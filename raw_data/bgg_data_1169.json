    "Description": "Across 15 reigns of the House of Capet your family seeks lands, titles, glory and wealth but faces dangerous rivals, external enemies and the ferocious warriors of Islam and Byzantium.&#10;&#10;Each turn is the reign of one king whose major policy/event impinges on that turn. The reigns (conveniently 15 of them) are split into five in the Age of Barons, five in the age of the Crusades, and five in the age of the Cursed Kings. After applying that reigns events (perhaps a Crusade or Poor Harvests) the players each have their turn (based on a cube draw). In each turn they may do one thing based on the Three Orders of medieval life: Laboratores, Bellatores and Oratores (Peasants, Warriors and Priests). Each has advantages and disadvantages. Finally, each Baron may attempt a marriage that will bring fresh fiefs into his family.&#10;&#10;The Baron seeks fiefs (his knights), peasants (for his new towns) and titles (many minor barons gained impressive titles in the East) as well as money. But kings seek armies in which you serve at your cost as these can eat your reserves or result in yet further success. Additionally they can invest in cards in suites of Military, Cathedrals, Scholars, Queens, Resources, and Culture. For example, respectively, Simon de Montfort, the Basilica of Cluny, St Bernard of Clairvaux, Blanche of Castile, the Fairs of Lagny, and the &ldquo;Summa Theologica&rdquo; of St Thomas Acquinas,&#10;&#10;Event cards cause a number of historical events to affect play. Victory is decided based on money, fame, titles held, card suites collected and other items.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As each faction sends a member to the past in search of valuable artifacts, the time travelers become ensnared in a time loop that repeats seven times.  In each iteration of the loop, each of the travelers is able to grow their collection of artifacts more efficiently and measure its effectiveness against their adversaries in preparation for a final showdown when they escape the time loop.&#10;&#10;The Eighth Round is a hand-building and trick-taking game where players spend seven rounds skillfully growing a hand of artifacts and testing its effectiveness against the hands of the other players.  The game is then decided by the results of The Eighth Round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The timeline strongly depends on types of objectives that players pick up for their campaigns. Decks are built around campaigns composed of carefully selected objectives combined with units, commanders, maneuvers, influences and events supporting reaching of those objectives. Effective decks are balanced with cards representing German forces slowing opponent's campaign progress down and cards that prevent player's campaign progress from being slowed down.&#10;&#10;The first player to achieve all the objectives of his / her campaign wins the game and is always ranked first. The player whose insurgent units have been eliminated loses the game and is always ranked last. In case of three players game the rank is based on campaign progress and strength of insurrectionists forces led by the players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Background. Starting in the mid-1950s, Italy went through an unprecedented industrial and economic growth that lasted well into the mid-1960s. This period in Italian history is referred to as &quot;Miracolo Economico Italiano&quot; (Italian Economic Miracle) or &quot;Boom Economico Italiano&quot; (Italian Economic Boom).&#10;&nbsp;&#10;The economy runs at full speed, national income grows and people are employment rates reach new records. The reasons for this growth were the favorable international economic situation and the abundance of labor supply. Exports were also a major stimulus for the development of the country's industrial fabric.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;These years brought extraordinary transformations that affected the lifestyle and customs of Italians, accompanied by a marked increase in living standards. Numerous consumer goods, such as the first washing machines, the first refrigerators and the first television sets, began to enter the homes of Italian families, forever changing the lives of Italians.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;In Dolcissima Vita 2-4 players are entrerpreneurs who produce televisions, washing machines and refrigerators and sell them in Italy.&#10;Most actions in the game are carried out by a very clever dice selection system. The sum of dice pips allows players to conduct basic and advanced actions, while dice colors let players advance on four different tracks (Workers, Scientific Research, Maintenance and Solidarity), which have various effects on the course of the game.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Dolcissima Vita features 35 colorful Event Cards of Italian history from 1955 to 1968. These cards change the conditions of the game, either permanently or temporarily.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Dolcissima Vita is the first volume in Spielworxx&acute; 'Italian Trilogy', dedicated to Italian history after World War II.&#10;&#10;",

As a result, he set out to write several sets of rules that would use similar game mechanisms to those in his other PORTABLE WARGAME rules, and that would enable him to fight a range of small, medium, and large battles on a relatively small tabletop. This book is the result.&#10;&#10;Please note that all the rules have been designed to be used with a gridded tabletop made up of squares or hexes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
