    "Description": "Players use colorful dice to represent armies of different fantasy races which battle to control essential terrain in this fast-rolling game.  Any number of players can join the struggle, although it's designed as a multiplayer game. The first player to capture two terrains immediately wins the game, or you may try to obliterate your opponent's dice. Spells and layered strategies benefit certain races as you try to control the odds in this dynamic game full of surprises!&#10;&#10;History: 2-Player Starter Sets, including completely rewritten rules, were released in 2006. These rules are available online at [www.sfr-inc.com]. The new Starters have perfectly paired racial armies, not random assortments like the old retail packaging, plus four terrain dice, two dragons, the complete rulebook, and new army placement cards. The races are paired up as Coral Elf/Lava Elf, Dwarf/Goblin, Feral/Undead, and Amazon/Swamp Stalker. Hybrid Dragons were offered in 2008. Acolytes of the Eldarim (a large expansion of the Eldarim race) was released in August 2009, along with a re-release of the Dragonkin. The Battlefields expansion (new major and minor terrains) was released in August 2010, adding exciting new options and strategies. The Dragoncrusader and Dragonzealots (new Eldarim Champions) were released in 2011. Dwarves and Goblins were re-released as kickers in 2012 and now include a 5th monster for each race. Magic Items were also re-released in the Battle Chest expansion in 2012. Coral Elves and Lava Elves were re-released as kickers in 2013 and now include a 5th monster. Amazons were re-released as kickers in 2014 and now include a 5th monster.&#10;&#10;The Starters listed above are now out of print. New Starters have been released that have 30 health of Firewalkers and 30 health of Treefolk. Those starters also contain 4 Terrains, 4 dragons, 2 playmats, and a simplified set of starter rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "First Ascent is a rock climbing-themed strategic board game. The goal in this medium weight, competitive game is to gain the most points by climbing the best route up the mountain and becoming the most skilled climber! Each player assumes the role of a unique asymmetric character, and throughout the game they will be building their route up the mountain, managing resources, achieving objectives, and increasing their efficiency by accumulating skills and gear! This game is for 2-5 players and takes 45-90 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview: &#10;In First Ascent, the goal is to gain the most points by creating the best route! Points are gained in four ways: &#10;1) Climbing pitches &mdash; use your climbing skills, gear, water, and psych to pay the requirements to move on to a tile &quot;climb the pitch&quot;. Draw a climbing card and resolve the events that may involve resource management, board manipulation, or selfish vs altruistic decisions. Each tile is worth 1-5 points with higher point value tiles requiring more resources.&#10;&#10;2) Objectives &mdash; achieve shared and personal objectives that relate to the path of your route. Plan carefully and manage resources to execute the path that will contribute towards achieving your objectives.&#10;&#10;3) Technique bonuses &mdash; the climbing skills and gear cards contain symbols representing climbing techniques of precision, power, balance, and pain tolerance. Match three technique symbols on the cards you play to climb a tile and earn +2 bonus points. These can add up significantly, so choose your resources wisely.&#10;&#10;4) Summit &mdash; reaching the top of the mountain is great, but climbing is about the journey. Gain +1 summit bonus point for reaching a peak.&#10;&#10;If you don't have the required resources to climb, you can &quot;risk it&quot; by rolling the risk dice to climb a tile for one less resource. You may get away with a check mark and succeed without consequence, roll minus two cards and give them to another player, or roll minus one card and one psych which you give to another player. As long as you have the assets to lose, you will climb the tile, but at a price.&#10;&#10;When you begin to ascend the mountain start in any tile on the first row. Next climb to any adjacent tile and leave your rope behind to mark the route you've climbed. Two climbers can not occupy the same tile, except for a summit, so you may compete with other climbers on the mountain for the prime locations.&#10;&#10;As you climb the mountain you will practice your skills and become a more efficient climber. The engine building component of this game grants you an &quot;earned asset&quot; after you play four cards of a specific skill type or gear. These tokens stay on your climber asset board and count towards fulfilling the required assets of future tiles.&#10;&#10;This isn't a race to the top, its about creating a strategic route that will reward your cunning and planning. The game ends when a player has used all seven rope lengths and climbed their eighth tile.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to create the greatest First Ascent?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Of the many mah jongg (mah jong) variants extant today, American mah jongg is unique. The single most popular variant in North America, it's also the least well documented. Prior to the publication of this book (A Beginner's Guide to American Mah Jongg, Elaine Sanberg, 2010), you could not find anything about the American game in bookstores. Instead what you would have found is descriptions of various modern regional variants, the classic Chinese rules (still played today in Europe), or the rules played in  Australia or the United Kingdom. Modern American rules, and especially strategy tips, were simply nowhere to be found (Sandberg, Tuttle Publishing, 2011).&#10;&#10;The American game of Mah Jongg differs in more than the spelling with two &quot;G&quot;s on the end. In the 1920s, when the Chinese game hit the United States, Babcock's rules and R.F. Foster's rules were largely discarded. Each group developed their own house rules and special hands.&#10;&#10;In 1937 the National Mah Jongg league standardized and streamlined the scoring system. Elements like Jokers and the Charleston which were part of various card games found their way into the game. Each year a Scoring Card of hands and rule changes is released. In 1999 the American Mah Jongg Association published its own scoring card each year and sponsors cruises and special events.&#10;&#10;American Mah Jongg is a rummylike game for four players. Players try to capture pungs, kongs, quintets, and sixtets from discards and complete hands listed in a scoring card released by one of the two Mah Jongg leagues.&#10;&#10;",

All artwork and graphics in the Dixie series (each regiment card is drawn with its historical uniform) was created by RPG/Historical artist, Eric Hotz (www.hotzartworks.com).&#10;&#10;The Dixie system is an expanded version of Columbia's tactical battle board system used in such games as Napol&#195;&#169;on: The Waterloo Campaign, 1815.  Each unit card shows its unit ID, its Combat Value (CV--the number of dice rolled), and its Firepower (the number needed to hit a target).&#10;&#10;The game is played without a board; the table is divided into three battle line areas for each player (left, center, and right).  Players deploy cards face down into their three battle line areas.  Player's hands act as the Reserve area.  Each turn, every unit may either move or fire.  Movement consists of advancing into the opponent's battle line areas to engage.  Combat consists of rolling dice equal to the unit's CV with hits occurring for each die that is less than or equal to the unit's firepower.  For each hit taken, a unit must make a morale check, rolling equal to or less than their CV or &quot;rout&quot; (i.e., be discarded).&#10;&#10;Play continues until one side is able to occupy unopposed two of the three opponent's battle line areas.  Rules are included for fighting a second day.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the original company website entry:&#10;&#10;Japan entered the modern age in 1868, with a new young emperor determined to make his island nation a world power. After decades of steady progress, Japan began its own practice of colonialism, defeating China in 1894. As the Japanese began to infiltrate the semi-independent Kingdom of Korea, they ran into Russian agents doing the same. Despite Japanese offers to negotiate, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II was set on war.&#10;&#10;Great War at Sea: 1904-1905, The Russo-Japanese War covers the naval side of this turn-of-the-century conflict, which opened with a Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet&rsquo;s base at Port Arthur in northern China. There are 19 scenarios, or game situations, provided, including the climactic Battle of Tsushima. There&rsquo;s also a campaign game, in which players can &ldquo;game&rdquo; the entire naval war.&#10;&#10;The Russian fleet is a mixed bag of modern battleships and ancient ironclads better suited for a museum. The Pacific Fleet that begins the game in the Far East has modern ships stationed at Port Arthur and a cruiser squadron in Vladivostok. Between them lies Korea, occupied by Japan. The Russian strategic situation is difficult.&#10;&#10;The Japanese have a better fleet; though not as large, their armored cruisers outclass their Russian counterparts and their torpedo boats are more numerous and more effective. They are also better-led after the death of the Russian Admiral Makarov.&#10;&#10;The map covers the Japanese home islands and the seas around them. As with other games in the series, it&rsquo;s divided into zones approximately 31 nautical miles across. Fleets attempt to locate one another on this map. When contact is made, play moves to a tactical map where ships manuever and fight. There are special overlays for Port Arthur and Chemulpo, so players can use the actual terrain of these key coastal zones.&#10;&#10;The original 1999 game included:&#10;&#10;210 Counters&#10;    One 25&quot;x30&quot; strategic map&#10;    One 25&quot;x25&quot; tactical map&#10;    16 page Rulebook&#10;    12 page Scenario book&#10;&#10;The game is being re-implemented in 2013 as Great War at Sea: Russo-Japanese War with a revised map, updated counters, new scenario book and new box.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "England, a land so harsh that forged heroes and conquerors, where the people are so indomitable that not even the Roman Empire managed to subjugate them. England has built an extensive empire on which the sun never set, vastly extending its domain beyond the British Isles on the spur of the Plantagenets, a royal lineage that dominated much of medieval European history, a dynasty forged from steel and blood, a lineage that would prevail for more than half a millennium. Plantagenet is a name that inspires admiration among enemies and fear among allies.&#10;&#10;Henry II, the first Plantagenet king to extend and stabilize his domains, contracted a political marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, a marriage intended to generate heirs to the throne. This strategic alliance by marriage produced four heirs: children who would rebel against their own father, more than once, leading to war, bloodshed and pacification, the stuff history is made of.&#10;Who is going to inherit the throne? Who will prove to be worthy of the illustrious name of Plantagenet? After years of battles and rivalry, only two of the heirs survived.&#10;&#10;The first, opposed by his own father, is a man with a destiny marked out by his own land, which he rarely set foot on as he was preoccupied for his entire life in conquests beyond the British Isles. The hope of an entire era would depend on his choices. The difference between being the usurper or the chosen one would depend on his actions. He is Richard I of England, better known as Richard the Lionheart.&#10;The other, the last born, was far removed from the throne. Overshadowed by his own family, derided by his own people and saddled with the unfortunate title of &ldquo;Lackland&rdquo;, John Lackland had the opportunity of a lifetime: Richard left for the Crusades and John could claim the throne for himself in Richard&rsquo;s absence. But would he have the mettle of a king? Would he surpass his more illustrious brother Richard? Would he be able to counter his brother&rsquo;s supporters?&#10;&#10;A wise choice as to with whom to form an alliance is crucial to one&rsquo;s place in history. Only brave choices will crown the true king of England, and only those who loyally and valiantly supported him in the conquest and administration of the kingdom would be remembered in history. This is a choice that only the strong and the wise would make.This is history.&#10;&#10;In Richard I, the players assume the role of the characters who remained in England when King Richard I left for the Crusades. They have to decide which side to take without knowing whether Richard I will return home a victor with glory and riches, or he won't come back at all (but there are many possible intermediate outcomes).&#10;&#10;During the game, the players take turns to influence the different characters available in order to earn prestige points (PPs) for themselves, but also to use their powers to influence the Crusade from far away by sending resources. A player might even decide to betray his own side, if worrying news were to come from the East...&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the outcome of the Crusade leads to an increase of PPs for the players who were deployed by the faction which has achieved its goal, but the game has only one winner: the player who has accumulated the most PPs, regardless of the faction to which he belongs!&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to amass the most Prestige Points (PP) by wisely choosing alliances and exerting influence on the performance of the Crusade.&#10;&#10;",

Each kind of the fish has different criteria for scoring; some prefer the edges of the tank, some like to be in the middle, some like to gather together and some don&rsquo;t like to have their kind around them. The players draft their fishes in 2 phases of the game, each consisting of 8 rounds. At the end of the game, each player has a 4 x 4 tableau of multicoloured fish in front of them. The player whose fish tank generates the most points is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sauria is a game where players are vying to complete as many of their individual goals as possible to gain Victory Points and then successfully reach safety before time runs out. While this is happening, they must also survive various dangerous dinosaurs that are out to get them.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of 1 of  8 unique characters, ranging from the ruthless Hunter, the friendly Ranger, or the no-good Saboteur. Each character has a specific set of goals that no other player knows. The player who gets the most Victory Points by completing goals and escapes the island wins.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over 16 Rounds which make up 48 in-game hours. Once the 16th Round is over, so is the game, and any character who has not reached safety is dead.  To make matters even worse, at the 24-hour mark, the volcano begins to spew lava onto the island, destroying roads, jungle, and buildings, and panicking even the friendliest of dinosaurs. Players take turns performing actions, engaging in unique encounters, and interacting with the park&rsquo;s locations. Meanwhile, dinosaurs reveal themselves, hunt, attack, and defend themselves against the players and other dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;Get your friends together and hold onto your butts, because on Isla Sauria, if you&rsquo;re lucky, you might just survive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You've lived here your whole life, but it was only a little while ago that you started to notice the strange sounds at night, and now the new kid at school has vanished. You're sure that a hideous creature has been unleashed on your town &mdash; and it's up to you to defeat it!&#10;&#10;In the co-operative game The Snallygaster Situation, which is based on the Kids on Bikes RPG, you and your best friends must face off against one of four diabolical monsters set on destroying Lakeview &mdash; and possibly the entire world! Get on your bikes to search for clues about the monster's weakness, find the missing kid it has abducted, and end the threat to your hometown. Oh, and watch out for the Federal agents because they can put a real damper on your epic adventure.&#10;&#10;In more detail, one player takes the role of the Lost Kid, selecting a card to play each turn that provides clues about their location such as street names, buildings, or landmarks &mdash; but the card also dictates how the monsters and the Feds move and attack on the board. You might have the perfect clue to give, but then the monster will attack one of your friends, sending them back to the treehouse and advancing the &quot;doom marker&quot;, i.e., the game's timer.&#10;&#10;The other players are trying to defeat the monster and save their friend. On their turns, they use their rides &mdash; skateboard, dirt bike, inline skates, etc. &mdash; to search the town, look for clues, use special item cards, and avoid the monster, which might be the Jersey Devil, a Dover Demon, Bloody Mary, or (of course) the Snallygaster. Each monster has a different level of difficulty with unique gameplay elements.&#10;&#10;Once the Lost Kid is found, they join their friends to try to defeat the monster.&#10;&#10;",

What title best fits the review cards? Players can select the movies from a list of eight &quot;broken&quot; titles composed of two movie titles mixed together. The result of these mixes might be brilliant, bizarre, and even weird: laughter is guaranteed!&#10;&#10;After secretly choosing, players in turn place &quot;Not&quot; tokens near a title they think no one chose. Each correctly placed token scores one point, and you have a free mistake per round. If you make no mistakes, you will score bonus points. You play five rounds and try to beat your previous scores and write your name in the score table. Will you ever reach the maximum of 40 points, with different player counts?&#10;&#10;Play with more than 25,000 movie titles no one has ever seen!&#10;&#10;(Note: This design was originally announced as Movie Night but during development the co-operative variant of the game was perfected to became the only official version.)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But there is hitch: ferocious monsters are guarding the gems! If the warriors join forces they can defeat them.

The warrior who will remain loyal and will betray at the right time is the genuine hero of this game.&#10;&#10;In Dungeon Busters, the players take the role of heroes exploring dungeons and defeating monsters in search of treasures. In order to defeat a monster, every player simultaneously plays a power card face-down then reveals the values. If two or more players play the same value, they are all ignored. If players are defeated the player who played the lowest value should return some treasures as a penalty. If players succeed to defeat the monster, players can divide rewards but the player who played the lowest value will go first.&#10;&#10;Japanese summary:&#10;&#10;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#233;&#133;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#140;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#133;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#177;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#232;&#191;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#182;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#152;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#178;&#162;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#172;&#145;&#233;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#233;&#154;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#233;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#150;&#145;&#230;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Perryville: The battle for Kentucky, 7-9th October 1862, One of the more obscure of all major Civil War actions, Perryville was the culmination of Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky in 1862.  The game recreates the events of October 7-9th, 1862, both what actually happened and what might have been...&#10;&#10;In the fall of 1862, the young Rebel nation launched two invasions into border state territory. One ended in the bloody Battle of Antietam. The other&mdash;lesser known&mdash;effort culminated in the Battle of Perryville. Bragg&rsquo;s campaign to seize Kentucky from the North was of critical importance. A crippling blow dealt here would have transferred the war from Tennessee (and further south) to the Ohio River. U.S. Grant&rsquo;s efforts at Fort Donelson and Shiloh would have been voided. The war in the west would be fundamentally altered in the South&rsquo;s favor. As it was, Bragg was unable to bring in the available Confederate forces and fight a decisive battle against Buell. In this game, however, the player can take an active hand in drawing on all the Southern forces to bring on the battle that might have been.&#10;&#10;With one map and 280 counters, Perryville makes an excellent starter game for players new to the successful Civil War, Brigade game series. With both the latest edition of the rules and a smaller battle to work with, new players will be able to quickly garner the skills needed to compete successfully in the other (larger) series games.&#10;&#10;Perryville is game number 6 in the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series by The Gamers (now Multi-Man Publishing).&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 30 minutes&#10;Hex: 200 yards&#10;Unit: Infantry/Cavalry Brigades &amp; Artillery Battalions&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32 page CWBS 2nd edition revised Rulebook&#10;One 8 page Perryville Rulebook&#10;Two six-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 2 (suitable for solitaire play)&#10;Playing Time: 4-16 Hours (varies with scenario played)&#10;Complexity: Moderate&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Proud Monster Deluxe is a Major Revision of Command's Proud Monster and Death and Destruction.&#10;&#10;Proud Monster Deluxe is a simulation of the Russo-German War beginning with the launch of Operation Barbarossa in June of 1941, and ending in April of 1944. It is a two-player (or multi-player) strategic / operational wargame of low-to-medium complexity.&#10;&#10;Units in Proud Monster Deluxe are typically divisions with some corps, brigades and regiments also included. Hexes are 20 miles (about 33 kilometers) across, and each turn represents about a 2 week period.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game systemIn addition to updated graphics, the major changes are Reserves and Reserve Movement phases to simulate the potential for encirclement or defensive reaction. Soviet first winter offensive rules allow the Soviets to retake parts of Russia in early 1942 as happened in history. Both sides now have offensive supply markers to show historical offensive potential and limitations. Innovative weather chits allow for weather variation without extreme weather swings biasing the game. AFV units become even more important due to AFV combat shift. Close Combat option allows for use of an alternate loss procedure and attacker advance to form a jointly-occupied hex, for example, to simulate Stalingrad's gradual fall to the Axis. The ability to fully exploit holes created by mobile assaults is limited to reserves.&#10;&#10;The Axis forces degrade in capability over time while the Soviet forces upgrade in capability. The Axis super heavy artillery Thor and Odin, Heavy Gustav and Dora can fire before combat resolution. Besides the 1941 Free setups, 1941 historical setups are provided for both sides as well as a 1942 scenario. Seasonal offensive rules allow for special turns when special things can happen. The 2 sides show a greater disparity in capability, the Axis can do things the Soviets cannot do and vice versa. Things that work when playing the Axis may not work when playing the Soviets and vice versa.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game componentsGame components have all been improved over the originals. All graphics have been completely updated and upgraded. Counters are 9/16&quot; and map hexes have ample space to avoid players from knocking over those stacks of counters when the fighting starts to tighten up. The four (4) maps impress upon the players the enormous expanse of the Soviet Union and the challenge for both sides to defend and overcome it. Rules are consolidated from the two original sources into one comprehensive set, with all known errata folded in, and a number of important rule changes to improve game balance and playability. In addition, the development of a definitive set of player aids will keep players playing the game instead of hunting down items in the rules.&#10;&#10;    4 maps - each map is 22&quot;x34&quot; with overlap&#10;    10 full sheets of 9/16&quot; counters (2052 counters), printed both sides:&#10;    1 rules book&#10;    12 Full color player aid charts and tables cards printed both sides on cardstock&#10;&#10;    2 Sequence of Play/Combat Result Table&#10;    2 Unit description Chart/Combat Summary&#10;    Axis setup charts: 1941 Free/1941 Historical/1942 (double page)&#10;    Soviet setup charts: 1941 Free/1941 Historical/1942 (double page)&#10;    Axis Turn record Track (double page)&#10;    Soviet Turn record Track (double page)&#10;    Axis Combat Boxes&#10;    Soviet Combat Boxes&#10;    Axis Reserve Boxes&#10;    Soviet Reserve Boxes&#10;&#10;&#10;2 6 sided dice&#10;    1 full color box and lid&#10;&#10;(from Compass Games website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

This is because there are position rules such as &quot;If you line up in a row with the same race / occupation, you can receive a placement bonus&quot; and &quot;Only units in the front line of each row can participate in the war&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone plays 9 cards or reached 40 points.

By playing cards, you change numerous aspects of the game: how to draw cards, how to play cards, and even how to win.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game.&#10;&#10;In Wonderland Fluxx, you get to go down the Rabbit Hole to join Alice as she has tea with the Mad Hatter, gets directions from the Cheshire Cat, tries to reason with Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and grows and shrinks alarmingly. You may even need to slay a Jabberwock to win at this even curiouser version of Fluxx...&#10;&#10;",

Flip City), a deck-building game in which you have no hand at all, but instead play cards directly from the top of your deck.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of two phases: card playing and building. Players play cards directly from the top of their deck and may choose to continue unless they have three cry-face icons in play, which ends their turn immediately. When they choose to stop, they move to the building phase.&#10;&#10;During the building phase, a player can use the coins gained from their previously played cards to buy a new card or to upgrade a card in their personal discard pile. To upgrade a card, pay the cost and flip it over; upgraded cards remain in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Since all cards in this game are double-sided, be careful not to flip them over accidentally when placing cards into your discard pile or when shuffling your deck.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player gains eight or more VP during a single card playing phase, the player wins immediately!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "HATSUDEN is a game of two players with a theme of electricity supply. Although minimal in system and play time, it has a thrilling game plot and the results are never predictable. This is a game for players of all range. Please take a try.&#10;&#10;Construct 5 types of renewable energy plant (Solar, Geothermal, Wind, Hydro, Biomass) and complete your supply to the city. Compete for greater electricity, also making sure to keep just the right amount for your city&rsquo;s demand. The special technology cards also play a big role as the game develops. Now, head out to the journey to become a great &ldquo;HATSUDEN&rdquo; engineer.&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game&#10;&#10;In HATSUDEN, players compete for 1. greater generation of renewable energy, and 2. optimum power supply to the cities.&#10;&#10;General Procedures&#10;&#10;Choose an open space. Place a power plant card corresponding to the renewable energy type indicated at the top of the column. Once you have placed a plant card, you have now acquired a power supply equivalent to the number marked on the card.&#10;&#10;All power plants supply electricity to the city at the end of the row. A city needs a total of 10 supply, and 9 or 11 would also be permissible. If the sum of supply becomes 12 or more after a power plant construction or upgrade, you must flip one&#239;&#188;&#136;or more&#239;&#188;&#137;of the other power plant cards in the same row and convert it to a pylon, so the supply level is kept at 11 or less.&#10;&#10;When either player completes all ten spaces provided another player takes the last turn to finish off the game. If the last player is not able to complete all 10 spaces, the remaining spaces will be filled with pylons.&#10;&#10;Point Calculation&#10;&#10;First of all, players calculate the generation for each renewable energy (solar, geothermal, wind, water, and biomass). Cards in the two spaces in the column are added, and the sums of generation level are compared between the players. The player with a greater generation level takes the renewable energy card face down. This will count as 1 point. If it is a tie, neither gets a point.&#10;&#10;Calculate the total supply to the city by adding the generation of the plants in the row. If you have a total of 10 supply to the city, you may take the city card face down. This will count as 1 point. If the total supply is 8 or below, you will have 1 point taken away.&#10;&#10;Whoever earns a higher total score is the winner of the game.&#10;If it&rsquo;s a tie, the total points from the cities&#239;&#188;&#136;1 point from scoring 10, and -1 from scoring 8 or less&#239;&#188;&#137;will determine the winner. If this too is tied, the player playing second will be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone.&#10;&#10;You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day. You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another.

The rifts you have to neutralise appear on the map unpredictably by dice rolls at the beginning of each turn, but they can also be planned by various spreading mechanisms. &#10;Fly your SPARC near a rift to scan it and advance science. This way you increase your navigation and neutralisation skills, because without technology advancements you don't stand a chance. &#10;Or is it more important at the moment to clear the path blocked by rifts for a cargo ship? The freighters must bring resources from the other planets to Earth, with which the Protector is being built feverishly. That is your main goal! Without a supply of resources, the saving space station will not be completed in time. &#10;Or do you need to use your action points to collect energy crystals in space? These are necessary to provide the energy for all your actions: Flying, scanning, neutralising... You need energy all the time! You can also charge the crystals for more effective actions, but they will be destroyed afterwards. &#10;At the beginning, choose from several SPARCs. You have to consider their individual skills when assigning the many new challenges. &#10;Since you can see the upcoming event cards, you should always consider together whether you want to intervene in the future by swapping cards in order to avert or minimise the damage caused by the upcoming catastrophes. But weigh the risks well, because every intervention in the future causes additional rifts on the game board.&#10;&#10;Chrono Fall: At the End of Space and Time, the new &quot;Kennerspiel&quot; by Ornament Games: cooperative, with unique mechanics and impressive table presence!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The embodiment of Orkish battle-lust and crazed genius, these metal monsters rumble across the battlefield on armoured tracks, grinding to dust the shattered remains of civilisation.&#10;&#10;Contained in the box are an Imperal Imperator-class Titan, two Ork Mega-Gargants, ten Imperial Knights, twelve Ork Bonebreaker tanks and nine card buildings, plus rulebooks, datasheets, unit cards and counters to pit these mighty war machines against each other in Epic scale battles.&#10;&#10;",

RuneScape Kingdoms: Shadow of Elvarg is a cooperative campaign board game inspired by the record-breaking video game universe with over 280 million registered users worldwide.&#10;&#10;Gather your group of 1-5 players and step into a sometimes epic, often irreverent fantasy world where your goal is simple: Become the wealthiest, most skilled, best-geared adventurer there is! Or, just enough of all three to succeed together. Or spend the whole time collecting eggs and let your friends do all the work. It&rsquo;s cooperative, after all! (Still, who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy a little friendly competition?)&#10;&#10;Either way, Gielinor needs capable folk to help its inhabitants and keep monsters and nefarious cults at bay, and that&rsquo;s where your group steps in. One minute you&rsquo;re slaying a vampyre that&rsquo;s been terrorising a village. The next, you&rsquo;re helping Gertrude find her beloved cat!&#10;&#10;Like chapters in a book, your tabletop adventure is split into campaigns, each one inspired by an iconic boss quest from the video games. Campaigns are made up of two phases:&#10;&#10;First is the exploration phase, where you&rsquo;ll explore the kingdoms of Asgarnia and Misthalin from above on a game board styled like a fast-travel map. Every location gives you different things to do &mdash; whether that&rsquo;s gathering and sharing resources, levelling up skills, or drawing from the exploration deck for that region to see what unexpected thing you&rsquo;ll need to handle next!&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;t get too distracted, though: The exploration phase has set quests you&rsquo;ll need to complete to keep your group moving forward. Spend too long gathering cabbages or engaging in goblin diplomacy, and the escalation track will rise, making the world around you more dangerous until you finally take on the boss&hellip;&#10;&#10;&hellip;in the boss phase! Here, you&rsquo;ll zoom in for face-to-face fights on dedicated game boards that bring the bosses &mdash; and their environments &mdash; to life!&#10;&#10;The story woven through the campaigns will immerse you in the fantasy world of RuneScape, while the optional side quests, exploration decks, vault deck, and event deck will change your experience each time you play. And because it&rsquo;s an open world, you can play your way!&#10;&#10;Even your adventurer starts as a blank slate. There are no fixed classes in this game! You choose what skills to max and what gear to craft. Use those skills and gear to pass tests and complete quests to help your group win the day, then take what you&rsquo;ve learned and earned on to the next campaign. Gain XP (even when you fail!) and rewards, and level up to earn your all-important cape!&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s not all capes and capers. At the end of every campaign waits a boss that&rsquo;ll take all the skills of your group &mdash; yes, even cooking &mdash; to defeat. Pulled into face-to-face combat on unfamiliar terrain, your group&rsquo;s shared health pool is all that stands between you and Death (and he wouldn&rsquo;t be pleased to see you!). Roll the dice on your melee, defence, and magic to strike, protect yourself, and push the boss back. Use your wits to plan ahead and influence the flow of combat to throw the boss off balance. And don&rsquo;t expect them to take your onslaught lying down. They, too, have ways to keep you on your toes&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shuffle Heroes is card game for two players set in a fantasy steampunk world filled with Lovecraftian monstrosities.&#10;&#10;Each game, you draft two heroes and shuffle their cards together, forming your draw deck. This provides a lot of possibilities for different deck combinations while keeping the deck construction fast and easy.&#10;&#10;The game-play is pretty straight-forward. During your turn, you either play a card, activate your hero or replenish your hand. However, when played right, you can chain effects together with devastating outcomes.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate goal is to defeat enemy heroes either by reducing their health to zero or wearing them down by destroying cards from their deck.&#10;&#10;One of the main mechanics in Shuffle Heroes is the so-called deck deconstruction. During the game, you can decide which cards you destroy from your opponent's deck. This decision heavily influences what your opponent can draw in the next turns.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&euro;uro Crisis is a tactical as well as a satirical game for 3-4 players about the financial crisis in Europe. The players take the roles of banks with the goal of enriching themselves at the expense of the struggling states.&#10;&#10;One game lasts for three years, with each year divided into four quarters. In each quarter, all players choose their action simultaneously and resolve them in turn order. As an action you can borrow money from the European central bank just to lend it in another action to the struggling states. You'll get good interest rates, especially when the state is nearly broke! But always be aware of the possibility that a state might have to restructure its debts.&#10;&#10;From your earnings, you can buy gold and weapons. Gold is used to bid on privatizations of state property, which is the one thing that will truly be worth something at the end of the game. Your weapons can be used to defend your privatizations from an angry mob &mdash; or you can give them to decent citizens, just to see how the new privatization of another bank becomes public again. Last but not least, you have to be a good lobbyist to gain exactly the government or the reforms you want.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the most points wins. Beside the privatizations, mainly income, but also gold, weapons and money add a few points.&#10;&#10;&euro;uro Crisis is entertaining, with a lot of interaction and invites everyone to gamble with borrowed money &mdash; just like the euro crisis...&#10;&#10;",

The players travel from Hanse city to Hanse city in wagons filled with valuable beans, where they can deliver bean orders and buy more beans. When a player is in a city and has an order card and the necessary beans to fulfill the order, he may deliver the beans and collect the value of the order from the bank. When two or more players are together in a city, they may trade beans among themselves. Trading beans is important as it allows players to get rid of unwanted beans and acquire needed beans. In addition, a player will buy beans in the city, if it has the type he wants. From time to time, the bean supplies will be replenished as described on new harvest cards. After eight new harvests, the game begins its last round. After this last round, the game ends and the player with the most thalers (money) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Bohn Hansa (Bean Trader) is part of the Bohnanza family of games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Circus Train, by designer Tom Decker, is a 1-5 player game in which you are the owner and operator of a small circus train in prohibition-era America. In this game, you and your opponents are vying to employ the best talent while putting on the most magnificent show each month. While touring the country by train, you will have the opportunity to perform while adding talent to your show through hiring the performers stranded in cities by defunct circuses. Just remember to keep an eye on your wages, because your talent definitely will.&#10;&#10;Through clever card hand management, you control the movement of your train around the American northeast, making strategic business decisions about talent, performances and payroll in this fast-paced strategy game. Each turn represents one week of real time, and after six months, the circus season closes for the year and the game ends with one player declared as having The Greatest Show on Earth.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Sara Gruen&rsquo;s novel, Water for Elephants, Circus Train Second Edition includes thematic elements such as improving your show&rsquo;s reputation by picking up alcohol for your talent and staff (legally, in Canada), the high costs of supplying big cats and elephants, and the ability to &ldquo;red light&rdquo; (firing by throwing off the train) disgruntled talent or talent that has simply become too expensive to maintain. These elements are blended into the game&rsquo;s mechanics, keeping it all simple while adding layers of depth and strategy.&#10;&#10;",

You have the correct cards, though.&#10;&#10;Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Adventure Time Card Wars is the most epic card game ever found in the Land of Ooo, or anywhere for that matter! In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.&#10;&#10;Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!&#10;&#10;In Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, which contains all new cards other than a few rainbow card repeats, the Ice King and his IcyLands deck take on Marceline's dark and crafty Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. IcyLands creatures are all about attacking directly. They would prefer to avoid attacking other creatures. One way they can find some clear lanes to attack down is through frozen tokens. Through various means, these chilling tokens can be placed onto your opponent's Landscapes. Opponents will find playing creatures onto frozen landscapes rather difficult. Where the Ice King finds an opening, he will strike as hard as a blizzard!&#10;&#10;Marceline's deck is a Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. This is the first time that NiceLands has been paired with another landscape type, and the chemistry is going to burn hot! The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around denial, discard, and dirty tricks. Some of the Useless Swamp Creatures are willing victims to your dark tidings. When they go, they leave a lot of destruction in their wake. The NiceLands side of the deck is themed around creatures with exactly five damage on them. This is a tweak to the NiceLands strategy as seen in the original NiceLands deck. There, the creatures thrived with various different amounts of damage on them. Now the trick is to get as many of your creatures as you can to have exactly five damage on them. When that happens, look out!&#10;&#10;Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!&#10;&#10;",

Cards must be played right side up (not rotated).&#10;     If desired, immediately select one or more items (cubes and/or dice) to place in any open patrol spot - any empty spot orthogonally between any played region cards to satisfy the requirements (the symbols on the facing edges of the region cards).  When a row or column of 3 cards is completed, then all items between those cards must be placed.&#10;     Repeat steps 3 - 5 until all cards are played, or you can no longer satisfy the regions&rsquo; requirements. &#10;&#10;&#10;12 Patrols won 2nd place for best overall game in the 2019 9 Card Design Contest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Gorbachev: The Fall of Communism you are thrust into the Soviet leadership, trying to push your immense country into democracy amid the collapse of socialism and the wild mood-swings of Gorbachev himself in the period from 1985 to 1991.&#10;&#10;This fast-play, fun, and educational solitaire game uses a system created by Darin Leviloff. &quot;People&quot; markers on five converging paths represent the political awakenings of the Russian people, the Baltic Republics, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Communist Party itself. The paths all meet in Moscow, where the danger of a coup exists if any of those People markers makes it that far. In addition, three tracks representing the Soviet economy, media and culture greatly impact the overall situation. A card draw determines which paths and tracks move against you this turn, and the number of &quot;Efforts&quot; which you earn that you can use to move them back in your favor (if the Effort die roll succeeds). The presence of Gorbachev himself gives you additional Efforts -- but he is often on vacation!&#10;&#10;Managing Efforts is key to the game, and you never have as many as you want. You can obtain more by calling in the KGB or gambling away your army in Afghanistan and Eastern Europe, and your nuclear missiles, in disarmament deals: a short term strategy that can cost you victory points in the end. You can even abandon your Warsaw Pact allies to win Western goodwill (and more Efforts) as the Cold War comes to an end. Your success at disarmament will depend on how the US President views your policies, making the 1988 election -- George H.W. Bush vs. Michael Dukakis -- important.&#10;&#10;Each risky gambit is aimed at averting a military coup against you, which can end the game suddenly. Your success (or failure) in controlling the five paths of public opinion helps determine how many individual Politburo members are still on your side when a coup plot is hatched, so the better you play the game, the less chance the coup gets off the ground.&#10;&#10;Can you hold the Soviet Union together long enough to achieve a treaty with your restive Republics and win the game?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Over the following seven weeks, the Allies battered their way through the tough bocage country while the Germans scrambled to keep a line together. By the end of July they had run out of tricks and the Allies were on the verge of a massive breakout.&#10;&#10;From D-Day to the break-out, Cobra allows you to play out the Allied invasion of Normandy and the break-out from the peninsula in one complete game. One player or team commands the Allies, the other the Germans. Victory depends on the Allied breakout and relative casualties. Command regiments, brigades, divisions, corps headquarters and special units. Valuable motorized and mechanized units gain additional movement and can overrun enemy units while moving. Combat rewards careful planning; getting headquarters and supplies to the right place at the right time enhances your combat power.&#10;&#10;From June 6 to August 23, Cobra recreates one of the most daring and dramatic battles of World War II. The beaches are waiting.&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;&#10;    Battle of the Buildup (14 Game Turns: 6 June to 15 July). A special D-Day landing routine brings the Allies ashore.

Place a Corruption Marker on each card in that Draugr&rsquo;s row with the matching Corruption Sigil. (See the section on the Shepherdess for protection from this rule.)&#10;&#10;If a Townsperson card has been turned over you do not need to place additional Corruption Markers on the card.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 - The Hunt&#10;You must now move your player marker up to two adjacent cards in distance (The Nunnery and Foundry are the only two cards to supersede this rule). All movement is orthogonal (horizontally and vertically).&#10;&#10;Once you have finished moving you may choose a Special Action of that Townsperson or Location. Some cards have only 1 Special Action, some allow for a choice between 2 Special Actions. You do not have to choose a Special Action if you do not wish to.&#10;&#10;If you land on a Townsperson card that has been turned over, no Special Action can be chosen.&#10;&#10;If a Special Action allows you to place Holy Water or Iron Markers on a Draugr, take one from your supply on the Town Square card and place it on a Draugr of your choice. If you match the number of markers as indicated in the upper left of the Draugr card, that Draugr is slain and removed from the game. Return all Holy Water and Iron Markers on that Draugr to your supply.&#10;&#10;Once a Draugr is slain and their card removed, slide one of the adjacent Draugr cards up or down so that is partially spans either 2 rows (or if 2 Draugr have been slain, 3 rows). The Draugr now holds sway over 10 (or 15) cards for rolls during the Corruption Phase. If you slay all 3 Draugr on one side, no further Draugr are moved to replace those slain.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;If you are able to slay 4 of the 6 Draugr you are successful and the other Draugr are forced to flee. If at anytime during Phase 1 all the Townspeople, or more than 7 of the cards (a combination of Townspeople and Locations) are corrupted you lose.&#10;&#10;",

Can you save your city from badly-named mob bosses, fear-inducing serial killers, a rising crime rate, and a police Chief that isn&rsquo;t always your friend? These officers may have 99 problems, but crime ain&rsquo;t one.&#10;&#10;Code 3&rsquo;s cooperative scenarios challenge players to complete goals and make choices before revealing the next part of a branching story arc. Of course, mob bosses aren&rsquo;t the only thing hindering our officers, as 911 calls spread like wildfire about your city. If too many 911 calls go unanswered&hellip; the game is lost.&#10; Customize your crime fighting duo by selecting two officers (out of hundreds of officer combinations), each with their own unique deck, which are then shuffled together to create your &ldquo;Beat Partners&rdquo; deck.&#10;&#10;You can tailor your Beat Partners deck to answer 911 calls quickly, to investigate for witnesses and evidence, to complete scenario objectives, or even move your beat cops into position to help your allies. There are hundreds of character combinations that you can experiment with, and finding the best two cops (or canines!) is key to your team&rsquo;s victory! Choices are everywhere!&#10;&#10;Most importantly, Code 3 gives players the opportunity to handle things by the book... or play just outside the rules. However, if players choose to step outside the Police Department&rsquo;s Code of Conduct then the Internal Affairs Division starts investigating them. Players then shuffle &quot;IA Heat&quot; cards into their deck, and if two are ever drawn on the same turn, those players must immediately proceed to a contentious &quot;Internal Affairs Interview.&quot; Unfortunately, this prevents players from hitting the street and handling those 911 calls. Your teammates can help you during the IA Interview by vouching for you... but at what cost? Are they willing to put their reputation on the line for you? Are they willing to risk their own IA Interview?&#10;&#10;Code-3 is a sand box of 80's cop action. Do you love rolling dice? Do you love pushing your luck? Do you love unraveling the story? The meta-game? Helping the team? Being in charge?  And... do you do it by the book? Find out now!&#10;&#10;&mdash;descripton from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This makes for an exciting trick-taking game that can be enjoyed from the beginning to the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The scoring system: if you do not score exactly two tricks, you score zero points. If you score three tricks, you are eliminated from the round and score zero points. If you score only zero or one trick at the end of the round, you score zero points. This can be a nerve-wracking dilemma.&#10;&#10;How to choose your initial hand: Unlike most trick-taking games, the initial hand is decided by discarding a relatively large number of cards from the hand dealt. Each player's intentions are intertwined and each session can be different.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#188;!!

    "Description": "In Chemical Overload, the current Master Alchemist is set to retire, but has been preparing for this by training his apprentices for years. Sure, the Academy of Alchemy has been pretty brutal so far, but the end of the road is near. The final exam is going to be rough, but it&rsquo;ll be worth it, if you manage to rise above your fellow students and win the title of Master Alchemist!&#10;At the end of the final exam, you&rsquo;ll be judged on the quality of your potions, which can be measured by how many Alchemy Points you&rsquo;ve managed to accrue. Do this before the lab fills up with too many toxic fumes and the exam is called to a halt.&#10;&#10;You and your fellow students will start with the same basic chemicals and flasks. You&rsquo;ll be combining your chemicals with the flasks of the correct size to brew magical potions.&#10;&#10;Each potion has its own effects and Alchemy Point values, and you&rsquo;ll be able to use those potion&rsquo;s effects throughout the game to help you gain more gold, alchemy points, more powerful chemicals, or even more powerful potions!&#10;&#10;But some potions will also add to the amount of toxic fumes in the lab! There are several thresholds, that once passed, you&rsquo;ll have to draw a toxin card and deal with those effects. So you&rsquo;ll want to keep an eye on that track, because once the tracker hits the end of the meter, the test is over!&#10;&#10;At the end of the final exam, the alchemist with the most Alchemy Points wins and is crowned the Master Alchemist!&#10;&#10;Chemical Overload is a Deck Building game that has elements of tableau building as well. On your turn, you&rsquo;ll have a hand of cards. Any flask cards in your hand can be played to the table and remain there until used to brew a potion. There are also potions that can be played to the table for ongoing effects.&#10;&#10;As a bit of a twist on a classic deck building game, when a player gains new cards, such as new chemicals or a newly brewed deck potion, those cards go right on top of their draw pile. Any flasks or table potions gained can be placed immediately in the players tableau area. Players will be able to decide what unused cards in their hand they want to keep at the end of the round and which they want to discard, all with an eye on the cards they know they&rsquo;ll be drawing next turn.&#10;&#10;Chemical Overload is for 1-4 players and takes about 45-60 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Somebody else may want the same cards you do. The first one to slam the board claims the cards. Most cards are good, but some aren't. &quot;Double or Nothing&quot; cards only count if you claim a pair of them. &quot;Toast or Most&quot; cards only score if you have the most of them, and &quot;Jackpot&quot; cards score jackpot points depending on how many you get.

Your mission is to achieve those objectives while avoiding the political debacle that marred the actual event.&#10;&#10;The game uses the Cold War Blitz series rules, a solitaire game system. You command the allied units, and have a deck of cards to enhance your unit capabilities. A second deck of cards, drawn randomly one at a time, controls Egyptian (OPFOR) activities. Combat is resolved with a quasi-tactical system with opposing units firing at one another. The game ends after the last turn, but you control when that is through the judicious play of your cards (the OPFOR cards can affect it too).&#10;&#10;Skills:&#10;&bull; Level: Brigade&#10;&bull; Hex: 14.5 miles per inch&#10;&#10;",

However, your mission spirals out of control when the Retiarius submerges and its warheads prime for launch!&#10;&#10;Danger in the Deep is a collaborative escape room game, where players must navigate their way through the engine room, crew&rsquo;s quarters, mess and control room of a submarine. Only by gathering key information and solving the 14 interactive puzzles will teams be able to disable the warheads, stop PROTEUS, and save the world. The game features puzzle books, cards, secret components, a blueprint, and a working UV torch (batteries included, 3 x AAA).&#10;&#10;Danger in the Deep features a tiered hint system, to enable teams of all abilities to progress through the game and story. The game can optionally be completed solo.&#10;&#10;Danger in the Deep is designed as a one-time experience, as some of the puzzles require players to cut, fold and write on the components. However, Professor Puzzle do provide a printable pdf of the destructible components, in the Files section on BGG and on their website, to enable the game to be replayed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The spiritual successor to tennis game Sweet Spot, Volleyball High is the second entry in a trilogy of sports titles by Medieval Lords. The mechanisms and gameplay are completely different though. Heavily inspired by the Japanese anime Haikyu, one can expect unique school teams known for various specialties and powerful individuals with their own signature moves. The package is completed with each school having their own coach as well, who can execute abilities to assist their teams.&#10;&#10;Players choose to play as one of several school teams. Volleyball High is a game of spatial control and hand management. There are 5 types of cards - Set, Bump, Dig, Serve and Spike. Each type has a distance range as well as Hit value. Players will play these cards to pass the ball between their own members as well as smash it over the net to the opponent. When the ball crosses the net, a player must always first defend by discarding cards showing DEF value equal to or greater than the Hit value of the attack. Then he chooses which member to receive the ball, again discarding cards for every extra space that member has to move in order to reach the ball. If the chosen member is already at the spot the ball is going, there is no need to discard any cards for movement. Finally, he plays a card to hit the ball and flip that member over (this member is now exhausted and cannot hit the ball again) There is a benefit in passing the ball around before sending it back to the opponent though - each time a member of the team touches the ball, the team synergy meter goes up by one. It is this value that determines how much Energy the team gains, as well as how many cards to replenish from the deck when the ball is sent over. Players can discard 2 cards to flip back an exhausted member. Here is the interesting part - if all 6 of your members are exhausted at the same time, they automatically refresh together and flip back as a team for free! Also when you set up the ball by passing it from a front member to another front member, when that member hits it over the net it is considered a Heavy attack. Unlike the typical defense where the opponent simply chooses which cards to discard to match the Hit value, in a Heavy attack it is a blind defense. He decides how many cards to discard, after which you can then randomly draw from his hand without looking. In this manner it is a press-your-luck style where your opponent must decide how much to commit to defend this Heavy attack. Too many and he will waste cards unnecessarily, too little and he risks not having enough DEF to overcome the attack.&#10;&#10;The first team to score 2 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;In the 2v2 mode, it gets more intensive as each player controls 3 specific members of the same team and must coordinate between each other to take down their opponent. Even the slightest crack in teamwork will spell defeat!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your nerves are already frayed&mdash;it&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and the pressure is on. Determined to make this day unforgettable, you&rsquo;ve booked a table at the most exclusive restaurant in town, the perfect spot for a night of romance. But when you arrive, something&rsquo;s not right. Your date is nowhere to be seen, the place is eerily empty, and the staff is missing. Just as panic starts to creep in, the door slams shut and locks behind you. What is happening? Romance takes a backseat as you scramble to unravel the mystery before the night goes from dreamy to downright disastrous!&#10;&#10;The Cupid Crisis, title #4 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room-style game in just 18 cards!
