    "Description": "Motor Speed is a somewhat more complex take on the idea of Racetrack. Instead of drawing lines, players move tokens representing cars on a square grid track.&#10;&#10;As in Racetrack cars use vector movement and can generally only alter each component of the vector (horizontal and vertical) by one space a turn. However, cars have wear points and can expend these for extra changes to movement: half a point per extra acceleration and a point per extra deceleration.&#10;&#10;Four different cars are provided with different characteristics.&#10;&#10;If playing multiple laps pit stops may be made to replenish wear points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Did You Really Just is an adult party game that requires you to spit out the first thing that pops into your head. A &quot;Challenger&quot; starts the game by flipping over a category card such as &quot;When I drink Tequila I...&quot; They then challenge each person at the table one by one by flipping over a letter card which has a random letter of the alphabet on it. The first person (between the challenger and the person they are battling) to shout out a word or short phrase, fitting the category and starting with that letter, wins the letter card. They then move on to the next person at the table in a clockwise rotation. After everyone at the table has been challenged the &quot;challenger&quot; passes the letter cards to the person on their left and now that person is the new &quot;challenger&quot;. They flip over a new category card and play continues in the same pattern.&#10;&#10;When all letter cards have been played, this concludes round one. Everyone counts their letter cards and the person with the most cards wins that round. Keep a tally of the winner and shuffle the letter cards to start a new round. You can play as many rounds as you like until the group decides they are done playing or you run out of category cards.&#10;&#10;The answers you give to each category card do not have to be truthful, but they do need to make sense. For Example if the category is &quot;When I Drink Tequila I...&quot; and the letter is &quot;S&quot; you can answer &quot;Streak!&quot; even if you have never actually done that. If you answered &quot;Shoe&quot; that does not make sense with the category and the group takes a vote on if it fits or not. If they say it does not fit you re-do this battle by putting that letter card back into the deck and flipping over a new letter.&#10;&#10;When all rounds have been played the person who has won the most rounds (has the most tally's) is the ultimate champion!&#10;&#10;",

Using of a hexagonal-grid game board, a 54-card deck, a 6-sided die, 2 tokens to represent fighters, and poker chips for damage, two adversaries seek positional advantage, attacking one another, and defending against, strikes, grappling, chokes, locks, and fouls.&#10;&#10;Attack cards are played at various ranges, and to varied effect. Strikes (clubs) can hit from distance, and do damage. Grappling attacks (spades) apply from closer range, do damage, and put you in control of your opponent. Chokes (hearts) can be played within the grappling clinch, and end the fight immediately when successful. Locks (diamonds) do the same, but unlike chokes, score damage, too.&#10;&#10;Defending attacks generally means playing a higher card of the same suit as the attack, or two lower cards in the same suit, unless you're in top position in a grappling clinch, in which case your grappling (spades) trump your opponent's chokes (hearts) and locks (diamonds). Fouls (jokers) trump everything.&#10;&#10;Players pay for damage caused by attacks with their supply of poker chips; but, when those chips run out, or if your opponent scores a successful submission hold on you, you've lost the fight: the winner takes the chips.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, swap the positions of two orthogonally or diagonally adjacent pieces of different colors so that the value of your piece in the pair is increased.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more moves available. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. On even-sized boards, if the board is empty, whoever made the last move before the game's end loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsFree Emulsion: The board is initially empty. A piece's value is the same as in the standard game plus half the number of empty squares orthogonally adjacent to that piece. On your turn, instead of making a swap, you may place one piece of each color on orthogonally adjacent empty squares.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesA swap always increases the value of both pieces in the pair by the same amount. Therefore, a legal swap for one player is always a legal swap for the other player as well.&#10;&#10;Emulsion was inspired by Micha&#197;&#130; Zapa&#197;&#130;a's Slyde.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Merchant of Venus provides a nice, solid base upon which to build variants. In addition to providing a simple movement system for combining speed, navigation and carrying capacity, it provides a balanced economic model with which to play. These two aspects combine to be very handy when you're modelling such expensive pastimes as war, politics or civilization. During the development of Merchant of Venus many alternative rules were tried and discarded. The variant here presents some of the best of these alternate rules, and the counters to implement them.&#10; These rules add quite a bit of versimilitude and fun to the game, but they also add some complexity, unbalance the play a bit, distract the players from the commercial aspects, and/or increase the playing time. That's why they weren't included in the original game. Generally, each variant rule can be used by itself, or it can be freely combined with the other rules.&#10;&#10;The variant rules are:&#10;- Fast Set-up: Shortens setup time by mixing in the bonus markers with the goods markers and placing them only on culture discovery, makes bonus markers appear more early.&#10;- The Lost &quot;?&quot; Box: Make the asteroid in the Multi-Generations Ship a &quot;?&quot; box.&#10;&#10;     Variable Nova Balls: Change the firepower of Nova Balls according to blast attack rolls of the players.&#10;     Own Species Bonus: Allow multiple items to be traded in a city matching the players species.&#10;     Customized Spaceships: Ships work differently depending on the player species.&#10;     Haggling: Adds a bartering system depending on presence, availability and luck to trading of items.&#10;     Extra Forts: Additional fort markers for the merchants.&#10;     Agents, Bases &amp; 2nd Ships: Rules for the new agent, base and 2nd ship counters&#10;     Mercenaries: Rules for the new mercenary markers.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

When a player does not have enough money or property to pay a rent or honor a debt to the bank or another player, he goes bankrupt and leaves the game.

    "Description": "It&rsquo;s the year 3327 and the human race has expanded deep into the solar system. However, supporting civilization on such a large scale uses lots of resources which are in scarce supply!&#10;&#10;Powerful, Hyperdriven Rockets piloted by adventurous privateers, such as yourself, compete for the desperately needed and lucrative resources found on the billions of Asteroids in the vast Oort Belt surrounding us.&#10;&#10;Gather as much as of each type of Resource you can before the others beat you to them, as you strategically navigate your Rocket through wormholes in deep space. But be careful, this is a highly competitive and cut-throat enterprise. If you&rsquo;re not careful you could get raided by your competitors and lose it all!&#10;&#10;Quick and easy to learn, light and fun strategy game.&#10;&#10;In clockwise turn order, each player places their Rocket in the center Wormhole of any unoccupied Game Board Tile. They then immediately take all adjacent Resources (orthogonally or diagonally) to their position. Once all Players have set their inital positions and taken their resources, they now must move their Rockets using either their Impulse Engine or Hyperdrive once per turn, then take Resources and/or raid other Player&rsquo;s Rockets if possible from that final position.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last Resource has been taken from the Game Board.&#10;&#10;Your Rocket is fast, but has no steering or brakes! Thus, you can only move in one direction (orthogonally or diagonally) and must continue in that direction until you are blocked by an Asteroid, another Rocket or the edge of the Game Board.&#10;&#10;Also, wormholes are littered throughout the Oort Cloud. You may choose to pass over or jump through them to another open Wormhole, but must continue your movement (in the same direction) until you are blocked.&#10;&#10;Instead of using your Impulse Engine, you may engage your Hyperdrive to jump and stop at any unoccupied space, including Wormholes. However, you may not take any adjacent Resources or raid other Rockets upon arrival at the new location.&#10;&#10;In addition to taking Resources from Asteroids, you may also Raid a single Resource from any Rocket(s) your movement ends adjacent to as long as you were not already adjacent to the Rocket(s) you are raiding at the start of your turn.&#10;&#10;The game is over when the last Resource is taken from the Game Board. The amount of points you receive is based on how many of each type of Resource you have collected. Thus having all five of a Resource yields 10 points, but having only one scores 0 points. In addition, you also receive a 5 point bonus for each completed set of six your Resources make up.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;This is a hand crafted game, made to order with high quality, durable acryllic components.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Luckily for Yakson, the train has an expert at the wheel.&#10;&#10;Rocco is the best railroad engineer around. He is the only one who can stop fast enough to save Yakson, but what is his thanks? Every time he stops, that Yak steals all of his train cars!&#10;&#10;In this 2-5 player game, plays put down a yak card to steal all the train cars played. The player with the most stolen cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;Deal each player 5 cards. Place the rest of the cards face down in the middle as a draw pile.&#10;&#10;Place the Rocco the Rhino Engine card face up. Draw one train card from the draw pile and put it on the end of the engine card to start the train.&#10;&#10;Each player takes turns adding train cards end to end so that the color and character at the end of the last train card matches the one you are playing.&#10;&#10;After you put down a card, draw a new card from the draw pile so you have 5 cards in your hand. If you can't play a train card on your turn, pass and don't draw. Play moves to the next player.&#10;&#10;If you have a yak card, you can play it on your turn or hold it to play later. After playing a yak card, player picks up all the cards in the train, expect for the engine, and places them in a pile in front of them. The game continues until all 5 yaks have been played.&#10;&#10;The person with the most cards from the train (including the yaks) wins.&#10;&#10;Wild Zebra can be played if you can't play anything else. Play  Wild Zebra and then play the card of your choice, drawing 2 instead of 1 card to bring your hand back to 5.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Lines can be orthogonal or diagonal.&#10;&#10;Special thanks to Cameron Browne for creating Ludi and to Stephen Tavener for the game name and for coding it in 5 minutes on a Saturday morning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Try to get your pieces across the field, bounding over as many enemies as you can to get there, and manipulating the mindless zombies to hinder your opponent.&#10;&#10;The two human players are purple and white. The third force (zombies) heeds the call of whoever holds the Green Skull.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player may move one of their pieces one space in any direction or may make any series of jumps, removing one piece each time. If the holder of the Green Skull jumps, the Green Skull goes to the opponent; otherwise that player chooses a move for the zombies. If the zombies jump, the Green Skull goes to the opponent.&#10; At game end, each force (including the zombies) gets 2 points for each of their own pieces at the far wall and 1 point for every opponent&rsquo;s piece that has been taken. The game ends when all of one side are against the wall or off the board: since the game can end when all the zombies are dead, players may be strategic about the zombies&rsquo; survival.&#10;&#10;Each player must judge whether a jump warrants the loss of the Green Skull. So while your opponent has the Green Skull, you can taunt them and dare them to jump, giving you the Green Skull.&#10;&#10;The original publisher, Nestorgames, discontinued Green Skull during the pandemic, among many other products (95%  of his catalog, as a matter of fact), making the game out of print. Any interested publishers should contact me.&#10;&#10;",

Little did they know that one of the looted chests belonged to an old pirate sorcerer, who had sealed within it the powerful SINISTER TWISTER. It turned out to be a devastating problem not only for them, but also for the kraken fleet that was about to siege their convoy.&#10;&#10;Sinister Twister adds components for a 6th player, a twister die and twister deck as well as curses and explosive bombardments.&#10;&#10;The game is won, as in the original, by defeating pirates, and sometimes your competing krakens and stealing their treasure, however in Sinister Twister you have at least 5 more ways in which to mess with your opponents.&#10;&#10;",

There are always two sides; with more than two players each side is controlled by a team.&#10;&#10;Players choose their forces using a points system and set up in secret. After that players alternate turns; on a turn a player may move all of their units according to their movement allowances and then may play a bonus card for additional movement. Firing is conducted afterwards. Players have five minutes to complete each turn.&#10;&#10;Bonus cards are drawn from a standard 52-card deck; players start with a hand of these, get a new one each turn, and get more for things such as having remaining time on their turns, capturing certain regions, etc. Most of the cards are used for additional movement but aces are used for additional cannon shots.&#10;&#10;Combat is conducted using dice.&#10;&#10;Victory is assessed by points: points are awarded for capturing sectors of the board (the 6x6 squares) and specific board features, with additional points awarded for killed enemy units.&#10;&#10;Optional rules are provided for hospitals and corpsmen, and a set of &quot;Junior Battle&quot; rules is provided for younger players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The final expansion to Petrichor, Petrichor: Cows gives the highly interactive cloud-faring strategy game new concerns with a decidedly bovine spin: a new action, a whole new Climate mechanic and a fresh set of crop tiles.&#10;&#10;With cows in the picture, so are their various byproducts; Manure, improving the quality of crops, and Methane Gas, affecting the world climate. The Graze action allows players to influence the cows, and nudge the world's climate in favour of the crops they intend to grow. With climate, comes an all-new set of climate sensitive trees; the Norway Spruce, the Baobab, the Date Palm and the Sweet Chestnut.&#10;&#10;Petrichor: Cows can be combined with any of the previous expansions Petrichor: Flowers and Petrichor: Honeybee to create some truly memorable cloud-slinging, water-sprinkling action. The expansion content is also supported when using the Southern Winds solo mode.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

They rule from on high.&#10;&#10;The people of Vlachold fear neither the Orcish warcry nor the Elvish arrow.  They fear when their Lords look upon them, and smile.  The vampiric Tepes Lords and Voivode Knights lead their mortal Voynik Swordsmen and Curteni Halberdiers to war, as likely to feast on their servants as they are the enemy.&#10;&#10;The Lords of Vlachold is an army for Battleground: Fantasy Warfare, a points-based tabletop tactical wargame in which units are represented by cards.   Each player builds their army, deploy their units, and assigns them orders. Once the battle begins, each player only has a limited ability to command their army. The player with the better plan can use their commands to inspire or enchant their units in combat.&#10;&#10;Quick to set up, easy to store, Battleground is a game that can be played at your kitchen table and carried in your pocket. And yet Battleground is a deeply tactical game, where maneuver and marshaling your limited command resources are the keys to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
