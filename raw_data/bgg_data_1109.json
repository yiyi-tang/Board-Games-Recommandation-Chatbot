    "Description": "A Cooperative Game of Survival, Exploration, and Escape&#10;&#10;Loosely based on Jules Verne's novel &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;&#10;&#10;In the early 1860s, a hot-air balloon carrying six friends, crash landed on an uncharted island in the South Pacific Ocean. Together, they must craft, explore, and move during the day and fight off threats at night. Survivors will move across the island finding clues that will reveal story moments and help them how to escape the island. However, as they move toward their ultimate goal, time is running out, as a catastrophic event will unfold at the end of 30 days!&#10;&#10;Mysterious Island is a cooperative survival game that uses an action point system for players to make strategic choices. In conjunction with those choices is the variability of cards drawn during the Day and Night Phases. These cards often will determine how players make their choices.&#10;&#10;The Day and Night decks double as a &quot;timer&quot; for the end of game. Once they run out, the game is over and the survivors lose in catastrophic fashion. Of course, staying alive while searching for a way off the island is another adventure of its own.&#10;&#10;The Craft and Explore decks offer the player ways to improve their skills and chance of survival. The 35 Craft cards will ALWAYS provide items to help survivors along their way. The 35 Explore cards have both positive and negative effects on the players depending what is drawn.&#10;&#10;Out of the 130 cards used in a game, only 6 are doubles, which makes each game session very unique. These variables offer high re-playability and make the gaming experience different each time.&#10;&#10;If you or someone you know love adventure games with elements of survival and exploration, give Mysterious Island a try!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

First to accuse him was Meliagaunt, whom Lancelot challenged in combat to prove the Queen&rsquo;s innocence. During the contest, Lancelot cleaved his opponent&rsquo;s head in half and cleared the Queen of those charges. However, rumors continued to abound and soon other knights became suspicious. Sir Agravain and Sir Mordred gathered twelve knights and stormed Guinevere&rsquo;s chamber, finding Lancelot there with the Queen. Now you, as Sir Lancelot, must try to escape and fight your way out of the castle and prove the innocence of Queen Guinevere before King Arthur has her burned to death for infidelity.&#10;&#10;Object of the Game&#10;&#10;You are fighting to escape the perils of the castle and, at the same time, trying to defend the Honor of the Queen you love. You will test your Knightly Virtues against those of the 14 knights standing in your way and fight to emerge victorious. If you can defeat 8 of the 14 knights along your path you will clear the name of your Queen and escape into the night. However, all is not as easy as it may seem. With every failure to defeat a knight, your Knightly Virtues will decrease and the Honor of your Queen will move one step closer to peril. Should you lose to 7 knights, or have two of your Virtues reach a value of 0, Lancelot will be banished from the lands and the Queen will burn for her sins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Somewhere in a dark but distant future, humankind is fighting a war for survival against its greatest threat - a changing climate. The polar ice caps have melted, entire civilizations, swept away almost overnight. A distant rust-covered memory, the world we knew has been swallowed whole, lost in the murky depths of an unforgiving ocean.&#10;&#10;Desperate, starving, and lacking the technical achievements of a forgotten era, the surviving population propels steam-powered engines towards the farthest corners of earth in search of the faintest glimmer of hope. Some found this hope on a plot of ocean simply known as the Arena. Through uncharted waters, there lies a thousand islands eroded by time, where untold riches await to be discovered by the remnants of past civilizations. You are among the desperate few in search of those lost treasures.&#10;&#10;SteamPunk Arena is a turn-based strategy game with an objective to explore the islands looking for salvage, exploit the resources you find there, expand your domain using bridge networks,  and exterminate your opponent. In SteamPunk Arena, each combatant chooses a faction, and then chooses the hero who will lead that faction into battle. These heroes will help spur theatre-specific units on by providing an action modifying bonus.&#10;&#10;The combatants begin the conflict with the same garrisoned unit strength and an equal amount of land; however, this is where your similarities will end. Where you place your Base Tile or Land Tiles is entirely up to you. What lies hidden and waiting to be discovered could also provide a unique advantage or disadvantage.  But keep in mind no matter what your path looks like, the dice-roll will often decide the outcome of events that transpire throughout the playthrough.&#10;&#10;Using a turn-based unit action system. The combatant controls the action of active units throughout the duration of the turn until all action points are spent. The health of the unit is determined by a population or hit-point, found in the center of the piece. Units can only be deployed one per turn. There are only so many population points you can have active on the arena game boards at any given time, unless modified by a certain Resource or Unit Bonus. So choose your army wisely and enjoy the fight. We will see you out in the Arena!&#10;&#10;",

Above that, it can be played in two different styles: Turn-based board game where players take turns to explore the crypt and battling creatures and the narrative-driven role-playing game (RPG). In both styles of play, the players will take on the role of a Tike and are highly encouraged to interact with and help each other.&#10;&#10;&quot;Raivynwood is a small but prosperous village nestled neatly in the, get this, Raivynwood forest. It is most well known for its local militia which is comprised of some of the most well-trained soldiers in the land. But it has another, rather unfortunate, claim to fame which is a little less known, and that is that Raivynwood is a hub of catastrophe. If anything can go wrong, anything in the world, it will go wrong in Raivynwood. That may be the reason for needing such well-trained men and women, or that could just be a coincidence.&#10;The training in Raivynwood starts at the ripe age of 5, these boys and girls are called the CIC (Combat Initiative Cubs). They mostly play with sticks and wooden shields in childish games that have a fortunate side-effect of teaching them how to kick butt. The Cubs graduate at the age of 7 when they become CIBs (Combat Initiative Bloomer). CIBs practice with dull metal weapons, begin to learn the bow and learn the value of respecting and helping their parents. It&rsquo;s an important lesson, you know? Finally, at the harsh age of 11, Bloomers get promoted to the Raivynwood CIA (Combat Initiative Adepts). As a junior member of the Raivynwood CIA it is your duty to train hard and watch over your small piece of paradise when the grownups aren&rsquo;t around.&#10;On this day, of all days&hellip; the day on which the grownups have all gone to the eastern forest edge to confront a new lizardfolk threat&hellip; misfortune has stricken. As you and your fellow CIA members train in the city square, showing off your moves and flirting with your crush, you are disrupted&hellip;&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Thus those who have placed lower bids will have more coin cards to use in later rounds.&#10;&#10;The first player begins by taking one of the available face-up jewelry cards and can either spend it to earn victory points or save it in their hand to use in combination with other cards in a later round. A maximum of two cards can be saved in hand between rounds.&#10;&#10;Once each player has taken their turn, the round ends and the process repeats. When the jewelry card pool is being refilled at the beginning of each round and a beer card is revealed, new rules go into effect and continue until the next beer card is drawn.&#10;&#10;Note: the game box closely resembles classic Japanese chocolate box, giving the game a strong retro feel for Japanese players.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

    "Description": "In FAT STACKS, you and your friends compete to build the tallest and tastiest pancake stack! Use classic pancake flavors and toppings, as well as some ~special~ ingredients other chefs wouldn&rsquo;t dare to use!&#10;&#10;The game begins by drawing 4 cards and a buttermilk pancake.  Begin your turn by choosing one of three options: draw 2 cards and play 2 cards from your hand, only draw 3 cards, or only play 3 cards.  Players create stacks of pancakes by playing Pancake and Topping cards from their hand.  Players can place positive cards on their own stacks, and play negative cards to sabotage other players' stacks.&#10;&#10;In order for your beautiful (or disgusting) stack to earn a final score, you must top off the stack with a Finisher card.  These special cards are placed in the center of the table and are earned by completing the objective on each card. &#10; When a finisher is played, it's special effect triggers immediately and your stack's points are locked in which prevents the stack from being sabotaged by other players.  Any stacks that don't have finishers on them at the end of the game don't earn any points.  This includes stacks that have a negative total value!  The game ends when the deck runs out of cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, special Trophy cards are awarded to players for bonus points.  These cards are given to the player with the tallest, finished, pancake stack, the player with the fewest negative items on their stack, and the player who dealt the most damage in one turn.  The points are added up, and the player who earned the most points the end of the game, wins!&#10;&#10;FAT STACKS works best with 3-6 players, takes about 40 minutes for a full game, and is recommended for ages 14+.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is a game of questioning and writing&mdash;in hopes of gaining insight and perspective, understanding and trust.&#10;&#10;Through their answers to questions, players are creating and telling a story about the world they have created and the family they belong to.&#10;&#10;",

The way their opponent chooses to defend themselves (or not) may result in a flurry of attacks and counter attacks between the two players, exhausting their Poise in a flurry of flashing thrusts, slashes and lunges. If either player gets hit with an attack while they are at No Poise, they are eliminated from the game!&#10;&#10;Be the last player standing after a series of ferocious duels and you win!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ACQUISITIONS&#10;&#10;ACQUISITIONS is a game inspired by the ideas of Sid Sackson. It is a game that is predicated upon building a Kingdom of wealth. Long ago, in distant times, Kingdoms were sometimes won and lost by mighty armies. Battles were waged to gain the lands and treasures held within the Kingdom under siege. Yet always behind these mighty armies were the Kings and Queens with their vaults of gold, silver, and bronze. Wealth has always driven the ownership of land. Kingdoms were always built on wealth.&#10;&#10;The game of ACQUISITIONS allows players to wheel, deal, and plan their way to building the largest Kingdom of wealth. The only &quot;luck&quot; in the game of ACQUISITIONS is the luck of the draw for the Destination Cards. Beyond that, it is up to the player to purchase, trade, and strategically maneuver to become the King or Queen of the largest cache of Commodity Coins.&#10;&#10;The basic concept of the game of ACQUISITIONS is that the players create and grow Kingdoms by playing the Destination Cards in their hand and placing buildings on the board. The Destination Cards available to the player are provided strictly by the luck of the draw. The skill in the game of Acquisitions, to generate a large amount of Commodity Coins, comes from the ability to obtain Kingdom Cards in the Kingdoms that will grow or even in the Kingdoms that are taken over by larger Kingdoms. The obtaining of Kingdom Cards is generally made in Kingdoms based on the players&rsquo; capability to grow those Kingdoms with their cards on hand. However, players can increase their Commodity Coins by obtaining Kingdom Cards in Kingdoms that grow from the other players building placements.&#10;&#10;The main objective of Acquisitions is to become the player with the most Commodity Coins at the end of the game. This is achieved by obtaining Kingdom Cards in the Kingdoms that are growing, for a long term venture, while at the same time shrewdly investing in smaller Kingdoms that can be sacrificed in takeovers, for a short term outlay, all of which gains Commodity Coins through Royalty Compensations. The more Commodity Coins that can be generated in short term outlays, the more they can be invested into long term ventures. You can not reach the pinnacle of the game of ACQUISITIONS just by becoming the King or Queen of the largest Kingdom. The player who wants to become the wealthiest King or Queen must produce that perfect mix of active cash flow through takeovers and uncanny investment in Kingdoms that will grow. Many different strategies can be used to reach the pinnacle of wealth because every game is different.&#10;&#10;The Game of ACQUISITIONS will keep the players focused because one purchase, one trade, one placement of a building can be the difference between win or lose.&#10;&#10;Acquire a Kingdom of Wealth&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Au&szlig;erdem darf ein Spieler pro Runde nur eine einzige Phase bilden. Sobald ein Spieler eine vollst&auml;ndige Phase ausgespielt hat und seine restlichen Karten losgeworden ist, endet die Runde. Dann erhalten alle Spieler neue Karten und die n&auml;chste Runde beginnt. Wer als Erster seine zehnte Phase abschlie&szlig;t und dann seine restlichen Karten loswird, gewinnt! Jedes Kartendeck enth&auml;lt Joker-Karten, die die Spannung steigern und den Spielern helfen k&ouml;nnen, einer kniffligen Situation zu entkommen.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (German)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In an ancient forest there was a tiny village. The villagers had cut a clearing into the dark chaos of the forest and cultivated a space for the patterns of life to grow. Everyone knew everyone else&rsquo;s name (and business) and the only dramas in the village were small ones. In short, it was peaceful.&#10;&#10;But all that changed when, one night, a wolf&rsquo;s howl split the darkness.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;&#10;Werewolf in the Dark is a game of hidden roles, deception, strategy, and, above all else, survival. When the lights go out some are afraid&mdash;they hide and hope. Others know that it is up to them to protect their fellow villagers and drive back the monsters menacing them. Still others begin to the feel the dark stirrings of a terrible hunger and rise to hunt.&#10;&#10;Werewolf in the Dark is played in two alternating rounds: night and day. Players join one of two teams: the village team or the monster team. Each night the lights go out and players get up and venture out to hide or hunt. The players on the monster team are trying to kill the other players by covertly tapping them on the shoulder until all the villagers are dead. The villagers are trying to survive the night round and gather information about the identities of the monsters among them. When the first dead body is found, the lights come on and the day round begins. All players then gather together to discuss what happened in the night round and vote someone out of the game. The game continues until there are only monsters or villagers left.&#10;&#10;",

And there&rsquo;s a lot of gold and treasures at stake.&#10;&#10;Abar Depth is centered around said game of dice. 2 to 5 players can sit by a table together.&#10;&#10;Each person rolls 2 dungeon dice, picks 3 character dice and attempts to defeat others in a game filled with treason, monsters and artifact hunting.

    "Description": "An Undeniable Victory is a simulation of Iran&rsquo;s first large-scale offensive in its war against Iraq. The previous year Iraqi forces had captured large swaths of Iranian territory. With the front line dangerously close to Khorramshahr, the Mullahs in Tehran ordered the Iranian military to launch an offensive at the earliest opportunity to eliminate the threat to this vital Iranian city and production center.&#10;&#10;An earlier, smaller Iranian offensive, Operation Hoveyzeh, was easily repulsed by the Iraqis in January. As evidence grew of another Iranian attack, the Iraqis entrenched and awaited their enemy&rsquo;s actions. Any further offensives by the Iraqis were out of the question until the severe losses in men and material from the previous year could be replaced.&#10;&#10;The Iranian offensive in March would be supported by three divisions of the newly created Pasdaran, or revolutionary guards. Composed of youthful recruits, many of them not even out of high school, the Pasdaran was created by the mullahs as a &ldquo;revolutionary counterweight&rdquo; to the Iranian military, which the religious leaders suspected of harboring many who were still loyal to the ousted Shah. Much would be at stake at this battle, both at the front and behind the lines.&#10;&#10;An Undeniable Victory is a two player game intended to be an easy-to-learn game suitable for new gamers, as well as a challenging and fun contest for veteran Grognards. The game can also be easily played solitaire, however.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players can use magic tokens to learn spells, enhance their attributes temporarily and control monsters to hamper other players.  Each player attempts to complete 3 honor tasks, to build 4 monuments, build one gold monument, and slay the dragon. The first player to complete these tasks wins. If no player completes all three, the winner is the one with the most points.   Points are gained by completing numerous smaller missions during the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
