    "Description": "&quot;For generations human teens have crept into pastures at night and tipped over defenseless cows in their sleep.&#10;&#10;&quot;Last night they tipped the wrong cow... Elsa was the prettiest in the pasture, and Clyde the Bull was in love.&#10;&#10;&quot;Seeking revenge, this morning Clyde rushed onto a nearby highway, causing an auto accident and stopping traffic for miles. Now he's organizing gangs of cows from the pasture to tip cars off the road.&#10;&#10;&quot;Watch out world, it's the cows doing the tipping now!&quot;&#10;&#10;Collect gangs of cows by drawing cards from the draw pile or your neighbors' discard piles. Use these gangs to tip over the 5 types of vehicle cards in 5 different colors. Your score is based on the set of vehicle cards you tip; Busses are worth more than Cars and Trucks, but they also require a bigger gang to tip over. Motorcycles aren't worth as much, but they're easier to tip (require a smaller gang).&#10;&#10;You score for collecting types of vehicles as well as for collecting colors, so you can go for a bunch of Tractors, or you could try to collect all the Blue vehicles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game simulating drivers in an apocalyptic future; where raiders and bandits roam the land, taking what they want by sheer force or through brute intimidation.  The players are wanderers; drivers of cars that have been modified to help them endure the perils &ldquo;out there&rdquo; as they travel the highways between fortified villages and settlements.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by one or more players. Ideally, the game is intended to be played by &ldquo;more&rdquo; players but works fine as a solo game. In a multi-player game, the individuals can work together, or against each, or as teams if they have enough players.&#10;&#10;The basic component is a standard deck of 52 cards, a token to show the drivers movement across the cards, and two 1d6 to keep track of the drivers two stats: health/speed.&#10;&#10;Each player is trying to get his driver across a wasteland of broken roads, and marauding bandits.  The cards themselves are used as the road, modifiers during movement, and combat against marauders or other players.&#10;&#10;The card suite and face value will determine the type and strength of encounters the driver will face along the road,  The driver will in turn use their hand of cards to control the speed of their vehicle as well as the strength of their attack and defense.   During a co-op game, the drivers can use their cards to help friendly drivers fight off marauders or control their driving reactions.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game was designed as part of the Traditional Card Game design contest.&#10;&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/421774/page/1&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of each player's turn, he draws 1 card from a common draw pile. During his turn, the player has to make a move on one of his pieces. At any time during his turn, he can &#10;(1) Summon basic or advanced pieces &#10;(2) Promote basic pieces to advanced pieces &#10;(3) Play cards&#10;&#10;To do these 3 actions, costs must be paid first, which means discarding cards equal to the cost face down to a common discard pile. Whenever a card is played, the opponent may respond by playing a card. Cards are resolved first in last out. During opponent's turn, player may also play cards. Player can also modify the movement, capture or interaction with opposing piece of a piece in play by paying the cost of a Piece Modifier Action card. The effects of the modification lasts only the turn the card is played. Unsummoned pieces are in each player&rsquo;s reserve. When the pieces are captured (or destroyed), they are placed in each player&rsquo;s graveyard.&#10;&#10;There are 2 types of cards. Actions go to the discard pile face up immediately while Permanents stay in play in front of the player who played them. Kings cannot be targeted or affected by cards unless specified. Player may not Check the opponent if he plays any card prior to his Move.&#10;&#10;Each 2x2 board tile has a coloured circle in one of the squares.

But watch out:  homes can only be built where commerce supports it.

As the dogs move on the board they can land on special spots that can aid or hinder the player's piece. Some spots allow another roll or to move ahead extra spaces. Some force you to lose a turn or move back. If your dog lands on another player's piece. The other player&rsquo;s dog is sent back to the start.

If the other player moves one stone forward to that column, the upper stone is placed in an empty cell on the lowest row of that column (which is accessible by a sequence of moves: in a chess-like board, the game only uses black squares). If the enemy stone cannot retreat (it was at the fifth row) the current player gets an extra move.&#10;If both attacks occur in a single move, column attacks takes precedence over contact attacks. That is, the player only executes the column retreat. If that retreat is not possible, he executes the contact retreat. If that retreat is also not possible, the player gets an extra move.&#10;&#10;LAST STONE&#10;If a player only has one stone, it may move one or two cells (mover's choice) and may retreat one or two cells after an attack by contact (attacker's choice).&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;If a player repeats a position by the third time, he loses.&#10;&#10;",

You get one in each of the six Munchkin Quest player colors. The obvious thing to do would be to throw them into your Munchkin Quest box along with the ones that came with the game, and use the correct pawn for whatever sex you character happens to be at that moment.&#10;&#10;But if you are truly evil -- and your friends let you get away with it -- you'll show the world just what a munchkin you really are by using the Munchkin Babes in other games.&#10;&#10;In Munchkin&#10;&#10;Any time you are entitled to go up a level -- or when you do something that WOULD earn you a level if you weren't already Level 9 -- you may, instead, place a munchkin pawn in front of you. In any combat, you may discard it for a 1d6 bonus. You may only have one in front of you at a time. Unless, of course, you &quot;lose&quot; these rules and tell the other players that you're allowed to have more. Six is a good number.&#10;&#10;In Other Games&#10;&#10;Because you're a munchkin, you may claim a munchkin advantage for using these pawns in ANY game. For instance:&#10;&#10;&#10;    In any roll-and-move game, if you use the munchkin as your pawn rather than one that came with the game, then once per game you may add or subtract 1 space to the move you roll. &#10;    In any game in which you start with money, if you use the munchkin as your pawn you start with 10% extra. Round up, of course. &#10;    In chess, a munchkin pawn can move forward two spaces at any time. &#10;&#10;&#10;If you create your own official rules for using the Munchkin pawn in other games, please share your rules with us at the Steve Jackson Games forums.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In September 1940, Italian divisions rolled over the border between their colony of Libya and British-dominated Egypt. After advancing several dozen miles they stopped to secure their supply lines, only to meet a devastating British counter-attack that soon had them reeling back halfway across Libya. For the next two and a half years, Axis and Allied armies surged back and forth across the North African desert until finally Gen. Bernard Law Montgomery's British Eighth Army wrecked Erwin Rommel's vaunted Panzer Army Africa.&#10;&#10;Western Desert Force: The Desert Campaign 1940-1942 is a quick-playing game from the same designer as our Defiant Russia, following the same philosophy: a game you can play in just an hour or two, with the emphasis on tense action and lots of fun.&#10;&#10;The map portrays the North Africa from El Agheila to Alexandria. It's divided into hexagons, at a scale of 15 miles across each.&#10;&#10;Players control the actual units that fought in this campaign. Units are divisions, brigades and regiments with some battalions. The Axis player controls German, Italian and Italian Colonial (Libyan) units; the Allied player leads British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, Indian, Polish, Jewish, Free French and Greek units in the fight against fascism.&#10;&#10;The objectives for each side are simple: kick the enemy out of North Africa. The strategy is not so easy: the Allies must hold on to protect the Suez Canal; the Axis must choke off this vital waterway. Neither can afford to be ejected from the otherwise worthless desert.&#10;&#10;The game design is by William Sariego, and development is by industry veteran Paul Dangel in his Avalanche Press debut.&#10;&#10;Western Desert Force includes:&#10;&#10;     One 33&quot;x17&quot; map&#10;     Full-color play aids&#10;     140 game pieces&#10;     16-page rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 15 miles / 24 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 11 x 17&quot; full color maps&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (140 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Western Desert Force rulebook&#10;Three single-side printed Player Aid cards&#10;One dual-side printed Random Events Card&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A roll-and-move game in which the board is a map of the United States, with certain spaces designated with cities' radio stations. Players start from Station WEAF in New York and make a &quot;complete circuit&quot; around the country.&#10;&#10;The game features an unusual mechanism for movement. Instead of a die or spinner, players use a &quot;radio tuner&quot; with two turning card discs. Shutter windows in the tuner reveal a station call sign (like WEAF) on one side and a number on the other. Players look up the station on the back of the tuner, where it is associated with a numerical value; that value is then added to the number revealed on the front. Therefore, if a player &quot;tunes in&quot; to Station WMC (Memphis), and the number 3, they then look on the back to see that WEC has a value of 1. That player then moves 3+1 spaces on the board.&#10;&#10;If players land on the same station they &quot;tuned in&quot; on their turn, they get a free extra turn. Players must &quot;tune in&quot; an exact number of spaces to finish their route and end on WEAF back in New York.&#10;&#10;",

Spin the dila and if the arrow is yellow then spin again until the spinner points either red or green where the cop either stops or moves the indicated number of squares. If all getaway cars are captured by the Squad Cars the police have won. If just one getaway car escapes then the bank robbers have won the game.&#10;&#10;",

It was to influence both literature and British army reform for years to come. &quot;1875: The Battle of Dorking&quot; allows two players to find out what might have happened at the key battle of this fictional campaign. Along with the rules and all the cut-outs needed, full background notes are given regarding Chesney's original book, the context of the campaign and the weaponry, organisation and tactics of both armies. A game should last two hours on a first play, reducing to 90 minutes once familiar with the rules.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The air one breathes is contagious of insensibility and hardness.&quot;&#10;-Louis Antoine, Comte de Bougainville&#10;&#10;An Abominable Kind of War, presents the players with a juxtaposition; on the one hand, you have the stylized warfare of 18th century Europe, embodied in the Regular Infantry of the Line, and the dandified  officers who were habituated to the finery of the courts of England and France, with a mentality little suited to combat in &ldquo;a labyrinth of forests, without roads;&rdquo; on the other, the brutal, almost feral type of warfare unleashed in North America in the form of &ldquo;an invisible enemy, who strikes  and vanishes, swift as the lightning&hellip;&rdquo; whose &ldquo;ferocity and insolence&hellip;makes[sic] one shudder.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;As the French, you must tame the &ldquo;lords of the wilderness&rdquo; and harness their fierce art of war without burning up too much materiel on them; though, should you allocate too little in the way of gifts and supplies for your formidable allies, they will return to their haunts in the wild, leaving your undermanned French regiments alone to face the gathering might of Great Britain and her American colonies.  So, can you find the right balance between the ferocious partisan war of the wilderness and the more &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; style of war as practiced in Europe?  If so, then perhaps the Marquis de Montcalm, with his French battalions, can stave off his more numerous enemies to the south; perhaps New France can survive the tempest of war.&#10;&#10;As the English, you, too, have a difficult &ldquo;balancing&rdquo; act to master; you must find a way to placate and protect your fiercely independent, but extremely valuable Colonials.  Without their numbers and forest craft, you stand little chance of besting the potent combination of &ldquo;unmitigated savages&rdquo; from the Lakes, Mission Indians from the St. Lawrence Valley, Canadian bush rangers, and French battalions which will be coming at you in waves.  Ask too much of the Americans; do too little on their behalf; treat them with disrespect; they will turn a deaf ear to your entreaties and allow the British Regulars to march off to certain defeat out there, at the hands of a foe who is covered &ldquo;by the universal forest.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;And, facing both of you, is &ldquo;an immense uninhabited wilderness, overgrown everywhere with trees and brushwood, so that nowhere can one see twenty yards.&rdquo;  This vast, uncharted forest dominates the struggle.  Ultimately, victory will only go to that player who can conquer that savage landscape stretching out before him.  It is the &ldquo;insidious warfare of the forest,&rdquo; then, which will determine the outcome of this struggle!&#10;&#10;",

But a rescue never comes. Worse still, the zombies are beginning to gather on the town. As their numbers grow, so does a strange intelligence in the undead hordes. Time grows short. If the characters wish to survive they have to do it themselves by escaping to the outskirts of the town.&#10;&#10;In Posthumous, half the players will command a single cliche character apiece, while the other half direct hordes of themed zombies. The town's layout, characters' and zombies strengths and weaknesses are all randomized each game, making every play through a distinguished experience. While on the surface, Posthumous's humor celebrates the proud history of the Zombie Flick, the game is at its core one of cunning and tactical use of your entire team's abilities.&#10;&#10;Posthumous's unique mechanics reduce downtime and keep the players plotting, laughing, and guessing. Games of up 10 players can expect their games to last no longer than games with only 4.&#10;&#10;",
