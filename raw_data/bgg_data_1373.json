    "Description": "Go Extinct! Stardust Catches the Carnivores is a new special edition of the award-winning Go Extinct! tabletop card game, incorporating artwork and concepts from the Stardust series of science books for young readers.&#10;&#10;Players complete sets of animals based on actual genetic clades, working to collect the most sets by inferring the other player&rsquo;s cards and identifying common ancestors on the evolutionary tree. By the end, players will deeply understand the amazing fact that every carnivoran alive today &mdash; from the house cat to the polar bear &mdash; descended from a single prehistoric ancestor, the miacid!&#10;&#10;Based loosely on Go Fish, the goal is for players to collect as many sets of closely related animals as possible. The sets are &quot;clades&quot; of closely-related animals on the evolutionary tree board, which players use for reference. Players take turns asking another player for cards, and if they do not have a matching card, they say &quot;Go Extinct!&quot;. The gameplay is more strategic than Go Fish because players can ask either for a specific card or a matching card at any level of the tree hierarchy, thus trading off the specificity of the result for the likelihood of a match.&#10;&#10;",

Can you be the first player to reach the covered bridge and not be defeated and turned into a Headless Horseman?&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a numbered movement card to play, discards that card and moves their game piece then draws a replacement movement card so they maintain 6 cards in their hand. Play rotates to the left each time with players moving their pieces along the paths through the haunted woods. At the beginning of the 4th round, each player is dealt a Curse card but players don&rsquo;t look at it. As each player begins their 4th turn, in order they will turn over the Curse card to see if they have been cursed and become a Headless Horseman.&#10;&#10;Staying in the playing order, the Headless Horseman player(s) will use their movement cards to chase down the remaining Ichabods and turn them through battle. If Ichabod runs out of hit points, they are converted to a Headless Horseman. If a horseman runs out of hit points, they are sent back to one of the graveyards and can continue the chase. Any Ichabod that reaches the covered bridge on the opposite side of the board wins, but if all players are turned to horsemen, the horsemen win.&#10;&#10;",

The more you control the supply of one type of resource the more money you can make.

The player with the start token goes first, once they have placed a ship their opponent gets to place a ship and play continues to alternate until both players have placed all their ships (to either explore or extract) and the round ends. Once a ship has been placed in a round it cannot be moved or returned to the players hand. At the end of each round both players will retrieve all their ships and the start token is passed to the other player who will then go first in the next round. The remaining asteroids are not shuffled and left in the same order.&#10;&#10;Once the last asteroid is claimed to be mined then the game ends and the materials extracted can be counted to determine who generated the most income. The income each resource is worth depends on how many cards of that resource each player has and is listed on each asteroid card with that resource type.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Promo card in French for Happy City by Cocktail Game. English language version by GameWright Games.&#10;&#10;The card is a special red building.&#10;To build it you will need:&#10;2 yellow building.&#10;2 blue building.&#10;&#10;When the card is built, you get one heart for each blue card adjacent to a yellow card (left, right, top or bottom).&#10;&#10;Information from publisher GameWright Games:&#10;Last year, our Ukrainian publishing partner chose to localize Happy City in their country. However, they had one significant request: replace the &quot;bonus building&quot; card that features Moscow's Red Square with a Ukraine-centric landmark. Honoring their wishes, our partner reached out to the game's artist who illustrated a vibrant scene that incorporates the iconic Golden Gate of Kyiv along with a monument of Yaroslav the Wise (one of the most famous princes of Kyiv). But just as production was about to start, the conflict escalated, leading up to the tragic situation we now know. As a result, Happy City cannot be released in Ukraine.&#10;Inspired by the actions of our dear partners at Cocktail Games and believing that every little bit helps, we decided to translate this symbolic card into English and offer it as a special release in solidarity with the citizens of Ukraine. For a $5 donation, you can get the card and we will contribute all of the proceeds to Global Giving's Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund.&#10;&#10;",

To ensure success, in addition to bringing memorable attractions, each circus also must offer spectators unique delicacies such as cotton candy, candy apples and popcorn. The circus that best satisfies its audience will be chosen as the greatest show on Earth!&#10;&#10;A game of Bravo lasts 17 rounds. In each round, the Master of Ceremonies chooses one of three types of tiles to be acquired by the players: Inner Ring, Outer Ring or Audience. Once the choice is made, a number of tiles equal to the number of players plus one is revealed. A single bid auction is then held to decide who will be the new Master of Ceremonies, who will have the right to be the first to choose one of the open tiles. In a clockwise direction, the other players choose tiles, being able to spend tickets to open new options on the table. When all circuses are completed, players reveal their Ringmaster tile and all artists in each circus are scored. The value of each artist category is added and then multiplied by the number of that category icons in that circus Audience tiles. The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "W&oacute;dz plemienia (&quot;The Tribe Chief&quot;) is a very interesting adventure game that will attract everyone. You have to prove that you are the best candidate for Chief of the Tribe.&#10;&#10;A true leader must be resourceful, well-planned, charismatic, and committed to trading. Candidates take a test to select who best meets the above criteria. In addition to entrepreneurship and strategic skills, the character and talents assigned to your character are also important. In addition, your village is struggling with the adversities of nature, and fate brings surprises and opportunities that are worth taking advantage of.&#10;&#10;THE COURSE OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The game takes place over the course of the year, and the passage of time is the movement of the pawn along the path of time. During each month, all players go through 4 Phases:&#10;&#10;PHASE I - GROWTH&#10;In this phase, all players successively: multiply their inventory, take 1 inhabitant, and take the crop from their crops.&#10;&#10;PHASE II - TRADE&#10;During this phase, all players buy or sell their 4 inventory tokens. Additionally, whoever has a purchase can go to it and sell tokens there, regardless of the general trade.&#10;&#10;PHASE III - CONSTRUCTION&#10;In this phase, players can perform one of the three actions: set up a crop, build a store, or train a buying staff.&#10;&#10;PHASE IV - FATE&#10;In this phase, the players roll the dice. Whoever gets an odd number of spots skips fate. Whoever has an even number of spots - he draws the &quot;Fate&quot; card for himself and is used to write it. If having a specific character trait gives you extra prots, it is written on the card and then we follow this notation.&#10;&#10;The description of the actions in each phase is additionally written on the board.&#10;&#10;After the end of the 4 Phases, we move the time pawn to the next month and start the queue again.&#10;&#10;MAGICAL NIGHT&#10;When the movement pawn reaches the MAGIC NIGHT space, we read aloud what happens to the entire village. The record on the card applies to all players. If the holder of a character trait is treated specially, it is recorded on the card.&#10;After following the instructions on the Magic Night card, move the pawn to the next month.&#10;&#10;EXCHANGE&#10;If, as a result of writing on the card, one player has to pay something to the other, but he does not have the appropriate amount, he returns the inventory tokens to the bank, exchanges them for $ and pays the opponent. If one player has to give the other an inventory token, but he doesn't have one, he pays the equivalent of $ ($ 1 for 1 inventory). If, as a result of writing on the card, one player has to give the other a citizen token, but he does not have one, then he pays the equivalent of $ ($ 1 per 1 inhabitant).&#10;&#10;CORONATION&#10;&#10;After the time pawn reaches this space, the points are scored&#10;individual players.&#10;&#10;",

Carefully remove the ice blocks from the ice wall with the ice pick or show off your skills on the ice tower. Your skill is tested in both of these exciting versions, because if the penguin falls, the game is over!&#10;&#10;1.Version: Ice wall The game starts when the ice wall is set up and the penguin is in position. You can play this game with 2-4 people. The players take turns to carefully pick an ice block out of the wall with the small hammer (ice pick). Players always have to keep an eye on the little penguin, because if it falls off the wall, the game is over! The player who makes the penguin fall off loses the game.&#10;&#10;2.Version: Ice tower Players now take turns to pull out a block of ice from the tower with their hands. The same applies here: If the penguin falls, the game is over and the player who caused it loses the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BLASTER: Vol. 4 includes two exclusive standalone games, and three expansions.&#10;&#10;Last Days: Legends&#10;Official Expansion for Last Days&#10;Rules for including The Luchador, The Mechanic, and the Waitress in your games of Last Days. These rules are compatible with the modern game setting and both the core Rulebook and Seasons Supplements. Keep an eye out for new miniatures available via Temple of the West.&#10;&#10;BRUTL! Tank Arena&#10;Standalone Game&#10;BRUTL! Tank Arena is a beer and pretzels style game of insanely fun tank battles. Your humble author wanted a ruleset to use all those cool tanks he had lying around, but something simple and required minimal effort.  With only a bit of terrain and a single tank per player, BRUTL! Is both easy to start and plays quick, getting to the best parts of miniature wargaming, blowing up your opponent.&#10;&#10;Sludge Nations&#10;Expansion for Sludge War, core rules available in BLASTER: Games Anthology 03.&#10;The world of sludge is vast and each player&rsquo;s interpretation of the setting is a valid iteration in the decaying multiverse. The Nation Factions described here will represent both existing nations and archetypes found across the dying world. For what it&rsquo;s worth, these factions are primarily focused on the western branchways inhabited by mankind and don&rsquo;t represent the full breadth of the sludge world.&#10;&#10;Gaslands: Legacy (Part II)&#10;Official Campaign Expansion for Gaslands: Refuelled, part I available in BLASTER: Games Anthology 03.&#10;Earth gets an eviction notice from Mars, and becomes dismantled and reassembled into a progressively more chaotic post-post-apocalyptic world. Randomly generate an illegal build and get out of the factory fast before you become dismantled yourself. Unique LEGACY Gaslands rules, and the remaining narrative scenarios. (The first five scenarios in the story are b in Vol. 3, but you don't need them to play these four, as the Legacy Rules are recapped in Vol.4.)&#10;&#10;Deathship One&#10;Solo/Co-op Standalone Game&#10;Deathship One is a solo or co-operative miniatures game in which the player controls a small squad of warriors attempting to fight their way through an alien death trap. It&rsquo;s designed to be fast and fun and to use a minimum of miniatures and terrain. It&rsquo;s also designed to be limited. The whole game consists of 5 scenarios or &lsquo;rooms&rsquo;. The order of those rooms can change from game-to-game, but you always play all five, assuming you live that long&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game is based on the Hostile Environment world, but players may use whatever modern or futuristic miniatures they have from Vietnam, Cold War or Science Fiction eras.&#10;&#10;Hostile Environment uses a die-pull initiative system to keep players on their toes. Better soldiers get greater odds of more activations, but lesser soldiers are allowed more numbers to keep fights balanced.&#10;&#10;Each miniature represents a single unit ranging in skill from green to elite. There are over 15 different weapon types and 6+ armor types from modern weapons and armor to alt-future tech.&#10;&#10;Most matches take about 90 minutes using at most two dozen miniatures.&#10;&#10;H.E.: Special Forces can be played solo, using the Hostile Tactical AI card deck (sold separately).&#10;&#10;2050, the world has entered total chaos. P68P, a poisonous pollen has killed over a billion people, while the toxic gnidia plant, once bred in labs, continues to spread like wildfire.

But, Paven the creator of &ldquo;the language of God,&rdquo; rules from the grave, spreading his mesmerism into weaker minds, leaving the zombies to his controlling thoughts.&#10;&#10;Failure of silver, the nano blood that cured cancer and heart disease has left mankind grappling with age old viruses thought to be extinct.

It combines a solid set of stats, a deceptively small size and a relatively low cost that makes it an affordable Tank Destroyer for a platoon commander on a budget. Left alone at the back of the battlefield sniping enemies it will quickly earn it&rsquo;s keep, but with a few small upgrades you can really enhance the ability of the Hetzer to be a threat on the table as well as improving it&rsquo;s chances of surviving. First up an Improved Rotation Mechanism will give your tank a nice improvement to its initiative, increasing your chances of being in the right place to get your shots off. Adding Wilhelm Lindemann to your crew will also improve your initiative in the movement phase whilst also increasing your chances of avoiding critical hits. Last but not least, a crew member with the Concealment ability will stack with the inherent Tank Destroyer special rule and keep your tank safe whilst in cover.&#10;&#10;",

Straight of the box it combines some fairly average stats, but with a little work the T-70 can shine in any situation with specific upgrades available for the gun and engine.&#10;&#10;The T-70 adds another Light Tank to the mix. Built in large numbers by the Soviet army it is a blank canvas ready for commanders to tweak to meet their mission needs. It comes with relatively high initiative (for a Soviet vehicle) but this can be improved through use of the M-80 engine which enhances the tanks initiative in the movement phase &ndash; it also works on the SU-76 and SU-122A (spoilers!). As a Light Tank the T-70 doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have the highest number of hit points or defense but a Low Noise System has the potential to give a light tank a nice defensive buff, if the dice are on your side.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Widely known for it&rsquo;s performance in the deserts of North Africa the Crusader is perfect for high speed attack runs on an unsuspecting enemy. Combine its naturally high initiative with Improved Communications to give a boost to the entire platoon.&#10;&#10;The Crusader, used by the British in the deserts of North Africa, is another speedster like the American M24 Chaffee. It gains an additional hit point over its American friend, but at the cost of two crew slots and the Arrow Shot special rule (which means it is less likely to cause critical hits). This means that straight of the box it will hang around longer, but possibly at the cost of dealing less damage&hellip; but if you are in the fight for one extra round that may be all the time you need to win the game! If you are looking to reduce the cost of your tank you can upgrade the gun to an OQF 3-inch Howitzer MK.I which removes the Arrow Shot rule and gives your tank High Explosive. This is a great option if you are feeling lucky with your dice&hellip; well are you?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Story:&#10;the 17th century, Ottoman Turk Empire, one of the most powerful states at that time, marched west to Austria and because of that, Arabs began to bring coffee into Europe. From that moment on, coffee has become one of the most popular drinks in the world. Then hundreds of years have passed, and even though travel between universes has become a daily routine like taking buses, coffee has spread from Earth to different Space Cities, the colonial satellites in outer space. Enjoying a cup of high-quality coffee every day has become the most anticipated thing for residents of Space Cities every day.&#10;&#10;After hundreds of years passed, a space expedition led by Dr. Brent Tully discovered an organic material called &quot;Stardust&quot;. By adding only a small amount of this magic ingredient, the flavors and aroma of any coffee are greatly enhanced. Moreover, the more freshly picked Stardust, the more it can improve the quality of coffee. This triggered a coffee revolution! In pursuit of the ultimate flavors, many new expeditions have been established on different Space Cities with the goal of &quot;seeking the freshest Stardust and ingredients for the first time and delivering the most delicious coffee&quot;. Beside the danger of sailing the spaceship across the galaxy, there is a robber called &quot;Galaxy Pirates&quot;, which is more threatening to them...&#10;&#10;Game Aim:&#10;In Stardust Coffee, you control a space expedition and sail your spaceships across the Galaxy. You collect different ingredients for coffee making and score by delivering the coffee back to your Starbase. Collecting Stardust and adding them to your coffee is another way to boost your Victory Points (VPs). By upgrading your spaceships, you could also speed up your collection of ingredients or Stardust.&#10;When the game goes on, the Galaxy Pirates will attack your Spaceships and rob your ingredients. By fighting back the Galaxy Pirates, you get Honor points and it will be another source of scoring. Only the player who could manage the Spaceships the best would gain most VPs to win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Rainbow ore is a legendary mineral that is more beautiful than any mineral. Many alchemists are trying to figure out how to make Rainbow ore from different minerals. Every day these alchemists have to find the necessary ore. But finding the required ore is not an easy task. They may have to rely on some luck sometimes. Sometimes it may be ore, But sometimes it might get a stone.&quot;&#10;&#10;Prime Stone is an educational board game designed for classroom use. The game rules are simple enough to develop calculating skills, which are a necessary basis for learning mathematics at a higher level. The prime Stone game can be used to educate about integer factorization and review content such as the greatest common divisor and least common multiple, prime numbers, composite numbers, powers, and other related topics. Teachers can use it to schedule classroom activities and play outside of school hours. Parents can play with their children to help them improve their math skills.&#10;&#10;Players can choose to do one of three things: Pick, Mix and Build. Details are as follows: 1) Take two tiles from the bag and place them in front of the player. If the player picks up one stone tile, the player places the picked tile in front and puts the stone tile back into the bag. 2) Combine two or three tiles placed in front of the player using Multiply and put the old and new tiles back into the bag. 3) Create Rainbow ore from the target card. Using two or three tiles placed in front of the player multiplies any number of the target cards. Players can use those two or three tiles to create rainbow ore by having the player put the tile used to create it back into the bag. Then put the target card in front of the player and put the number of stone tiles specified in the target card into another player's bag. (will give stone tiles all with one player or distributed to multiple other players) and then open a new target card to replace it.&#10;&#10;There are two conditions to ending the game, either 1) the player generates eight rainbow ore or 2) the player collects four target cards. When one of the players meets the condition, play that round as the last round and count rainbow ore number. The player with the most number of rainbow ore is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

After years of intensive, secret research, edible species from Aotearoa and all over the world finally flourish year-round in the Valley, a forager's paradise in a climate-controlled biodome.&#10;&#10;You are a Cottager, leading your team of Gatherers to forage for harvest goods, learn your craft from local Artisans, and craft the best recipes to sell to your customers. Move around the modular hex tile Valley, choosing from actions to harvest, make recipes, visit Artisans, complete Goals, and get those sales. Choose recipes from a river of cards that include good and bad event cards - play the standard game or add the Spice cards for increased complexity - but take care, as every card drawn can precipitate Nightfall, the end of the day, where the board resets, the overnight growth cycle restocks the resource tiles, and all Gatherers return to the Cottage with their laden baskets.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the Recipe cards run out and the final Night falls. After you have added your Goal points to your recipe card values, the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Valley is very flexible - with 2 to 6 players, and gameplay from 20 minutes to several hours, you can play a quick game by ending the game on the first or second Nightfall card, or play with up to 6 rounds, each ending in a Night. You can also control the complexity by adding in Spicy Recipes, Event cards, Goals, and by using your Cottager abilities.&#10;&#10;The Valley is set in New Zealand, so it also features recipe ingredients and cultural terms which only apply in Aotearoa. While these are covered briefly in the Glossary, we encourage you to jump down that rabbithole and learn more about this beautiful country!&#10;&#10;",

The cards are arranged in the following order: adjective, noun, verb, noun, adverb. On the first card, more are placed, changing the sentence. The meaning of the sentence does not matter, what counts is the markings (numbers) on the cards. The resulting sentences are fun, but just an extra dose. Some cards also have additional functions that make the game easier for their owner or make it difficult for opponents. When someone dominates the sentence with his sign, he wins and the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

Each game takes 15-30 minutes on average and you win by being the first to capture 5 of your opponent's pieces or locking them out of the game.&#10;&#10;Each player places a combination of 5 archetype pieces on the board (each archetype uses 2d6 in a specific way). Some pieces capture by landing on enemy pieces while others capture at a distance and some even stun and drag enemy pieces.&#10;&#10;Every turn follows the same rhythm of a player declaring which piece they intend to use, rolling the dice if appropriate, and then applying that die value to the pieces they selected in order to dominate their opponents or mitigate their risk depending on how the dice came up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This format of Sabacc is sold exclusively aboard the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser at Disney's Hollywood Studios.  It uses different components and slightly different rules than the version sold in Blackspire Outpost. Like &quot;Corellian Spike&quot; Sabaac, the deck includes 30 green positive cards with values of 1 through 10 (3 each), 30 red negative cards with values of -1 through -10 (3 each), and two black cards with values of 0.  However, unlike that version, there are also two custom dice, one which shows suits (square, circle, triangle) and one which shows a number value (0,0,5,-5,10,-10).&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to score as close as possible to the number rolled on the gold die.  The silver suit die is used as a tie breaker if two players have the same value.  Suit values are per card, so two triangle cards would be two triangles, no matter what the value of the card shows.&#10;&#10;Once the dealer has rolled the dice, he deals five cards to each player.  Players then calculate their hands, and save as many cards as they would like face down.   Then the &quot;Shift&quot; phase occurs, which allows players to get new cards for cards they did not save, returning their hands to 5 cards.  The &quot;Improve&quot; step is adding newly acquired cards to their face down saved cards pile, if they wish.  The improve cards may alternatively be discarded.  Finally, players &quot;Reveal&quot; their face down cards to see who came closest to the dice value goal.&#10;&#10;Betting chips are not included in the game, but a round of betting after the deal, &quot;Shift&quot; and &quot;Improve&quot; phases is assumed.  This is also how game play works in the electronic Sabacc table version you can play in the Sublight Lounge on the Galactic Starcruiser. Once all players have had a chance to deal, the game ends and the player with the most betting chips wins.&#10;&#10;&quot;Coruscant Shift&quot; has also removed the hand ranking complexity of &quot;Corellian Spike&quot;.  If two or more players have equal hands, even after the suits tie breaker, players split the pot.&#10;&#10;There is also a Sabacc: Bounty Hunt variant included in the rules, which is similar to Go Fish for younger children.&#10;&#10;",

To investigate, nothing more simple. Take a card to take a closer look. An item intrigues you? Flip the card over and find out what is this little paper on the bedside table.&#10;&#10;An address? You can now take the card that corresponds to this track. Unless another element on the crime scene appeals you even more ?&#10;&#10;In Crime Zoom, you will conduct your investigation freely. Discuss between players to choose the tracks to follow. And as soon as you think you have solved the case, go to the questionnaire. Who is guilty ? What is his mobile ? What is the murder weapon ? And some subsidiary questions, of course.&#10;&#10;Do not miss the culprit otherwise you will lose the game. But if you answer the questions correctly, the number of cards you will not reveal will decide you.&#10;&#10;The solution will answer each of the questions. The epilogue will come to tell all this in a story or a testimony history to understand the plot that has been played.&#10;&#10;Crime Zoom: Fen&ecirc;tre sur crimes is the fifth case of the Crime Zoom family. It brings you in a residence in Los Angeles in 1954. This case is a tribute to Hitchcock famous movie Fen&ecirc;tre sur cour (Rear Window).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Answer questions, think carefully about the territories you want to conquer and learn while you prove that you are the best in World Challenge Game.&#10; Choose one of two game modes:&#10;&#10;- Conqueror, where you conquer as many countries as possible before the end of the game or Raid, where you attack and win the countries conquered by other players to take over the entire continent. In this mode you can conquer a country that another player has won.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player will take a card and choose one of the two existing questions, which they must read aloud, along with the four answers. The other participants will write on their card the answer which they consider correct, marking an &quot;X&quot; in the options A, B, C or D. When everyone has answered the question, the answers will be revealed, starting with the player to the left of the one who read the question. If the answer is correct, the player can place a conquest token in an available border country and the same for the rest of the players.&#10;&#10;The Conqueror game will automatically end once the last country on the continent is conquered. At that time, the countries that each player has conquered will be counted, so the player with the most countries conquered will be the winner of the game. If there are two or more players who have the same maximum number of conquered countries, questions will be read to them as a tiebreaker. Players who cannot answer the question lose.&#10;&#10;- The Attack game will end when there is only one player left on the continent and they will be crowned the winner. If the question cards run out, the game would end and the one with the most countries would win. There is also the option in case you want to continue the game, you can use the questions available in the APP, choosing the &quot;Board game questions&quot; section.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
