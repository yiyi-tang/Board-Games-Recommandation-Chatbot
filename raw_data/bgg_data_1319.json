    "Description": "Omny is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (cells) of a finite, initially empty patch of a hexagonal tiling (board). Before the game starts, some cells on the board are designated as star cells.&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty cell. You win by making a group of your color such that none of its cuts include more than half of the star cells on the board. A group is a set of interconnected stones of the same color. A cut of a group is a set of interconnected cells (empty or occupied by either color) including no stones in that group.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Komi and pie ruleKomi or the pie rule (or both) can be used in order to make the game fair.&#10;&#10;The pie rule gives White the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;Komi is either a whole number or a whole number plus 0.5. When komi is used, Black wins by making a black group such that none of its cuts include more than half of the star cells on the board minus komi, and White wins by making a white group such that none of its cuts include more than half of the star cells on the board plus komi. Komi works best when the number of star cells is fairly large.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games. When komi and the pie rule are used together, Black on their first turn chooses komi and places a black stone on the board, and then White has the option to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesRaces (but not draws) are possible when the sum of the number of star cells and twice the value of komi is an even number.&#10;&#10;Different board shapes and star cell configurations result in different games:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sunder: The perimeter of the board is a regular hexagon. All cells on the board are star cells.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Y: The perimeter of the board is an equilateral triangle. The three corner cells of the board are star cells.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Gyre: The perimeter of the board is a regular hexagon. The center cell and all perimeter cells are star cells.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Free Y: The perimeter of the board is an irregular hexagon with an odd number of cells. All perimeter cells are star cells.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Enemies such as Dutch, French and Spanish ships will stand in your way, alongside the most famous pirates ever to sail the seas.&#10;&#10;The aim is simple! Destroy all of those in the way and make it back still afloat.  Management of HP and ammunition will be key towards the decisions needed to be made on the way.&#10;&#10;There are 5 journeys in total in the single player (3 in the two player), and your level of success will depend on the amount of foes you defeat whilst completing those journeys.  On each journey there are 7 positions, at each position you draw a card.  This card is most likely to be one of your enemies to defeat.  Do this by deciding how much ammunition you want to shoot with and rolling for success.  If they aren't sunk already your enemies will fight back! This happens at each position of the journey until you complete the 7th step.  If you are still in one piece then you have been successful.  The game ends when all of the journey are completed and you have made it back alive.  How do you win?  Firstly, a basic win is that you have been able to get through the journeys and made them all home successfully.  On top of that you may be in for recognition, depending on how many foes you have defeated, especially those pirates lurking in your way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

These are Dream cards that they will be trying to hide from their diver, Dive cards that will define their methods of interpreting their subject's cards, and Lucid cards which will shape their overall strategy.&#10;&#10;Each player plays as a Diver, trying to find their Subject&rsquo;s valuable cards, and a Subject, trying to hide their valuable cards from a Diver.&#10;&#10;Lucid is meant to give all the fun and stimulation of a drafting + deck-builder, in far less time, and with all the sneaky clever moments of a bluffing game.&#10;&#10;Quick Rules Overview:&#10;&#10;Lucid has 3 card types. Every 12-card deck contains 4 cards of each type. &#10;Dreams - These are the cards you try to hide from your diver. &#10;Dives - These are the cards you use to interpret your opponent&rsquo;s cards, generally searching for dreams.&#10;Lucids - These cards give you a specific bonus while active, and can be resolved for a larger bonus when replaced by another lucid.&#10;&#10;Every round each player will:&#10;&#10;Draw 3 cards&#10;&#10;Prepare 3 cards:&#10;Place 3 cards in front of you face-down, in 3 positions. Outer, Middle, and Inner.&#10;&#10;Interpret one of their subject&rsquo;s cards:&#10;Your subject is the player to your left. You interpret one of their cards by flipping it face-up. You can do this by choosing any one of their 3 prepared cards, or by flipping up and following the instructions of a Dive card that you have prepared. Interpreting a card gives you resources and buries the card, disrupting your subject&rsquo;s plans. &#10;When you interpret a card, you will receive a bonus based on which position it was in.&#10;&#10;Swap Lucids:&#10;If you prepared a Lucid and your Diver did not find it, you can resolve your current active Lucid and replace it with the new one you prepared. You can also resolve your active Lucid and not replace it.&#10;&#10;Have a Dream:&#10;If you prepared a Dream and your Diver did not find it, you can reveal the Dream and do its effect.&#10;&#10;Clean up:&#10;Bury all prepared cards that are still face down and pass the first player token. If a player has 30 Insight, the game ends and the player with the most insight wins.&#10;&#10;(View the full rulebook on the Lucid Website)&#10;&#10;",

You must navigate through the colony to find and modify the coordinates of the Teleport Pad to escape. All of the remaining survivors must escape before the teleport pads are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into 3 simple phases. The first phase is the action phase. During this phase, you must do two of the following:&#10;&#10;1- Reveal: this is when you reveal tiles based on the number of doors your current room contains. &#10;2- Move: Move your survivor to an orthogonally adjacent tile. &#10;3- Unlock: unlock any temporarily locked tiles. &#10;4- Rest: discard 1 tile to rest. You will not have the chance to do a second action.&#10;&#10;The second phase is the enemy movement phase. Move the stalkers 1 space (orthogonally) towards the nearest player.&#10;&#10;The third phase is the lockdown phase. Discard any temporarily locked tiles from the game board.&#10;&#10;The game ends when:&#10;A- All the survivors escape together&#10;B- You discard all of the Console tiles without modifying all of the coordinates &#10;C- You discard all of the Teleport Pad tiles. &#10;D- You run out of tiles to place.&#10;&#10;",

So, players know they have to have a trading post with silver to be allowed to develop the banking system. But you need to first find silver before you can create a trading post. &#10;There will be an optional rule that heavily favors the powers who have well developed their fleet. So, players quickly need to find and explore wood and wool to develop their fleet.&#10;&#10;This expansion brings a lot of variety and fun to the three games of the series.

Simply find the funniest excuses to get out of life&rsquo;s most mundane moments. It&rsquo;s really that simple. JOMO is a card game like Cards Against Humanity. Only you&rsquo;re tasked with providing funny, obscene or downright offensive excuses.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt 10 excuse cards each. They then take turns to draw a scenario card. Scenario cards contain the first part of a sentence, like this: &quot;Sorry, I can't hear any more stories about your children...&quot; Players then have to submit the funniest/rudest/most offensive excuse to get out of that situation. That might be something like this: &quot;Sorry, I can't hear any more stories about your children... I trusted a fart and now I'm at DEFCON brown.&quot; The player that's deemed to have submitted the best card gets to keep the scenario card as a way of keeping score. The winner is the first player to get to 10 scenario cards.&#10;&#10;So, whether you&rsquo;re after something new for a games night or looking for the perfect drinking game at your next house party, this one is sure to induce fits of semi-nervous laughter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Time is the bane of all kings. Always does it march forward, bringing change and challenges, wars and disasters, invaders and internal rebellion.&#10;&#10;This supplement for Oathmark: Battles of the Lost Age, focuses on the passage of time and its effect on a players kingdom. While wars and battle still determine their ultimate fate, many other events can affect the armies of a kingdom. Plagues and blights can reduce access to soldiers from specific territories. Attempted coups can cost a king some of his best generals. On the other hand, unexpected alliances might give a kingdom access to unusual troops, or the birth of a new heir might bring wondrous presents.&#10;&#10;Along with the rules for the passing of years, this book also presents the option to train your units to fight in special formations, such as phalanxes, shield walls, and skirmish lines. These will allow players to use their existing armies to try out new strategies and tactics to swing their battle in their favour. &#10;This book also includes several new military expeditions, including numerous scenarios, to once again challenge a player's generalship.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Mini Containers all players simultaneously have the cleaning jitters and a clean-up rage. The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand (trash). The main difficulty is that you will need to separate your waste and the different waste containers will not have enough room for all the players.&#10;&#10;Mini Containers is a push your luck game with a small deck building element. Each round all players decide which cards from their hand they put in their mini-deck. You can choose to play it safe and form an exceedingly small deck with cards of which you are sure you can all fit in the available containers. Or you can bring a lot of trash to the containers and take the risk that you will not be able to play all your cards. In turn order each player decides whether to pass or reveal the top card from his mini deck. If there is space in a container of the same type &ndash; the card can be played. But whenever you reveal the top card from your mini-deck and there is no place for it &ndash; you need to take all remaining cards in all player&rsquo;s mini-decks.  Whenever this happens or all players have finished taking turns, a new round starts. This continues until a player manages to lose all his cards, and immediately wins the game.&#10;&#10;Mini Containers is family friendly and quite easy to learn. But the game is incredibly challenging as well. This makes it a perfect game to play with both casual and experienced gamers. The possibility to add different modules ensures a high replayability value. It plays best with 3-6 players but also contains a solid ruleset for a 2-player game and a solo variant.&#10;&#10;",

A cut of a group is a set of mutually adjacent cells (empty or occupied by either color) including no stones in that group.&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate.

When komi is used, Black wins by making a black group such that none of its cuts include more than half of the cells on the board minus komi, and White wins by making a white group such that none of its cuts include more than half of the cells on the board plus komi.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.

    "Description": "For about 1800 years many Roman cities had four-horse chariot races almost daily. They were popular with the rich and poor. There was pageantry, favorite factions (defined by the colors worn by the drivers), and substantial wagering. Table-top chariot races have been popular at board and miniature game conventions for years as well as with a group of friends. Circus Maximus for Miniatures distills the best features of these games, focusing on quick play with rules that include player aids, charts and examples of play, so that players can focus on the action.&#10;&#10;During setup, each player uses a dry-erase marker to track their team on a laminated Driver&rsquo;s Log. A team is defined by the Weight of its Chariot, the Speed and Endurance of its Horses, and the Skill of its Driver. A lighter Chariot and Team is faster, but more easily damaged than a heavy one. Players eventually develop their team preferences, favoring light, speedy chariots with an emphasis on better die rolls, or sturdy Heavy chariots that can dish out damage.&#10;&#10;Each race involves three laps around the track. During a turn, chariots are selected for action by a random pull of a colored d6 (matching the Chariot&rsquo;s color,) then roll 2d6 for movement. The selected team and may choose to move, attack, move, attack again and Block. In addition to avoiding damage caused by opposing teams, a team must not enter corners with too quickly, as disaster lurks. Players record actions and results on every turn. The most used rules and tables are printed on the reverse of the Driver&rsquo;s Log, with additional rules printed on cards for quick event resolution. Each turn is a raucous affair, as nearly every Chariot/Team is passed, attacked, or dodged.&#10;&#10;The game comes complete with a large track (designed to fit 15mm chariot and team miniatures), counters for each of 12 colors of Chariot in all three Weights, and other Counters to keep track of laps, chariot speed. (movement), and the occasional wreck or running driver. The game and it&rsquo;s components fit on a 30 x 96-inch table.  Both unpainted and painted Miniatures are offered as options.&#10;&#10;Big Board Games also offers 15mm miniatures of chariots and four-horse teams typical of the ones used by the Romans.  They are offered as unpainted and unassembled, as well as painted and assembled.&#10;&#10;",

But who will do the housework, put the baby to sleep for the night and who will change the baby?&#10;&#10;Walking Baby is a cooperative board game. The game is set in an eco household, so nappies are changed using colourful washable nappies. You have a long weekend to keep the rooms tidy while also keeping your baby happy. Every day is another challenge, because your baby always wants something different.&#10;&#10;In Walking Baby each player controls a family member: mom, dad, grandma or grandpa. There are 8 rooms of the house where they can move around. And of course, there is the baby who always wants something and makes a lot of mess around the house. The game lasts for 3 days, that's 12 rounds (shifts of the day). In each round new housework tasks appear and the baby has new wishes to be fulfilled to keep up his/her mood.&#10;&#10;Players win if they last until the evening of the 3rd day. But they will lose if the baby starts to cry or the housework overflows.&#10;&#10;Players roll 2 dice simultaneously (starting player also rolls the baby dice). The throw shows the number of action points that can be used to move a character between rooms, perform housework tasks, change nappy, fulfil needs of baby cards or cheer up the baby. Plan your actions because you'll get more tired as evening approaches. Time for a coffee! Use it wisely to gain energy for the night shift.&#10;&#10;Can you cope with even the most chaotic situation?

Each turn all players still in the race will secretly select a card, they'll place it face down on the table. Once all players have made a selection the next card in the deck is turned over and added to the &quot;course&quot; of cards on the table. If there are two of the same boss cards in the course when it's flipped, all remaining players lose a life token (of which they have three) and a new round begins. The game is played over five total rounds. When players choose to retire, they will collect all ring tokens on the course at the time and keep them for end game scoring.&#10;&#10;",

The Indian King has commissioned some of the finest chefs to compete for a chance to cook at Henry&rsquo;s Feast. He has asked his Head Chef to arrange the competition.&#10;&#10;Henry's Feast is a competitive, family friendly, appetizing, cooking board game for the hungry. A balanced but deep strategy game where players are constantly challenged to think ahead and work with limited resources to cook King Henry's favorite dishes.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a personal kitchen in the form of player board that each player will use to cook their dishes. The kitchen also has a pantry with a limited space and can only store so many ingredients. Players are forced to choose between using their stations to start cooking, and therefore, revealing the dishes they want to cook or store them in the pantry for future use. However, the empty space in the pantry will determine how many ingredients you can take in the next round. In the middle of all the players, lies the Stockroom that is quicker to get to, but has a lower probability of finding the ingredients you need. The Market has all the ingredients but is farther and requires more time (an extra round) to utilize.&#10;&#10;The Recipes (50 of them) tell you all the ingredients you need to cook various types of dishes. They can be Easy, Medium or Hard to cook, and also lets you know the course of the dish. The recipes for the Feast create a race to the finish line and determines who ends the game first. But the Chef's Corner will provide you with those extra recipes that will let you get ahead of the competition and win it.&#10;&#10;Not that fast! Winning doesn't come easy and the multitude of strategies come from the Chef's Bonus. Stations, Satchels, Hand Limit and Pantry all give you an extra edge throughout out the game. At higher bonus levels that edge becomes larger but getting the bonuses isn't an easy feat. You will have to choose between when to go for the victory points or when to get the bonuses. They all use the same resources, and maintaining that balance while controlling your heartbeat as someone visits Chef's Corner to steal the recipe you have been working so hard to cook is where Henry's Feast will test your limits.&#10;&#10;On a players turn they will perform one action to take the available ingredients or steal recipes. Using these the player will Cook dishes which will earn them victory points or bonuses. Victory points may also be earned from making combos of dishes or making the most number of dishes.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player cooks all the feast recipes and announces Last Call. This sets up the last round. After the last round is done victory points are counted and the player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For many decades, Bangalore was the Garden City of India, but now it sports a different avatar. With the rise in IT companies all over the city, Bangalore became popular as the Silicon City of India, sometimes also referred to as the start-up capital of India. Ask a local about the Bangalore they remember, and you will be taken on a walk down memory lane of an era gone by: Sprawling green parks filled with trees, beautiful lakes, bustling markets and shopping centers contrast the buzzing business and industrial areas against the solace of cosy residential areas.&#10;&#10;Namma Bengaluru &mdash; or &quot;Our Bengaluru&quot; as translated from the native language Kannada (which is pronounced &quot;Kun&quot; like in &quot;gun&quot; and &quot;nada&quot; like &quot;na-da&quot;) &mdash; is a game inspired by the publisher's hometown of Bangalore, India.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plan and build neighborhoods in the city of Bengaluru. To start, you have a hand of two tiles (with tiles coming in five types) and a neighborhood card that shows a way to score points. On a turn, you either play a tile into the city, matching tile types or roads to do so; swap the tiles in hand for two new ones; draw a neighborhood card; or remove a neighborhood card in hand to place a tile on top of an existing tile. When no tiles remain in the draw pile, each player takes a final turn, then reveals their neighborhood cards, scoring for each pattern of tiles in the city that matches what's shown on their card; some cards provide bonus points based on your ability to place tiles of the right type next to scoring patterns you have.&#10;&#10;Whoever scores the most points wins, with ties being broken in favor of whoever holds fewer cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players will collect the cards and plays accordingly with an option to build a kind of a combos making the cards more powerful for attack, defense or movement. However, combining these cards will increase the risk level which may end up with some incidents or additional tyre degradation or even a car spin, but with a bit of luck nothing will happen. Dice plays a marginal role in the game and are partially used in quick qualifying session, also to measure Pit Stops, rate the risk consequences and evaluate some incidents. &#10;Like in modern formula cars players have to manage energy recovery system by collecting energy. It&rsquo;s up to players how to use up stored energy as it can be used as additional buffer to keep action cards or to use so-called &lsquo;overtake button' to increase the chances of successful attack/defensive maneuver or just to extend car movement. Each team has different ERS/OT combinations, gear ratios and special team ability simulating different car characteristics.&#10;&#10;Basically players needs to play the action cards in a way to keep the balance between the speed, tyre wear and risk level to move the car on the board and stop at the fastest places on the track keeping up the momentum. That sounds simple but taking into account tyre degradation, tyre compound differences, ERS management, different car characteristics, battling opponents for position and random racing incidents it gives a real challenge to keep the pace and win the race &hellip; but if you will take right decisions, you will race smart with a bit of a luck you will become a FormulaGP world champion!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The majority of other game systems use a more abstract method where one unit actually represents several, or where entire units are modelled on a single base and dealt with as a whole. We found that our method provides a more accurate and realistic impression of real warfare.&#10;&#10;By focusing our game on realism we have found that real-world tactics work just as well on the tabletop and we highly recommend reading the fantastic range of WWII tactics books published by Osprey.&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence:&#10;&#10;     Check Universal Morale&#10;     Resolve Battlefield Effects&#10;     Movement Phase&#10;     Firing Phase&#10;     Close Assault Phase&#10;     Re-organisation Phase&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The initiative phase determines which play goes first during the Action phase.

Once one player completes the action phase, then it is the next player's turn.  The final step is to reinforce for the next round.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on getting the right dice roll combination to implement your strategy to achieve victory. However, it won't be easy because your opponent is doing the same and taking steps to counteract your plan.  Do you have the skill and luck to defeat your opponent? Or will they outwit you and claim victory?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Diamond Heist is a compact 2-4 player strategic dice-rolling game about stealing diamonds, with a cast of unique characters, each with interesting abilities. Diamond Heist features fun art, a relaxing theme, and elegant gameplay all packaged together for decades of family fun.&#10;&#10;The game starts by selecting one of the many unique characters. Each turn, players roll dice, and must decide whether they want to lock in their arsenal of guns, knives, bulletproof vests, pickpocket action, or take a chance and re-roll. Vests block guns, and helmets block knives. Each unblocked attack allows the player to steal a diamond from the opposing player. To add additional strategy, players must balance doing direct damage, and building up cash reserves. Cash can be spent on each player's character ability, which ranges from stealing mass amounts of diamonds, to blocking certain damage types, to swapping 2 players' dice.&#10;&#10;Players can save up if they roll Bonus Cash, to spend on their character speciality. Players must balance short term and long term rewards for building up cash. Then, players battle it out with their selected arsenal, stealing as many diamonds and as much cash as they can.&#10;&#10;Diamond Heist relies on easy to learn, but hard to master strategies with a cast of interesting characters to keep gameplay fresh. Manage your strategy with 4 competing players, to be able to steal diamonds when they are vulnerable.&#10;&#10;Diamond Heist keeps things new, fun and challenging by including a selection of 18 different characters. Combinations of these creates numerous matchup possibilities, each with their own strategy to consider.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are a lot of things to pay attention to.  You must make decisions whether you will keep a guaranteed dice roll, or risk it to try to get something better. Players will need to weigh whether they want to steal cash to use their special abilities, or steal diamonds to add to their Offshore Accounts. Another tough decision will be whether to spend your cash for short term gains, or save up for a larger impact special ability. In 3 and 4 player games, you may need to team up and form alliances with other players, while making sure you have enough defenses such that you don&rsquo;t get backstabbed yourself!&#10;&#10;",

For these activities the Justice Department has formed an undercover division known informally in the Department as the &lsquo;Wally Squad&rsquo;. These Judges adopt civilian garb and move amongst the street life of Mega&#226;&#128;&#144;City One always on the lookout for leads on criminal activity. If required, they will infiltrate gangs and criminal organisations on highly dangerous undercover missions. Activities like these are abhorrent to most Street Judges who tend to view their Wally Squad colleagues as necessary &lsquo;oddballs&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Whilst some undercover operations can be concluded in a short time, dedicated squad members have been known to spend years on a case, all the time maintaining a false identity. There is a danger in such deep cover that some Wally Squad members, such as the infamous Lenny Zero, have had their outlook and life values completely changed. Their beliefs have been sequestered by the roles they are playing, and many have &lsquo;gone rogue&rsquo; working out of sight, but not out of mind, of the Justice Department. A Judge gone rogue can become the most dangerous of criminals.&#10;&#10;Here we present three of the most infamous members of the Wally Squad.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Dirty Frank: Originally a respected Street Judge, Frank now appears to be a deeply unhygienic lunatic living in &lsquo;Low Life&rsquo;, the Mega-City One&rsquo;s most crime-ridden area.&#10;     Jack Point: A deep cover Wally Squad Judge, Jack is a follower of the Church of Simpology. Despite this, Jack is an effective and dangerous operative.&#10;     Aimee Nixon: An &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade cadet, Nixon joined the Wally Squad and was mentored by Dirty Frank.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
