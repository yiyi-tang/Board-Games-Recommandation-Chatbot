Combine certain warriors with the right support cards to score big bonuses. Strengthen your warrior with cards like the Sword of Laban, Fortress, Liahona, or Prophesy. Even other warriors can be combined to strengthen your warrior and expand the kinds of support cards he can use! But when the call to battle is raised, watch out so you won't be caught off-guard by your opponent's warrior armed with Assassination, Dissenters, Ambush, or Secret Combination cards. You may have won that round, but you never know what challenge you'll face next with the Warriors of the Promised Land.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.bookofmormonbattles.com/&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An update to the original Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition (1981).&#10;&#10;While the core of Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition is still found in the 25th Anniversary Edition, there are a few differences from the original board game.  The original six categories are still used: geography, entertainment, history, art &amp; literature, science &amp; nature, sport &amp; leisure.  Each category now has its own card, with six questions and three difficulty levels.  What you roll determines the level of difficulty of the question.  A roll of one or two results in an easy question, three or four a medium question, and five or six a hard question.  Play in the middle of the board is just like the 1981 version where you roll the die, move your scoring token that number of spaces, and try to answer a question in an attempt to roll again or, in a special case, win a wedge of the corresponding color.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is still to win all 6 wedges and answer one final question in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The biggest difference of this new version is the addition of an outside track, which you move a 2nd playing piece, a pawn of the same color, around.  If you get a question correct, you get to move your pawn a certain number of spaces depending on the difficulty of the question answered.  If your pawn lands in one of the four &quot;specialty zones&quot;, you are granted a special power used either to help your chances to win the game or hurt your opponents.  These zones are the Face-Off Zone, the Slow it Down Zone, The Easy Cheesy Zone, and Freebie Zone.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of a hand, if there are still two or more players left for the showdown, the top card from the draw pile is turned face-up. 60% of the cards have a hidden message on the face of the card. By tipping the card back and forth in the light, a particular card or hand will be revealed in the varnish of the card. The named card or hand (if any) is dead and out of play.&#10;&#10;For instance, if the King of Spades is flipped up, the hand with the low spade is dead. If a seven is flipped, all Wild cards are dead.&#10;&#10;Even with its unique twist, Dead Hand is primarily a straight-forward game of Poker. The Dead Hand mechanic ends up only effecting approximately 20% of the hands played. So don't use the mechanic as a crutch, you've still got to play good poker.&#10;&#10;That said, you may find that the added element of chance keeps people in the game longer and folding a bit less than they might otherwise. A reference card is included, so you can watch which cards have been played and have a better idea of which hands are more likely to be killed by the Dead Hand.&#10;&#10;",

It ran from London to the West Country &amp; Wales, and was nicknamed God's Wonderful Railway. This game was produced as a 150th anniversary edition by Gibson Games (and re-issued later) and has a jigsaw board showing the rail network and a deck of 80 cards in coloured sets. Players move their tokens around the main lines and branch lines, collecting, swapping and forfeiting cards to get sets. Movement is determined only by the lines and junctions. The rules say the game was inspired by a railwayman Richard Morris, but the board shows copyright Sara Finch &amp; Leslie Scott.&#10;&#10;5,000 copies were made, each with a serial number on the rulebook. A subsequent print run was not numbered and had a few minor changes to the rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The inhabitants of the planet ROLLEX in the Sun system SOLLEX used to live on nothing but the delicious fried dice that fell from the sky. They found these so delicious, that they would often spend years at a time, just sitting in their towers, hardly moving at all, enjoying this delicacy.  Now and then, they would ascend to the top of their towers, and, just for the fun of it, would spit out dice in all directions out over the surrounding lands. As a result, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were known far and wide as the Dicemouths.&#10;&#10;However, one day the rain of fried dice dried up, and the Dicemouths got extremely hungry.  But they remembered all the dice that they&rsquo;d spat out in the older, better, times.  Looking around, they found that many of them had developed into full grown dice trees, covered in fresh ripe fried dice.  But when the dicemouths tried to leave their towers to pick the dice, they found that they&rsquo;d got so fat that they couldn&rsquo;t get out through the doors.  They were trapped in their own towers.&#10;&#10;But just before it was too late, one of the dicemouths, who&rsquo;d saved a few dice in his tower, had a brilliant idea.  He spat out a die, just as they had always done, but this time, as the die shot out from the tower, he kept tight hold of it, and he and his tower were dragged along behind the flying die.  In this way, he managed to reach the dice trees, picked their fruit, and passed them on to all his friends, saving the race of dicemouths.&#10;&#10;Soon, all the dicemouths were able to travel this way.  And they developed a race, held every year, a dice tower race.  And nowadays, every year, the winner of the race is crowned as King of the Dicemouths.&#10;&#10;",

He can add towns and abbeys to his belongings, and also build ports, markets and walls on his towns. Each castle, town, abbey, market and port is worth a money card each turn, but only one per turn can go safely into the castle: the others must be kept in towns and abbeys. Towns can be pillaged and abbeys can change ownership thanks to the action cards: militia, catapults, saracene pirates and bishops.&#10;The goal is to reach a certain amount of money, but every turn the choice is between keeping it or spending it to get more action and building cards.&#10;The drawings are by Valeria De Caterini, an Italian artist and writer of children books.&#10;&#10;",

There are 7 people on board: The Captain himself, the captain&rsquo;s close friend Albert, the Digger who will dig for the treasures, the Gunner who will keep the natives at an arm&rsquo;s reach from the adventurers, the untrustworthy Boatsman, and, of course, two Mutineers who are just waiting for the right moment to seize command of the ship.&#10;Every time the ship reaches a new island, the Captain must choose one other crew member to take with him ashore to find treasures. The others must stay behind and look after the ship.&#10;&#10;The Captain, however, is a very old and senile man. His eyesight is bad, and on top of that, it is a very dark and foggy night. So it is very difficult for him to know who is who among the crew members. To get ashore with the Captain, and get a fair (?) share of the treasures, the crew members are willing to do whatever it takes to fool the poor Captain: Including lying, tricking and conspiring.&#10;&#10;",

Death is a scary thing indeed.  The only board game with ghost-appeal.&#10;&#10;Ghosts aren&rsquo;t real, right?  Time for some actual hands-on education on the subject.  Every neighborhood has one, you know, that old abandoned mansion down the lane that you dared each other to step inside and explore.  Well, now your little party gets to spend the entire night or better yet SURVIVE the night on the inside.  You see, this particular abode has a little something special for the newly initiated ghost-hunter.  The catch?  This one actually IS haunted, and by none other than old man Alabaster, RIP.  He&rsquo;s a playful spirit now, well, most of the time, but has been known to possesses your dice and toy with you like his own personal plaything.  Can you survive both your friends AND Alabaster, and walk out again the next morning?  Alive is much preferable to worm food.&#10;&#10;So pick up those possessed dice, change them as you see fit, put on your Big Kid Pants, say Boo! with creative drama, pick on the living Bully, and pray to be Resurrected by your friendly neighborhood Ghost. You also argue with the living, make alliances as quickly as you break them, and finagle your way to not being six feet under. This is the hectic, fun-filled world of FRIGHT, where no one is ever completely out of the game, and Ghosts have a way of exacting revenge on those that made them.&#10;&#10;Each player gets their own tombstone with 5 scare tokens and a dice. Each round consists of a dice phase and a scare phase. The dice determine who gets to scare, but cards can change the dice. When players are scared, they must remove a scare token and players &ldquo;die&rdquo; when all of their tokens have been removed. The last player alive wins.&#10;&#10;Even when players die, they can still play cards to affect the outcome of the dice round.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever is first in collecting three heart points wins the game. However, bad letters penalize the players with broken heart tokens.

    "Description": "In the strategic game Sparta, set in 228 B.C., you will relive the fascinating experience of skillful Spartan and Achaean warriors. Will Sparta seize power, or will the Achaeans maintain their stance?&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 10x10 grid. Each player starts with a row of eight fighters on their side of the board. In the middle rows of the board, there are eight cities; each player owns four of these.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player may move one of their fighters up to two squares in any direction, changing direction between the moves if so desired.&#10;&#10;If the fighter ends its turn in one of his own cities, he is promoted to a hero, and may move up to three squares on future turns.&#10;&#10;If the fighter ends its turn on an opposing city, the city is conquered; it now belongs to the player that conquered it.&#10;&#10;If, after the move, there are pieces trapped in between two opposing pieces, they are captured and removed from the board. Pieces are trapped if they are between pieces of the other side along a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row without a vacant square in between.&#10;&#10;The game ends if one of the following happens:&#10;&#10;    One player owns all cities. That player wins the game.&#10;    One player has only one piece left on the board. His opponent wins the game.&#10;    Both players have only one or two pieces left on the board. The player with the most cities wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cat Attack, suitable for two to six players, aged 8 years and over and made entirely in the EU. The game has been designed with the fun strategy player in mind. Playing time 40 - 180+ mins depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game Cat Attack is based on the trials and tribulations of the domestic cat. The board represents a local neighborhood. Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car. A Curiosity card is picked up when a cat lands on a Curiosity square. Some of these cards are good news but you know what happened to the curious cat!&#10;&#10;",

You should not shy away from stealing your rival captain's crew or treasure points and gaining the upper hand while hiring crew members. Only the captain who is clever and combines cards with foresight will set sail as one of the most infamous of pirates. Once you have hired your crew it's time to say &quot;All Hands On Deck&quot; and you are ready to gather valuable treasure points.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Each player has got a deck of cards in front of him or her, but during the game players can draw from any deck. At the beginning of a turn players each draw 3 cards without looking at them. Then a player counts down from 3 and all players start looking at their hand, then putting one card aside and the rest on the deck in front of them. The first player to do so is going to be the next first player and will start drawing cards at the beginning of the next turn. The card you have put aside is your hidden crew. As soon as you have got a combination of 2 or more cards in your hidden crew you can shout &quot;All Hands On Deck&quot; and play one set of cards for an effect and the treasure points they are worth. Afterwards the next turn starts with the new first player.&#10;When all cards are gone, the game is over and the pirate with the most treasure points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "HEROOJ (heroes, in esperanto language) is an abstract board game for 2 players, which can be played on an 8x8 board, with 10 pawns (double-sided pieces) and 4 masters for each player. You can use a set of checker-like pieces or poker chips, with a mark on its bottom side to recognize promoted pawns or &quot;Herooj&quot;. For the Masters, you can use 4 pawns from a chess set, or any other 4 pieces of your election.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10; PAWNS: A pawn can move 1 or 2 cells orthogonally or diagonally forward, (backwards and sideways moves are not allowed for pawns).&#10;they can capture by jumping orthogonally (in straight line) over an adjacent friendly piece and falling on an inmediately adjacent enemy piece, which is removed from the board, (backwards and sideways captures are allowed, but not diagonal captures).&#10;&#10;MASTERS: A master can move 1 or 2 cells in any direction, orthogonally or diagonally forward and backwards. Also, it can capture in the same way of pawns (jumping over an adjacent friendly piece and falling on an inmediately adjacent enemy piece) but in any of 8 directions (including diagonals).&#10;&#10;HEROOJ: When a pawn reaches the far rank of the board is promoted to &quot;heroo&quot;. It can move sideways and backwards (orthogonally and diagonally), but NOT FORWARD. It captures like pawns.&#10;&#10;GOAL: The goal of HEROOJ is bringing back one heroo to the player's safe zone (2 first rows of the player's side).&#10;A player can also win if he eliminates all the opponent's pawns/herooj.&#10;&#10;",

Each time someone rolls that station on the game die, you get one card for each of the stations you have built for that resource.&#10;&#10;To add extra strategies to the game, there are mission cards. Peaceful mission cards will allow you to play peacefully and get ahead by building your own colony and acquiring more resources.

    "Description": "In Cultists of Cthulhu, you play as a student or professor at Miskatonic University, working with your friends to investigate the horrors invading your school. Unbeknownst to the rest of you, one of your friends is secretly a Cultist, eager to sacrifice the rest of you to their dark master.&#10;&#10;The Academics must work together to accomplish the goals of the scenario before the stars align and the Cultist is able to pull off their scheme, reveal themselves, and summon a Shoggoth, a flight of Night Gaunts, or reveal themselves to have been a Mi-Go the whole time, to pick three example Cultists from a single scenario, the Fungi from Yuggoth.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, consisting of each player taking a turn, and then one University Phase. On a turn, a player draws an Event card related to their location, resolves it using a push-your-luck ability check mechanic which forces them to make trade offs between personal harm or harm to the group, and then takes two Actions: Move, Fight, Search, Steal, Trade, Use an Item, or a Scenario specific event. The University Phase consist of moving any monsters that may be on the board, followed by the starting player drawing two University cards, selecting one to play and one to shuffle back into the deck without revealing. These cards are all bad for the Academics, but in different ways and to different degrees, so this is another opportunity for the Cultist to secretly advance their own agenda. The starting player then passes the Starting Player token to their left and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The Academic players are trying to complete their Scenario specific goals before the Cultist kills them. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth scenario, the Academic goals are: A1: assemble a complete Elder Sign, A2: take it to Chapel, B1: find the Necronomicon in the Vault or Library, B2: use it as described on its card. Players gain Elder Sign pieces by successfully completing Events, by searching, or by making them in the Art Department with a Finesse check. Players look for the Necronomicon in the Library with Reason checks, or the Vault with Focus checks. Events also have a chance of advancing the Star Chartz The Academics win if they complete their goals before the last of them is killed, the Cultist wins if they kill all of the Academics. When the Star Chart reaches a certain number, the Cultist may reveal themselves to gain some horrid benefit. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth, all players know that the Cultist is trying to get the Star Chart to either 15 so they can reveal themselves to be a Mi-Go in a human costume, or 20 so they can summon a trio of Night Gaunts, or 25 so they can summon a Shoggoth. All players know these are the options, but only the Cultist knows which one they are actually trying to do.&#10;&#10;Cultists of Cthulhu is a big-box, semicooperative, thematic game of mystery, investigation, teamwork, and betrayal. The board is modular, and assembled at the beginning of each game in a rapid-fire, real-time setup. With this very fast, unique map setup, 12 characters, 4 different scenarios, each with multiple possible hidden Cultist goals, Cultists of Cthulhu provides near infinite diversity and replayability.&#10;&#10;Featuring an ability check mechanism using custom dice which allows for meaningful decisions every turn, an innovative combat system, dark, suspenseful art, and gripping theme music, Cultists of Cthulhu has been called &quot;possibly the next Arkham Horror.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each researcher gets 2 actions per turn, which they can use to do any of the above in any combination.&#10;&#10;In each game of Molecular, researchers (players) define a 'deadline' which is the number of turns each researcher gets before the game ends. At the end of the game, points are counted and the researcher with the highest score wins! Points are scored by creating new bonds, scoring Functional Group cards, and in some other ways through use of the Effector cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Santa Timea is a card game that consists of steering cards and ship cards. There are 5 ship cards for each wind direction (north, east, south, west) with the values 3, 2, 2, 1, 1. Each game is played for 12 rounds and in every round one ship card can be 'won' by playing steering cards: Steering cards of the same wind direction as the current ship card count with their full value of points, cards with a wind direction perpendicular to that on the current ship card count with half their value and cards of the opposite wind direction count as zero points. The player who played the lowest point value gets the ship card. After 12 rounds, the player with the LEAST total of points on his collected ship cards scores the most victory points (depending on the number of players). There are, however, several possibilities to score extra victory points for certain combinations of ship cards. Thus, collecting ship cards may also be a good thing if a player can obtain the right combinations.&#10;&#10;",

The other players simply move a pawn on the board and are awarded points by the priestess based on how their actions (including seemingly irrelevant ones like body movement or tone of voice) correspond with the rules. At the end of a round the priestess receives the same score as the highest-scoring adept, encouraging her to make the rules difficult but not impossible to guess.&#10;&#10;",

When the fires of the revolution died down, a political game began to establish the only proper totalitarian regime. The players take the roles of animal dictators who will stop at nothing to gain absolute power over the global Farm.&#10;&#10;1984: Animal Farm is a negotiation game for 3 to 5 players that's based on the concept of forced cooperation. On one hand, players share some business with their neighbors; on the other hand, they are divided by the will to win. The game favors efficient strategy, slick negotiations, and successful bluffing. At the same time, it forces the players to form temporary alliances with their enemies and keep an eye on their friends. All this makes each round of the game abound in heated talks (both public and secret), pacts, promises, and betrayals. Special abilities drawn before the game, along with the winning conditions, guarantee that no two games will be the same.&#10;&#10;&quot;Remember, fellow revolutionaries: All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NEW RULES, BETTER GAME PLAY!&#10;&#10;Bag-O-Loot wss first introduced in 2010 as a rummy type game where players steal sets from each other and a completed set (5 matching cards) made a Bag-O-Loot. It was met with mild success with just over 15,000 copies sold. It did, however, have three basic issues:&#10;&#10;1. Hoarding: players were not required to make a play during their turn so it was possible to just collect dozens of cards then try to play them all at once. Although not a winning strategy it did kind of take the fun out of the game when someone did this.&#10;2. Two Players: The game was always best with four players. Although you could play with two people it wasn't much fun.&#10;3. Bluffing: It turns out that while some people loved the bluffing element, the majority did not care for that part.&#10;&#10;NOW BETTER THAN EVER!&#10;&#10;With the release of the Ten Year Anniversary Edition, all three of these issues are fixed. You can't hoard, playing with two players is definetly fun, and bluffing is now listed as an &quot;Advanced Play Option&quot; not part of the regular rules. As a bonus, the game is also fun with more than four people which was not even possible in the original release.&#10;&#10;GIVE IT A TRY!&#10;&#10;So if you have never played Bag-O-Loot before or if you played the original version get a copy of the new rules and see what you think!&#10;&#10;",

Your mission is to have your character accumulate supplies like food, fuel, weapons, and medical kits, as well as scout locations that may serve as a haven in which to start over. Originally tailored to survival enthusiasts that wanted a real survival scenario (no zombies).&#10;&#10;You start off in once-peaceful center city, now controlled by raiders out to get what you have. There are plenty of resources out there, but you have to get to them and survive various encounters and attacks to reach towns that have potential as safe havens. You&rsquo;ll have to plan your route to include spots that have the assets you&rsquo;ll need to stockpile. Some of these spots are controlled by raiders, and you&rsquo;ll have to survive attacks to gain the items you need.&#10;&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve scouted locations, you&rsquo;ll have to return to center city for your family and more supplies.  You then pick a location as your final destination. If you can get there with the required supplies and survivors before anyone else, you win the game.&#10;&#10;The game dynamic revolves around the management of assets while you are traveling to your destinations. You'll be tempted to use them to gain an edge in an encounter, but you have to stockpile them to be able to win the game. Different gameplay styles and a unique route traveled in each game, plus game-changing Bonus cards, add variety.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This abstract game cleverly exploits its theme of warring spiders to introduce children to thinking games.  The board represents a web with two nests at opposite ends, and stands up between the players.  Each player uses his side of the board to move his spiders on (three small ones and a large one).  Each spider has two long flexible legs with which it steps over the web; each leg ends in a peg which fits into holes in the web.  The catch is that if you insert your peg in a hole occupied by an opponent's spider, it pushes his peg out.  A spider hanging by only one leg is a &quot;dangler&quot; and is in danger of being pushed off the web altogether (and out of the game) should the opponent push its other leg out.  Re-attaching a dangler uses up one's entire turn.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is either to eliminate all of the opponent's spiders or put a leg in his nest.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you move two different legs, belonging to the same or two different spiders.  The small spiders' leg span confines them to adjacent holes.  The big spider, the Daddy Long Leg, has a greater span and can use holes two spaces apart.  A move consist of detaching a leg, pivoting around the other, and plugging the free leg back in.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dread Draw is a strategy card game of press your luck competitive fortune telling.&#10;&#10;Setting Up a Game:&#10;At the beginning of the game each player is dealt 10 cards face down. These cards form each player&rsquo;s Life Deck. Players can never look at the cards in their Life Deck unless the game or a card effect allows them to.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game:&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. During each round, players take turns in trying to summon cards. A round ends when only one player remains, making that player the winner of that round. A new round then begins.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each eliminated player will take damage, which is represented by discarding cards from their Life Deck. If you are eliminated and have no cards in your Life Deck, then you are defeated and are out of the game. The last player remaining in the game wins!&#10;&#10;The Turn:&#10;The player who was randomly chosen to go first takes the first turn of the opening round. On your turn, you must try to summon a card. Initially, you&rsquo;ll try to summon a card from the Draw Deck, but as the game progresses you might be able to summon cards from your reserves as you accumulate them. To summon a card from the top of the Draw Deck, reveal that card. If its strength is greater than the strength of the last card you summoned, then you&rsquo;ve successfully summoned that card. Place it to the right of the last card you summoned. This is known as Escalating.&#10;&#10;If you summoned the card successfully, you may use any Summon ability that it may have; though using it is entirely optional. If the card&rsquo;s strength is not greater than the last card you summoned, then discard the card you drew from the Draw Deck, and you are eliminated from the round. Discard any other cards you summoned this round.&#10;&#10;After a player summons a card, or fails to summon a card, play passes to the player with the lowest total strength among their summoned cards. If there is a tie, and the current player is one of the tied players, then the current player takes the next turn. Otherwise, play passes to the next player to their left that is tied for lowest. If the Draw Deck runs out of cards, shuffle the cards in the discard pile to make a new Draw Deck.&#10;&#10;Ending the Round:&#10;A round ends when only one player remains in the round. The winning player adds up the damage values of their summoned cards. Each &lsquo;Red dot&rsquo; on a summoned card represents a single damage point. Each opponent takes that much damage, starting with the player to the winner&rsquo;s left, and going around the table. Once each player has taken their damage from their Life Deck, the winner discards their summoned cards and becomes the starting player for the next round.&#10;&#10;The Life Deck:&#10;Whenever you take damage, draw that many cards from your Life Deck and choose one of them to go to your reserves. Discard the other cards.&#10;If you&rsquo;re out of cards while drawing, you are still in the game &mdash; you don&rsquo;t get defeated until you take damage while having no cards in your Life Deck.&#10;&#10;If an ability allows you to gain life, put that many cards from the Draw Deck on top of your Life Deck without looking at them.&#10;&#10;The Reserves:&#10;Whenever you place a card in your reserves, put it next to your Life Deck so you don&rsquo;t confuse it with the cards you summon during the round. If the card has a Reserve ability, you may play it now. Whenever you must summon a card, you may choose to summon one from your reserves instead of revealing a card from the Draw Deck. You can choose any card with strength greater than the last card you summoned this round and put it to the right of that card. If it has a Summon ability, you may play it &mdash; play then passes per the normal rules.&#10;&#10;Abilities:&#10;Most abilities on cards have a keyword that tells you when to play that ability. Playing summon, reserve, and aftermath abilities are always optional. &#10;Summon: Play this when you successfully summon the card.&#10;Reserve: Play this when the card is placed into your reserves, regardless of where it came from.&#10;Aftermath: Play this when you are eliminated from a round or at the end of the round that you won.&#10;&#10;Cards have special abilities that do not fall under any other ability category are considered to be &ldquo;always on,&rdquo; even while they are in your reserves. These abilities are not optional.&#10;&#10;Telling the Fortune:&#10;Once the game is over, if the winner had any cards left in their Life Deck, they use those cards to divine the future. That player shuffles those cards and lays them out, face-up, one at a time. The first card represents the present, the second represents the immediate future, and the rest divine the far future. It&rsquo;s up to the players to interpret what those cards mean.&#10;&#10;",
