    "Description": "A group of mice must navigate a giant pyramid of cheese, racing each other to see who can collect the most before reaching the top. Mice can wiggle through the holes in the cheese to collect even more, but watch out for the cat!&#10;&#10;Having found a lot of holes  in the cheese, the pussy howls: &ldquo;Mice must feel too much at ease, eating up the master&rsquo;s cheese. I will guard it night and day,  shooing naughty mice away!&rdquo; Careful, mice - the cat is sly,  it will hit you &ndash; you will fly. Go running to the top! Keep  the cheese and do not stop! Traps are no threat with cheese, win, do not be scared of these!&#10;&#10;GAME COMPONENTS: &#10;Cheese pyramid &ndash; 1,  &#10;&lsquo;cheese lumps&rsquo; &#10;with holes &ndash; 4, &#10; numbered tokens &ndash; 25, &#10; chips:  wooden mouse &mdash; 4,  &#10;wooden cat &mdash; 1;  &#10;glass balls &ndash; 4, &#10;dice &ndash; 1, &#10; rules &mdash;  1.&#10;&#10;THE PURPOSE OF THE GAME:&#10;To be first to reach the cheese pyramid, and gain as many points as possible!&#10;&#10;THE PROGRESS OF THE GAME&#10; &bull;  The game participants take turns to throw the dice and move the mice game pieces towards the top of the cheese pyramid along the tiers (levels). &bull; The game pieces may only be moved anti-clockwise.    &bull; The movement to each subsequent tier (level) is via four staircases. &bull; Only one game piece may be located in the field. Game pieces may &ldquo;step over&rdquo; each other. If the relevant field is  occupied by another game piece, the player should go to  the free field ahead of it.  &bull; On the fields with symbols the players must comply with their conditions (see the playing field symbols). &bull; When moving or &ldquo;stepping&rdquo; with a game piece over other game pieces the players must hold the marble with a finger of only one hand.&#10;&#10;PLAYING FIELD SYMBOLS &#10;1.  The mouse game piece stopped in the field with this symbol: &bull; If the player does not have the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; of his/her piece of cheese closed, he/she will take one token from the bank, and cover the holes with it blindfold, i. e., without turning the token with the number upwards. &bull; If all the holes are already covered with tokens, the player will make an additional move. &#10;2.  The cat game piece has stopped on this field, so the move is to be made to the player who is next in turn. &bull; If the player&rsquo;s game piece gets onto the field with the cat&rsquo;s symbol, the player will throw the dice and move the cat&rsquo;s game piece by the number of points shown on the dice.  See special cases that may occur during the cat&rsquo;s movement  in VI and VII. &#10;3. If the game piece gets into this field, the marble will fall into the hole and roll down to the other tier (level).  The player will move the mouse game piece to a new field, cover the marble with it again, and take two tokens from the bank and cover the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; on the cheese piece with them.  See special cases in IV and V. NOTE. The trap field will be inactive if all five holes on the cheese piece are closed with tokens. In this case the player will put the mouse game piece near the hole, so as prevent the marble from falling. &#10;4. On the upper tier the Players&rsquo; game pieces will be moving in a circle until one of them (or the cat game piece) stands precisely on the field with a red flag &mdash; the finish field. NOTE. For the smallest kids the game may be finished when the first player reaches or crosses the field with the flag. &bull; Then the players turn their cheese pieces upside down and count the points on the tokens. The one who gains most points will be the winner.  &bull; In the event of two players with equal number of points the one who has reached the finish or is closer to the same will win.&#10;&#10;Developing game &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot; in the form of a dimensional pyramid develops fine motor skills, memory and attention. Gives an idea of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;numbers and scoring. Trains accurate eye. Unique 3D form of the pyramid allows you to play not only in one-dimensional plane but in three-dimensional space.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first to get your mouse to the top of the pyramid while avoiding the cat.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a wooden mouse covering a marble. Players take turns rolling the die and moving their mouse. Some spots allow the marble to drop, requiring the player to move their mouse to that lower location. Other spots trigger the cat to move.&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

As the crisis unfolds, players will try to use a combination of diplomacy and military posturing in a bid to claim victory without the situation devolving into a conflict that could leave both sides in ruins.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to reduce their opponent's resolve and control regional tension by playing diplomacy and progress cards. When tension rises above certain levels, players receive more progress cards and the crisis develops, yet these cards are the most powerful way to reduce opposition resolve. Each decision could have far-reaching consequences and the challenge is to claim victory in the crisis without both sides destroying each other.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The result is the Seeding &ndash; an alien invasion, but not a normal one.

It is a cluster of multiple games containing a common core mechanic called the Plan. For example, during a period the characters may be attempting to search for refugees over a wide area. They play a Journey mission. They search, evade or face enemies, working to survive while journeying over a large area. The next mission may be penetrating a facility, and they instead play a Tactical mission, where play style is more tactical RPG game with the Plan at its core. During Interludes, a specialized form of choose-your-own-adventure sets the characters and their allies on different paths, and pulls you into their lives so that they are far more than simply stats.&#10;&#10;Westhope will have nearly every style of play available. Its core is an ambitious campaign where you truly begin to empathize with the characters and their allies (and enemies). However, players can engage in separate solo, cooperative, or competitive modes in each of the individual board game elements.&#10;&#10;The campaign spans months and years, and expansions continue the story, some adding new board game methods to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Then each player rolls two dice, sums them up and places on one of the four boxed number one of the 10 wooden game animals. At this point you have to move the animal with the result of either of the two dice. With the other die you can do one of the following: cancel it and do nothing; move his pawn orthogonally, in the desired direction; move another animal already on the board, in the direction of the head. At the end of these movements, if the pawn of the turn player is orthogonally within 4 boxes from an animal (or even more than one) without the line of sight being obstructed, he can &quot;snap a photo&quot; by picking the corresponding card from the deck . The first one who manages to collect ten photos of the ten different animals won the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NeoParadise: Rampage is a card game set in a science fiction, dark fantasy, post-apocalyptic world where 4 factions slaughter each other for &quot;survival&quot;.&#10;&#10;Main Features&#10;&#10;     The 4 groups have different play styles but that's not all. Each faction either adds or changes a rule of the game to their advantage, but that's not all! Each faction also possess a different resource system!&#10;     How to win, during the match players will play buildings (one of the 3 card types) to form their &quot;base&quot;. This constructions can be damaged and the moment your enemy has no more of them in the field, you win.&#10;     We have 2 ways of playing, one in which you play with your deck in 1 pile, and another in which you separate your deck in 2 piles. You can choose from which pile you draw your card each turn. This decreases luck and increases strategy.&#10;&#10;&#10;Comments from the designer:&#10;&#10;A big part of the game is that all factions are broken and fragile at the same time. All of them can win or lose against all of the others in a ridiculous way, specially when you get the hang of it.&#10;&#10;In this game we have 3 card types, Units, Buildings and Interventions. Units represent your &quot;troops&quot;, Buildings make your base and Interventions are standalone effects. You can't cancel enemy effects in this game, only normal attacks from &#10;Units.&#10;&#10;While it's not difficult to learn, specially if you have played other card games, the fact that every faction is so different might make you feel you are learning 4 games at the same time...Might.&#10;&#10;Also, when it comes to playing times, the one registered is the standard. But sometimes, specially when you really grasp the game and you get top level luck: you can get a 3 minute match... This happened only once during testing, quite a funny thing it was. And also, if you have no idea whatsoever and get terrible luck it can stretch up to an hour and a half. Only in those circunstances.&#10;&#10;",

Each army has their own characteristics. In this case, the English have more soldiers (as in the real battle) but the Scottish infantry is stronger, so there is a balance. Careful, try not to lose the King. If your King dies you don't lose automatically the match,but you will lose some soldiers of infantry.&#10;The aim of the game is to destroy the enemy army and win the battle for freedom.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Plan your combo. Save the city together. &mdash; A fun, cooperative, strategic crime-fighting card game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Beatdown is a 1-4 player fully cooperative card game. Players team up to defeat waves of comic-book criminal and eventually go toe-to-toe with a crime-boss that threatens their city. The group wins if they are able to reach and defeat the boss and lose if all players are simultaneously reduced to 0 hitpoints.&#10;&#10;The core fighting mechanic revolves around building combos by using a mixture of attack cards in hand and from the shared &quot;Attack&quot; deck. Between each attack players must roll a 10-sided combo die to see if they can continue their attack. Each added attack increases the difficulty rating of this roll. A failed combo roll leaves an opening for enemies to attack.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player chooses a hero with a unique stat-line and ability. Heroes tend to have roles for group play such as tanky wrestlers or fragile high-damage boxers. Planning the right team to bring can be crucial for defeating the foes that await.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The strength of sisterhood found in the Shisai of Orochi is not like the standard bonds found in faith. The Shisai of Orochi are spiritually and mentally stronger in the presence of their sisters. Few in the Jwar Isles can challenge the will of two let alone three of these fervent believers in Orochi&rsquo;s power. Satsuki like the other Shisai lets Orochi&rsquo;s will flow through her, becoming a channel with which Orochi can strike down its enemies. Those who stand against the Ito shisai fall crumpled to ground, wracked in agony as Orochi&rsquo;s poison destroys their bodies from the inside, Satsuki&rsquo;s presence accelerating the process to terrifying speeds, leaving only the faithful to walk in Orochi&rsquo;s lands.  &#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once a beautiful child of the Ito, with many a samurai lord interested in claiming her hand for a son.

The Blessing awakening a deep power within her, granting her the power to grant minor gifts to fellow believers to conduct Orochi&rsquo;s bidding. Her gaze able to bend the minds of even the most resolute to her own ends or freeze them in place until they might serve a purpose for this deadly and beautiful Shugenja of the Ito.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A broken landscape with little arable land for farming, brimming with danger and hazard from the hostile terrain or its inhabitants, beasts unique to the island fill its dense jungles. Beautiful as they are exotic, with colourings to make the royal gardens seem dull in comparison. Amongst the many reptiles lurking in the shadows of the canopy the Shimogama vipers are some of the largest and deadliest. Five foot of muscle, harnessed by great feathery wings enables the snake&rsquo;s great power and movement, striking without warning and disappearing just as fast. These ancient predators of the jungle are drawn to the service of their mother in times of war.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The first is the writing stage, where everyone writes a story of a crime using the elements from the cards they have drawn.&#10;In the second stage, the player who's turn it is becomes the writer and the others become guests.&#10;The guests try to reveal the crime story by asking and guessing and try to figure out the whole story, observing the rules of asking.&#10;The guests must continue until they can make all the connections and tell the whole story.&#10;The game only comes to an end once the story of every player has been found out.&#10;&#10;An exciting card game for any party of teenagers and adults.&#10;&#10;Playing Time: 15-20 min./player&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
