    "Description": "Green Hell: The Board Game is a non-legacy, campaign, survival, fully cooperative game for 1-4 players. The board game follows the recipe for success implemented by its electronic counterpart, by introducing a highly optimizable set of survival mechanics, pitting players against a changeable and unpredictable jungle environment. The core mechanics of the game are:&#10;&#10;Players are all members of a search and rescue party, sent into the Amazon rainforest to locate Jake Higgins - the protagonist known from the computer game. Avoiding too many spoilers, the plot of the board game campaign runs its own course and uses some hallmark elements of the overarching Green Hell story, without spoiling the electronic adventure to anyone.&#10;&#10;Apart from the characters in the team - who have varying roles and asymmetric skills (the Survival Expert, the Guide, the Medic, the Scientist) the other main character of the game is the jungle itself. With a map based on random card setup, providing modularity (no two games of the same scenario will look the same), and an ever-expanding area to cover (each scenario will allow players to uncover a part of a greater region, and sometimes the players will have to backtrack to an already known location) the jungle creation system introduces variability and unpredictability to each session.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a single action to either claim a die or modify it. Players must carefully decide when to modify dice, and when to claim them. Players may also sacrifice dice, keeping any player from claiming them.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of three rounds. The round ends when there are no more dice to claim, either because players claimed them all &ndash; or some have been discarded. Each round players refill their hand back up to six cards, meaning any remaining cards in a players hand hang around until they can eventually claim a die to get rid of them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Once, Nathaniel Essex was a biologist in Victorian London. Realizing that an increasing number of human mutations signaled the beginning of a new evolution, Essex put aside morality in his pursuit of perfecting the human race. A long road of unethical experiments on unwilling subjects eventually led to him to incredible discoveries and even greater personal power. Becoming something far more than human, Nathaniel transformed himself into the nearly-immortal being known as Mister Sinister.&#10;&#10;Mister Sinister views the mutant race's eventual dominance over the world as a foregone conclusion, and that now we must look beyond the next step. Believing that certain genetic bloodlines possess greater mutant power than others, Mister Sinister has targeted members of the X-Men as potential experimental subjects. Regardless of the opposition, Mister Sinister will allow nothing to impede his quest for evolutionary perfection.&#10;&#10;Marvel: Crisis Protocol &ndash; Mr. Sinister includes one miniature, a character stat card, two team tactic cards, and thirteen tokens.&#10;&#10;",

Haggle and form coalitions in a series of fast-paced negotiations, while facing the constant threat of betrayal. As Executives attempt to secure the support of Shareholders by promising some coveted paperclips, Infiltrators with hidden agendas will do whatever it takes to fulfill their own ambitions. Who can you trust to make you rich?&#10;&#10;After players draw their roles, the Executives shall identify themselves while the roles of the remaining players, known as the Board Members, remain hidden. Each Executive then enters a two-minute negotiation with every Board Member, offering Paperclips in exchange for information and support with the hope of closing Deals with Shareholders during the Board Meeting at the end of the game. Shareholders must decide which Executive to side with and close the most lucrative Deal, while Infiltrators disrupt negotiations with their own goals.&#10;&#10;While negotiations are occurring, the other players are free to network, strategizing and scheming with each other. Before the Board Meeting begins, Board Members can discover someone else's role through a Disclosure (provided by Shareholder Tokens, Infiltrator Tokens, and VP Stars). Once the Executives finish negotiating with each Board Member, they may negotiate with one player for the second time in the Endgame Negotiations.&#10;&#10;In the Board Meeting that follows, Executives and Shareholders shall submit Proposals, outlining the terms that they are committed to. Executives write down which of their Paperclips will go to who, while Shareholders write down their expected payout and which Executive they are supporting. Terms need to match in order for a Deal to close, but Executives may give more Paperclips than what a Shareholder asks for in their Proposal. Once they are done, players will reveal their Proposals and see who has closed Deals and who has won.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.&#10;&#10;Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and outthink them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.&#10;&#10;With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone elses. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;King of the West' card game set 3: The Banished, including The Reaper, The Phantom, The Shade, and their locations.&#10;&#10;",

The cards in your hand, when lined up and tabbed, create attack power and special effects, so they must be &quot;exactly&quot; the same as either the temporary &quot;repel&quot; value, which makes the front line temporarily yours, or the &quot;dominate&quot; value, which gives you complete control of the front line, making it impossible to ever get it back, and which you can use as a new weapon repeatedly.&#10;&#10;The elements are divided into four categories: Land, Sea, Air, and Supply. The Army can only attack frontline cards adjacent to their own territory, while the Navy can only attack blue frontline cards with an anchor symbol. Because of the restrictions on the attack range of the army and navy, you can't attack deep into enemy territory very well, so you must first &quot;repel&quot; the middle of the enemy's front line with auxiliary range enhancing effects from the air force and supply operations to convert it into your territory.&#10;&#10;The designer notes that the game's cards were inspired by Dobble/Spot-It.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On the verge of extinction, after years of conflict that has left their planet nearly depleted of its natural resources, the inhabitants of this world have no choice but to leave their home. They&rsquo;ll accomplish this by using advanced long range spacecraft to journey to the nearest habitable world that will become their new home.&#10;&#10;&#10;Still stubbornly divided after decades of fighting, the remaining world powers now engage in a final surge for dominance and self preservation as they race ahead to their objective. As time runs out, they now must make a hasty departure from their dying planet. In order to complete their mission, they must obtain the materials necessary to sustain themselves, maintain their spacecraft, and research the science required to navigate their way through the long and dangerous journey that awaits them. In an ironic twist, they may be forced to cooperate with one another while still protecting their own interests. Now the ultimate strategic gamble for survival will require you to be the first to arrive and claim the distant world TERRA PROXIMA...&#10;&#10;Terra Proxima, by Bavarian Games, is a push-your-luck, resource management game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout gameplay! It&rsquo;s intense enough to keep experienced gamers excited, but simple enough to be enjoyable regardless of a player&rsquo;s skill-set! In Terra Proxima, players will travel to different Moons and Planets to gather necessary materials and research the science in order to continue their journey towards Terra Proxima at the center of the board. The first player to arrive on Terra Proxima is the winner of the game. Will you be able to get there first?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fifth installment in Rick Young&rsquo;s Fast Action Battle Series. &#10;FAB turns East.&#10;&#10;The time is set for Operation Barbarossa and the greatest tank battle of all times: more than 3.000 Soviet and nearly 700 German tanks and assault guns will clash in Soviet occupied Southern Poland. Known as the Battle of Brody-Dubno-Lutsk, that bloody triangle saw the direst straits of invading German forces in Barbarossa as they struggle for a week to repel the massive Soviet armored counterattacks to the flanks of the spearhead formed by Ewald Kleist's 1st Panzergruppe.&#10;&#10;German invasion force was aimed towards Kyiv and the Kyiv Special Military District was the better armed and prepared of all Soviet Fronts stationed on the Westerns borders of the URSS, with a full array of Soviet Mechanized Corps, equipped with hundreds of the new brand tanks KV and T-34.&#10;As the German player you control two powerful German armies: 6th and 1st Panzergruppe. The Soviet player will control the Northern flank of the Southwestern Front &ndash;formed by the 5th and 6th all arms armies. Blocks are mostly divisions with some regiments/brigades and German Kampfgruppen.&#10;&#10;In DUBNO&rsquo;41 you will see, with a minimum of new rules, the Soviet unpreparedness for war in June 1941 as they desperately struggled for defeating the German invaders. Soviets had a huge amount of low quality units with powerful but fragile armored forces against the Wehrmacht at its peak of quality and efficiency. Not a one-sided battle as someone could think about Operation Barbarossa but the Soviets could accomplish their mission and defeat or at least stop the invaders. The game includes assets for minor but powerful German units as the elite 652nd Panzerjaeger battalion or the scarce panzer grenadiers units fully equipped with armored carrier vehicles, heavy artillery, anti-tank units, the all-known 88&rsquo;s cannons and more. Events include Soviet extra-hard KV and T-34 tanks, flamethrower tanks, air attacks, Soviet mechanical breakdowns and political officers and more&hellip;&#10;&#10;German swiftness and tactical ability is opposed to Soviet mass and technological advantage. Weirdly not a single Stuka plane would arrive to help the German forces as Army Group South was not equipped with that type of aircraft. Soviet Air Force will fight one of its more desperate battles adding considerable strength to Soviet ground attacks. Will you pierce the Soviet lines and breakout towards Kyiv, or you would slow the German advance and counterattack successfully defeating the invaders?&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

But somehow your choice of place doesn't seem to be the best to reach the jumping fish.&#10;Fill your fishing net with the best fish before your fellow players do!&#10;&#10;Each player receives a game piece and a fishing net. The lake is placed in the center. 5 phases are played. First you draw 2 tiles from the bag. Then you can put one or both tiles back into the bag and draw again. However, this costs one tile from the net. This can be repeated as often as you like.&#10;&#10;After that, one tile is placed in the lake based on its coordinates. The other tile is turned over and serves as a time unit. The time unit can also be exchanged in phase 4 for giving up a tile from the fishing net. &#226;&#160;&#128;&#226;&#160;&#128;&#10;&#10;In phase 5, fishing takes place. For each time unit, you may take one step around the lake and cast your fishing rod. Reeling in does not cost a unit of time. You may only cast straight ahead, so you must stand at right angles to the fish. Then the start player marker is passed on and a new round begins. &#226;&#160;&#128;&#226;&#160;&#128;&#10;&#10;In the 3-4 player game, you can save time units and use them later. If a player's net is full, the current round is still played to the end, followed by the scoring. You add up the points of the fish on the fishing net. Who is the best angler?&#10;&#10;",

If players have chosen the same the rewards are split evenly. Any unchosen monarch's tokens are then also distributed evenly.&#10;&#10;After all of this, the player with the most tokens (money) wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

In each round, one chosen player tries to give as many correct answers as they can for a category with ten items. Each answer earns money, and a player may stop and bank what they have at five correct answers. Banked money goes into the final jackpot for the bonus round.&#10;&#10;To help, a team gets one life per round (in case they give a wrong answer), as well as one &ldquo;Overrule&rdquo;, where the team captain can reject a given answer and substitute another one. These can be used once per round, with the Overrule only allowed prior to five correct answers. The final help is three &ldquo;Nominate&rdquo; tokens, which are used among all players. With them, the player may chose another player to give an answer if they can&rsquo;t think of one. Players get eliminated if they give a second wrong answer and are sent to the Vortex.&#10;&#10;When all players have played a question, the final round begins. Any player who banked money and was not eliminated participates. If no player remained in the game, 500 is put into the bank and the captain plays solo. The team is given a choice of two lists to play, and they begin giving answers one at a time, in turn. A wrong answer eliminates a player. If the tenth answer is given, any remaining players split the money. If everyone is eliminated prior to getting all ten answers, the player who banked the most money in the previous rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

There are four categories available for play: Their Flair (People), Sports Shorts (Sports), Creature Feature (Animal) and Hodge Podge (Variety). Each card contains four numbered clues which determine how far a playing piece may move (e.g. - answering clue #3 means a player can move three spaces). There are three sub-categories in the game: Think Wink, Thinky Winky and Thinkety Winkety. These designate two-word answers of one, two or three syllables per word, respectively. However, since Thinkety Winkety cards are harder, they are treated as Wild cards that allow for moving five spaces on the board.&#10;&#10;When a player gives an answer, opponents may either pass or challenge the answer. While there is one answer per clue, it is possible to have more than one correct answer. If a player passes, they accept the given answer. If they challenge, they consult the Challenge Card and check the answer given. If the answers don&rsquo;t match, it&rsquo;s an automatic wrong answer. Once a team is correct, they can move their piece the number of spaces the clue stated, or they may hinder opponents by moving their piece farther from the exit. Moves are also not limited to completely one direction. For example, a move of three could be played as two backwards and one to the left.&#10;&#10;The first player or team to get their piece to the exit on the opposite side where they started, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

They do this in the hopes of getting a higher point value on their card. There are also Censored and Socially Redeeming Cards in each deck. Censored cards are used to cover one of the opponent&rsquo;s words, thereby blocking out scoring points, and the Socially Redeeming cards are used to remove a Censored card if one has been placed.&#10;&#10;The player or team who creates the highest scoring sentence on their game card wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Think Go Fish, with a classical art theme and deeper strategy.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players are dealt four cards face down. The remaining cards are placed face down into a draw pile. On a player's turn, they ask another player if they have an artist card (e.g do you have a piece by Van Gogh?). The player they're asking then has two options. They can either say yes and give the other player their Van Gogh cards, or say no, either truthfully or in an attempt to bluff.  As this game involves bluffing, if a player does not believe their opponent is telling the truth when they say they do not have a card by the named artist, they can challenge their opponent. If their opponent did have any cards by the named artist, the opponent loses a turn and has to give all cards by the named artist to the person who challenged them, and the person who challenged them takes another turn. If the challenge fails, the person who made the challenge must give the person they challenged all their cards by the named artist and the turn then passes to the left.&#10;&#10;When a player builds a complete collection (four cards by the same artist, by artists from the same country, in the same genre, or by female artists), they place those cards on the table face up, these cards form your collection. If when doing this a player runs out of cards in their hand, they draw four new cards from the draw pile. Play continues until the draw pile is empty and all cards are placed into collections, or no more collections can be formed from the cards left in player's hands.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players add up the value of their collection, taking into account any end game and wild card bonuses. The player who has the most expensive collection wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

These are available to all players.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the player does two things. First is the movement phase, where the player rolls the dice and moves their airplane token. Airport spaces must be avoided unless the player intends on &quot;landing&quot; there. Once on an airport space, that player claims an associated route card with that airport as the PICKUP AIRPORT. The goal is now to complete that Route card as quickly as possible by moving on subsequent turns to the DESTINATION AIRPORT indicated on the claimed card. Once the DESTINATION AIRPORT is landed on, the player claims the associated points and now may chase another route to gain more points.&#10;&#10;The second part of one's turn is comprised of playing one action card if the payer chooses to. Follow the card (either GREEN or RED) instructions. Then play moves to the next person in a clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;First player to earn 20 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes the role of a mythical creature from the traditional Chinese mythology, an Immortal, whose goal is to have the best and most delicious hot pot dinner whilst sabotaging the other Immortals their meal! Each Immortal character has a favorite type of food, as well as one they despise. Each player tries to eat as much as possible of their Immortal&rsquo;s favorite food, while tricking the other players into eating food they despise and ruining their meal. A variety of tricks, traps and deceits are available to make the dinner go according to your wishes.

Players take turns flipping cards from a deck of cards called &ldquo;The Pot.&rdquo; Each card has a chili spiciness level assigned to it with a value between 0 and 6. Players must take care not to go over a chili level of 6, or they have to dispose of all the flipped cards. After this, the Immortal proceeds to eat the food cards and you place them in sets of different types of food. There are a total of 6 types of food (meat, fish, vegetables, tofu, mushrooms and noodles) and each food set has to be up of different food types up to a total of 4 cards per set.&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s Immortal character has a favorite food type indicated on the character card: for this food type, you can place as many as you want in one food set, up to the 4 card set maximum.
