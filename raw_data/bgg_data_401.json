The book then moves on to traditional board and dice games such as checkers, backgammon, and craps.  There are many word and guessing games.  Outdoor activities are also listed, including races, snow or water games, lawn games, and full-blown sports.&#10;&#10;Ideas for adults' get-togethers include quick-thinking contests and even dancing games.  The book details countless games for children, suitable for everyday play or social events such as birthday parties.  Some of the party games are geared toward specific holidays.&#10;&#10;This huge volume devotes one little paragraph to branded games such as Monopoly, Pit, and Flinch.  It only mentions that they exist, and require special equipment, which is purchased along with the rules.&#10;&#10;Although you'll find very familiar entries such as bridge, marbles, and baseball, many of the games are less known, or a variation on a more familiar idea.  Some of the names are intriguing in their own right.  Here's a sampling of names of the many games to learn:&#10;&#10;Misery Nap&#10;Bierspiel&#10;Anti-nudist&#10;Hearts of Lettuce&#10;Skeegee-Weegee&#10;The G Man Never Takes His Ease&#10;Literary Salad&#10;Strawberries Without Cream&#10;Schnozzle Race&#10;&#10;",

The key to victory is correct deployment and effective use of reserves.  For the Allies, one of the key decisions is how much to bombard.  It is very effective but it also destroys the drainage systems of the area and leads to a quagmire that with eliminated possibilities.  For the German player, commitment of reserves is the key.  He has to guess correctly at the main points of attack by the British player before they have sufficiently evolved to make the attack plan apparent.&#10;&#10;",

The first die determines how many cards are held in each player's hand (1-6); the other die is special and determines the trump suit.  The second die may come up &quot;no trump&quot; (there is no trump suit) or &quot;no suit&quot; (suit doesn't matter, only face value).  Chips are used to keep score.  Players must ante up before each hand, and the pot is won by the first player to reach eleven points (or to have the highest score after four hands).  Scoring centers around the fact that at start of each game, players use bidding wheels to predict how many hands they can win.  Penalties are applied for guessing incorrectly, while guessing correctly and winning all tricks in a hand can lead to an instant win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the tube...&#10;&quot;.. a game which truly simulates real harness racing.  You control your horse's speed, decide when to make your move and make all of the other decisions.  Your driving skill - not just luck - determines the outcome.&quot;     The object is to drive your horse the farthest twice around the track.&#10;&#10;Yes the game is packaged in a tube. The &quot;board&quot; is a piece of fabric backed printed vinyl, similar to a place mat.  Players are assigned or pick a horse from a choice of 200 in the Stable book.  Each horse has a movement number that is broken down into quarters (4 numbers), one for each quarter mile (track is a half mile).  These quarter mile numbers are then reduced to 6 numbers, from 1 to 9.  These 6 numbers are printed on cards.  On his turn the player uses one card to move his horse.  The move is modified by: spaces that count as two, variable length lanes in the curves, swaping cards with the draw pile without changing the movement #, holding back a card till the next quarter mile, blocking another from holding back a card, chance cards at the start and on the home stretch, chance dice roll is required to pass thru a space directly in front of another horse.  It is recommended to have a race secretary.  This person should be a fair minded person who will set up and referee the race.&#10;&#10;The players try to use all of their movement while causing others to waste movement.  This player has observed that it is easy for all of the players to use all of their movement with only 6 horses in the race.  All of the movement robbing mechanisms are easily avoided with 6 horses.  The race is then determined by the movement number combined with the Start and Stretch chance cards.  The use of 12 horses makes a much more interesting game.  With 12 horses the movement robbing mechanisms can not be totally avoided.&#10;&#10;John Campbell is a Hall of Fame driver (not rider) that holds many of the sport's records.  John Campbell did not design the game but has endorsed it.  The 1989 instructions invite players to a yearly tournament where the championship is decided by playing against John Campbell.&#10;&#10;The instructions promote another game, &quot;Classic Thoroughbred Racing&quot; which is not currently in the BGG database.&#10;&#10;",

You can try and trick the others by resting on the journey, but if this means that trek fails, you must pass out your highest cards to the others. Then at the temples, players use their cards to beat each other to the treasures.&#10;&#10;The 64 card deck uses authentic b&amp;w illustrations from contemporary explorations of the nineteenth century, which lend the game a strong theme. The cards have simple German text. The cardstock is laminated but flimsy, and while the production is good for a first release, gamers may expect better. However, the price at Essen 2005 was only &euro;4 which was fair. German rules only in the box.&#10;&#10;",
