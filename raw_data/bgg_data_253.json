    "Description": "In Maginor, players are trying to gain votes from various oracles. Maginor visits each one in turn. The player with the most influence counters at an oracle can take either the points for the oracle or the spell card there. The player with the second most influence gets whichever the first player didn't take. Spells have one-time effects that alter different aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;Influence is gained at the oracles both by playing cards and rolling a die. This gives a mix of random chance and control over the game. If a player tries to get influence in a position occupied by another player's influence counter, they must duel. This is a RPS mechanic with a twist. If both players choose an &quot;earthbeast&quot; in the duel, the defender wins.&#10;&#10;When all oracles are scored, the player with the most total votes wins.&#10;&#10;This is a reworking of Reiner Knizia's Vegas. Maginor adds some cards, spells, and a different &quot;dueling&quot; mechanic.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to get the combination shown on the player's card within the number of rolls given to score points. If a player is unable to complete a card an opponent can try to steal it for half points by rolling the remaining dice and if successful will be able to attempt their own card in the same turn, but failing the steal will end the turn. When all cards are claimed, the person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The game comes with five dice, twelve cards, and a rule sheet that are all stored in a small plastic case for easy transportation and storage.&#10;&#10;",

Hyenas, however are always negative.&#10;&#10;Originally Published in German as Alles f&uuml;r die Katz:&#10;The title means &quot;Everything for the Cat&quot; and may have an idiomatic meaning of &quot;all for nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Alles f&uuml;r die Katz The animals in the zoo are loose and players must attempt to collect one of each type out of a face down grid which represents the zoo, but must avoid collecting any black cats which do not belong in the zoo. Adults should be sure to use the Advanced Rules to ensure an interesting game. Otherwise, the rules are the same as the English version (7 Safari).&#10;&#10;",

They learned that these ancients simultaneously built pyramids towards the sky and had an extensive knowledge of the stars. It was rumored that perhaps they were the original colonizers and space-farers of the first human age.&#10;&#10;Now, at the edge of a colossal black hole, a pyramid-craft known as the Zoneplex has emerged with legendary markings and glyphs of the deep past. The known empires have sent their elite warrior-monk mystics on a one-way mission to gain control of the Zoneplex, to emerge victorious and ultimately control the pathways of the universe and time itself.&#10;&#10;Zoneplex is a game that combines a tile-laying/exploration mechanism, a collaborative battle system and a zone control system to create an intriguing adventure in an alien pyramid.&#10;&#10;The game works in 2 phases with the first phase players not counting Influence points until the pyramid is completed.&#10;&#10;In phase 1 players strategically lay tiles determined by action cards to build their pathway through the Zoneplex pyramid whilst being cognizant of the Sacred Symbol card that they are bestowed with before the game begins. While building strategically players also confront creatures within the pyramid which they must collect to become worthy to enter the Eye and win the game. The players control the Zoneplex by gaining Influence points which occurs when a Player places a spirit-stone on the board. Spirit Stones not only sustain one's Influence points but can also be removed to gain bonuses in combat.&#10;&#10;In phase 2 after exploring the pyramid, the players reveal their Sacred Symbol cards and count influence points, then a cutthroat race for survival and worthiness begins as players vie to enter &quot;The Eye of The Zoneplex&quot; to become the decisive winner or stand their ground with the most influence points as the action cards run out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dodoresque: Jungle Fever is a funny card game for 2-4 players. Each Player takes the role of a Dodo, trying to build the best nest possible.&#10;&#10;To do so, the Dodos can go on Adventures, Trade and Build.&#10;&#10;Each player starts out with the drawing of 3 starting cards, of which one is discarded to create the exchange stack.&#10;&#10;To gather nest building materials, the Dodo Players have to go on Adventures in one of three card stacks (drawing cards). Those stacks consist of 2 different card types: Material and Action. To get better material cards, you need the right action cards on your hand to counter certain effects and be able to take the materials on your hand. Material cards from your hand can be built into a nest by playing them on the table in front of you. A nest consists of a maximum of 6 cards. Goal of the game is to score as many points as possible with different combinations of cards in your nest.&#10;&#10;Another option to get the cards you need is to trade with other players, but not in a direct way. Depending on the number of players there are some cards available as an exchange stack. Players can trade cards from their hand with the exchange stack.&#10;&#10;Each material card has one of three types, one of four themes and an individual value between 1 and 3. To build the perfect nest you require 2 cards of each type, preferably of the same theme and with an individual value as high as possible.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the adventure card stacks is used up or one of the Dodo characters has lost all of its hit points.&#10;&#10;Dodoresque consists of 90 cards, over 60 of them with unique artworks of our Dodos and their adventures.&#10;&#10;Dodoresque: Jungle Fever can be combined with Dodoresque: Cherry Blossom to be played with up to 8 Players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The other player(s) become the mob. The mob divides one hundred mob tokens as evenly as possible. One mob player, acting as host, reads a question and its three possible answers aloud. The mob players use their tokens to secretly choose one or more answers.&#10;&#10;When the mob players have finished distributing all of their tokens, the contestant may ask for one of three helps before giving a response to the question. The helps one response of the contestant&rsquo;s choosing), Trust the Mob (the contestant is forced to choose whichever response has the most tokens on it) or Ask the Mob (this eliminates one wrong response). The contestant can use each help only once.&#10;&#10;If the contestant gives the correct response, the money is added to the bank equal to the level the player is on multiplied by the number of tokens the mob has put on the wrong responses. The levels start at $1000 and ascend to $10,000. The mob tokens that are on the incorrect responses are out of play.&#10;&#10;The game is over when the contestant gives an incorrect response. This means the money in the bank is divided among the mob players who still have tokens.  The contestant wins $1,000,000 when the mob loses all its tokens. The contestant can quit the game before ascending to the next level and keep whatever money has been accumulated in the bank.&#10;&#10;Players continue the game until each player has been the contestant. A running total of the scores of each game is kept. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Considering that the television series uses 101 contestants, this is reasonable faithful translation of the television series.&#10;&#10;Intended for 2 - 4 players Ages 12 and up&#10;&#10;",

There is always a plenty of those who are eager to take this place, so when such a chance comes up, they&rsquo;re ready to take it by all means.&#10;&#10;The city of Urbis is ruled by the City Council elected by the residents. The main objective of the game is to become the Head of the Council. Like all the other players, you are a Council member who is responsible for the well-being and prosperity of the city.  Each Council member (player) has an access to the city treasury and guard, and is obliged to follow the Council&rsquo;s decreets. Each councillor is in charge of one of the city blocks (represented by a board given to each player in the beginning of the game) and aspires to develop his block either quickly or proficiently. Gold and silver from the treasury are distributed depending on the buildings that have been put up on the block. However the block residents are always on the lookout: no one wants to live close to the cemetery, gibbet or prison. Take thought for the residents, spend some money, and these grim buildings will appear on the neighbour&rsquo;s block instead of your own. Hospital is also an essential city institution but it demands substantial charges to maintain. Taking this into account a player might awaken his inner dictator and build up his block with slums and honky-tonks, regardless of the residents&rsquo; needs, because the first player to fill all the building slots on his block becomes a winner.  Which way is the best? To consider the block residents or to just execute the will of the Council? To turn your block into a dark place or a blooming garden? In Urbis you&rsquo;ll have to make decisions promptly.&#10;&#10;",

He controls more powerful wizards than does Lord Forseti, and he can gain allies in the magical fairy people known as the Cadmin and the mighty dragon, Terromax.

If a player could claim a target card after the first or second roll &ndash; such as a card showing three-of-a-kind &ndash; but decides to roll again, she can no longer claim that card after a future roll. Once a player claims a card, her turn ends and the next player goes, rolling all six dice to start the turn.&#10;&#10;If a player doesn't claim a card, however, the next player has the option of immediately claiming a card that matches the dice previously set aside or keeping those dice set aside and having only two rolls on his turn to try to claim a card.&#10;&#10;Some cards have icons that allow whoever wins it to take a special action, such as a bonus turn or theft of a card from an opponent.&#10;&#10;After a player has claimed a certain number of cards (4, 5 or 7 with four-to-six, three or two players), that player can decide to end the game. The game ends automatically once a player has claimed six, eight or ten cards (again, based on the number of players). Players then tally their points, and whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10;",

A slew of information in words and pictures for 155 cities is awaiting your visit!&#10;&#10;The players travel by car, train, ship and airplane from city to city and control private and public destinations with three travel companies. The goal is to visit as many destinations as possible in six differently colored regions. Whenever a player reaches a destination, he lays the corresponding city card in front of himself. The game ends when a player has at least ten city cards (or nine cards with five or six players) in six different colors before himself, although the round is played to its end. The winner is the player who visited the most destinations in all six colored regions.&#10;&#10;New game mechanisms: Europareise possesses novel game mechanisms that differ from the familiar travel games in the Ravensburger catalog (Deutschlandreise, Weltreise). Movement doesn't come from dice, but rather from tickets for planes, ships, trains, and cars. To keep the lines from tangling on the gameboard, no flight lines or ship lines are marked on the gameboard. The players travel from a ship's harbor with a ship chain to any harbor within reach of the ship chain. Travel by airplane is done similarly.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The object is to win the most battles in any given round to become Captain for the next round. But be careful &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t win ANY battles in a round, you&rsquo;re out of the game. You&rsquo;re dealt fewer cards in each successive round, and the player who wins the final round wins the game! Play is fast and furious, with an average game time of only 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;Walk the Plank comes with a deck of 68 cards. The deck has sixty-five numbered cards, two Walk the Plank! cards, and one Sea Monster! card. The sixty-five numbered cards are divided into five suits: Doubloons, Hookhands, Monkeys, Parrots, and Peglegs. The cards in each suit are numbered 1 through 13, with 1 worth the least and 13 worth the most.&#10;&#10;The first dealer, or Captain, deals 7 cards to each player in the first round of seven. Subsequent rounds deal one less card. (Round 2 is 6 cards, Round 3 is 5 cards, etc.) The Captain then turns over the top card on the deck so that everyone may see it. The suit of the card revealed will be trump for the first round. The trump suit is the most powerful suit in any given battle. For example, if Monkeys are trump, then a low card in Monkeys will beat even a higher-numbered card in any other suit. If the card the Captain turns over is a Walk the Plank! or a Sea Monster!, there is no trump suit for this first round. In every round after the first, whoever is Captain chooses the trump suit after looking at his or her cards.&#10;&#10;The suit of the first card played in a battle is called the current suit. If this card is a numbered card, it may or may not be from the trump suit. If the first card played in a battle is one of the three special cards, there is no current suit for that battle, but each player still has to play one card.&#10;&#10;You must play a card of the same suit as the first card played in each battle, if you can. We call this following suit. So if you have any cards in your hand of the same suit as the first one played in a battle, you have to pick one and play it. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have no cards in the current suit. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have a special card (Walk the Plank! or Sea Monster!), unless you choose not to play the special card.&#10;&#10;Walk the Plank! will win any battle, beating even the highest card in the trump suit&mdash;think of it as a &ldquo;wild card&rdquo; worth one more than the highest card in play. When someone plays Sea Monster!, no one wins the battle, no matter what cards&#10;have been played. The player who played Sea Monster! doesn't win the battle, but he/she does gain control. (So he/she gets to choose the current suit for the next battle by playing the first card.)&#10;&#10;The player who wins the battle in the round becomes the Captain in the next round, which means you get to play the first card in the next battle.&#10;&#10;If you win one or more battles in a round in which no other player wins a battle, you win the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of this game (a distant relative of Stratego) is to destroy your opponent's six tanks before he does the same to you.  In addition to your tanks, you deploy an Ammo Dump, a Fuel Dump, your HQ and five Anti-Tank guns (which do not move).&#10;&#10;Your tanks are numbered but the opponent knows not which is which.  You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.&#10;&#10;You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.&#10;&#10;Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.  Tanks die if they end up on an enemy mine square.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Land&#10;&#10;",

If the German player has a unit in Cassino Abbey AND the Continental Hotel, the German player wins.

The first player to get five nuggets to the Bank is the winner.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;Goldrush is a game for 2, 3 or 4 players and takes about one hour to play.  The rules are simple to follow and luck and skill are well blended to make it enjoyable for each member of the family or children of different ages on their own.&#10;&#10;When you play Goldrush the fun starts from the from the first move.  You re-live a time of high adventure when reckless men staked all they had on one lucky strike.  Every game is different because you seldom strike gold in the same place twice.&#10;&#10;You will need to be clever as well as lucky to make your fortune but right to the final exciting showdown, every player has a chance to win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A dwarven card game of mining and masonry. Each player has a team of specialist dwarven miners, each good at collecting the right precious metals and gems to create beautiful jewelry. Be the first to fulfill the necessary orders, gaining a reputation of being the best crafts person with the different gems, and ultimately gain the most favor with the Nobility.&#10;&#10;The mining Dwarves all have a Friend and a Foe that can either help or hinder them.&#10;&#10;Take Ruby for example:&#10;As Ruby&rsquo;s name implies, she is an expert at mining for rubies. She will produce +1 Ruby for you if you hire her. Her foe (on the left) is Diamond and her friend (on the right) is Sapphire. Diamond will rob Ruby of a gem if she gets a chance (hence the minus symbol), but Sapphire will get an extra gem from the ruby mine supply with the help of his friend (hence the plus symbol).&#10;Friend Actions (+ pluses) are cumulative allowing you take several gems in one turn. Foe Actions (-minuses) rob other players of valuable gems. The crux of the game is to know how and when to take advantage of the Dwarfs&rsquo; friendships and rivalries for your gain.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A playing card game in which players take turns drawing up to 5 cards, playing a card to either give positive points to someone, negative points to someone, or play an effect card.  Wild swings in points can be accomplished as cards are asymmetric and players tend to target the current leader.  Some actions cards also tend to completely negate other events or effects creating a wild, unexpected outcome.&#10;&#10;The card game plays until either one player has 1000 points or the deck has run out and all players have finished playing their remaining cards.&#10;&#10;The game comes from a Youtube video personality, Alex Day and his cousin Danny Hooper, and includes humorous hand-drawn pictures on each card.&#10;&#10;",

Individual board squares may be colored to match one player&rsquo;s color, or in a neutral color. The color of the landing site indicates which player (whether or not that is the active player) places one floor of a new building at this square.&#10;&#10;The active player must then pay points to owners of all buildings over which the Helicopter has just flown. The pay rate is based on the total floor count for each color involved, and escalates steeply with increased floor count.&#10;&#10;Turn ends with one additional floor of the appropriate color being added to each building flown over.&#10;&#10;Some players may be eliminated early when unable to pay.  Game ends when one player cannot move (cannot reach an empty square), or when one player has no more floors to place.  Player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

If the moved piece (or stack of pieces) would land on an occupied space, it covers any pieces located there.&#10;&#10;Whenever the first piece of a color is moved over a scoring gate &ndash; of which there are four on the track &ndash; all towers are scored. If a multi-colored tower is on a raised section of the track, the player who owns the top piece earns as many points as the number of pieces in the stack; if such a tower is on the ground, the owner of the bottom piece scores points instead. Each turn before moving, a player can spend a point to move one of his pieces to the top or bottom of a stack.&#10;&#10;The game ends once three pieces enter the scoring area at the end of the track &ndash; earning 2-4 points in the proces &ndash; and whoever has collected the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Part of the Schmidt Spiele Easy Play line.&#10;&#10;",
