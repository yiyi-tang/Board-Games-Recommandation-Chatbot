The game has polyhedral dice in different colours (d6, d10, d20). Players are alchemistic hedgehogs who go around collecting dice on their spines, to deliver them to their storerooms and laboratories. Each hedgehog has their own circuit, moving dice around in a way similar to mancala games.&#10;&#10;The dice are then combined to make more and more creatures, which earn the hedgehogs gold coins and victory points. By combining different sets of d6 dice, the hedgehog gains certain d10 dice. Then, combining those in sets earns d20 dice, which lead to the most rewarding creatures.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the hedgehog with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;A sensational new game woven by drafting dice around a mancala, mixing them to complete formulas and build up victory points!&#10;&#10;You are a hedgehog alchemist. Every day you deliver magical materials to the Alchemist Guild for a rich old age.&#10;Your small hands are not enough, so you can carry the materials around by sticking them into the needles on your back. Collect snails, frogs, and small dragon materials and deliver them to the guild to earn gold coins.&#10;&#10;After delivery, turn around again and return the materials one by one to the storage. Mixing the colors of the dice is the key to acquiring new materials (dice). To get an orange frog (decahedron), you need red and yellow snails (hexahedron) and so on! The guild will give you gold coins when you deliver the materials you have acquired. After delivery, store the rest of the material (dice) in the storage.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

You can not make a move if it disconnects your pieces or your opponent's from the rest of the same color.&#10;The sendas of both players can also be connected, creating one long senda that allows for pieces of both colors to get mixed in an intricate pattern.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#138;&#180; (Jinrou) is a werewolf style game from Japan, set in a business company. The title &#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#138;&#180; means Human Labour (essentially the HR dept), and is a homonym of &#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#139;&#188; (Jinrou) which means werewolf.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds and the players have different roles in the company, each with various skills needed to complete projects. Each role also has secret goals, and players are trying to achieve their goals by the end of the game to win, or to avoid goals and not lose!&#10;&#10;In a round, the team leader chooses three players to work on a project. These players (could include the leader) submit two skill cards in secret, which are shuffled and played up. If the six cards show certain combinations, then a player might win or lose on the spot.&#10;&#10;But if players can work out what role a person has, they can determine their goals, and play skill cards to make them fail, or make themselves win. By disguising their own roles, players have more chances to achieve their objectives and avoid being eliminated.&#10;&#10;For example, the CEO does not want to be in four projects, because they will die of over work. The Lazybones wants the CEO to die, or wants the projects to fail so they don't have to work. The Secretary wants to find romance with anybody but the Lazybones. The Temps want to be in four projects so they get hired permanently, and so on. And everyone wants to fall in love with the Secretary.&#10;&#10;Lazybones will win the game if the projects fail to complete, or if the diligent workers fail to take their vacations or miss out on romancing the Secretary.&#10;&#10;The various goals and possible outcomes means winning the game  depends on concealing roles and identifying others'.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;&#10;This is a game about hiding your identity. You are an employee of a company and you are involved in a secret project, hiding your true identity from each other. You have to achieve your goals while taking care of your paycheck and your love life!&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of cards that matches his or her abilities, and they all work together to move a single piece through the backgammon of event cards (i.e. projects) towards the goal.&#10;There is also a lot of fun to be had in the squares where the pieces stop. Squatting, talking in gyaru-speak and other events will help you to win the game.&#10;&#10;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#229;&#140;&#191;&#231;&#179;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#188;&#129;&#230;&#165;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#231;&#164;&#190;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#231;&#167;&#152;&#229;&#175;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#130;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#231;&#181;&#166;&#230;&#182;&#136;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#164;&#190;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#230;&#129;&#139;&#230;&#132;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

However, the day to day campaign activity of the combatants included reconnaissance, raids, probing actions, resupply and a host of other minor operations that frequently lead to small skirmishes.&#10;&#10;What I want to do in this volume of Refighting History is to take some of these actions, however small, and however sketchy in terms of accounts, and turn them into wargames. They will also demonstrate that you do not need large armies to wargame the Seven Years War.&#10;The Western Theatre accounts provide details of the day to day activity by both armies. Coupled with this, the great variety of light and irregular troops provides a whole range of different unit.&#10;&#10;The result is this volume with small historical actions refought on the wargame table. There is also a significant amount of background on the units involved coupled with art work to illustrate the uniforms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;The scenarios are compatible with many rulesets&#10;&#10;",

Players must open and close doors (the tiles) to move along a path and be the first to cross to the other side.&#10;&#10;Special cards are played to hacksaw through barred doors, use a skeleton key to unlock padlocked doors, throw a net on a player to stop them in their tracks or use secret passageways to maneuver your way to the other side.&#10;&#10;The game is easy to learn and quick to play. With the tiles acting as the &quot;board&quot;, there is a new outcome to each game every time the tiles and cards are shuffled.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players will play student cards to the board that advance forward every turn. Once your student and an enemy's student land on the same space they will perform a face-off, a rock-paper-scissors battle of athletes, misfits, and preps. The loser drops out and the winner continues on. Once a student gets to the opponent's side they will be added to the graduating class. Once players have 10 GPA in their graduating class they win. Players can use single use event cards to drastically alter the board to their advantage. There are also several game modes available to play including a cube draft and a 2 v 2 format with an extra copy of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Once a damaged tile has 3 damage, it immediately flips over to its damaged side. Once the damaged side takes 3 more damage, it is removed from the board.&#10;Players may not damage each other.&#10;&#10;The Capcom Cup:&#10;The Capcom cup is a 1 versus 1 tournament style game mode.

The eaten sushi will be removed from the game.&#10;&#10;However, if it has wasabi in it, the player who eats it loses the game immediately.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#141;&#179;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129; &#230;&#143;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#175;&#191;&#229;&#143;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#230;&#186;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;2&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#148;&times;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#142;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#155;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#136;1&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#173;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;1&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#142;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;1&#228;&#186;&#186;&#232;&#168;&#136;6&#229;&#128;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#228;&#184;&#173;1&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#141;&#179;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#229;&#140;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

The players are divided into three camps: mafia, citizens and outlaws. The game is played in the same way as a regular werewolf game, but with the added bonus of having a weapon of choice for each position. In addition, the game progresses faster because there are players in all camps with the ability to kill. It is a werewolf game with 'half the time, twice the deduction'.&#10;&#10;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#175;1920&#229;&#185;&#180;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#181;&#183;&#231;&#167;&#159;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#232;&#186;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#175;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#232;&#190;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#153;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#232;&#129;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#230;&#183;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#174;&#186;&#229;&#174;&#179;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#232;&#129;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#141;&#138;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When Nagash resolved to conquer Ghur, Kainan's Reapers were amongst the first forces he despatched, the tithekeepers sent to call in ancient debts and claim osseous stockpiles that might be used to bolster the Bonereapers' advance. The Mortisan Executioner Mir Kainan was charged with collecting the long-overdue tithe of the Silent People. When they arrived in Beastgrave, Kainan's Reapers found the Silent People had fled, their regular migration cycle interrupted by the mountain's anguished raging. They did not intend to return empty-handed, however. Direchasm's depths held countless ancient bones, and many rival warbands would pay the price for the Silent People's delinquency.&#10;&#10;Bringing hitting power, magic, and disposable bone constructs to the living mountain, Kainan's Reapers are an incredibly flexible warband. Emphasise your preferred play style through the use of a range of warband-specific and universal cards, and their new tithe mechanic will help you inspire your warband. This set also features universal cards for any warband in Warhammer Underworlds, while a free downloadable warscroll lets you fight with Kainan's Reapers in Warhammer Age of Sigmar.&#10;&#10;This set contains:&#10;&#10;     6x push-fit Kainan's Reapers miniatures &ndash; no glue required to assemble&#10;     6x fighter cards, representing each warrior in your games &ndash; Kainan, Karu, Nohem, Senha, Hakor, and Binar Khenta&#10;     A further 62 playable cards (only available in this set) to enhance your fighters and provide new tactics and challenges for your games of Warhammer Underworlds: Direchasm, including:&#10;     12x Kainan's Reapers objective cards&#10;     10x Kainan's Reapers upgrade cards&#10;     10x Kainan's Reapers ploy cards&#10;     10x Universal objective cards, usable by any warband&#10;     10x Universal upgrade cards, usable by any warband&#10;     7x Universal gambit cards, usable by any warband&#10;     3x Universal gambit spell cards, usable by any wizard&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The recommended board sizes are between 5x5 and 9x9. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.&#10;&#10;A group is a stone along with all other like-colored stones one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent stones of its color. The size of a group is the number of stones in it.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty square and move all stones adjacent to it one square directly away from it.&#10;&#10;If a stone is moved to an occupied square, the stone that was originally on that square is moved one square in the same direction as the stone that landed on it, and so on.&#10;&#10;If a stone lands outside the board, said stone is moved to the farthest square in the opposite direction, next to the edge of the board. If this square is already occupied, the stone on that square is moved one square directly toward your newly placed stone, and so on.&#10;&#10;If two stones are moved to the same previously empty square, the one of those two stones that moved toward or past your newly placed stone is returned to its original square. If this square contains another stone that was moved on the same turn, said stone is also returned to its original square, and so on.&#10;&#10;Your newly placed stone cannot be moved. Any stone landing on it is returned to its original square, along with all other stones that were moved in the same or the opposite direction as that stone.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the board is full. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. If the board is empty, whoever added the last stone to the board loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsSquared: A player's score is the sum of the squares of the sizes of their groups. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. Komi is used instead of the pie rule. Komi is the even number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Like Mr. Franklin, Chuck Glass or Tammy Tomahawks, every criminal is unique and has their own ridiculous crime, fighting style and gang that they belong to. Look out for your bounty cards, these give bigger rewards for completing their specific task, keep these secret from the other players as you all take it in turns around the table.&#10;&#10;The game is played around the the town, five buildings set up in the middle of the players where you draw cards from, or send criminals to jail.&#10;&#10;Each player has their criminal lineup in front of them, these are the criminals you have in custody, but don't get cocky! A unique game mechanic means that other players can take any card from your hand! (As long as they leave a bribe)  But be warned, after every completed bounty comes an Event card, something to add the wild in to the west, these cards could benefit or hinder your progress and make you change strategy!&#10;&#10;Every card is unique and the setup is randomised ensuring that no two games are ever the same.  There are all kinds of tricks, special abilities, techniques and strategies to find so I cant wait to see what wild journeys you have.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Not That Funny is a tabletop game designed to uncover the damaging truths behind everyday jokes and microaggressions directed at marginalized groups and individuals. A minimum of three players are needed to play this game.&#10;&#10;Each player should select seven Response Cards to start, and should always have that amount before the start of each round. Each player selects one Time-Out Card at the start of the game, and keeps it handy in case the game gets a little too fiery.&#10;&#10;The shortest person will start the game as the &quot;selector.&quot;  After each round, the person to the selector's right will take on that duty&mdash;and so on, until the game ends. The selector chooses one Situation Card from the top of the deck at the start of the round, and reads it out loud. Then, each player picks the Response Card they think fits best, and discreetly hands it over to the selector. The selector chooses &quot;the best&quot; Response Card, and that player is awarded one point.&#10;&#10;If the chosen card is an NTF (Not That Funny) Response Card, another point is up for grabs.  All players EXCEPT the player that laid the NTF card can attempt to explain to the selector why the phrase is harmful or problematic. The selector decides which of the explanations is the most accurate, and awards that player a bonus point. If the selector determines that none of the players were able to answer correctly, the player that laid the NTF Response Card will be awarded the extra point.&#10;&#10;The best way to keep score is to return the winning Response Card and NTF Response Card to the player that earned the point. We suggest 10 points to win the game. However, you can choose a higher or lower point goal depending on how long you want to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As a wizard at the School of Sorcery, summon the powers of Orinitin, Sloankai, and Cranaj as you attempt to gain friends and influence at the school. Along with these pets come five new cards with unique powers.&#10;&#10;The School of Sorcery Pet Pack includes one instruction card, three pet cards, and five new sorcery cards. The pet cards introduce a new mechanic into the game, while the five new sorcery cards--Slingshot, Icarus Stone, Flaming Sword, Curse, and Cloak--introduce new powers to the normal game.&#10;&#10;To use the pet cards, place them face-up in the supply. If you play the &quot;cast no crystals&quot; card, you send a crystal to one of the pets.  If both players have a crystal on the pet card, the crystals are removed. If only one player has a crystal on a pet card, that player befriends the pet and may use the pet's power once per round. Orinitin allows you to take a crystal any time your opponent wins a card. With Sloankai, your score is increased by one for each crystal. Cranaj allows you to adjust a die up or down one pip.&#10;&#10;To use the new sorcery cards, shuffle them into the deck and play normally. The three immediate use cards are Slingshot, Icarus Stone, and Flaming Sword. With Slingshot, you remove all crystals from one location (if you have fewer VPs). Icarus Stone allows you to remove one crystal from any location. After getting Flaming Sword, you flip the top card in the deck and use its power (but only if it is a one-time-use card). The two one-time-use cards include Curse and Cloak. Curse allows you to turn an opponent die to any result and Cloak allows you to remove an opponent crystal from the portal.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It&rsquo;s the bottom of the ninth, score tied, one out, and a runner on third. Your opponent is playing his infield in, looking for a squeeze play. Your batter&rsquo;s a weak hitter. Will you try the squeeze anyway &ndash; or let him swing away? Will you hold your runner at third except for a hit or error? The game is on the line&hellip;. What will you do?&#10;&#10;Major league baseball is the most popular summer sport in the USA, with a fan base of many millions. D20 Baseball is a card (and dice) driven simulation of the game, playable in about an hour. It&rsquo;s based on current statistics, and will delight fans with realistic play and accurate results. No teams, so it's just you against your opponent on equal terms.&#10;&#10;During the game, players select a card from their hands for each batter&rsquo;s plate appearance, sometimes face up, sometimes face down. When revealed, only one of the cards will be used to determine the outcome: hit, walk, out, etc. A D20 (20-sided die) is often used to select one of multiple results on a card. The two played cards can also determine which player must play his or her card face up for the next plate appearance.&#10;&#10;D20 Baseball  follows all rules and tactics of major league baseball, and includes sacrifices, squeeze plays, stolen bases, stretching for an extra base, playing the infield in, and so forth. Unlike other boardgames where the dice-rolling becomes tedious, in D20 Baseball you&rsquo;ll feel tension from the card play &ndash; and that you&rsquo;ve actually been in a real game after nine innings. Highly portable and easy to play, D20 Baseball is sure to please baseball aficionados of all ages.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer'&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ghosts of Saltmarsh is an expansion for any standalone title in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure System board game series, and it features new adventures, map tiles, monsters, traps, and spells. To use this expansion, select your favorite heroes from one of the existing games, then dive into this new campaign!&#10;&#10;The King of Keoland, after unsuccessful expansion to the north, has turned his eyes southward, to Saltmarsh, with the intention of turning this village into an important port to increase the stature of his kingdom &mdash; but not everyone in the village is happy about the new developments, and old enemies fight for control, unaware of a new enemy about to rear its ugly head.&#10;&#10;You come through the town gates and cross Sharkfin Bridge...to the screams of townsfolk and the unmistakable sounds of fighting. You do not know the situation but you are sure you are needed.&#10;&#10;Return to the classic gameplay of the D&amp;D Adventure System, with some exciting new changes! You'll still take on the role of a D&amp;D hero, with thematic skills and abilities, either on your own or as a group of up to five adventurers. You'll face multiple scenarios in an overarching campaign, evolving and leveling up your character on the way. You'll explore treacherous dungeons, avoid deadly traps, and defeat terrifying monsters. You can also play your favorite scenarios on their own as a standalone experience!&#10;&#10;Ghosts of Saltmarsh includes eight new highly-detailed Sahuagin miniatures, including two powerful new villains to encounter in your adventures! You'll add these to the miniatures from your Adventure System Games to populate the board, using included tokens to represent any monsters you may not already have. (If you do own the related games, feel free to replace the token with the appropriate miniature!)&#10;&#10;In addition to the &quot;exploring&quot; adventures familiar to fans of Adventure System games, where tiles come out one by one, there are adventures that take place in the town of Saltmarsh itself, a set map made up of six double-sized tiles, where you'll fight to keep villagers safe from monsters after their own ends. It's an exciting and different game mode, where without exploration, the new Adventure deck provides the challenges and surprises that stand between the Heroes and success.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Dungeon Command: Blood of Gruumsh&#10;    Dungeon Command: Curse of Undeath&#10;    Dungeon Command: Sting of Lolth&#10;    Dungeon Command: Tyranny of Goblins&#10;    Dungeon Command: Heart of Cormyr&#10;&#10;&#10;Can also integrate with:&#10;&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: The Legend of Drizzt Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Tomb of Annihilation Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Waterdeep &#226;&#128;&#147; Dungeon of the Mad Mage Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Ghosts of Saltmarsh Board Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mega Empires is a strategy board game for 3-18 players that covers the development of civilizations through history, from the Stone Age to the Late Iron Age. It consists of standalone games Mega Empires: The West (2019) and Mega Empires: The East (2021), which can be combined into a single game.&#10;&#10;In this colossal game, players lead their historic civilization as they gain victory points by expanding their population, building cities, trading and developing their knowledge and culture. Notwithstanding its large scope, the game's core mechanics are straightforward and easy to learn. A key element in the game is player interaction as they position themselves on the map board and search for valuable commodities during interactive trading sessions.&#10;&#10;Scope&#10;Mega Empires covers two standalone games Mega Empires: The West and Mega Empires: The East. These games can be played standalone with as many as 9 players or combined with a maximum of 18 players, and take up to 12 hours to complete.&#10;&#10;Where The West concentrates on the Mediterranean Sea, which stimulates movement by ship, The East covers Northeast Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Southwest Asia, and has a stronger focus on movement by land. Both games were designed as equally balanced counterparts, albeit with unique characteristics.&#10;&#10;The game was designed to be the biggest board game in the world that can be played in a single day in one room. When combined, the map board measures over 2 meters (80 inch) in width. Despite its ambitions about size and duration, Mega Empires can be scaled down to as few as 3 players (The East) or 5 players (The West), and both games also include a scenario for playing a shorter game through an accelerated start.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player starts their civilization in the Stone Age with a single population token on the board. As the game progresses, the population will expand, spread over the board, sometimes engage in conflict, and build cities. Cities bring resources and wealth, expressed in trade cards. The more cities players manage to build on the board, the more trade cards they receive. Trade cards are mainly valuable commodities, but sometimes turn out to be disastrous calamities.&#10;&#10;Trade&#10;Trading is the heart of the game, a social experience where all players interact with each other to optimize the value of their sets of commodities. In addition to the desired commodities, calamities are secretly traded as well, adding an additional layer to the trading dynamics. Once the trading phase has ended, players that end up with a calamity in their hand will suffer its effects.&#10;&#10;Develop Civilization Advances&#10;When the smoke of trading and resolving calamities has settled, players can decide how to spend the wealth gathered through trading. The game includes 51 different advances that can be developed, each of which provides benefits in the game to its holder. For example, Metal Working provides an advantage when fighting conflicts, Architecture facilitates city construction and Enlightenment reduces the impact of (civil) calamities.&#10;&#10;The 51 Civilization advances are divided into the categories Arts, Crafts, Science, Civics and Religion, each of which has specific powers. Each advance acquired by a player provides discounts to other advances that can be purchased later in the game, thereby creating a path of strategic decisions. The ultimate advance in the game, Wonder of the World, is only in reach for players who manage both their trading and purchasing strategy very well.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game&#10;The players who have best developed their position on the board whilst avoiding making enemies, and defended their civilization against natural or civic calamities and stand the test of time, will eventually gather the most victory points and compete for winning the game. After up to 12 hours of playing, that is.&#10;&#10;Expansions&#10;Mega Empires: The Special Buildings (2024) is an expansion set that provides additional flavor to the game through 18 miniatures of ancient buildings historically associated with each of the civilizations in the game. These buildings can be built on the map board and provide additional benefits in play and victory points to their controller.&#10;&#10;Accessories&#10;The Mega Empires: The West &#226;&#128;&#147; Deluxe Game Mat (2024) and Mega Empires: The East &#226;&#128;&#147; Deluxe Game Mat (2024) are neoprene game mats at 125% scale of the original cardboard maps that offer an enlarged playing area and high-quality design for easier and more immersive gameplay.&#10;&#10;The Mega Empires: Identifier Cards Bonus Pack (2024) is a set with 18 large player identifier cards, one for each of the Civilizations included in Mega Empires. These can be used for distributing the civilizations among the players during setup, to identify which stack of Civilization Advances belongs to which player, or to divide acquired cards from not yet acquired ones during the game.&#10;&#10;Wrap-up&#10;Mega Empires is a long strategic board game about development, trade, culture, politics and showing resilience when dealing with calamities. The game is a perfect fit for larger groups of strategic board game enthusiasts, which, due to its scalability, can also be played in smaller groups. It is not just a game, it is an experience!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

Everyone knows that a well-placed Butterfly Weed can set you apart from the crowd. Of course, sometimes the most important part of being a trendsetter is knowing when to buck the trend. Should orange blooms become popular, you&rsquo;ll need to know when to quit.&#10;&#10;If you're comfortable with the harmonious blend of pinks and purples in the base game of Tussie Mussie, the Orange Flowers expansion is the perfect way to add a pop of color to an old favorite. Orange flowers push the player interaction with their diverse scoring: depending on which you find first, you may want to gather them all for yourself or spread them around the table. There&rsquo;s also the Nasturtium, a potentially powerful (though situational) card that lets the player reorder their arrangement before scoring. Don&rsquo;t let another player find out why its meaning is &ldquo;victory shall be ours&rdquo;!&#10;&#10;",

Be sparing with your greenery, however: this is still a flower arrangement, after all.&#10;&#10;The Greenery expansion introduces 5 cards that work in an all-new way. Greenery cards are great for adding a few extra points to your arrangement...as long as you don&rsquo;t go overboard. One will do just fine; any more than that and you&rsquo;ll lose points. Every face-down offer could be the Greenery that tips the balance, adding a delightful layer to the already rich decision-making of Tussie Mussie.&#10;&#10;",

The new waypoints are compatible with every map (even that of the Project Athena expansion) and hide many dangers: you will risk suffering a lot of damage and running into many radioactive areas, but you may also have the opportunity to find a refuge that shelters you from enemy fire.&quot;&#10;&#10;It adds an alternative, print-and-play set of waypoint tokens compatible with the base game and Project Athena maps. These waypoints are more dangerous than regular ones.&#10;The list of the tokens includes:&#10;2x regular radiation&#10;1x radiation + bullets&#10;1x radiation + gas&#10;1x radiation + object&#10;1x radiation + hit&#10;1x hit + food&#10;1x double hit&#10;1x hit + object&#10;1x hideout&#10;&#10;The only special waypoint is the hideout: enemies and players outside cannot attack those inside.

Along the way, you and your opponents will help industrialize Japan's largest island, upgrading low-paying dits into profitable cities. (In fact, failing to do so will result in end-game penalties!) Of course, cities can be tokened, allowing you to create chokepoints on the fly. A nasty, nasty map.&#10;&#10;The second map shifts the scene to exotic and fantastical Wisconsin. This is a sprawling &quot;big money&quot; map for three to five players. The major gimmick here is that there are nine 5Ts, and these trains are &quot;diesels&quot; &ndash; running as far as you like along a stretch of compatible track. Plan carefully in the early game, and you can end up with a triple-digit run in the last couple Operating Rounds. But an inconvenient change in gauge or station can stop your diesel before it leaves the station.&#10;&#10;When the base game came &quot;back in print&quot; in 2021, we added Company Charter cards. Those cards are also included in this expansion for our early adopters.&#10;&#10;",

They may even sneak into a castle in order to steal gold or rescue a peasant in the dungeon.&#10;&#10;As the Merry Men earn more experience points, they will continue to improve their skills.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal of your Merry Men is to arm the towns of Nottingham Shire, convince them to rebel and attack Nottingham Castle, and remove the Sheriff from power before December 31st, 1180. To accomplish this, the Merry Men must increase Loyalty of the town to 10, plus arm the town with 10 weapons. The more towns that take part in the rebellion, the better chance they will have of succeeding in defeating Nottingham Castle and removing the Sheriff from power. But if the towns fail to remove the Sheriff before December 31st, the Merry Men will all be automatically hunted down and executed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In the game, players manage their actions at the expense of working hours of which each player only has a limited amount for each round. Thus, resource management will be a key factor to win the game. Working hours can be used for lobbying politicians, getting an intern to receive additional working hours, receiving effect cards, or acquiring courses and projects which will educate your character and provide you with additional income.    While the game is round based, players can also take an active role, even if it is not their turn, by playing effect cards or participate in auctions for either projects or courses.&#10;&#10;The base game can be played in three different versions. Which allow players to opt between an asymmetrical and symmetrical gameplay or change the numbers of components in the game to adjust the difficulty of play.&#10;&#10;While the game mechanics require a strategic mindset, the actual theme of the game is a satire about the consulting industry. Effects like &ldquo;Auditor&rdquo; who is displayed as a blind person and approves important documents with his stamp, should remind players how shady the industry can be (Auditing firms caused the financial crisis in 2008 because they assigned ratings without evaluating them properly).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The local townsfolk fear the return of three notorious outlaws who they helped send to prison years ago, and when a mysterious gunfighter rides into town unannounced, the citizens of Lagos beg him for help.

    "Description": "Game of the Year is a thematic board game about making video games. It can be played solo, competitively or cooperatively.&#10;&#10;In each session, players takes on the role of a video game publisher and release up to three titles. Players win if they are awarded Game of the Year. If they fail to be awarded Game of the Year (or run out of money prematurely) they lose.&#10;&#10;A title is created in three phases. In the pitch phase, players combine a genre card with 1-2 themes and 2-3 features drafted from a shared pool. In the development phase, players choose from separate pools of dice employees to generate resources. These resources are used to complete the title's themes and features. In the release phase, the title is compared with a rival in order to determine its success.&#10;&#10;Players must skilfully use resources to create stars and avoid bugs in order to succeed in the competitive video game marketplace. The rewards for doing so include money (used to play dice employees), tech tokens (used to remove bugs), reward cards (which grant players unique abilities), and additional hype (which must be maintained otherwise the company is forced to close).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Finders Creeperz&quot; is a uniquely clever and challenging game that requires a combination of strategy, luck and killer instinct.  A plethora of different gameplay scenarios will unfold giving a different outcome every time and fun for all of the family. The aim of the game is to trick and capture your opponents with the help of your CREEPER, action cards and traps (pre-game traps and on board traps) leaving you in the clear to get around the board and take the win. It's high paced from start to finish and you can be called in to action on anyone's turn. Just because your go is done, you are most certainly not safe. The attack/question cards are hectic and full of twists. Those who you think are your friends often turn out to be enemies and you are all but guaranteed to have to choose between one friend or another. We take no responsibility for any arguments that follow. Do you trap your kid or let your partner win? Will you put yourself in a trap just to send your best friend back to the start? OF COURSE YOU WILL! Be ruthless. Be bold.&#10;&#10;Yes, we know that the vast majority of games claim to be equally as fun for parents as it is for kids but this one actually is... Trust me, as a parent there is little I enjoy more than the look on a kid's face go from joy and smugness when they think they are going to win, to despair and anger when they slowly realise they most certainly are not. It's like a fun punishment. &quot;Funishment,&quot; if you will... After all, they'd most certainly do it to you! Life isn't fair and they will soon realise this.&#10;&#10;",
