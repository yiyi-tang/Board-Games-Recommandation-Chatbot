    "Description": "&quot;At the heart of the Royal Blue Sea, a position in the Council of the Great City of Menhos, political and economic capital of the Kelonic archipelago is now vacant. The leaders of the smaller islands eagerly seek to obtain that seat by gaining more influence through commerce and production.&#10;    Trof&iacute;, the island of fishing and agriculture; Eide, the land of great sawmills; Calkino the island of bronze foundries; Latomeia, the quarry of the high seas; and Kras&iacute;, producers of the best grapes; all of them try to gain their place among the families that rule the Council, the capital&rsquo;s founding families of a long tradition of master craftsmen. In their efforts, the emissaries of these islands can take the advantage of the founding families&rsquo; favour they obtain when gaining influence in the city or in exchange for a price.&quot;&#10;    &quot;Emporous&quot; tells a story in two chapters, the second one being a more complex option for players who enjoy bluffing and negotiating in a more intense way. We advice to play the First Chapter before proceeding with the Second one, but that's not mandatory.&#10;    In &quot;Emporous&quot; you are the sailing emissary of an island -called  &quot;Emporous&quot;- dedicated to raw material production, islands that compete to have the most economic influence in the Capital city, Menhos. As such, you must find the fastest way to acquire influence points by fulfilling contracts, commissioning artisan works and gaining Masteries. The First Chapter of our Story, &quot;Kelonic Islands&quot;, is about these struggles.&#10;    The game develops in a series of turns, in which you'll have to make a Trip, choosing whether to &quot;Travel to your Island&quot; to recover all your spent coins and bring back some raw materials your island produces; or to &quot;Travel to the city&quot; to perform one action, such as using your available resources to acquire different ones, to commission artisan works or fulfill your contracts. On the other hand, you can complete your objetives faster if you have the Council&rsquo;s Seal, which grants you access to the benefits of having the founding families&rsquo; favour, Seal which you can obtain by gaining influence in the city or by giving the Council one of your coins.&#10;    The Second Chapter of our Story, &quot;The Council of Menhos&quot; tells the real reasons behind all the changes in the Council, in which our Emporous will get tangled in a more complicated web of relationships with the council and with each other. In this Chapter, you'll have to complete Clandestine Tasks acquired during the game before it's end, while trying to get influence as fast as possible. If you fail to fulfill one or more of these tasks, you'll lose influece for each one of them.&#10;    The graphic design in this game has been specificaly though of and developed for being accessible for people with a colour blindness condition, especially for protanopia and deuteranopia.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&quot;En el coraz&oacute;n del mar Turqu&iacute;, uno de los asientos del Concejo de la Gran Ciudad de Menhos, capital pol&iacute;tica y econ&oacute;mica del archipi&eacute;lago Kelonico, ha quedado vacante. Los l&iacute;deres de las islas m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;as buscan &aacute;vidamente obtener ese esca&ntilde;o ganando influencia a trav&eacute;s del comercio y la producci&oacute;n.&#10;Trof&iacute;, la isla de la pesca y la agricultura; Eide, la tierra de los grandes aserraderos; Calkino la isla de las fundiciones de bronce; Latomeia, la cantera de altamar; y Kras&iacute;, productores de la mejor vid; todos intentan ganar un lugar entre las familias que dominan el Concejo, familias fundadoras de la capital y de una larga tradici&oacute;n de maestros artesanos. En sus esfuerzos, los emisarios de estas islas podr&aacute;n sacar ventaja de los favores de estas familias fundadoras que obtienen al ganar influencia en la ciudad o a cambio de un precio&quot;.&#10;    &quot;Emporous&quot; cuenta una historia en dos Cap&iacute;tulos, siendo el segundo una opci&oacute;n m&aacute;s compleja para jugadores que disfrutan el &quot;bluff&quot; y la negociaci&oacute;n un poco m&aacute;s intensa. Aconsejamos jugar el Primer Cap&iacute;tulo antes de proceder con el Segundo, aunque ello no es obligatorio.&#10;    En &quot;Emporous&quot; eres el emisario navegante -llamado &quot;Emporous&quot;- de una isla productora de materias primas del archipi&eacute;lago que compiten por obtener la mayor influencia econ&oacute;mica en la ciudad capital, Mehnos. Como tal, deber&aacute;s buscar la forma m&aacute;s r&aacute;pida de conseguir puntos de influencia a trav&eacute;s de contratos, artesan&iacute;as y maestr&iacute;as. El Primer Cap&iacute;tulo de nuestra historia, &quot;Las Islas Kel&oacute;nicas&quot;, se trata de estos esfuerzos.&#10;    El juego se realiza en una serie de turnos de jugador, en que deber&aacute;s realizar un Viaje, decidiendo entre Viajar a tu Isla a buscar tu producci&oacute;n y recuperar tus monedas, o Viajar a la Ciudad para realizar una acci&oacute;n como usar tus recursos disponibles para adquirir otros, encargar artesan&iacute;as y cumplir con tus contratos. Por otra parte, podr&aacute;s completar tus objetivos mucho m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido si cuentas con el Sello del Concejo que te permite acceder a los beneficios de contar con el favor de las familias influyentes de Menhos, Sello que obtienes cuando ganas influencia en la ciudad o pagando una de tus monedas a las familias fundadoras.&#10;    El Segundo Cap&iacute;tulo de nuestra historia, &quot;El Concejo de Menhos&quot;, cuenta las verdaderas razones tras los cambios en le Concejo, en el que nuestros Emporous se ver&aacute;n enredados en una red de relaciones m&aacute;s complicada tanto con el Concejo como con los dem&aacute;s jugadores. En este Cap&iacute;tulo deber&aacute;s completar Tareas Clandestinas adquiridas durante la partida antes de que &eacute;sta termine, mientras intentas conseguir la mayor cantidad de influencia lo m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido posible. Si no consigues completar una o m&aacute;s de estas Tareas, perder&aacute;s influencia por cada una de ellas.&#10;    El dise&ntilde;o gr&aacute;fico de este juego ha sido expresamente pensado y desarrollado para ser accesible para personas con daltonismo, especialmente protanop&iacute;a y deuteranop&iacute;a.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer (Spanish)&#10;&#10;",

There must have been something in the water where they grew up! Lucien (&lsquo;The Silver Bullet&rsquo;, according to his official merchandise) was the first to rise to fame, as team captain and star Blitzer of the Galadrieth Gladiators. Under his leadership they won Blood Bowl X and Lucien himself amassed a serious haul of awards and plaudits. His brother Valen later followed in his footsteps, captaining the Elfheim Eagles and setting them up as one of the most promising new teams in the league. In recent years, tired of competing to top the leaderboards, the twins have begun hiring out their services as a pair.&#10;&#10;This multipart resin kit contains the components necessary to assemble The Swift Twins. These models are a pair of Star Players for High Elf, Dark Elf and Elven Union Blood Bowl teams &ndash; they refuse to work alone, only as a pair. This means they&rsquo;re quite expensive, but worth the gold &ndash; you won&rsquo;t find a finer Thrower and Blitzer. The rules for using the Swift Twins can be found in The Inaugural Blood Bowl Almanac.&#10;&#10;This kit comes as 12 components, and is supplied with 2 32mm Blood Bowl bases.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Place an unused droplet of each player's color on the leftmost test tube (&quot;15&quot; for the brown side, &quot;12&quot; for the green side).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay:Whenever you get the opportunity to move your droplet forward in the course of the game, you may either move your droplet in your cauldron as normal or you may move your droplet on the test tube stand one test tube to the right.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Scoring:Brown side: At the end of the game, all players empty their bags and add up the values of all of their chips in their bag and cauldron (white chips included). Each player divides their total value by the value of the test tube their droplet is at on the test tube stand, and this number is added as VP to their final score. For example, if the chips in your bag and cauldron add up to 60, you would gain 4 VP if your droplet is at &quot;15&quot; (60 divided by 15), but if you managed to get your droplet all the way to &quot;2&quot; you would gain 30 VP (60 divided by 2)!&#10;&#10;Green side: During the course of the game, players may buy VP with their shopping coins in addition to buying ingredients. The price for each VP for a player is determined by the value of the test tube their droplet is at on the test tube stand. Players may purchase as many VP each round as they want and can afford.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are already dead. One way or another, you have fallen to the lich Yor'Mir. They have locked your soul within their phylactery, along with their other victims they have slain. Within this cursed orb exists a demi plane known as the Ragnorwald. A cursed forest with one purpose: to kill its residents. Death is not permanent within this realm, but it is costly. With each death, the victim loses a cherished memory, which forms into ghostly blue crystals known as Essence. This Essence is what Yor'Mir desires, and as such is used as currency within the Ragnorwald. Once drained of all your memories, you become Forgotten.&#10;&#10;But fear not, all hope is not lost. There is a way out, a gate which Yor'Mir uses to check on the Ragnorwald. Two small problems: First, whenever someone uses the gate, the Ragnorwald is reset. The second is the gate is guarded by a Keeper, a twisted monstrosity placed by Yor'Mir to keep the residence of the forest from escaping. Luckily for you, you are a Champion. A being capable of Awakening these memories. Remember your powers from your past life, collect essence to purchase powerful Items, and defeat the Keeper. However, you are not the only one with this plan... Race to be the first to slay the Keeper, lest you lose your progress when the plane is reset.&#10;&#10;Journey Into the Beyond is an asymmetrical competitive tableau building adventure game. Inspired by epic fantasy games such as Talisman, Runebound and Mage Knight, Journey takes these long winded, large scale games and condenses it into a shorter more palatable experience. Players will notice right away that in the Ragnorwald, death is not only common and inconsequential, but often convenient. Fast paced highly strategic deterministic combat keeps the game flowing, and it's heavy player vs player elements keeps players interested even when it isn't their turn. Move around the board, choosing which stories to Encounter. Each Encounter type offers different risks and rewards, from fighting Goblins, exploring Dungeons, and even discovering critical information about the Ragnorwald itself.&#10;&#10;Tabletop Simulator Link&#10;https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1510019854&#10;&#10;Discord&#10;https://discord.gg/GnV5TpyMAg&#10;&#10;YouTube Tutorials&#10;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSq5JJx-Oy7wecuwMQBVirw&#10;&#10;",

The only way to escape those starving creatures is to find other lost kids and stay close to them at all times.

By using evil thoughts, fear, hunger and loneliness, they lure their victims and snatch them, one by one, to devour them in the dark. In the end, only one lost child will find his way home. The others will never be seen again.&quot; Lost in the rain is a short roleplaying game of sadness and horror which invites you to take on the role of a child, lost in the great city and hunted by mysterious creatures.&#10;&#10;Every player gets ten tokens at the start of the game. When a player loses their last token, the sirains eat them. Each turn (called a chapter) a player will be the main child for this chapter. The other players will play their child but also the sirains and the environment. Every time a player describes something that is frightening or harmful for the main child, the main child loses one token.&#10;When only one child remains, their player can describe how their child finds the way back to their home.&#10;&#10;",

Players will need to combine 20 points of purple tool cards. &#10;Players will need to negotiate to decide who will defeat each room card, and how the loot will be split. The combination of players that can play the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The game is finished when all jobs are complete. Players should count their loot. &#10;Their tool cards are also worth the value they were purchased for. &#10;Cards from a player&rsquo;s starting hand have no value.&#10;The winner is the player with the highest total.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Place the castle on any castle space on your player board (The A side is better for beginners, the B side for advanced players). Take 3 random goods and put them next to the board. In solo game there is no restriction for the number of different types (= colors) of goods that you can collect.&#10;&#10;Choose a color and take both playing pieces and dice of that color, plus the white die. Place one of your pieces on space 0 of the victory point track as a victory point counter and the other piece on the 50 as target marker. Continue setting up the game as usual for a 2-player game (hex tiles, goods, etc.)&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;You are playing 25 rounds. At the beginning of each round, throw all 3 dice:&#10;&#10;- First, take the topmost goods tile and place it on the depot indicated by the white die.&#10;&#10;- Then remove a hex tile from that depot from the game, starting from the top to bottom (depots 2, 3, 5 and 6) or left to right (depots 1 and 4) respectively. If a depot is empty, remove a hex tile from the next depot in clockwise order etc.&#10;&#10;Next, perform your 2 dice actions as usual, with the same effects and victory point gains as in the base game, except for the following restrictions and changes:&#10;&#10;- You can only expand to other territories via the rivers.&#10;&#10;- Whenever you place a ship, take all goods from a depot of your choice, then immediately remove all other goods from all other depots from the game.&#10;&#10;In addition, you now (and only now!) have the option to exchange any 5 of your goods for a single tile from the black depot (the 5 goods tiles are removed from the game). Place that tile face down (i.e. its black side up) on one of your three storage spaces. A &quot;black tile&quot; can be placed on any color space on your board, as long as you follow the base game placement rules. Placing a black tile helps you to complete a region (to gain victory points, a color bonus and for winning the game) but has no other effects.&#10;&#10;For example: a &quot;black mine&quot; won't generate Silverlings at the beginning of the phase. A &quot;black ship&quot; gains neither goods nor the option to exchange 5 goods for a &quot;black tile&quot;.&#10;&#10;- Victory points from a yellow Knowledge tile are added immediately after placing it (instead of at the end of the game).&#10;&#10;- You won't gain victory points as color bonus when completing a color. Instead, choose a tile from the black depot and place it directly on the board, with all its effects, following the base game placement rules. If that completes another color, take an additional tile from the black depot (if available), place it on your board, etc.&#10;&#10;- Whenever you gain victory points, move your victory point counter that many spaces. In addition you may buy now further victory points. Each victory point costs 1 Silverling.&#10;&#10;When your victory point counter reaches the target victory point marker, put it back on space 0 (any remaining victory points are lost), then move the target marker down 5 space (e.g. from 50 to 45, next time to 40 etc).&#10;Immediately after resetting the victory point counter you may carry out a dice action of your choice (just as if you had added a castle to your estate).&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;You win the game if you manage to occupy all 37 hex spaces of your estate within 25 rounds.&#10;&#10;",

To do so they take turns rolling a six sided die and simply move that number of spaces on the gameboard.&#10;&#10;There are three types of spaces you may land on. Drink spaces require pulling a drink card from a pile in the center of the gameboard and simply taking that number of drinks before throwing the card in a discard pile to be shuffled and placed back in the center when there are no more drink cards to draw.&#10;&#10;Fight spaces require the player to draw a fight card from the pile in the center of the board. These unique characters all have a power rating from 1 to 6. The player then has to roll a six sided die against the power of the fight card. If they win they keep the card and can use it once against their opponents to knock them back on the gameboard a number of spaces equal to the power of the card. If they lose they drink the difference of their roll and the power of the fight card as well as move back that many spaces on the gameboard.&#10;&#10;The third type of spaces are home and the bar themselves. These are safe spaces where no fighting can occur. Otherwise no two players can occupy the same space on the board and will have to fight each other (by each rolling dice) to see who stays on the space and who gets bumped back the difference of the two rolls on the gameboard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It's said that he is not an albino by birth, but rather became one due to a botched witchery. It's not known by anyone but Elisa why Mogba'gh is here or what he aims to do, but so far everyone has been very content with the idea of having another magus in their midst, even one as strange as him.&#10;&#10;Mogba'ghs pointily filed teeth, his general behaviour and dark stories about culinary pleasures have formed a reputation of a repugnant, barbaric cannibal that he seems to enjoy and cultivate at every possible moment.&#10;&#10;Mogba&rsquo;gh offers a versatile and unique hero addition to your Perdition&rsquo;s Mouth. A close range magic user with a wide variety of spells, you can make very effective Special combo&rsquo;s with him.&#10;&#10;For quite some time, our fans have asked for Mogba&rsquo;gh to be made available again.

    "Description": "A solitaire Tarot card game of making connections and finding demons.&#10;&#10;In this game you take on the role of a teenage exorcist. You had transferred to this school when you learned of a demon possessing one of the students. As you arrive, you can sense the demon within but cannot pinpoint the exact student.&#10;&#10;During the following schoolyear it&rsquo;s your job to make as many allies as you can, identify your foe and drive out the demon. But remember, the demon will be turning your classmates against you too.&#10;&#10;'&mdash;description from the introduction&#10;&#10;The game is provided as a print-and-play PDF document (25 pages).  Several pages of the document are needed for reference during play (even for experienced players).  Play requires a Tarot deck of cards, though a mapping table can be used to play with a standard pack of French playing cards.  Play involves card distribution into several distinct, named piles (Friend, Classmate, Rival, and Discard).  When play begins, most cards are placed in the Classmate pile representing students.  The goal of play is to transfer cards from the Classmate pile to the Friend pile.  The &quot;demon&quot; works against you, moving cards from the Classmate pile to the Rival pile.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds in three phases.  During the first phase the identity of the &quot;demon&quot; is unknown.  During the second phase the identity of the &quot;demon&quot; is known.  The third phase is the final period of the game when the player and the &quot;demon&quot; have the &quot;final battle&quot; - the outcome of which determines if the solitaire player wins or loses the game.&#10;&#10;The first two phases essentially are discovery and building phases, with the player attempting to gather as many resources as possible (thus denying them to the &quot;demon&quot;) - this is represented by the distribution of cards into the Friends or Rivals piles.  The third phase determines victory in the game - the player wins, or the &quot;demon&quot; wins (thus, the player loses).&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the principle action involves card manipulation to influence a basic card vs. card flip where the winner, by default, is determined by suit and rank (court cards always beat number cards, etc.).  Too, each court card is identified as a specific &quot;student&quot; in the school, and each student has variable power.  For example, &quot;The Sun&quot; equates to student &quot;Hiroko Harunobu&quot; - who has specified powers over &quot;The Moon&quot;.  Unsurprisingly, &quot;The Moon&quot; equates to Hiroko's younger twin, &quot;Horie Harunobu&quot; - who has specified powers over &quot;The Sun&quot;.&#10;&#10;Because the cards are randomly distributed by shuffling, replay will always be unpredictable.  While essentially a solitaire card game at heart, the extended game concept and especially the variable card effects create quite a nuanced game that would lend itself well to an immersive experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
