Manipulating the creature line is essential to solving each round&rsquo;s combat puzzle. It is a battle to stay alive and keep the campfire burning! Use your wits and skill to fight for the light&hellip;or all will perish in the darkness.&#10;&#10;The game ends in victory if the heroes are able to defeat every monster by the end of round 5.

    "Description": "Lords of Lore and Loot is a turn based game that allows each player to build their kingdom from within, explore their surroundings, and defeat the other players. Each round consists of accounting for income, building improvements in their kingdom, training combat units, and exploring the countryside with the player's heroes. The heroes can amass an army of various combat units available to each player in their kingdom according to their faction. They can explore the areas surrounding their kingdom, defeat rogue warbands guarding resources, buildings, mines, and artifacts. Experience is gained from defeating rogue warbands and another player's armies. Those guarded treasures can be used to grow the player's kingdom and armies.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over a series of Weeks (turns) and Months (4 consecutive turns). Each week players collect gold for from their kingdom. Each month players collect resources from their mines and controlled buildings. Each player's turn consists of actions they can perform. Collect gold. Move their hero up to their movement speed. Engage with any space along their moved path. Spend gold on an improvement in their kingdom. Spend experience to level their hero up. Learn spells and abilities to aid their fighting armies. Fight rogue warbands or other players to take control of valuable spaces. Dice, from the d4 up to the d20, will be used to fight and perform abilities. Each player controls a faction with a set list of units with various combat characteristics and prompts for which dice to use.&#10;&#10;The player that conquers all other players or the objectives set out in the chosen scenario wins the game. Conquering a player happens when a player no longer has a kingdom or a hero. They are then removed from the game. Specific scenarios will outline additional game mechanics and win conditions. There is no set number of turns or time limit for the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdoms of Denmark-Norway and Sweden found themselves on opposite sides, and fought several skirmishes in the border areas between the countries. This game deals with the 1814 campaign (a 1808 scenario will be provided later).&#10;&#10;The game is a low-complexity wargame, with units representing battalions of infantry (about 350-400 men), batteries of artillery and squadrons of dragoons and cavalry (about 75-100 men). The Swedes have regular cavalry units like hussars, the Norwegians have dragoons and mounted jaegers. The Swedes enjoy better training, better supplies and more fire power, the Norwegians have advantages in mobility and skirmish ability, employing ski troops and light infantry (jaegers/sharpshooters).&#10;&#10;The game map uses point-to-point movement and covers the border area between Norway and Sweden from Frederikshald (Halden) to Trondheim. The Swedish objective is to break the Norwegian lines and capture Christiania (Oslo), the border forts, (and perhaps Trondheim if they choose to try. The Norwegian objective is to prevent the Swedes from winning by inflicting enough casualties and delay the Swedes long enough to force negotiations to start.&#10;&#10;The game was originally released in 2018 as a zip-lock, hex-based system with a print run of just 100. (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/300929/norwegian-war-independence-1807-1814).&#10;The game has been completely redesigned and is in reality a completely new game on the same topic, rather than a new version of the old game.&#10;&#10;This is the first game in the Scandinavian Wars Trilogy from Pantero Games.&#10;&#10;",

The professionally written and absorbing questions are designed to intrigue, surprise and amuse. All the questions are on the theme of forty, making it wholly suitable for the big occasion.&#10;&#10;Players form two teams which take turns to answer questions.&#10;Correct answers win cards, and the first team to win 7 cards wins.&#10;&#10;If a team answers a question correctly, they can choose to &quot;stick&quot; (which ends their turn) or &quot;play on&quot;. If they play on and get the next question incorrect, they lose all cards they've won on the current turn (i.e. the penalty for not sticking). Ending your turn with a &quot;stick&quot; means you keep your cards, and will not be able to lose them on a future turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Coin Set is a game in which you and a group of friends compete to find patterns and sets in a selection of coins, plucked at random from a bag. Each coin has a number of different characteristics. Your task is to locate sets of three coins where each of these characteristics is either all different, or all the same. And you have to do it quickly &ndash; because everyone&rsquo;s competing at the same time and waiting for the opportunity to spot patterns, shout &ldquo;Set!&rdquo; and claim the coins for themselves.&#10;&#10;The game is played exactly like Set, but the rules simply state the winner is the person who manages to find the most sets during the course of the game. The game ends when the bag is empty and no more sets can be found.&quot;.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s trickier than it might seem, because every one of every coin&rsquo;s four defining characteristics needs to be considered. As a result, Coin Set is a test of your observation and thoroughness as well as how quick-witted you are. If you think you&rsquo;ve found a set, but have failed to consider one of the characteristics, you&rsquo;ll lose three of the coins you&rsquo;ve collected so far. So you need to pay real attention to detail, thinking fast but not being too hasty. One thing is for sure: keeping a cool head will help you find order in the chaos.&#10;&#10;Legend has it that these coins were found at the bottom of the Med by none other than Jacques Cousteau. But whatever the backstory, Coin Set is a quick and quirky brain-teaser, a fast-paced and intermittently frenetic way to test your attention to detail and your ability to see a slightly bigger, more complex picture than one coin alone can show you. Plus: it&rsquo;s small enough to fit in your pocket, and encased in a robust little tin that&rsquo;ll keep it safe wherever you might take it.&#10;&#10;",

Each player plays cards to win tricks against the others over multiple rounds.&#10;&#10;Players score points by winning tricks (or turns), correctly betting how many tricks they will win per round, and successfully executing certain abilities. The game lasts, at a minimum, long enough for each player to be dealer. For longer games, each player may be dealer multiple times. After the final round, the player with the most accumulated points is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is composed of 46 game cards. These cards are divided into three suits: HUMAN, DWARF, and DARK ELF, and one wildcard. Each suit is made up of fifteen different cards, each card having a distinct value, indicated by both the number in the top left and bottom right corners of the card. A card&rsquo;s value is akin to its strength or power. If two cards share the same suit, the card with a higher value will beat the card with a lower value, thus winning the trick (or turn).&#10;&#10;Each round consists of a series of 7 turns for each player, called tricks. Every trick, each player will play one card from their hand face up into the middle. One player will lead (that is, play the first card of the trick), and the others will follow in clockwise order. Based on the cards played, one player will be said to win the trick.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The team that has the majority on top of the wagon wins.&#10;&#10;Travel: 1 to 2 players&#10;The convoy must pass through the 3 steps Mine, Wagon and Customs before arriving. Along the way, the Conveyor tries to fill up with a maximum of Coal, while the Traitor tries to get Werewolves into the Coal. The points are counted individually at the arrival of the convoy.&#10;&#10;Halt: 3 to 6 players&#10;Players exchange cards with the convoy stopped in the center. Each one tries to fill his hand or the convoy with his favorite Cargo cards, unless the Striders come to modify the balance.&#10;&#10;Customs: 3 to 12 joueurs&#10;Each player is responsible for a load (4 or 5 Cargo cards), each in turn takes the role of the customs officer. The customs officer must allow in a load proposed by another player.

Strategies to win include managing resources, maximizing trades, building cards before other players, gaining the right combination of followers so each turn can produce the most resources, gold, and points.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 8 rounds when the eighth fortnight tile (or round tile) is placed on a special fortnight board. The player with the most points wins.  Points are totaled up from building cards, follower cards, gold, monsters defeated, and certain followers' special abilities.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The 5th Key is a medieval turn-based strategy game where the goal is to obtain five or more keys and gain control on the central island. During the game you can use special cards which will give you strategic advantages and are designed to make the game fun and balanced.&#10;&#10;After each round the control of the Castle port changes from one player to the next in clockwise order. A player can use the Explorer Spirit card to obtain the control of the port for the next 2 rounds,. The first player to obtain 5 keys and gain control on the castle port on his turn wins the game.&#10;&#10;Battles are the only way to obtain keys. Every player starts with 3 keys and the remaining 2 keys need to be obtained from the neighbour players, the battle mechanics are based on a simple formula: dice points multiplied by the attack points plus the number of soldiers, during the match you can send a maximum of 20 soldiers for a battle and by default the number of attack points is 1, but it can be increased with the Brave Destiny Card. You can only launch an attack at your turn after collecting your village resources, If you win the battle you can claim 1 key and 5 coins if available. The loosing party will loose the number of soldiers sent to the battle unless he has hospitals to treat his soldiers.&#10;&#10;After each battle the losing party will be allowed to draw a special card, the card needs to be displayed at any time to others, some cards are valid only once and need to be returned to the card pool, other cards are held permanently by the player. Only the defender can claim the special card and only the attacker can claim the key and the coins.&#10;&#10;",

Players receive points as follows:&#10;&#10;     1 point for each correct number&#10;     3 points for each number that completes a group&#10;&#10;&#10;Example: If a player places 2 numbers correctly on the board and another number that completes a group, he receives 5 points for it (2 points for the 2 numbers and 3 points for the number that completed the group).&#10;&#10;The bonus points are awarded only if the player can complete a full group within his minute (there are no bonus points for completing a group already partially placed by other players).&#10;&#10;If a player places a number incorrectly, his turn ends immediately. In addition, the wrong number is removed from the board again. The player who notices a wrongly placed number receives the number of points for a correctly placed number. The game ends when the Kakuro is completely solved. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;_________________&#10;&#10;One year earlier in 2005 JUMBO started the mini-series of 'Japanese Cult Riddle Games' with Code Sudoku.&#10;&#10;",

The children &mdash; pupils of orphanages and patients of hospices &mdash; put all their unbridled imagination into sketches, which were then worked on by the best Russian artists, trying to bring the clarity of lines and images to perfection, while retaining the idea and mood of a child&rsquo;s drawing. This is a world of children's fantasy without limits and restrictions. And most importantly, these are stories that children can tell us. In the box you will find a brochure with original drawings and the names of their authors.&#10;&#10;You can play Imaginarium Dobro even with preschoolers: the illustrations here are bright, and the images are understandable.&#10;Finally, another feature of the game is that we created it together with the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation and the charitable foundations &quot;LIVE&quot;, &quot;Ship&quot;, &quot;House of Ronald McDonald&quot;, &quot;Vera&quot;, &quot;Sheredar&quot;, &quot;Nastenka&quot;, &quot;Creation&quot; , &quot;Rusfond&quot;. 100 rubles from the sale of each box of &quot;Imaginarium Dobro&quot; are transferred to these organizations to help children.&#10;&#10;Want to see what cards are in the deck? You are welcome!&#10;&#10;The updated version of the Imaginarium Dobro has a convenient plastic lodgement with storerooms for decks and a special closable compartment for chips. We've made the board removable and added scoring tips to make the game even more enjoyable. Also in the new version, numerators appeared - special tokens that help put the cards in order and make it easier to vote. Winged elephants, however, remained the same: bright, cheerful and transparent, like candy.&#10;&#10;",
