They&rsquo;re very proud of themselves and their advancements, these humans, and they take themselves very seriously, what with their empire-building and their silly and relentless wars with one another. They have no clue how tiny they seem to you, like clever insects&mdash;how thousands of years of their civilization pass for you in a matter of minutes, and how completely subject they are to your whims.  But, like them, you&rsquo;re proud, too, ye god, and you do so very much delight when these humans notice you and praise you and create all these wonderful and diverse religions about you. And your very favorite thing of all is when they marshall their greatest talents, and the earth&rsquo;s most precious resources, and they build monuments to you and all your glory. After all, where would they be at all if not for your influence and magnanimity?&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to score as many points as possible, at the end of five progressive game ages (game phases) by influencing human activities (arranging card tableaus) and encouraging the construction of monuments (collecting suited sets).&#10;&#10;The five nations of the game evolve through progressive game ages and through individual technology levels (tech levels). Different ages and tech levels dictate different circumstances and game rules. The five tech levels loosely correspond to the five game ages, but it is important to remember that the tech level of any individual nation might not be the same as the current game age (one or more nations can be &ldquo;behind the times&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;Any time a nation&rsquo;s individual tech level advances beyond the current game age, it will cause the game age to advance by one increment. Depending on other circumstances, other nations may or may not advance their own tech levels at the same time. When any nation advances beyond the steel age (V) and into the atomic age (the sixth, unmarked age card), the game ends, and you proceed to scoring.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

While inspired by that game, the rules have been simplified allowing for an easy-to-learn game that still has elements of chance with a need for strategy.&#10;&#10;Like the original game, Fours is a race to move checkers through a course.  Opponents can knock each other off the course, but there are 'safe' spaces.  The 'fours' theme is evident throughout the game - dice yield a result of 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Safe spaces occur every 4 spaces. Each player has four checkers to run through the course.  A roll of 4 allows a player an extra roll.&#10;&#10;One of the most unique design elements of the game is the portability.  The game 'board' is actually a fabric game mat with a rubberized backing.  This allows it to conveniently fold and pack into a small pouch easily carried in a purse, backpack, or briefcase.  Unlike modern recreations of the game, a large, bulky wooden board is not required.&#10;&#10;",

Each player represents a ruthless investor in the megacity Dystopolis. The aim is to outmanoeuvre  the rivals through clever investments and by maximizing the profit from companies. Money can also be used to shamelessly bribe others into obedience. Action cards can be used to remove competing investments or to take over threatening companies - as long as the voting succeeds.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics is a combination of area control, stock holding and economic negotiation through bribes and bidding. The strategy in Dystopolis is centered around the placement of company tiles and investment tokens. The players add company tiles to the modular game board during each round. To claim ownership the players then need to invest money in the companies. The companies establish connections to each other. More connections to other companies increases the revenue, but also makes the company more vulnerable to attacks. A player with limited influence in an area can compensate for this by saving pleny of money for bribes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In particular focuses on platform coops as an alternative crowd-sourcing model with respect to privately owned network models. A main inspiring reference is Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy by Trebor Scholz.&#10;&#10;This is a board game that mixes role playing, card deck building, collaborative gameplay and transformative narrative aimed at exploring platform coops and their integration.&#10;&#10;What is the object of the game? For the single Megacorp player, to acquire all the Platform Coops transforming them in its subsidiaries. For all other players, who play as Platform Coops, to earn 5 happiness points. Players can decide whether the game ends as soon as one Platform Coop reaches their goal, or all are required to reach the 5 happiness points.&#10;&#10;How is it won or lost? Players win when they reach their goal.&#10;&#10;What do players do in their turns? Each player picks a new card which goes in their hand, and also may play a card as a new service of the coop or Megacorp. Each player has then to pay taxes and compute earnings, which are determined by the cards that they have played. For coop players, the effects of the cards of their deck are integrated with those of the shared service which require all coops subscription to become effective.&#10;&#10;The game is available as print and play, all materials available on Github with the rules. On Youtube there is a how-to-play video.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Doppleganger is an expansion unit for Malifaux. He belongs to the Neverborn faction.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;The Doppelganger can be almost anything you need it to be. Doppelganger can (0) Mimic any action on a Non-leader models stat card or Upgrade as long as it doesn't list a model by name. It can be either an enemy or friendly model's action and there is no resisting if you want something from your enemy. Doppelganger can't declare Triggers with these actions but you can still make it a huge advantage, should you fail something important (Example: a Lure from a Beckoner, you basically get 2 more chances to that with the Doppelganger, if you get the right Trigger to Mimic (Tomes) you get to do the action 3 times).&#10;&#10;The Doppelganger also brings more than that to your crew, with Ill Omens you get the possibility to cheat the Initiative flip before you or your opponent use Soulstones. This can be huge as usually in every game comes a time when it's crucial to win the initiative.&#10;&#10;If that's not enough the Doppelganger also has the Ability Don't Mind Me which allows it to make Interact actions while Engaged, which in the right Scheme Pool can be a great advantage.&#10;&#10;All this for a very reasonable price of 7 Soulstones becomes a bargain and should be considered in many Neverborn lists.&#10;Mobility&#10;&#10;Doppelganger has a very respectable Walk of 6, which makes Doppelganger highly mobile to get where needed.&#10;Offense&#10;&#10;While not having a very good offense with Fists (Ml5 and damage track 1/1/2) the Doppelganger can become furious in Offense with Mimic as you can copy the stats of the highest Ml beasts in the game. Should you get charged by a Ml oriented model and survive, you just Mimic the opposing model's offense and hit it back with its own damage track or Mimic another model within 8&quot;.&#10;Resilience&#10;&#10;The Doppelganger has an average Defense of 5 and quite good wounds of 8. The main thing in its Resilience comes from Manipulative 14 which forces the opponent to pass a WP 14 Duel to target the Doppelganger. The good thing about Manipulative is that as long as you haven't activated the Doppelganger your opponent must make the duel with every action as you don't gain Immunity to it as you do with Horror Duels. This can deter a few models from targeting the Doppelganger.&#10;&#10;Also, with (0) Blend In (Ca8 mask / TN: 15 mask) you can further up the resilience of the Doppelganger, with a 7 of any suit you get to choose from the following Conditions:&#10;&#10;Chameleon: Sh Actions taken against this model receive a minus flip.&#10;A Familiar Face: Ml actions taken against this model receive a minus flip&#10;&#10;Playing Against the Doppelganger&#10;&#10;Best time to go after the Doppelganger is after it has activated as there is no Manipulative to protect it and in a turn it has used (0) Mimic as then it can't cast (0) Blend In. After that it's quite easy to take down with a big hitter with only Df 5 and 8 Wounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ryle is an expansion unit for Malifaux. He belongs to the Guild faction.&#10;&#10;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;Ryle Hoffman is the older brother of C. Hoffman and the end result of breach psychosis and the wonders of Ramos. This once-brilliant individual was almost destroyed entering Malifaux, and only Ramos' hasty work was able to rebuild him into the creature he is now. &#10;Ryle is a melee oriented construct with above average damage tracks and a few tricks to stay alive. &#10;external image 14d94912-b346-4e5d-8fc7-bd27dac8eab7.jpg&#10;Table of Contents&#10;Overview&#10;Mobility&#10;Offense&#10;Resilience&#10;Soulstones&#10;Tricks and Tips While Joining a Crew&#10;Tricks and Tips While Leading a Crew&#10;Building a Crew&#10;Playing Against Ryle&#10;Mobility&#10;He has a strictly below average Walk and Charge but his (0) Socially Repressed allows him to push 4&quot; aways from a model within 12&quot; so with good positioning you can move him 12&quot; a turn. The Socially Repressed action also allows him to escape melee easily if needed (eg. taking interact actions).&#10;&#10;Offense&#10;Damage is where Ryle shines. He has a gatling gun attached to one hand and a mechanical fist attached to the other one.&#10;&#10;Hydraulic Fist&#10;This as an above Ml stat and a remarkable 3/5/7 damage profile. Moreover it comes with Critical Strike so if you use a soulstone for Rams and cheat a high Ram card you will be doing 5/7/9. This is enough to kill a large proportion minions model in one action and threaten the rest with two.&#10;&#10;Modified Steam Gatling Hun&#10;This is Ryle ranged attack and comes with an average Sh stat and lower damage profile than his fist. However it comes standard with a positive on the attack flip allowing you to target models in cover at your leisure and an automatic Trigger that gives a positive flip to the damage, meaning you can get the moderate or severe damage far more reliably.&#10;&#10;The other Trigger Raking Fire requires an extra Ram and allows you to take the Modified Steam Gatling attack against another model which has not been targeted with it this activation. It also comes with no restriction on the number of times you can use it, so as long as you have soulstones or Rams in hands and eligible targets you can keep on firing away. This is immensely powerful against crews that clump together such as gremlins or spider swarms. However, against more elite crews you will find yourself using Concentrated Burst almost exclusively.&#10;&#10;Resilience&#10;Ryle's weakest points are his low Df and terrible Wp stats, both of which are well below average for a Henchman. This makes him vulnerable to potshots from enemy Minions and Enforcers and means you'll rarely be able to win defensive duels against Masters or other Henchmen. He does come with a few tricks to help with this though.&#10;&#10;Firstly he has Armor +1 and decent wounds take the edge off weaker attacks. He also has the Grinding Halt Trigger to gain an additional Armor +2 with Tomes on his Df. This means you can often pitch a weak tomes or spend a soulstone to cut 4 damage down to 1, however it cannot protect himself from attacks that target Wp or those that ignore Armor.&#10;&#10;He can also heal with (0) Field Repairs at the cost of a card, letting him recoup wounds in the thick of things whenever you don't need to use Socially Repressed. This can also be used on friendly constructs, which is a handy way to spread the healing around.&#10;&#10;Finally as a Henchman he can use Soulstones to prevent damage and to aid defensive flips.&#10;&#10;Soulstones&#10;Ryles has several options to use his soulstones. He can use them to increase the damage of his Mechanical Fist, automatically trigger Raking Fire on his gatling gun or to protect himself but adding Tomes to his Df. As well as that with his low stats Df and Wp stats you will want to keep a few stones for damage prevention flips if he gets in trouble.&#10;&#10;Tricks and Tips While Joining a Crew&#10;Ryle is a construct so he has obvious synergies with C. Hoffman. Hoffman can Power Loop Ryle to increase his stats and use Machine Puppet to get around his low mobility and provide more attacks.&#10;&#10;His Field Repairs action plays well with with Hoffman but also gives him a bit of synergy with any crew with an interest in taking some constructs, such as Lucius the various construct minions.&#10;&#10;He is also a good choice for any crew that wants a shooting model with some extra melee punch, meaning Sonnia and Perdita might like to take him as insurance against enemies getting too close to them.&#10;&#10;Tricks and Tips While Leading a Crew&#10;&#10;Strategies and Schemes&#10;Ryle is pretty killy and tends to lean towards strategies and schemes which reward eliminating enemy models. He's also reasonably mobile and can support other constructs with his (0) actions and upgrades so he can serve as a dangerous and durable anchor for a crew more focused on marker based schemes.&#10;&#10;Building a Crew&#10;Francisco Ortega is useful if you are building a crew around Ryle as he can buff Df and Wp. He also provides ranged support, movement shenanigans and decent melee presence, so the two form an effective tag team.&#10;Including constructs in a crew is also a good idea as they can benefit from Field Repairs and Ryles construct oriented upgrades.&#10;Finally Ryle lacks a bit of speed so including fast objective runners should be a priority if needed.&#10;Playing Against Ryle&#10;Ryle is in many ways a glass cannon. Focus on him and he will die. This is especially true if you have models that can target Wp or ignore Armor. Models that can ignore armour are also useful specially if Ryle is in an C. Hoffman crew.&#10;&#10;Do not let him hit you with his Hydraulic Fist. It's every bit as dangerous as it sounds, so you're often better off hitting him from range or after he's activated.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Malifaux Wiki&#10;&#10;Bishop, Outcast Enforcer&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;Bishop is a Mercenary pit fighter whose main claims to fame are Swift, granting him a third AP, and a handful of useful triggers that make him quite effective in a variety of different situations. &#10;Table of Contents&#10;Overview&#10;Mobility&#10;Offense&#10;Resilience&#10;Upgrades&#10;Tactics and Tips&#10;Playing Against Bishop&#10;&#10;Mobility&#10;&#10;While Bishop's Walk of 4 is a bit of the slow side, his Charge of 7 makes up for it by letting him move quickly into combat. He's also Swift, granting him 3 AP during each of his activations, which allows him to move further than one might otherwise think after glancing at his stats.&#10;&#10;Offense&#10;&#10;Bishop is a melee-focused model, and that's where he shines.&#10;&#10;His main attack is Chain Wrapped Fist, which has a high Ml of 6 but a damage spread of 2/3/4, which is a bit low for a model of his price. However, Bishop makes up for that with a variety of triggers which make him very versatile, and his Study Opponent ability allows him to target either Wp or Df, allowing him to both hit his opponent where they are weakest and to bypass a number of defensive triggers (such as Lady Justice's Riposte trigger, which only triggers on her Df flips, but not her Wp flips).&#10;&#10;Bishop also possesses the Adaptive ability, which lets him choose a suit when he activates and add that suit to each of his duel totals during that activation. This makes Bishop very independent from the suits in your hand and essentially lets him pick which of his suits he wants to guarantee hitting during that activation. This also provides him a bit of defense from enemies that strip printed suits (such as Hannah or the Freikorps Librarian), as the suit gained from Adaptive is not considered to be printed on his card.&#10;&#10;The triggers on Chain Wrapped Fist allow Bishop to quickly adapt to whatever enemy his is fighting. Penetrating Blow ignores Armor, Hard to Kill, and Incorporeal, Choke Out makes his opponent Slow, Knock Around pushes his opponent 3&quot; in any direction, and Critical Strike just increases his damage by +1 for each Ram in his final dual total. With a flipped or cheated Ram and a Ram from Adaptive, this can increase Bishop's damage spread to 4/5/6, which is pretty impressive for a model with 3 AP!&#10;&#10;Bishop's second attack is Haymaker, which costs 2 AP and doesn't deal any damage, but does make the target Paralyzed if it connects. It has a very high Ml of 7, making it a very accurate attack, especially when used as a Disengaging Strike.&#10;&#10;Finally he has Flurry. This allows him to spend 2 AP and discard a card to get 3 Ml attacks against a single target. They will all have to be Chain Wrapped Fists as Flurry only allows Bishop to take attacks costing 1 AP.&#10;&#10;Resilience&#10;&#10;Bishop has higher than average defensive stats and a good number of wounds, which makes him difficult to kill in the best of situations. He's even harder to take down in melee, as his Cage Fighter defensive trigger deals 1/2/4 damage to anyone that makes a Ml attack against him and misses. The Crow he needs to hit his trigger is already built into his Defense, so he can Cage Fighter every attack that fails to strike him. Because of this, Defensive Stance is a good option with Bishop once he's in melee, as it improves his chances of dodging an attack (and thus counter-attacking via Cage Fighter) and still leaves him with 2 AP to fight back.&#10;&#10;Upgrades&#10;&#10;Bishop has two upgrades available to him in Outcasts.&#10;&#10;Scramble increases his WK and Cg, which becomes even better on Bishop, as he has a third AP with which to get even more extra movement out of the upgrade.&#10;&#10;Oathkeeper can be discarded at the start of Bishop's activation to give him Fast. If you thought that Bishop with 3 AP was good, 4 AP is even better. With it he can charge and flurry in the same activation, Charge twice, or Flurry twice.&#10;&#10;When hired into Arcanists, the Imbued Protection upgrade will make Bishop have Df 7. This makes attacking Bishop in melee a huge risk, as he's just that much more likely to avoid the attack and hit his opponent right back with Cage Fighter.&#10;&#10;With Guild, Lead Lined Coat grants Bishop Armor +1, which only serves to make him that much harder to kill.&#10;&#10;Resurrectionists have Decaying Aura available to them, which punishes any model that lingers too close to Bishop for very long. Because Bishop is so difficult to escape in melee, this can be a viable option for those who like to toss him into the thick of things.&#10;&#10;When hired into Ten Thunders, Recalled Training becomes an option, granting Bishop a +flip to all duels he makes for the rest of the turn. Because of his third AP, and his ability to counter-attack models that fail to strike him with Ml attacks, this upgrade makes Bishop very scary for one turn.&#10;&#10;Tactics and Tips&#10;&#10;Bishop is a melee-focused model, so try to get him into the thick of things as soon as possible. He does very well against weaker enemies that are likely to miss him and trigger his Cage Fighter counterattack, but can also hold his own against Henchman and Enforcers (particularly if he focuses on using Haymaker to paralyze them).&#10;&#10;When you activate Bishop, take a moment to consider which triggers you need the most and then gain the appropriate suit via Adaptive. Remember that you can still use the suits from cards that you flip or cheat, so don't feel constrained by Adaptive if you need to hit different triggers during his activation or if the situation changes unexpectedly.&#10;&#10;Playing Against Bishop&#10;&#10;Bishop is a very versatile model that can be used in many ways. You don't really want to get engaged with him if you can help it, as his Df trigger makes him risky to attack with Ml attacks, and his high Ml makes it hard to disengage from him. Shoot him with ranged weapons when possible.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overview from Walifaux wiki&#10;&#10;Hans is a Sniper for a hire, a Mercenary who will work for anyone willing to pay his fees.&#10;&#10;Mobility&#10;&#10;Lawls no.&#10;&#10;Hans as a Walk of 3 and is completely unable to declare a charge. Deploy him in a good position, because he's unlikely to move very far from that spot over the course of a game.&#10;&#10;Offense&#10;&#10;Hans has a Sniper Rifle with a respectable Sh of 6, a decent damage spread of 2/3/5, and an insane range of 18 inches. When he focuses, the range of his Sniper Rifle increases to 36 inches(!), allowing him to reach out and touch someone almost across the entire board. Furthermore, due to his excellent sniping skills, Hans does not randomize when shooting into melee. Pinpoint precision is a virtue.&#10;&#10;He also comes equipped with Goggles, which allow him to ignore any pulse, aura, or Markers which affect Line of Sight. This won't always come up during a game, but it can be a surprise for opponents who think that their models are safe within a cloud of steam or behind a pillar of ice. Hans is also Ruthless, so he is immune to Willpower duels (such as those created by the Terrifying or Manipulative abilities) during his turn.&#10;&#10;His Sniper Rifle comes with an assortment of triggers, one for each suit. He can use his Reference the Field Guide tactical action each turn to discard a card, which adds the suit of the discarded card to his duel totals for the rest of his activation. This is a good use for low cards in your hand, ensuring that Hans will hit the triggers you need regardless of the suits of his flipped or cheated cards.&#10;&#10;The Kneecap trigger lets Hans discard a card to give the target Slow, the Armor Piercing trigger makes his attack ignore Armor, the Curse Breaker trigger makes his attack ignore Incorporeal, and the Disarm trigger lets Hans discard a card to give a Minion the Disarmed Condition, which prevents them from making Ml actions until the end of the turn.&#10;&#10;Hans also possesses the Smile, You Son of a... tactical action, which grants him the Ping! Condition for the rest of his activation. Ping! changes Hans's attacks so that they deal no damage, but instead discard one Upgrade from his target. This very unique ability makes Hans the one model that can knock upgrades off of other models, which can drastically change the course of a game, especially when used against Masters.&#10;&#10;However, Hans is also a mercenary in the truest sense of the word, and his To the Highest Bidder ability allows any Master that has been targeted by Hans to discard two cards to make the action immediately fail. Be wary about this, though sometimes forcing the opponent to discard can be useful in its own right.&#10;&#10;Resilience&#10;&#10;Hans has a high Defense and an average Willpower, though his main defense is that he's a sniper who probably won't move very far from where you deploy him at the start of the game. If the opponent does get close, however, he is also Disguised, making him immune to charges.&#10;&#10;Otherwise, he has a low number of wounds for a model of his price, so try to pick a good spot with plenty of firing lanes and some good cover when you deploy him.&#10;&#10;Upgrades&#10;&#10;As of Ripples of Fate, Hans has his own 0 Soulstone Upgrade, Advanced Sight. This boosts his Wk to 4, and gives him the (0) Advanced Sight Action. It gives Hans Focused +1, but needs a 7 of any suit to succeed. It also competes with Reference The Field Guide for his (0) action.&#10;&#10;Oathkeeper is great for Hans in Outcasts, as a turn of Fast is three attacks per turn, or two attacks after a successful Smile, You Son of a... action. That's a potential two upgrades he can shoot off of an enemy model, which is usually a pretty good exchange for your own discarded Oathkeeper.&#10;&#10;Scramble is another option for Hans, but given his already slow speed, it's not a good one, as he'll still be slow, only more expensive. If you want a fast model, take something other than Hans.&#10;&#10;When working for the Guild, Plant Evidence can be useful for allowing Hans to help out with Power Ritual, if you deploy him near one of your corners. This also has the effect of keeping Power Ritual a secret until later in the game, as you won't be dropping a scheme marker in your own corner at the start of the game and giving it away.&#10;&#10;Imbued Energies is useful out of Arcanists, for the same reason that Oathkeeper is good in Outcasts. A Fast Hans is a happy Hans.&#10;&#10;Out of Neverborn, Pact can use useful on Hans to ensure that his attacks won't be completely shut down by the Black Joker.&#10;&#10;Ten Thunders can give him Recalled Training, which makes Hans very effective for one turn. The +flip to all his actions can help with both Smile, You Son of a... and his Sniper Rifle attacks, making him more accurate when it counts.&#10;&#10;Tactics and Tips&#10;&#10;The effectiveness of Hans really depends on his board and your deployment zone, as he's great on boards where he can get to a high position and cover wide swathes of the board, but less effective if most of the board is blocked off from his bullets.&#10;&#10;Smile, You Son of a... is a scary ability that will cause many opponents to panic, as nobody wants to see the upgrades shot off their Masters. You can use this to your advantage and bluff with Hans to make them discard via his To the Highest Bidder ability, as the opponent has to choose whether or not to discard before you flip any cards for Hans's attack.&#10;&#10;Tara has a cute trick that she can do with Hans and Whispers From Darkness (Eternal Journey upgrade). By burying Hans (via a Glimpse the Void trigger from her crew), she can use Whispers From Darkness to use his Smile, You Son of a... action and gain the Ping! Condition. This allows Tara to shoot upgrades off of other models without having to worry about Hans's To the Highest Bidder ability allowing the opponent to cancel her attacks. Her ability to bury him also allows him to rapidly deploy on the battlefield, either via her Faces in the Void action (Obliteration Symbiote upgrade) or just as a natural result of the Glimpse the Void trigger. The latter option, however, tends to bring him closer to the action than he prefers.&#10;&#10;Lilith can also help Hans rapidly redeploy via her Tangle Shadows action, which can toss him forward in exchange for tossing one of her (much faster) models back to his prior location. When used in conjunction with sprinting Terror Tots, this enables Hans to get to an advantageous position without having to make what might otherwise be a game-long trudge with his slow speed.&#10;&#10;Mah Tucket can also push Hans around with her Horribly Hollerin' action, ensuring that he gets to a better position for his shooting without having to take a Walk action.&#10;&#10;Playing Against Hans&#10;&#10;He's a sniper, so your best bet is probably to either avoid getting into his line of fire, or close to melee and kill him there.&#10;&#10;Be careful of his Smile, You Son of a... action, as it can knock the upgrades off your Master and Henchmen, and save cards to discard to cancel Han's attack if you have upgrades that you simply cannot live without.&#10;&#10;",

Ignorant peasants have created colorful&#10;myths about these monsters, myths the Order has done nothing to dispel.&#10;&#10;Varacolaci are not the animated corpses of suicides or unbaptized babies. Stories of their enormous tongues are just that, stories. No, the truth is far worse. Varacolaci are a further corruption of the Vampire, a Vampire infected with&#10;a large and muscular parasite. The parasite lives inside the chest of the Varacolaci and emerges through its mouth to feed, mistaken by the locals as a giant tongue. The parasite controls&#10;the host and, in return, feeds it symbiotically. However you name it, Hunters must approach the Varacolaci carefully, as they can attack from a distance.&#10;&#10;Rejected as abominations by the other Creatures of the Night, the Varacolaci were so well hidden in the past century that the Order wondered if they died out. No such luck. Varshi may be the first Varacolaci Elder, at least he is far more cunning than any Varacolaci before. It is Varshi that has led the Varacolaci from&#10;their hidden lairs to advance the Night&rsquo;s cause. The Order has yet to determine Varshi&rsquo;s agenda or why the Night is tolerating&#10;his presence.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overview:&#10;Wardens is a 1 to 4 player post-apocalyptic adventure set in a lovecraftian steampunk universe, offering different types of scenarios such as 1vsAll, Solo and Co-op mode. &#10;One player will take the role of Cthulhu and his legion of Starspawns and spread madness over the humanity while the Wardens team co-operatively maneuver their steam-powered armies in the last battle for the survival of humankind. &#10;Join the fight in this immersive mythological strategy game.&#10;&#10;Goal: &#10;As Cthulhu&rsquo;s dreams are beyond humanity&rsquo;s ability to defend against, only the Wardens &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;are strong enough to travel the world in search of the powerful Artifacts that belonged to the Naacal.  If found, the Artifacts can release the Elders who will fight one last time to return Cthluhu to his submerged stone-city where his nightmares can no longer harm humanity.  &#10;To fight the Wardens&rsquo; armies and stop them from finding the Artifacts, Cthulhu and his powerful Starspawns will spread madness, turning the Wardens &quot;Insane&quot; and converting them to play against each-other.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: &#10;One player will be taking the role of Cthluhu and control his Starspawns minions as they rise across the world and fight the Warden's armies. Cthulhu's Gameplay is focused in strategic movements and unit placement. The Great Old One travels through various portals across the map and spreading madness, he corrupts the Wardens at his will, forcing the insane player to fight against his allies. &#10;Every time The Wardens perish in battle, Cthulhu grows stronger and uses the defeated army&rsquo;s power to raise his legion with his mutation tree.&#10;&#10;1-3 players are the Wardens, each controlling their own steam-powered army over land, water and sky. The vehicles can be upgraded with hidden Blueprints in order to take control of territories, fight Starspawns, call for reinforcement and go on Expedition, in search for Artifacts.&#10;&#10;Each Warden has their own characteristics, abilities and strategies, each presenting a unique gameplay experience and adding a lot of replay-value to the game. Since their actions are so different, they must absolutely work in coalition if they want to survive. &#10;They must use their special abilities, spend distinct free actions, unique masteries and designated pet companion skills to fight the enemy's legion.&#10;&#10;Battles in Wardens are diceless. Instead, opponents will engage in a strategic mini-game to read each other's mind by tossing Strategy Battle Coins using a battle pyramid mechanic deciding your fate.&#10;&#10;Wardens also includes different mechanics such as Prophecy and Ability cards which add yet another dynamic to gameplay.&#10;&#10;During the Co-op and Solo Scenarios, the Wardens will fight against the Game as Cthulhu's actions will be automated.&#10;&#10;Will the Wardens prove strong enough to prevail against Cthulhu, or will humanity be lost to madness?&#10;&#10;History:&#10;The annals of prehistory describe a time of peace and unprecedented enlightenment and creativity lead by a mysterious earthly race called, the Naacal.  &#10;A hostile and cosmic family of entities lead by Cthulhu invaded the world seeking to usurp the Naacal&rsquo;s power and send humanity into madness.  &#10;The Naacal Elders, with the aid of powerful Artifacts contained Cthulhu and his Starspawn, entombing him in a Stone-city where he sleeps to this day at the bottom of the ocean, forgotten in history.&#10;The Elders retreat, allowing the world to set its own future but not before establishing a Naacalean bloodline of guardians to watch and defend, known as The Brotherhood.  The most powerful and trained of these guardians were known as Wardens, sworn to keep vigil over the cosmic threat that slumbers beneath the world through their superhuman ability and with the power of the Artifacts.&#10;Thousands of years later an unearthed scroll warns of Cthulhu&rsquo;s return to seek vengeance on the Naacal and humanity itself &ndash; that warning comes to pass as an awakening Cthulhu spreads his tentacles across the world, this time imprisoning the Naacal Elders.  The Brotherhood is left in ruins as the world falls to madness and burns.&#10;Time is running out for humanity&rsquo;s remnant and only our three remaining Wardens stand between Cthulhu freely roaming the world and humanity becoming enslaved to his madness.&#10;&#10;",

In each turn, a Challenge is revealed, and Leaders choose to take part in it or not. Players who dispute the Challenge try to negotiate and convince others to join their alliance.

Once the bets are revealed, the Alliance with the most power is declared the winner and obtains the Challenge's reward (Cause points).

    "Description": "In The Ancient Evil up to 4 players will take on the role of investigators trying to thwart the plans of the evil cults, &#10;controlled by a fifth.  This fifth evil player or 'Games Master' will be in charge of driving the scenario, creating an atmosphere of mystery and suspense for investigators. The 'Games Master' will find everything they need to keep the investigators on edge; summoning cultists and monsters, as well as introducing plot twists, special events, and more. And the closer the investigators get the more powerful he will become.&#10;&#10;During each scenario the investigators are free to proceed as they wish but every action they take in their attempts to solve the mystery generates 'menace' which in turn fuels the powers of the 'Game Master'.&#10;&#10;Both investigators and enemies use a points system to perform different actions. Some actions, such as moving and attacking are limited in how many times they can be performed on a turn.&#10;Actions are resolved using a D10 dice, rolled against the relevant skill, to determine success ranging from critical failure to a critical success. Critical results will be unique to the item or action being used/taken.  Some enemies can even take and use items and equipment against the investigators.&#10;&#10;Facing off against the Ancient Evil the investigators are in constant danger of falling to insanity. Exposure to otherworldly creatures, eldritch magic and unnatural events all threaten to drain their precious sanity.  Such mental trauma can result in &#10;episodes of temporary insanity or phobias which impact on an investigators ability to perform actions.  Investigators pushed to the brink may even become completely insane.  But this does not eliminate the investigator who, after flipping their character sheets to reveal an insane version, will continue to play.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a scenario book containing numerous missions that can be played alone or linked as a campaign.  But it doesn't end there.  With the many tiles, enemies and other components you will have the tools to create your own scenarios.  We are also committed to supporting the game and keeping to alive by, amongst other things, providing even more scenarios via our website which will be free to download.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is for each player to strategically place 9 howitzers playing pieces in a position along a World war 1 trench line to capture their opponents howitzers.&#10;&#10;When 3 howitzers are in aligned along the trench line the player calls out &quot;Trio&quot; and may remove any opponents howitzers. Failure to make this call forfeits the opportunity of a capture.&#10;&#10;Players take turns in moving howitzers around the trenches to align their howitzer guns. If a player places a howitzer in a position where trenches meet thus completing a trio in two directions he may call &quot;Terror&quot; and either captures an opponents piece or replace a gun previously lost.&#10;&#10;The game is over when a player does not have enough howitzers to form a trio and he has lost the battle.&#10;&#10;",
