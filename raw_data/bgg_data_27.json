    "Description": "Comancher&iacute;a is the second game in Joel Toppen's &quot;First Nations&quot; series. Like its predecessor, Navajo Wars, Comancher&iacute;a is a solitaire game in which the player plays from the Native American tribe's point of view.&#10;&#10;In Comancher&iacute;a, the player takes command of the Comanche nation. The player must drive hostile tribes from the southern plains, establish dominance over the region, set up trade networks with both friendly tribes and colonial powers, and finally defend all of this against relentless military and cultural attack.&#10;&#10;While many mechanics will feel similar to Navajo Wars, Comancher&iacute;a is a very different game. Comancher&iacute;a promises to deliver all the tough decisions and drama that Navajo Wars players have come to expect, but with a faster playing time and more streamlined victory objectives.&#10;&#10;",

The sun will set before you know it; will it be your hard work that makes this year's Festival the best one ever?&#10;&#10;Set in the delightful world of Creature Comforts, Maple Valley is a game of traveling trails, finding friends, and celebrating new beginnings for 1-5 critters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An eternal conflict for the land of Ironwood is raging between two factions: the stalwart and hard-working Ironclad, settlers of the iron mountains; and the ferocious Woodwalkers, swift and deadly shadows of the forests. Both factions struggle for the ultimate control over the land for its greatest treasure: the Larimor Crystals, a mysterious substance holding immense energy within. It can be found both inside the colossal mountains and scattered across the dense forests.&#10;&#10;The Ironclad extract the essence of the crystals and process their energy to fuel their machines and mechanical inventions. If they succeed, their giant forges will swarm the land with endless armies, and establish ultimate dominance over Ironwood.&#10;&#10;The Woodwalkers use the crystals&rsquo; raw magical power to discover and retrieve three ancient totems from secret ritual sites, hidden in the mountains. Once retrieved, the combined power of these totems will summon the Guardian, the ancient protector of the woods, to wipe out the Ironclad once and for all.&#10;&#10;One way or another, the eternal conflict is finally coming to an end.&#10;&#10;Ironwood is a rules-light, highly asymmetric, card-driven tactical game for 1-2 players. Each round, you and your opponent alternate playing a total of 3 of your faction-specific cards for their action effects. These effects include positioning your warbands, initiating combat, extracting crystals, bestowing temporary passive effects, and many more. When combat occurs, you will use the same cards for their combat values instead, in a simultaneous bid to gain combat bonuses, inflict and fend off casualties, and augment the Dominance value of your warbands to win the combat.&#10;&#10;The two factions are completely asymmetric in their play styles, decks, victory conditions - even in which parts of the map they can access.&#10;&#10;As the Commander of the Ironclad, your primary goal is to lay down the foundations of your forges in the outer mountains, and once you have collected enough crystals, build forges on the foundations. As the Chieftain of the Woodwalkers, your mission is to locate your people&rsquo;s ancient totems through Vision cards, clear the path to them by defeating Ironclad warbands, and finally securing them in the outer forests, beyond the Ironclads&rsquo; reach. Once you have retrieved the third totem as the Chieftain, or built the third Forge as the Commander, you immediately win the game.&#10;&#10;Ironwood also features a low-upkeep solo mode against the Ironclad or the Woodwalkers. Although both solo opponents work on the same main principles, each of them bears its faction&rsquo;s unique aspects and features.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are 6 colored monk pieces, a Williams piece, and an Anson piece, all set up in different locations at the start. All monks start with 10 suspicion points and 5 clue points. Players are each randomly assigned one monk color (keep secret!). Each player receives 3 cards (which show either a monk, a location, or Williams/Anson).&#10;&#10;There are 7 rounds (days), each with 24 hours. Each day starts by revealing a random event tile in effect for that day. Then, players take turns playing cards: monk card = move that monk to a different location; location card = move any piece to that location; Williams/Anson card = move either of those pieces to any other location. Cards also have a number (0-5): add as many hours to the clock, unless you spend previously collected chits to reduce the number (by 1 per chit spent) -- spent chits added to the line of chits next to the board. If you move past 2400 hours, the day ends. Draw a card at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;When a monk is moved to a location, if there is no piece of their color, increase their suspicion by the sum of (both) chits present. If there is, take that chit and reduce the monk's suspicion score by the number on that chit. If it was the last chit, add 2 chits from the line next to the board.&#10;&#10;If Williams moves to a location, add/subtract 3 from each of the clue scores for all monks present there. For Anson, it's +/- 5 suspicion points.&#10;&#10;When the day ends, that player takes the event tile (=2 clue points against their monk at end of game). Convert suspicion points to clue points by ranking most to least (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 clue points); ties &quot;generous&quot;. Reset suspicion points to 10 for all monks.&#10;&#10;After days 1, 3, and 5 players reveal one color they are NOT.&#10;&#10;Day 7 is different: players simultaneously guess which monk other players were assigned. For every correct guess, that player's monk receives (substantial) additional clue points (number of points varies based on number of players).&#10;&#10;The player with the fewest clue points against their monk wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

If not, you may not place a car but may still connect the road to the next pillar.&#10;&#10;If the road crosses multiple roads, you may place multiple cars depending on the number of roads crossed.&#10;&#10;crossing over two roads at the same time&#10;crossing over and crossing under two roads at the same time&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;Caution&#227;&#128;&#145;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187; You may not place a car when crossing over/under your own road.&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187; You may not place a car on already constructed roads later on in the game.&#10;Keep the traffic rules and enjoy driving!&#10;&#10;Constructing a Junction&#10;The yellow pillar is called the junction. Using a junction, you may do the following.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#160; Increase or decrease the height of the pillar by any number&#10;You may increase or decrease the height of your pillar regardless of the height of the pillar at the base point. However, you need to have at least one gray pillar under the junction. You may only construct a pillar of one more or less stories as usual in the following turn.&#10;&#10;Be careful, if the road angle is too steep you&rsquo;ll have trouble placing cars!&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#161; Branching out to two-ways&#10;You may branch out your highway from a junction anytime during the game.&#10;&#10;Constructing Exit to Highway&#10;&#10;If you can ground a road safely to the table from a height of 1 pillar, you have created an exit to your highway. You may place an additional car as a bonus point on the exit road. If the road crosses your opponent&rsquo;s road(s) while grounding, you may place multiple cars on the road. You cannot start a new road from the exit.&#10;&#10;Penalty&#10;&#10;If you drop your opponent&rsquo;s car or road during construction, you must hand over your pillars to your opponent as penalty. You must offer a number of pieces equivalent to the materials you dropped. Game proceeds only after the parts are fixed by the player responsible. There is no penalty for dropping your own pieces.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;&#10;1. When all 10 cars are placed on the highway&#10;The first player to finish all 10 cars is the winner.&#10;&#10;2. When construction materials run out&#10;If you are out of construction materials, you must wait for your opponent to finish the next turn. If the opponent finishes the turn with no penalty, the player with no more construction materials is the loser.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nieuw Amsterdam was founded by the Dutch West Indies Company in order to encourage the lucrative beaver pelt trade with the local Native American hunters along the Hudson River. To establish a trading post there, they needed a town and a fort, which was built on the tip of Manhattan Island. To encourage European patrons &ndash; that is, settlers of means or noble birth &ndash; to populate the colony, they granted them both land and indentured servants. The patrons became the lords of a new feudal system not unlike that seen in Europe.&#10;&#10;In Nieuw Amsterdam, players are those patrons, and they bid on action lots in order to build businesses, work land for both food and building materials, compete in elections, ship furs to the Old World, and trade with the Lenape Indians &ndash; a process that gets more complicated as players claim more land and push the Lenape camps farther up the Hudson River.&#10;&#10;",

Amsterdam is the beating heart of global trade and the wealthiest city on Earth. Goods from around the world are piling up on the docks, in ship holds, in warehouses, and on the banks of its countless canals. You mean to profit from this!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a supply of 16 carts, two transportation cards in hand, and one or two trade contract tickets that show locations in the Amsterdam market. On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up wild card, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two trade contract tickets and keep at least one of them.&#10;&#10;Whenever you complete a route that has carts depicted on it, with these primarily being on the perimeter of the city, you claim a merchandise bonus card.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until someone has no more than two carts in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for the routes that they've claimed during the game, the trade contract tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their carts), and their standing among those who hold merchandise bonus cards. Whoever holds the most cards collects 8 points, with other players collecting fewer points. You lose points for any uncompleted contract tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A tradeable card game covering the events of the Lord of the Rings movies. Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book.&#10;&#10;The game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each &quot;lost&quot; combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this &quot;health&quot; rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no &quot;tapping&quot;. Also importantly, this is not a &quot;draw one&quot; game but a &quot;hand-filling&quot; game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;shadow&quot; cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you.&#10;&#10;Unlike some of their other published games, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined). Additionally, there is a much more sane rarity distribution than previous Decipher products (many - in fact most - familiar characters are common or uncommon, or at least have common or uncommon variations that are no less powerful than the rare versions).&#10;&#10;This game &quot;ended&quot; when Decipher ran into financial difficulties and let the license expire.  The following sets were released:&#10;&#10;1 Fellowship of the Ring&#10;2 Mines of Moria&#10;3 Realms of the Elf-Lords&#10;4 The Two Towers&#10;5 Battle of Helm's Deep&#10;6 Ents of Fangorn&#10;7 Return of the King&#10;8 Siege of Gondor&#10;9 Reflections&#10;10 Mount Doom&#10;11 Shadows (Starting with this Set, Minion Cultures were re-formatted)&#10;12 Black Rider&#10;13 Bloodlines&#10;14 Expanded Middle Earth&#10;15 The Hunters&#10;16 Wraith Collection&#10;17 Rise of Saruman&#10;18 Treachery and Deceit&#10;19 Ages' End&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flying Colors recreates naval actions during the height of the Age of Sail, from small engagements to full battles involving dozens of ships in each fleet. Play is fast, furious, and does not require the pre-plotted movement found in many other naval games. Instead, a simple initiative and command system allows players to activate and maneuver their fleets in a realistic manner, indicating how older commanders adhered to rules of engagement where more forward thinking commanders, like Nelson, could retain control of their fleets after the first broadsides began to be exchanged.&#10;&#10;Rather than focusing on the abilities of individual ships, Flying Colors uses broad classes of vessel within each &quot;rate&quot; and concentrates the players minds on maintaining command of their fleets using a simple command system.&#10;&#10;This is not a strategic level game where one piece represents several ships. Flying Colors includes individually named ships rated for size, gunnery, boarding ability, and damage capacity. Also included are nearly four dozen individually named commanders, rated for their ability to control their formations as well as the impact of their presence within the fleet. The game system provides what naval enthusiasts will expect in a tactical Age of Sail game: broadsides, rakes, anchoring, wind effects, weather, shore batteries, and much more. All this is packed into a short, accessible rulebook.&#10;&#10;Included within the game are historical scenarios [...]. The battles range in size from small engagements playable on a single map through huge engagements like the Glorious First of June playable on three maps. Players are also free to create their own variants and &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios using point values for each ship. Most scenarios can be played within a few hours and two players can complete even the largest within a day. Several are also well suited to solitaire play.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE : 5-10 minutes per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 100 meters per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Individual Ships&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One to Four&#10;&#10;(from GMT website and BGG users)&#10;&#10;",

The Scot James Taylor, and later many other entrepreneurs, set about substituting tea plantations for coffee plantations and hence creating what many connoisseurs today consider to be the best tea in the world.&#10;&#10;In Ceylon, players take on the role of the pioneers who developed the Ceylon tea industry. As such, they build plantations in different districts and at different altitudes. They produce tea and try to sell it to the most important export companies. To favor this task, they must win the favor of the counselors of each district and develop the necessary technology that allows them to get ahead of their competitors.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players score points for having plantations in each district, for meeting demands that have been set, for the level of technological development reached, and for the amount of money collected. In the end, the player who has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In addition, the Fate effect allows each player to banish a card in his discard pile whenever a &quot;Dark Energy Shard&quot; is placed in the center row.&#10;&#10;This set also features new Energize cards, including Heroes, Constructs, and Monsters that transform into new beings or more powerful versions of their original selves. If you would play a card that has a Transform ability and you've met the Energize threshold on that card (by having played a certain amount of energy that turn), then you ignore all the effects on the original card and place the transformed card in your hand, which can now be played this turn and on future turns for the remainder of the game. (Ascension: Darkness Unleashed contains both double-sided transform cards for those who play with card sleeves and single-sided transform cards for those who don't. In the former case, you remove the card from the sleeve, flip it to the transformed side, then resleeve it; in the latter, you remove the original card from the game and bring in the transformed card.)&#10;&#10;Other cards &ndash; such as the monster &quot;Erabus, the Exiled&quot; &ndash; are transformed and added to your hand when you defeat them in the center row. At the end of the game, you score Honor for whichever version of the card is currently active in your deck.&#10;&#10;",

As soon as three tokens are on a space, those tokens are flipped and activated, first in first out, with each agent carrying out its individual action in addition to whatever takes place in that space. When an evil mastermind completes their contraption or the Secret Service brings this villainy to a halt, the game ends, and whoever has generated the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Assyria, players represent tribes living in Mesopotamia, trying to develop on the desert and a limted fertile area located between two rivers that divide the board. In their quest for power (points), players build Ziggurats (permanent outposts), wells, make sacrifices to gods and try to get along with nobles of Assur - the capital of Assyria. The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order&#10;&#10;In this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.&#10;&#10;Players begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.&#10;&#10;A player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3. Each round, players also score points for huts (those built on fertile land between the two rivers bring more points) and ziggurat tiles.&#10;&#10;In comparison to other games from Ystari's series - Assyria is lighter than Caylus, Olympos, Ys or Sylla (in terms of complexity, available choices - represented by numerous tiles, cards, icons, cards etc. that need to be remembered and can be combined during play), but heavier than Yspahan, Mykerinos or Metropolis.&#10;&#10;",

At an Indian spice booth, the players bargain for the precious ingredients they need for their exquisite meals. Thereby, everyone throws their Indian coins face-down onto the bowls depicted on the game board. The players may bluff and push the opponents&rsquo; coins aside. A clever coin thrower is able to arrange the coins on the game board in a way that allows him to do both: sell his spices at a high price and purchase cheap spices as well. Eventually, the first player wins who has been able to acquire the spices needed to serve the maharajah his desired meal.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, your team will play cards from their own decks &mdash; recruiting other agents, uncovering evidence, and fighting enemies. If you do well enough, you will face the final challenge &ndash; the conspiracy&rsquo;s vicious &ldquo;End Game&rdquo;!&#10;&#10;How to Play and, Maybe, Win&#10;During each game, you&rsquo;ll play through three &ldquo;seasons&rdquo; of the X-Files&trade; show (the game covers the first nine seasons).&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a deck of basic cards. At the start of your turn, you&rsquo;ll add a card from the Conspiracy Deck into the Shadows. It could be an Enemy, an Event, an Informant or even a Lead about the conspiracy. You&rsquo;ll play cards from your hand to generate Attack, Recruit Points, and special abilities. You&rsquo;ll use Attack to defeat Enemies and to reveal hidden cards in the Shadows. You&rsquo;ll use Recruit Points to find and recruit new character cards in the Bureau for your deck.&#10;&#10;Whenever your deck runs out of cards, you&rsquo;ll shuffle your discard pile to make a new deck, including all of the new characters you&rsquo;ve recruited. This allows your deck to get stronger over time. But beware &ndash; your adversaries also get tougher as you go.&#10;&#10;Players must work together on their turns to find Leads and discover Evidence of the conspiracy&rsquo;s End Game. The more Evidence you Collect, the better your chances will be when you face the End Game. If you somehow overcome the End Game, you win the game. But the conspiracy isn&rsquo;t a passive participant in this game. Its End Game will have a wicked assortment of abilities and the conspiracy uses all kinds of X-Files&trade; to distract your team and keep the pressure on you.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, if there are any Enemies remaining in the Field, they will Strike you. If a player takes damage equal to or greater than their health, they&rsquo;re defeated and the team loses the game -- they can&rsquo;t bear the practical and emotional loss of their colleague. However, if &ldquo;The End&rdquo; has begun (if the End Game card has been revealed), the players will soldier on without their teammate. Once &ldquo;The End&rdquo; has begun, either the conspiracy will succeed, or a few brave agents just might save the world.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;500 cards&#10;Playmat&#10;Full color rulebook&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At 23:40 on April 14, 1912 in the North Atlantic, the R.M.S. Titanic strikes an iceberg. Water immediately floods into the liner's compartments and the ship is listing to starboard in a worrying way. There is no hope about the outcome. On board, there is widespread panic.&#10;&#10;Alone, or co-operating with other crew members, you must show presence of mind and do the right thing to save as many passengers as possible. Time is short...&#10;&#10;The card game SOS Titanic uses a mechanism similar to Patience, with the cards representing passengers who must be arranged on the decks, then placed in the lifeboats in a particular order. As one of the crew members, you and your teammates need to move and arrange these passengers as quickly as you can. Each section of the Titanic holds a pile of cards of which only the first is available.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws a few cards from the main deck and tries to move passengers out of the sinking ship onto the lifeboats. Failing to move at least one passenger or needing to reshuffle the main deck might cause one section of the ship to sink, thus reducing the number of piles available as well as the hopes of those still on board. Players can also use action cards to step in at fateful times when things otherwise seem lost. The game ends when the ship has sunk completely or when all remaining passengers have been saved.&#10;&#10;",

Having a simple-to-learn strategic system and short rulebook, The Napoleonic Wars, can be played in an evening as the cards and Diplomatic Track make for tough decision-making in the face of everchanging enemy threats.&#10;&#10;Set in 1805 Europe, you must weigh the strategic dilemmas facing the two alliances in mortal conflict. Napoleon's France enjoys a superb army, central position, superior leadership, and a useful, if not powerful, ally in Spain. However, she faces three foes.&#10;&#10;Napoleon must beware of Britain's seapower and wealth, Austria's threatening position, and Russia's reinforcing hordes. In the wings, Prussia, Turkey, and Sweden teeter on the brink of war, begging inducements to join either side. Even lowly Denmark's fleet can upset the balance of power.&#10;&#10;When fleets or armies collide, battle-related cards may be played and then dice are rolled to resolve the battle and inflict casualties. Even the most brilliant maneuver faces the chance of floundering. So play The Napoleonic Wars now, and put the strategist in you to the test. Your options are only limited by your vision, a meddlesome enemy's cards, and the hand of fate.&quot;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Napoleonic Wars: Super Deluxe Map&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;     The Napoleonic Wars&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The pagoda housed the four Gods and towered strong over the magnificent kingdom. As time passed, the queen fell ill, and she summoned her people to compete for her crown. The crown would be passed on to the person who could build the most pristine garden around the pagoda. The heir would be chosen by the four Gods themselves.&#10;&#10;The goal of Four Gardens is to accumulate the most points on the score board by completing landscape cards and finishing sets. Each finished set creates a panoramic view of a garden, and these sets are called (no surprise) &quot;panoramas&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players can finish panoramas by first laying groundwork cards, acquiring resources by turning the 3D pagoda, and allocating those resources to satisfy the requirements of each groundwork card. Once satisfied, a groundwork card becomes a landscape card. Multiple landscape cards laid in the correct order create a panorama. Each God has their own satisfaction meter which expresses their goodwill towards the gardens and their builders. Players try to please the Gods by completing landscape cards and finishing panoramas.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As you grow stronger, you can take on more powerful monsters and, if you plan well, even defeat a dragon.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, each player takes five crystals, then you shuffle together as many kingdom decks as the number of players, then lay out six cards (either items of enchantments) on the journey track. In the game, players take turns to embark on quests, collecting cards from the journey track by paying with crystals. Acquired cards are placed into adjacent stacks, with something like &quot;Long Sword&quot; going into the item stack and cards like &quot;of Fire&quot; going into the enchantment stack; combined, these cards create the &quot;Long Sword of Fire&quot;, and cards grant both temporary bonuses (upper icons and skills) and permanent ones (bottom icons).&#10;&#10;Players may attack approaching monsters and defeat them in a simple combat encounter to score points. In combat, you compare your defense against the monster's strength to determine whether you receive damage. Then, you need to accumulate as much attack as the monster's health to defeat it. You keep defeated cards as trophies.&#10;&#10;From time to time, you rest in the village to gain crystals or heal wounds. If you do, discard the first card from the journey track. At the end of each turn, replenish the journey track to six cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last card is taken or discarded.&#10;&#10;",

If you succeed (using a combination of dice, tokens and cards), you add the Secrets to your score; if you fail, you unleash a Terrible Thing, which counts against your score at the end of the game. The object of the game is to be the player with the most Ancient Secrets when the game ends at the Unspeakable Event.&#10;&#10;Game play involves rolling dice to achieve combinations: runs, pairs, three or more of a kind, and single die showing a particular number or higher. Dice combos are used to overcome Encounter cards that are worth points at the end of the game, and/or to acquire the four resource tokens in the game: Focus, Courage, Treasure and Feat.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Focus tokens are used to re-roll individual dice. &#10;    Courage tokens are spent to overcome an Encounter, before rolling your dice. &#10;    Treasure tokens are spent to purchase Swag cards from the Trading Post, which give you a permanent game effect.&#10;    Feat tokens are spent to play Feat cards from your hand, which activate one-shot effects.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A player keeps the dice from their previous turn and may, if desired, add or subtract a die from these to accelerate or slow on their current turn.  Any or all dice used in the previous turn may be left at their current values or rerolled.  Once the roll is complete the player chooses a direction of travel, either straight or one hex side (60 degrees) to the left or right, and if the complete distance cannot be travelled the boat incurs damage.  Too much damage will sink your powerboat and penalise you for the next race.  The buoys change positions for each successive race and, after three races, players add up their points to determine the winner.  A scoring variant for two players is included in the rules.&#10;&#10;",

It's a tense psychological thriller full of gritty moods and dark themes, but the game lets the survivors take the fight to the hordes of the undead.  The game uses standard Zombicide mechanics.&#10;&#10;There are two variants included in the game: Romero - where the characters have the attributes from the original movie and Zombicide: where the movie characters have had their attributes amped up to meet the Zombicide world - but always have the chance of regressing to their original Romero character.&#10;&#10;",

The battles, included in the scenario booklet, focus on the historical deployment of forces and important terrain features of trench fighting in scale with the game system. The scale of the game is flexible and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a few infantry units may represent an entire wing of a larger battle, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave soldiers going over the top.&#10;&#10;The Command card system drives movement, creates a &quot;fog of war&quot;, and presents players with many interesting opportunities, while the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The Combat cards add an element of suspense and will challenge players to coordinate their use in a timely manner. Overall, the battlefield tactics players will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various types of WWI units, their weapons, battlefield terrain, and written history.&#10;&#10;In this core game, the main focus is on a number of WWI trench warfare battles. However, a series of expansions, which will feature early war, Eastern Front scenarios, tanks, airplanes, other national armies, plus more special personnel figures, are already in the planning stage to enhance your WWI gaming experience.&#10;&#10;",

When all cards are gone, there is a scoring for all displayed cards, but beware, the player with the most corruption sigils sees his income almost cut down in half.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 3 rounds or if a player has reached a hundred points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Since time immemorial, the mines of Runedar have supplied gold to generations of dwarves. Today, only a handful of them remain, guarding the fortress surrounding the entrance to the old, depleted mine... or so it was thought. This group of dwarves have been fortunate enough to accidently stumble upon a new vein of the purest gold and have managed to extract a small treasure. Unfortunately, just as they were about to set off to the safety of the nearest stronghold, they discover that the old fortress of Runedar is surrounded by orcs who are willing to do anything to get their hands on the precious metal. Now, the dwarves not only need to defend the fortress, they also must dig a tunnel under the mountain to escape and get their hard-earned gold to safety.&#10;&#10;The Siege of Runedar is a co-operative game for 1-4 players who take on the role of dwarves charged with defending the walls of Runedar and the treasure they keep within. They will have to face orcs, goblins, and trolls, fighting in hand-to-hand combat against those who manage to get past the walls and shooting from a distance at those who try to enter. A deck-building system allows players to upgrade their weapons and tools as they must hold off the raiders long enough to build a tunnel to escape the terrible siege they have been subjected to and get the treasure to safety.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each location tile gives victory points and may generate resources (skill tiles or connectors that connect two location tiles). Connectors and skill tiles can be used to upgrade location tiles for additional victory points and productivity.&#10;&#10;The game is played over four eras, and in each era, new location tiles will be available for bidding. In both era 1 and 2, these tiles consist of six resource-generating tiles, plus some additional building tiles.  In era 3, there will be only building tiles, which arrive already upgraded. In era 4, some of the Routemaster tiles become available.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player chooses one of five actions. They may use one or more of their team of wooden workers (&quot;keyples&quot;) to (1) bid for a location tile, (2) use a location tile to generate resources, or (3) upgrade a location. They may (4) pass, in which case they may play again in that era, or (5) cease playing in that era by setting off in their sailing barge along the Thames. The game finishes after the last river barge sets sail at the end of era 4, at which point the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Key to the City &ndash; London has similarities in structure to the award-winning 2012 R&amp;D game Keyflower.&#10;&#10;",

The workers are planning to strike and since the city is full of troops, they do not know if they will survive that day. Three hours later, the German monarchy does not exist anymore, and the first German democracy is born.&#10;&#10;Weimar: The Fight for Democracy is a game about the major actors in the spectrum of the new Republic. The Social Democrats and the Conservatives are trying to defend the democracy. Communists and Nationalists are looking to overthrow the government and install their own regime. Will this infant Republic survive? Or will Germany &mdash; as in history &mdash; fall to the Nazis and become a lawless state? Or will there be a Union of Socialist German Republics?&#10;&#10;Weimar includes two major &quot;battlefields&quot;: In public opinion, the parties struggle to influence the important political issues like the economy, the media, or foreign affairs. Winning these issues scores points and allows them to take significant decisions. At the same time, the parties try to control the streets and position their followers in the major cities of Germany for demonstrations, street fights, and actions taken by the paramilitary organizations.&#10;&#10;Weimar is a tense and exciting card-driven game (CDG) on a most interesting topic. Cards may be played for the event, for public opinion, or for actions in the street.&#10;&#10;In each of the six game turns, the parties play one agenda that defines their strategy for the turn (e.g., modifying their twelve-card play deck, defining issues, getting advantages in the streets). The goals of the parties are asymmetrical and contradictory. While the democratic parties score for stabilizing the state and removing poverty, the non-democratic parties score for coups and unrest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each cult is in competition to be first to summon their god, but they all must also repel intrepid investigators working to seal off the gate to beyond with Elder signs. Gather arcane artifacts, cast powerful spells, embrace the Dark Gift of your Elder God, and be first to hasten doom...before it's too late!&#10;&#10;During the game, players use a variable hand of spell cards to do one of two things to aid their cult in their mission: Use the spell's Astral Symbol to navigate the areas around Arkham on the unique Fate Clock board, or use the symbols in a location's Astral Column to ready a spell. Readied spells can be cast at any time, but while in a cult's Spell Reserve their primary Astral Symbol can aid in readying future spells, creating an engine for pumping out more potential power.&#10;&#10;As cults travel to the six locations on the Fate Clock, they activate specific powerful abilities, such as gaining useful artifacts at The Museum or enabling their Elder God's Dark Gift at The Ceremony. As cults send more and more cultists to a location, they may gain control there, adding even more powerful abilities. However, cults must be careful how they navigate Arkham as a location with lots of activity will attract pesky investigators. Tempt fate too many times and the investigators may raid your cult's lodge, placing Elder Signs, and generally getting in the way of summoning your Elder God. Gain too many Elder Signs and it's game over!&#10;&#10;If any cult can manage to raise their Summon Track to 9 before the investigators save humanity, their Elder God awakens and they win! Of course, &quot;win&quot; is a relative term as it will certainly herald the end of the world &mdash; but that's a small price to pay for eternal servitude to the Ancient Ones.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "P.I. is a pure deduction game, with players competing in three consecutive mini-games in order to see who's got the best chops in terms of solving their cases.&#10;&#10;Each mini-game plays out the same way. To start, you receive in secret one suspect card (out of 12), one crime card (out of 10), and one location card (out of 14); this set of information represents the case that the player to your left must solve. The game board shows fourteen locations arranged so that each location touches a few others; each location has space for a suspect and crime tile. Shuffle the suspect tiles (12, plus two &quot;no suspect&quot;) and the crime tiles (10, plus four &quot;no crime&quot;), then place one face up in each location. Each suspect, crime and location is included in a deck of evidence cards, and nine evidence cards are revealed.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either places an investigator, chooses an evidence card, or attempts to solve her case. When you place an investigator in a location, the player to your right looks at his case cards, then places a disc on this space for each case card he holds that matches the suspect, crime or location in this space. Additionally, he places a cube on this space for each suspect, crime or location that's adjacent to this space.&#10;&#10;When you choose an evidence card, the player to your right places a disc on the matching tile if the card matches one of the case cards he holds, places a cube on the matching tile if this tile is adjacent to a tile matching one of the case cards he holds, or places nothing if you've made a wild-eyed guess and the tile isn't adjacent to anything.&#10;&#10;To attempt to solve the case, you place a black token on your guesses. If wrong, you're penalized two points and continue play next turn. If right, you receive 7, 5, 3 or 1 points depending on how many others have solved their cases in earlier rounds.&#10;&#10;The mini-game ends once everyone has solved their case or only one case remains unsolved. All used investigators are removed from play, then the board and cards are reset for the next mini-case. Each player has only five investigators total, so use them wisely!&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points after three mini-cases wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, players place numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest-valued creature being eliminated from play. Players also place bets on which creatures they think will make it into the storybook, and you can use the special powers of these creatures to ideally turn things to your advantage.&#10;&#10;Fans of Dr. Reiner Knizia might recognize Equinox as a revised edition of the previously released game Colossal Arena, but with two new creatures. Of the fourteen unique creatures, only eight are played in a game, which means more than three thousand different combinations are possible. To celebrate the equinox occurring twice a year, players can select from two distinct box covers, but note that the contents in each box are identical.&#10;&#10;",

Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!&#10;&#10;The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.&#10;&#10;",

The easiest orders to complete &ndash; say, two specific bean types or three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &ndash; requiring, say, a four-of-a-kind or seven beans with no blue ones &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the seven bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and four of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then she rerolls any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, she completes as many orders as she can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, she can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of four. When a player harvests the order card, she draws a new card and uses that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card she already had.&#10;&#10;In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &ndash; and not dice already set aside &ndash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much with her rolls as her opponents might benefit from her turn more than she does.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected thirteen Bohnentalers. The player with the most Bohnentalers wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Dice Realms, players vie to improve and expand their Medieval realms, while contending with Fate. Realms are represented by customizable dice with faces that can be popped out and upgraded for better ones.&#10;&#10;Each game is different as during setup, players draw five tiles (from a bag of 35) to determine which extra die faces will be available beyond the five standard lines of faces: lands (victory points), farming (grain), commerce (coins), settlements (defense), and progress (upgrades). Each player begins with two identical dice and can gain more dice during play, in addition to upgrading their starting dice.&#10;&#10;Play is mostly simultaneous. To begin, players roll their dice, with one player rolling the Fate die, which affects all players.&#10;&#10;If Winter appears on the Fate die, players must pay 1 grain for each die they own or take a -2 point &quot;misery&quot; chip for each grain they lack. Players may then re-roll one die for free and use any re-roll or &quot;set-a-die&quot; tokens (that allow you to choose the die face result) that they have previously invested in for further control.&#10;&#10;Players then resolve any attacks showing, starting with the Fate die and then clockwise, with each player's attack affecting all their rivals. Each shield showing on your dice lets you ignore one attack. Successful attacks can cost players grain, the use of a die for a turn, or even the loss of a die face (which can be later rebuilt).&#10;&#10;Players collect any victory points (VPs), grain, and coins shown on their die faces. Coins are used to acquire upgrades, purchase re-roll and set-a-die tokens, repair destroyed die faces, or buy a new die -- which also costs 2 grain -- expanding their realm. At most 1 coin can be saved in your treasury from round to round.&#10;&#10;Upgrades are the heart of the game. Players receive upgrades from upgrade symbols showing or by spending coins. Die faces have 1, 2, or 4 dots on them. To change from a 1 to a 4 in the same color &mdash; such as from a yellow face collecting 2 grain to the 4-dot version that collects 4 grain and 2 coins &mdash; costs three upgrades, whereas changing from one face to a different color face at the same level costs just one upgrade.&#10;&#10;Using upgrades, crossgrades, and the &quot;free reroll&quot; each turn, players can craft their dice to specialize them and dramatically &quot;tilt&quot; the probability that a desired face is rolled. Of course, players will want different things at different times: upgrades to get going; coins to expand their realms; food if a string of harsh winters are rolled; defense against that pesky Robber on the Fate die; VP chips to race for victory; or whatever die face is the key to winning a particular setup.&#10;&#10;If during a round any player needs to use a 10 VP token, a -10 misery token, or a 10 grain token (because all of the smaller value tokens have been used), then the game ends after finishing that round; otherwise, the player with the Fate die passes it clockwise to the next player and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players tally their points earned, both from VP chips and improved die faces, with 2-dot faces being worth 1 VP and 4-dot faces being worth 2 VP. Whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

(The exception: In a five-player game, one color can be played twice.) Whoever plays the highest card wins the trick &ndash; except that the three least valuable cards in the game (1, 2, 3 of yellow) win the trick if one of the three most valuable cards in the game (16, 17, 18 of red) is present. Whoever wins a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Each color has its own small deck of scoring cards, and when a player wins a trick, he takes a scoring card of the corresponding color. The red color, for example, has highest playing cards on average (cards 5-18, compared to yellow 1-13), but least valued scoring cards for a trick. However, once three tricks are taken with the same color, the scoring cards of that color are depleted and players take golden &quot;joker&quot; scoring cards, worth the most points. Therefore you might want to keep high cards of a frequently winning color in your hand in order to maximize your points &ndash; but the round ends as soon as a player cannot play a card due to the restrictions on which cards can be played in a given trick.&#10;&#10;Players tally their points, then begin a new round, with the game lasting as many rounds as the number of players. In the end, whoever tallies the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;History&#10;The term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.&#10;&#10;The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.&#10;Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.&#10;&#10;What's in the box?&#10;Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at www.gangoffour.com&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;All the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Big Two&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Oniria &mdash; the world of an ancient dragon civilization. Tales describe the land as an idyllic paradise filled with marvelous dragon-made wonders and surrounded by a flourishing wilderness. The only portal to that world is the Wonder Book, an ancient tome locked away in an abandoned tower. It sleeps, covered in dust, awaiting the one thing it desires most: you.&#10;&#10;Wonder Book is a pop-up game for 1-4 players in which each player takes the role of a teenage kid in a group of adventurous friends. This is a co-operative game in which you all win or lose as a team.&#10;&#10;The game is split into six consecutive scenarios (&quot;chapters&quot;), each composed of a specific deck of pre-sorted cards that contain the rules, the story, and the challenges you have to face. Each chapter has you explore a new part of the interactive 3D cardboard pop-up book and reveals more about the world in which your adventure is set.&#10;&#10;Starting with the first card of the chapter deck, the story unfolds until you reach a goal card. These cards show a goal that must be achieved to proceed and explain how the players' and enemies' turns take place. Each hero can perform three actions per turn, including moving and fighting, using their individual skills, collecting sparks of magic (used to perform special actions), and interacting with cards and pop-ups. Once all heroes have taken their turn, a Wyrm card determines how the enemies will respond by moving, attacking, spawning, or doing something unexpected.&#10;&#10;The basic mechanisms are easy to grasp, but the game keeps changing as each scenario offers different things to do. You will find yourself exploring, fighting bosses, solving riddles, playing little minigames, looking for clues...anything is possible during the story!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Don&rsquo;t Mess with Cthulhu is a social deduction game with secret identities. Players are either Investigators trying to keep Cthulhu from waking and controlling the world, or Cultists that want to bring the world to a disturbing end.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over four rounds. The Investigators must uncover all the Elder Signs to win; the Cultists win when Cthulhu is revealed or if the game ends before all the Elder Signs are discovered.&#10;&#10;Before each round players receive a number of Investigation cards, which they look at but then shuffle and put in front of themselves so they know what cards they have, but they don't know which card is which.  Each round has a number of actions equal to the number of players in the game.  Players take actions to reveal Investigation cards, and gather all unrevealed cards are shuffled an redistributed evenly among the players.&#10;&#10;Reveal Cthulhu, and the Cultists win instantly.  Reveal all the Elder Signs, and the Investigators win.  If you want to play multiple rounds (it's highly recommended), the losers in each game get Insanity tokens.  Get three tokens, and the night is over with the winner(s) being those most sane.&#10;&#10;Kickstarter version notes:&#10;&#10;Kickstarter Edition has the following bonuses, unavailable in the retail version:&#10;&#10;#1 - 10 player aupport. All the components needed to play with up to 10 people at the same time.&#10;&#10;#2 - 3 x Necronomicon Investigation cards. Now the Investigators not only have to discover all the Elder Signs in time to prevent Cthulhu from rising, they must also discover the ancient tomes called Necronomicon. But the Necronomicon are dangerous to the uninitiated and cannot be revealed until at least one Elder Sign has been discovered.&#10;&#10;These promo cards add more information into the game, helping the Investigators in their quest. However the Necronomicon also give the Cultists another win condition - making the strategies more complex and the discussion even more lively.&#10;&#10;#3 - 6 x &quot;Objects of Power&quot; cards. These special cards have a variety of different uses, and provide more direct and indirect information in the game (as well as a touch of light-hearted fun). Objects of Power give the game more replay value, more strategy and more variability without adding complexity.&#10;&#10;Timebomb Themed edition&#10;&#10;In TimeBomb, you are playing either a terrorist trying to make a bomb blow up, or a SWAT team member trying to defuse it.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a card at the beginning of the game that indicates his role and keep it secret until the end of the game. Then, at each of the game's 4 rounds, each player receives 5 cards that he shuffles after having a quick look at them and place them face down in front of him. Among all of the player's cards, a number of &quot;SUCCESS&quot; cards, one &quot;BOOM&quot; card and the rest being &quot;SAFE&quot; card.&#10;&#10;The active player then chooses another's player card and reveals it, that player then becoming the new active player. After N cards have been revealed (N being the number of players), all cards are shuffled again and distributed equally to the players for a new round. If at any time the &quot;BOOM&quot; card is revealed, the terrorist's team wins. If all &quot;SUCCESS&quot; cards are revealed before that happens, then the SWAT team members win.&#10;&#10;Will you be able to convince the other player to reveal your own cards among them a SUCCESS is hidden ? Or are you just trying to cheat the SWAT team members into revealing your own cards because the BOOM card is among them ? Only a game of TimeBomb will say.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "D.E.I. (Divide et Impera) is a game of exploration and survival set in the Earth devastated by a new ice age.&#10;The cities of the future, from the crucible of civilization, have become icy deserts dotted with the carcasses of skyscrapers now reduced to uninhabited rubble. Between alleys of old London, bands of survivors use their abilities to explore and plunder the scarce resources that are left, to sell them to the Pure Caste in exchange for food and fuel. The only ones who still have high technology, the Pure Ones are the elected heirs of the old civilization. Protected by fortified citadels, they manage the bands of survivors, helping them in their research or putting them in competition, so that they cannot ally and threaten their domains.&#10;&#10;In D.E.I. each player will control one of the four bands of Survivors, and they will be competing with each other for the wealthiest loot to trade with the Pure Caste. They will have to explore London on two levels, between the streets and on the roofs of the old buildings, to look for the precious resources of the past era coveted by the Pure Ones: Technologies and Energy cells.&#10;&#10;Each faction will start with 8 cards, a Hero and few Explorers, but during the game it will be possible to acquire new action cards from London black markets, building new structures such as bridges and elevators, and obtaining temporary control of the hi-technological Drones that the Pure Caste will give to them.&#10;&#10;The game map is completely modular and three-dimensional so that every game of D.E.I. is always different and compelling. The explorers will often be able to contend for territories for resources and to have greater influence in the markets, and therefore, the fighting will be inevitable. Also, during the games, the players will have to solve missions of increasing difficulty, which will grow their victory points. The survivors' gang that earns the most victory points, satisfying the Pure Caste, wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Its quickly expanding trade and exports to close cities were great opportunities for the local businessmen to expand their riches.&#10;&#10;Take on the role of an ambitious merchant during this golden era of trade. The task set before you is to become the most successful entrepreneur in the city of Constantinopolis. Compete against your rivals and earn the most renown by completing contracts and establishing viable trade; your fame will be measured by your ability to expand your trade district while managing your delivery contracts.&#10;&#10;Constantinopolis is a board game of resource management, economy, and trade for 2-5 players. With a moderate game time of 1 to 2 hours and intuitive rules, Constantinopolis strikes the perfect balance of accessibility and depth.&#10;&#10;Tiles in Latin, consistent with Giustiniano's time, are both a reference to the high period of Constantinopolis and a way to make the game entirely language independent.&#10;&#10;",
