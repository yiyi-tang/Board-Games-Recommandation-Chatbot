After that, each player looks for words that can be made from chains of adjacent cells snaking in any combination of directions, ignoring vowels and allowing a single letter to stand for a double letter.&#10;&#10;Each player writes down their word on paper and then, on their turn, writes the appropriate consonants on the cells used and challenges their opponents to guess the word. A successful guess gives the points to the opponent, otherwise the player gets a point per cell used. In either case the used cells are out of play.&#10;&#10;There are a few further wrinkles, including one where, if a player manages to enclose an area with his or her color and the edge of the board, he or she may claim all the enclosed spaces.&#10;&#10;",

Each player begins the game with 5 daggers, and places one of them on the starting 'foot-print' at the beginning of the game. Each turn every player gets 6 movement points to share between his daggers (ie move 1 dagger forward 6 footprints, or 2 daggers 3 footprints each, or any combination up to a total of 6). You can 'leapfrog' your own daggers, (but may never have 2 daggers on the same footprint) and at the end of each move the dagger is 'stabbed' into the board. When a dagger is placed in one of the randomly selected footprints the Vampire will let out a bloodcurdling scream causing that dagger to be removed from the game. Players have to remember which footprints will wake the Vampire and avoid them for the rest of the game. The first player to reach the centre of the board and stab his dagger into the heart of the Vampire wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player has three shakes. Rolling 10 spots with one roll is a strike. You put aside dice that have spots on them and then re-roll the rest. if you get spots on the rest of the dice you make a spare. You then have a third roll if you make all ten spots with the third roll you score a 10.&#10;&#10;",

Hornet Leader II has retained all the key decision-making aspects of the original game, while greatly streamlining the game mechanics.&#10;&#10;While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices, the more suppression munitions, you haul to the target, the safer your pilots will be, but the less likely you are to destroy the target.&#10;&#10;Available in two formats:&#10;&#10;- Virtual Tabletop Game using the Vassal Engine&#10;- PDF files to download and print.&#10;&#10;Not a complete game, you must own Hornet Leader II.&#10;&#10;",

Each of the games is a bit more challenging than the last so once they master one game they &quot;graduate&quot; on to the next.&#10;&#10;Initially the child simply counts. Later the child uses an included ink stamp to make a number of marks equal to a die roll.  Later, players have different colored pencils and take turns coloring parts of the picture.  They must figure out the number that they can color.  The player coloring the most wins.  So children are learning counting while they think they're only playing a game.&#10;&#10;",

Words can be placed crossword-style, which means that a word could be used in a horizontal as well as vertical direction. The score is 1 point for every word that forms part of a sentence (words used in both vertical and horizontal sentences score 2 points). However, 1 point is deducted for each die that is not used.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An application for a U.S. patent was filed in December 1927 by James M. Prentice of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Prentice was 17 years old. The patent, for &quot;Electric Baseball,&quot; was granted less than a year later, and Jim Prentice Electric Baseball, under a variety of titles and in a variety of forms, would go on to a production run of more than thirty years.&#10;&#10;Prentice initially sold, or at least licensed, the rights to his invention to Parker Brothers, the game-publishing giant of nearby Salem -- probably to help fund his college tuition at the University of New Hampshire, whence he graduated with a degree in mathematics. Parkers produced Electric Base Ball Game, arguably the first electrical boardgame ever, in the very early 1930s.&#10;&#10;Despite the enduring popularity of the fondly-remembered Prentice games, their more than two dozen variations and their chronology are poorly documented, and Prentice himself (1910-2005) seems a mysterious figure to most.&#10;&#10;Prentice regained control of his patent by the mid-1930s and set himself up in business as Electric Game Co..  One of the first products of The Electric Game Company -- perhaps the very first, and among the simplest of all Prentice baseball games -- was Electric Base Ball &quot;version D02,&quot; featuring the &quot;Electric Bat.&quot;  Prentice evidently got rights to Parker Brothers' graphics as well.  He told the Union-News that in his first year of production, he sold about a hundred games at five dollars each.&#10;&#10;Very similar to both the D02 and the Parker Brothers game, another of the earliest varieties of Electric Base Ball was the &quot;version DD24,&quot; also featuring the &quot;Electric Bat.&quot; The &quot;D&quot; and &quot;DD&quot; clearly denoted editions using a single D battery and two D batteries -- perhaps the last obvious indicia in a long list of cryptic Prentice codes. The games were personally assembled by Prentice and a few assistants.&#10;&#10;Another early-looking version of Prentice electric baseball is Wonder Baseball Game. The illustrated batter would be reused in later variations of the box lid.&#10;&#10;Not only is Wonder again similar to the early models above, the promo literature included in the box trumpets both the Wonder game and Electric Base Ball Model D02, as well as Electric Football, and identifies all as available in 1938. Oddly, the Wonder gameboard indicates &quot;patent pending,&quot; despite the 1928 patent used on much later models.&#10;&#10;Wonder Baseball had an edition packaged in a slip-cover sort of box and apparently devoid of battery compartments, control buttons, and lights. It seems to be a non-electric model, perhaps a wartime revision.&#10;&#10;Prentice saved a little money by providing box lids but no box bottoms for his games, leaving many vendors of second-hand games today to think that one part's missing. It's not. Adding to some latter-day confusion, Electric Game Co. box lids and gameboards do not always match up.  Prentice was not one to waste a nickel, so it's very likely that, even while new gameboard models were being designed, produced, and sold, old box-lid inventory was being used until it was exhausted, and only at that point would new and redesigned box lids be printed.&#10;&#10;The lid most often associated with the earliest 1930s versions of Electric Base Ball is a red box with the batter illustration above the title.  Two words on the gameboard, &quot;Baseball&quot; is one word on the box.  The source of the illustration -- the same batter seen on Wonder Baseball Game -- remains unknown.&#10;&#10;Slightly later editions of the lid added the phrase &quot;Big League&quot; above &quot;Electric Baseball&quot; -- all in a new font -- and are in fact usually seen covering &#10;Big League Electric Baseball Model B-4, which was produced from about 1938 through 1941.  Prentice's All-American Electric Football and Collegiate Electric Basketball also debuted by 1938.&#10;&#10;Like the earliest versions, the B-4 measures about 16x14&quot; -- the standard dimensions of all Prentice Electric Baseball games until the Super De Luxe editions of the early 1950s.&#10;&#10;A fourth edition of the red box replaces &quot;Big League&quot; with &quot;Jim Prentice.&quot;  Jim Prentice Electric Baseball, probably from about 1940, sports a version of the cover illustration on the gameboard itself.&#10;&#10;The legend added to the fifth red box variation reads &quot;This Game Operates Electrically Or Mechanically.&quot;  Jim Prentice Electric Baseball Dual Control Model, is a little lighter on the bulbs and wiring and the need for batteries, hinting that this too is not just post-1940 but a wartime product.&#10;&#10;A slightly simpler version of Jim Prentice Electric Baseball Dual Control Model (had two knobs, no illustration). The two Dual Control models are the only versions of Electric Baseball so far found carrying a different patent number -- confirming not only their 1942 invention, but also that they were not a Prentice design.  George P Alderman and Herbert H Fredrick had been the people granted the patent on that gameboard.&#10;&#10;The patent was later licensed to a company called Mastercraft, which produced the game as Prolectric Baseball in 1951.  Mastercraft also turned out Prolectric Football and possibly other games in the '50s.&#10;&#10;The famous &quot;alligator-finish&quot; white box is assumed by many to be early 1930s vintage, but this box lid is almost always seen with Models E120, 68-B, 48-B, and 63-B, all verifiably from the late 1940s. Model E120 dates to 1947. The cartoon of the swinging batter is based on an early-'30s painting by noted illustrator J. F. Kernan.&#10;&#10;(Source)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Taken from the Darkson Designs website:&#10;&#10;&quot;It is 1946. The greatest conflict mankind has ever known has entered its seventh bloody year. Tens of millions have already fallen, yet the war rages on. No corner of the globe has been spared, the shadow of battle hovers above every land. Millions have been left homeless, driven from the charred carcasses of once great cities. Millions more cower beneath the iron heel of foreign rule. Awesome weapons of destruction rain down upon the earth, blasting the land itself into a blackened cinder. Mankind stands on the edge of midnight as the wheel of history turns toward its darkest hour.&quot;&#10;&#10;AE-WWII is a alternate-history WWII game played with metal miniatures- the miniature range is currently very new, but several new releases are planned for 2007.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "PatimPatamPatum is a special majorities game whose scenario is the popular and traditional festival of &quot;La Patum&quot; in the Catalan city of Berga, near the Pyrenees, recently declared &quot;Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot; by the UNESCO. The game does not intend to faithfully reproduce the festival, but just be a funny competition among the players grasping some of the feeling of the festival.&#10;&#10;Each player represents a group of patumaires (i.e. those participating in the festival) and he or she should lead his or her patumaires through the old city streets, trying to reach the special squares where the festival is held. The final aim of the players is to gather the maximum number of patumaires in these squares at the end of each round. But there is a problem: the squares are pretty small and there is no room for everybody. If the squares are full you'll have to manage as best as you can in order to throw out some competitor, while trying to keep there your own patumaires. To help you in this task you should use wisely the various cards and popular characters of the festival: some ones will help you in reaching the squares, some others will help you in defending yourself from the other players' pushes.&#10;&#10;The game has three rounds and each player can use his cards to move the patumaires as well as the character cards, which allows some special (and sort of magical) action. At the end of each round the players obtain points by their mere presence in the squares and, in some cases, even more points by having a majority there. You'll have to maintain always an equilibrium in your cards: will you spend your cards mainly for trying to reach all the places or better keep the highest card for defending against your competitor's pushes? Will you spend that 6-valued card for his movement value or for his character's special action?&#10;&#10;&#10;    Released October 2007.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Winner of the 6th Game Creation Contest Award at the Fira JocJoc in Tona, Catalonia, Spain (November 2007).&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Jim Harkonen's rules focus on the differences in formation in terms of fire, movement, damage taken, and morale, far more than most such rules.  The rules also focus on relative position and its effects on morale.

    "Description": "In the years immediately following the defeat of Nazi Germany, some leaders among the victorious Allies believed that war between the two remaining superpowers was not only inevitable, it would come very soon. The United States and the Soviet Union continued to design and build new armored vehicles and other weapons for this looming war, but the &ldquo;Cold War&rdquo; would drag on for almost 45 years without ever resulting in open battle.&#10;&#10;Iron Curtain is a supplement introducing the post-war weapons of the two superpowers to the Panzer Grenadier system. The scenarios are all hypothetical, of course, but are based on what generals of either side believed would be the course of a war in the years immediately after 1945. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Road to Berlin and Battle of the Bulge.&#10;&#10;For those fascinated by huge tanks with big guns, this is the ultimate in tactical armored wargaming. New pieces include the Soviet Josef Stalin III and Josef Stalin IV heavy tanks, T-44 medium tank and Su101 assault gun. There are also infantry armed with the awesome AK-47 assault rifle, still a front-line weapon around the world 60 years after its development.&#10;&#10;An American player will need powerful weapons to counter that arsenal, and Iron Curtain provides. There are M26 &ldquo;Pershing&rdquo; heavy tanks, Sherman &ldquo;Jumbo&rdquo; assault tanks, M24 Chaffee light tanks, M4 Sherman tanks with a 76mm gun, M28 ultra-heavy assault tanks, and M29, M30 and M32 heavy tanks. Plus M36 tank destroyers, M39 full-tracked armored personnel carriers, and 90mm anti-tank guns.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

With this historic stroke of a pen, the stage was set for Union Pacific to open the American West to settlers and, in the process, connect a continent.  The transcontinental route heralded the Industrial Revolution and modernized transportation, turning the grueling, six-month, $1,000 journey from New York to San Francisco into a week long trip costing a mere $70.&#10;&#10;It took an army of 20,000 men, working 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for six years, to connect America east to west by rail.  It was a remarkable feat, as the system was built primarily by hand.  With the driving of the Golden Spike on May 10, 1869, the route was complete, and a vast, largely unpopulated region was poised for growth.&#10;&#10;Today, the 50,000 men and women of Union Pacific still connect America&rsquo;s communities, transporting the raw materials and finished goods that keep our economy, and our country, moving.&#10;&#10;Tokens include: Railroad crossing signal; Engineer&rsquo;s cap, Golden Spike, Caboose, Locomotive, and a Lantern.&#10;&#10;",

Within a month, the Austro-Germans inflicted over 300,000 Italian casualties at a loss to themselves of only 100,000, and had shifted the front over 100 miles.  But they fell short of a decisive victory.&#10;&#10;Caporetto recreates this spectacular offensive.  Modifications to the Great War in the East Standard Rules account for infiltration, naval fire support, changes of command, heroic &quot;last ditch&quot; leadership, and much more.  The game poses different problems for each Player, with the Austro-German player impelled to push his advance as fast and as far as possible and the Italian Player forced to retreat, often in the face of certain losses to his rear-guard units, in order to rebuild his shattered line.  But despite the inherent imbalance of forces, the game is tensely balanced.&#10;&#10;Included in the The Great War in the East: Four World War 1 Battles Quadrigame.&#10;Folio edition contains Standard rules, Special rules, 17&quot; x 21&quot; map and 200 counters.&#10;&#10;",

At Verdun the French army was gradually being bled to death, and in Trentino, the Italian army was rapidly nearing its breaking point.  As in August 1914, the Allies sent out a call of au secours to the Russians.&#10;&#10;The Russians responded on 4 June with an offensive along the entire line of General Brusilov's Southwest Front.  This operation resulted in the capture of some 150,000 square miles of territory, inflicted losses of over 3/4 million, and force the Central Powers to weaken their offensives.  As great as it was, however, the Brusilov Offensive was not the strategically decisive victory the Russians needed to stave off internal collapse.  In the game the Russian player must break through the Central Powers line and encircle masses of enemy troops, while the Central Powers Player must make careful withdrawals and timely counterattacks.  For both Players, the game is demanding and requires coherent planning and careful execution.&#10;&#10;",

To forestall this, von Hindenberg transferred four German corps from Prussia to the southwest corner of Poland and launched an offensive toward Warsaw.  By 12 October, they had driven the Russians back to the Vistula, just south of Warsaw, but there, outnumbered and over-extended, they ran out of steam.&#10;&#10;Von Hindenberg in Poland simulates the intense back-and-forth struggle that began 16 October, with von Hindenberg's retreat from the Vistula.  Over the course of the ensuing six weeks, both sides surged forward and back, east and west, alternately threatening the other with potentially disastrous encirclements.  Special rules cover the effects of inferior Russian intelligence (hidden movement for the Germans), the combined effects of poor Russian logistical capacities and German scorched-earth policies.&#10;&#10;Included in the The Great War in the East: Four World War 1 Battles Quadrigame.&#10;Folio edition contains Standard rules, Special rules, 17&quot; x 21&quot; map and 200 counters.&#10;&#10;",

On the first map area, the Austrian forces must try to make headway against the under-equipped but ferocious Serbs, while on the other, the Russians attempt to make up for the disasters in Prussia by overrunning as much of Galicia as possible.  Special rules cover Serbian supply constraints, Austrian river-monitors, and the transfer of Austrian troops.&#10;&#10;",
