    "Description": "Aera was published by New Dimensions of Corvallis, OR, and reviewed in GAMES, April/May 1987. The games was for two players, Red and Blue, each has 6 pieces in his own color, numbered 1 to 6. There is,  first a drop phase, then a movement phase with each phase being in numerical sequence.&#10;&#10;For the dropping phase Red drops 1, then Blue drops 1. Red drops 2, then Blue drops 2, and so forth through Blue dropping 6. Now the movement phase starts. The pieces are now moved in numerical sequence. So Red moves his 1, then blue moves his 1. Red moves his 2, then blue moves his 2 and so on.  In addition the pieces are started with the silver side up. When the pieces are played a second time, then they are flipped to the other side, gold, to help keep track of the sequence.&#10;&#10;The object is to score points; one point is scored by forming a line of four of the players pieces, either orthogonal or diagonal. The first player to score six points wins.&#10;&#10;The original pieces, according to the review, were not numbered. The &quot;1&quot; was a clear acrylic disc showing a circle, the &quot;2&quot; was an vesica piscis (oval with pointed ends), the &quot;3&quot; an equilateral triangle, &quot;4&quot; a square, &quot;5&quot; a pentagon, and &quot;6&quot; a hexagon.&#10;&#10;",

They receive initial resources, colonists, cash and a ship to search for a rumored new land.&#10;&#10;Turns are taken by choosing specific roles which allow movement, technology advances, and investment in the Old World or influence on the continent, outfitting ships, investment cash, and diplomatic efforts.  Only two roles are chosen per turn and then all movement and actions are played out.   Players must explore the New World and found farms, posts, towns, and harvest resources.  They then score points and generate income shipping new goods to the Old World, and then can score points shipping supplies back to the New World.  Nations must also balance defense against rival nations while protecting their investment in the New World on land and sea.  OWNW is different each game.  Explorers and ships reveal new hexes that have a type of terrain and a potential special resource.  All terrain has a carrying capacity, which cannot be improved until the player builds farms.  While exploring and settling the New World, players also play technology advances back at home which improves ship speed, manpower, reduces cost of men and goods, and allows for special buildings.&#10;&#10;Game features:&#10;-role selection.&#10;-known and unknown map.&#10;-hex based discovery, changes each game.&#10;-carrying capacity per hex which may be modified&#10;-resource extraction and management&#10;-shipping goods, soldiers, colonists.&#10;-tech advancement.&#10;-piracy and conflict on land and sea / all units are unarmed until you decide to arm them!&#10;-colonization, simple building tech tree.&#10;-Area control through role selection of Old World for endgame points.&#10;-multi-path scoring: building, influence, shipping, exploration.&#10;-basic units and characters with special abilities.&#10;-'touring' mechanism for specific mapmaker, envoy, etc... characters.&#10;&#10;This game is still in development.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When Nazi armies launched their sneak attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Spanish fascists exulted. Still nursing deep hatreds from the Soviet role in the Spanish Civil War, thousands volunteered to fight alongside the Germans. Spanish dictator Francisco Franco organized them into a &ldquo;Blue Division&rdquo; to carry the fight to the Russians and, not coincidentally, send the most politically active fascists far away from Madrid.&#10;&#10;Blue Division is a supplement to the Panzer Grenadier series, focusing on the actions of this unit between 1941 and 1943. Organized as a standard German infantry division, the Spanish unit fought well in some of the hardest fighting of the campaign. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front and Road to Berlin to play all of the scenarios.&#10;&#10;All the new pieces represent Spanish volunteer forces: infantry, ski, engineer, motorcycle, bicycle and machine-gun troops; anti-tank guns, mortars and artillery, and of course leaders. Scenarios cover actions of these units between their arrival on the Eastern Front in October, 1941 and their departure almost exactly two years later.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;20 Scenarios&#10;77 pieces&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

Whenever a player is on an auction space, an auction is triggered. The auction is done in a similar way as in The Merchants of Amsterdam, meaning that players have to hit a spring driven auction clock to place a bid and win the auction. The object is to buy your vegetables cheap (during an auction) and to sell them with profit (whenever one is one a vegetable space of a sort that one has bought). I suspect this light Dutch bidding game with a high dose of luck (due to the die) was released in the early '90s.&#10;&#10;",

(e.g, take from your opponent's 3 and put it on your two). &#10;There are no sixes, sixes do nothing. In fact, rolling double sixes requires you to remove one of your own coins. Otherwise, rolling doubles allows you to go again.&#10;The first to cover all his/her numbers wins.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on the type of city a player&rsquo;s pawn lands a player may raise funds, spend funds to get vote chips, declare vote chips for a state in the hopes of getting a plurality to earn that state&rsquo;s electoral votes or go head-to-head with another opponent in a debate. Lines connect the cities to regulate the movement of the players&rsquo; pawns.&#10;&#10;The players divide $72 million dollars and each chooses a different city to start the game. To move, a player rolls the die and advances that many cities unless the roll in a one and that allows a free move to anywhere on the gameboard. The city landed upon regulates what a player&rsquo;s actions are on that turn. After taking one&rsquo;s turn the player advances the calendar pawn one day. The game is over after seventy-two days. The players add up their votes and each state&rsquo;s electoral votes are awarded to the player who has the most votes. Ties go to whomever rolls the higher number. States where no one has any votes goes to the player who has declared the most popular votes in that region. The player who has the most electoral votes is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

This gives the impression that this is a traveling game. The closed box measures 23x13cms. Each player receives 1 colored counter (available colors are red, yellow, white and blue). There are also 4 dice in two colors (red &amp; blue) but the dice don't contain the traditional 1 to 6 numbers but range from 0 to 4 and also includes a cross on one side. The gameboard is a cycling track in an oval shape. Different kind of races can be played on the track: sprint, time trial, chase, keirin or a points race. The mechanism is purely rolling dice thus the luck factor is rather high here.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "East-German cycling game. Each player controls a team of 4 cyclists. The game is not dice controlled and not with cards either. In fact it has quite a tactical system, the rules are quite simple but don't depend on luck. Per turn each cyclist can use either 3,4,5 or 6 action points to move the same number of squares (each number can be used only once). There can't be more than one rider on a square (except the blue ones), so riders can eventually be blocked. The red marks are intermediate sprints, where 4 points are awarded to the winner. The blue squares are punctures. There are also bonus points for a cyclists who helps another cyclist (for example after a puncture), this bonus is added because of 'comradely behavior' (the communist regime clearly showing here). At the end of the race every cyclist gets points (80 for the winner, 76 for the second,...). Now the players add up the finishing-points and bonus points of their 4 cyclist to determine who wins the game. The board (58*32cms.) looks surprisingly beautiful and well designed for an East-German game, the cyclist are also well produced, in plastic. Nice vintage game for collectors of sports games.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls a team of 2 cyclists, the movement is done by rolling 2 dice. Tactics are quite simple and limited to deciding which cyclist a player will move.

There are 189 cards that determine the value (ranging from 7 to 16) of the movement, 27 bonus cards, 17 risk cards, 6 metro cards and 25 replenishing cards. The winner is the player who's cyclist reaches the longest distance after the finish line after the final turn.

From there, 6 routes of equal length lead to 6 destinations: Edinburgh, Helsinki, Athens, Istanbul, Palermo and Gibraltar.&#10;&#10;Object of the game is to be the first player reaching one of the destination towns. Each player has a starting capital of 1000 Deutsche Mark. Towns on the way are stopovers, where the means of transportations to the next town must be fixed. Moreover, a chance card must be drawn, which indicates, if the travel goes on normally, of if additional luggage or passengers must be taken on.&#10;&#10;Walking by foot is slow, but the cheapest means of transportation.   Faster movement is desired (bicycle, car, train and airplane), but costs rise drastically when using them. If a player runs out of money, he is eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turn drawing white or black dots, according to their color.  They then take turns drawing lines between dots, without regard to color.  Points are scored when a triangle is formed which cannot be further subdivided.  The player who completed the triangle scores one point for each of their own dots in the completed triangle.  The game ends when no further triangles can be formed and the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Divide and Conquer was invented on a dry-erase board with colored magnetic dots in 1996 and was published in the Origins preregistration book with the title Triangulous.

The game also contains several tokens, which you had to cut out from the magazine. There is a green and yellow jersey, the polkadot mountain jersey, a tour-caravan token and several 1 to 3 peaked mountain tokens. You need also a die and a number of chips or matches, whatever you like. The paper gameboard has the Tour de France route of 1965 printed on it. At the start, every player gets some chips as starting money. After a stage is finished, the tour caravan pawn moves to the next stage. Every stage has a number printed on, this is important for the dice rolling. You need to roll that number for winning the stage. Since this fame is purely based on dice rolling, the rules are very simple. You can earn or lose chips depending on how the dice rolls. The game ends when the tour caravan reaches the final stage in Paris. The player who has the most chips at this point wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The board measures 64x48cm., there are 18 cyclists, 2 dice, 40 lap winner cards, 40 booster cards and 32 chance cards in the game. The mechanism is not difficult. The criterium goes over a number of laps that is agreed between the players (this determines the length of the game). One the map there is a track that gives the players multiple choice to determine the circuit. A number of spaces on the track are colored yellow and blue. When a cyclist is on a yellow space he receives a power card (also when he finishes a lap and starts a new lap), on the blue spaces a player has to draw a chance card. It is also possible that a cyclists takes a wrong route (this can happen with a chance card). There are also spaces that contain a text (for example 'flat tyre'). Winner is the player who's cyclist covers first the total distance of the criterium. With the dice and the card drawing this Canadian game has a high luck factor but the cyclist lover will certainly enjoy it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kariba and Kalak are 2 different games by Frank Stark that come in one box. Both can be played using the same components. Kariba, the main game, is a 2 player variant inspired by the Mancala game family. Kalak is a Marbles variant, or rather, a pebble-flicking dexterity game whose arena is created by assembling the 2 piece jigsaw board in an alternative way. Kalak is mainly aimed at younger players.&#10;&#10;KARIBA&#10;This variation on the age-old Kalah game keeps the familiar sowing movement rules, but it introduces an alternative way to capture stones and dramatically changes the way the board is used. It also introduces new types of pebbles. They now come in 3 different colours, each with its own value, and one even with a special protective ability. The board shows 2 large scoring pits at either end of the board. Between them, 2 rows of just 4 pits are sitting side by side. Each player is assigned one row of 4 that ends in their private scoring pit. This row is the only row in which a player will place their own pieces and it should be obvious that the players move in opposite directions.&#10;&#10;At the start, both players get a set of 25 stones that forms the supply, and these are kept beside the board. It is a mix of 3 types: 20 stones that are worth 1 point, 3 treasure stones that are worth 2, and 2 guard stones that are not only worth 3 points, but also protect all stones in a pit from capture, as long as a black stone is not caught out sitting on its own. By itself, a guard stone is equally vulnerable to capture.&#10;&#10;In turn, players pick up 1-4 tones from supply and move them onto the board, or remove all stones from one of their own pits and move these further along the track towards the scoring pit. To move a hand of stones, the player chooses the first hand stone and drops it into the pit it would reach next on its way to the scoring pit. Then, 1 stone is dropped in each pit thereafter until a player's hand is empty. When a player manages to drop a stone into the scoring pit (here players are forced to drop the lowest value stone), it is safe and counts toward their end total. All remaining hand stones go back to supply and must start all over again. When one player has no more stones left to move, the game ends. Players add up the total points in their own pit. The loser ignores any stones left en-route on the board, but subtracts the value of the stones still in supply from this total. The player with the highest score wins, with simple tie-breakers provided.&#10;&#10;What makes this game interesting is the way by which opposing pieces are captured. When a stone is placed in an empty hole, all opposition stones that sit beside it and are not protected by at least one guard stone are captured and are immediately added to the pit of the capturing player, boosting that player's score. The high stone total triggers the need for continued protection from capture by Guard Stones, which adds to the deliberations to be made. Guards stones will be deliberately played so they overshoot the scoring pit, ensuring their continued services as protectors of all other stones on their way to the scoring pit. However, sacrifices will have to be made, making continual forward planning a requirement for victory.&#10;&#10;KALAK&#10;By flipping over one side of the jigsaw board, a flat surface is revealed for the bottom half of the board, and that leaves a square of 4 small pits with 1 large one directly above it at the top. The player sits at the base of the flat surface board, and makes a smiling pebble face by placing 2 black pupil stones in the lower &quot;eye socket&quot; pits, 2 blue ones underneath the nose-shaped jigsaw lock to make nostrils, and by creating a smiling mouth of the remaining 8 blue stones underneath.&#10;&#10;In phase 1, the player flicks each blue stone once, trying to reach the large target pit at the top. Only blue stones that fall into this pit can be taken into the second phase, the rest are removed. In phase 2, the player places all surviving stones in a single row on the bottom edge, including the 2 eye stones if more than 4 stones survived the first phase. Again, stones are all flicked once, but this time the player determines their end score. Each pitted stone scored one point, but player's will have to spread the stones out across all pits, as any stones that supercede the maximum capacity set for each pit in this phase are worthless. Optional rules to make it harder by using special landing restrictions for the then also more valuable eye stones, or making it easier by relaxing the set-up for phase 2 are also included.&#10;&#10;PUBLICATION HISTORY:&#10;&#10;     2006 Kariba (including Kalak) Gerhards Spiel und Design - deluxe wooden version - in print (last checked oct 2006)&#10;&#10;&#10;Gerhards Spiel und Design produces their wooden games range to high standards, and this is no exception. The 2 solid oiled beech wood board pieces slot together seamlessly, and the (minimum of) 50 semi-precious stones are colourful and elegant. A string-chord storage bag for these is provided. The whole set fits in a remarkably small box, roughly the size of a DVD box set. Frank Stark has been releasing a couple of board games each year through this smaller German imprint, after being attracted by the quality of its products.&#10;&#10;ADDITIONAL INFO:&#10;&#10;     language skill needed: language neutral. It comes with German rules.&#10;     english translation: Clemens Gerhards has made an English translation available.&#10;     artwork: none, Clemens Gerhards games come in plain brown, ribbed cardboard boxes with the game title burnt into the lid. &#10;     awards won: none.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: in 2008 Clemens Gerhards published a three piece jigsaw board edition. An additional piece can be added to the original Kariba board so that a new board with two rows of six pits sitting side by side is produced. This expansion provides new tactical challenges to the game. In addition, rules for a two player game called &quot;Cubango&quot;, a Kalaha variant that is played using the expanded board, are also included.&#10;&#10;",

One hit and your enemy's ship will be history.  Of course, one hit and you will be history as well.&#10;&#10;Stellar Annihilation is a simple game in which each player draws (in pencil) a fleet of ships on opposite ends of a sheet of paper.  The paper is then folded and the first player shoots by drawing a dot on the back of the sheet with a marker.  The paper is then unfolded and the players check to see if a ship was hit.  Any ship hit is destroyed.  Players take turns shooting until one fleet is annihilated.&#10;&#10;In the solitaire game you draw an enemy fleet and attempt to destroy it in a set number of turns.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Starchec is actually a 2-games box with 2 different games in it. Common to both games is the use of 6-sided chess-die showing the 6 chess symbols: knight, bishop, rook, pawn, queen and king. Each turn, the die is rolled and allows 1 playing piece to make a chess move according to the roll of the die.&#10;&#10;Starchec-1, Wettlauf um die Sterne (race around the stars):&#10;&#10;&#10;2-4 players can play. Each player has 1 &quot;saucer&quot; and 1 &quot;meteor&quot;. Object of the game is to be the first player, who brings his saucer to the finish line. Meteors are used to block opponent saucer; they can only be moved, when a king is rolled, but the can be placed everywhere on the board then. If a saucer captures another saucer, the 2 involved saucers just change places.Starchec-2, Spiel im Weltall (game in outer space):&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is played on a normal chessboard. Each of the 2 players has 8 tokens, which are placed on two opposing sides of the board. Winner of the game is the player, who brings all 8 tokens on the opposing side of the board first. Captures result in an exchange of positions again, but it's also allowed to &quot;capture&quot; own pieces, if a player does not want to move any of his tokens.   ",

Heroically they have braved the darkest pits, the foulest creatures, and the most perilous of quests.&#10;&#10;This, however, is not such a game.&#10;&#10;Welcome to The Imp Game! Rather than taking on the role of one of these namby-pamby heroes, players in the Imp Game take on a much more entertaining role: that of the common, dungeon imp! Servants of a wannabe dark and quasi-evil overlord, players scour the world in search of items of power, foil the plots of &ldquo;evil&rdquo; Adventurers, and clean out the dungeons whenever needed, getting themselves into mess after mess with the only way out is to help each other!&#10;&#10;The Imp Game is a wonderfully hilarious game for 2 to 5 players of all ages. The Imp Game features a powerful &quot;Failure&quot; mechanic that captures the feeling of inept but stupidly lucky sidekicks, ensuring that success is inevitable, but who succeeds at what?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Rules:&#10;&quot;Feeeeed Meeeee is the most popular game among the Big Trolls. The rules are simple: Big Trolls sit around a table loaded with food.. but they are not allowed to eat! As time passes, they get hungrier and hungrier. The first Big Troll that can&acute;t control his hunger and starts to eat the food is the loser&quot;&#10;&#10;You must collect sets of food cards. This is done by rolling 2 dice to determine how many action points you get for the turn. With these action points you move to different storage places and collect food.&#10;&#10;The Swedish edition, called Glufs Glufs, was included in issue 5/2006 of the Swedish games magazine Fenix.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An analysis of &quot;matrix games&quot; where each player has a set of &quot;strategies&quot; to choose from - these are just labels, could be rock/paper/scissors - and there are pre-arranged &quot;payoffs&quot; according to which strategies are chosen. Prisoner's Dilemma is a well-known example of such a &quot;game&quot;. Or, consider the following example, paraphrased from the text.&#10;&#10;Aldie and Derk decide to play a game for daiquiris. Each throws one or two fingers. If both throw one finger, Aldie buys Derk a daiquiri. If both throw two fingers, Derk buys Aldie two daiquiris. If they don't match, Aldie pays Derk a dime. (At the time this book was written, daiquiris were 55 cents.) How much per game should Derk demand of Aldie in order to make this game worthwhile?&#10;&#10;This text can help you solve this problem, or others like it. In particular, this is the type of game theory floating around behind certain sports simulations like Football Strategy or MLB SportsClix, although the latter has dice as well as the strategy selection.&#10;&#10;",

Don't fret though, rules are included to play the routine memory style game of matching pairs.  The game was published by BETEXA which is in the Czech Republic.  FEVA, located in the United Kingdom, was the distributor.  This game is hard to find and most likely would appeal to collectors of Lord of the Rings themed games.&#10;&#10;",

Stimulating young children to understand the value of energy and how not to waste it, is vital. This boardgame has been developed as an extension to the resource pack and posters, following requests from teachers already using the material.&#10;&#10;The game has been designed for use within the primary school, linking science and literacy at various skill levels. On the following pages, are not only background information, facts and ways to play the game, but also suggested variations and ideas for follow up activities.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Lowcy Zwierzat&quot; (or &quot;Animal hunters&quot;) is a print and play game where players move their pieces (hunters) on a hexagonal desert. Once 4 hunters are next to a hex with an animal that animal is captured by the player who has most hunters nearby. Hunters move one hex at a time unless they manage to form a group, which allows them to move about much more quickly.&#10;&#10;",
