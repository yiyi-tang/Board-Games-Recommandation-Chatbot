    "Description": "In the dark depths of a drifting space wreck, a small team of specialists investigates unusual scanner readings of life on board.  The team acts relaxed; banter hides their anxiety.  Motion scanners show nothing; torches illuminate the dank corridor casting long shadows.&#10;&#10;Suddenly the point man's scanner shows movement ahead, increasing in speed.  His reflexes are conditioned by experience, so he shoulders the carbine.  The torch illuminates a horrific shape.  Recognising danger the point man fires the carbine in a rapid series of bursts.&#10;&#10;An alien screeches of pain and the creature falls to the ground.  You have just made first contact.&#10;&#10;More motion scanners come to life, movement all around you starts closing in through the maze of ship's corridors.  This is more than five men can handle.

The first player picks up two stars and if the pictures underneath are the same the stars are kept.  If not, the stars go back into the sky.  Then the second player picks up two stars, etc.  Who will collect the most stars?  To play a NEW game there is the possibility to change the picture-plates underneath, fitting the colors, around the holes in the corners, to the same colors of the pegs.  There are two plates, printed on both sides, that give four different possibilities.  To add even more playing possibilities, there are 5 papers included for drawing, or gluing pictures or photos.  &#10;To practice before playing memo, you can start with a simple game, where you look for each pair.  One picture is covered with a star, who will find the same picture?&#10;&#10;",

It is a two-player operational wargame simulates the War of Resistance (&#230;&#138;&#151;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#239;&#188;&#137;1937-45. One player commands the Imperial Japanese Army (&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#229;&#184;&#157;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#233;&#153;&#184;&#232;&#187;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#137;and the other player commands the National Revolutionary Army&#239;&#188;&#136;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#233;&#157;&#169;&#229;&#145;&#189;&#232;&#187;&#141;).&#10;&#10;Leonard To who is the designer of War of the Suns&#239;&#188;&#136;&#229;&#164;&#169;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#239;&#188;&#137; tried to use another way to show the history of War of Resistance in this new game.&#10;The Everlasting Glory (&#232;&#139;&#177;&#231;&#131;&#136;&#229;&#141;&#131;&#231;&#167;&#139;) uses the same research and basic game concepts as War of the Suns: The War of Resistance 1937-1945, while focusing less on the non-military aspects.&#10;&#10;There are also 4 fundamental changes in the game design:&#10;1. The use of area movement instead of hexes. Each area is a province. It speeds up the game. By organizing combats in an area, similar dynamic like that of hex and counters has been maintained.&#10;2. The use of generic units instead of unit IDs. This is a tough choice. It reduces the effort of the player to locate individual units, and makes it more flexible in losses and breakdowns calculations. Historical unit IDs are provided in the OB for those who are interested in unit history.&#10;3. A 2-players instead of a 3-players game. The game is now played between the KMT and Japan players. Game mechanism controls CCP. British and part of the Japanese forces in India and Burma are removed cause they do not represent the core of the Chinese struggle. It again speeds up the game, and removes a player who has little to do sometimes.&#10;4. The use of cards. This is not a card-driven game but strategy, command and logistics cards are included to handle those aspects.&#10;&#10;There are 6 scenarios included: &#10;&#10;    1 Campaign scenario&#10;    2 Operational scenarios: Space for Time, Operation Ichigo &#10;    3 Introductory scenarios: Fist of Fury, Retreat to Victory, Plan B&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    540 5/8&quot; counters&#10;    60 Cards in English, 60 Cards in Chinese&#10;    1 A1 map in Chinese &amp; English (mounted)&#10;    1 Chinese &amp; English Rule book&#10;    1 Chinese &amp; English Scenario book&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You will also need the provided set of 12 tokens (or coins if the officers are elsewhere).&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;At the start of a game the following number of tokens are placed in the center of the playing area, depending on the number of players taking part:&#10;&#10;4 players: 3 Emperor tokens, 6 Compass tokens, and 3 Lady tokens&#10;3 players: 2 Emperor tokens, 4 Compass tokens, and 2 Lady tokens&#10;2 players: 1 Emperor tokens, 2 Compass tokens, and 1 Lady token&#10;&#10;Choose who goes first.&#10;&#10;Players, clockwise in turn, roll the dice once and try to get five-of-a-kind. Players may keep as many of the previous player's dice and roll the remaining ones in their turn.&#10;&#10;A player who rolls 5 Compass tokens (regardless if it is the Compass or the Marked Compass) claims one Compass token from the center. A player who rolls 5 Emperor tokens claims one Emperor token from the center. A player who rolls 5 Lady tokens claims one Lady token from the center.&#10;&#10;Once a player has made five-of-a-kind and claimed their reward, the next player rolls all the dice to start the next round. If a player is unable to claim their reward from the center because there are none left, they may take one from another player.&#10;&#10;If 3 Marked Compass die faces are rolled that player may take the &lsquo;roundabout&rsquo; die to use during future turns; rolling it once when taking it to determine its use during the time the player has control of it. The player can only lose that die if another player rolls 3 Marked Compasses and takes it from them.&#10;&#10;This die gives the player the following bonuses:&#10;&#10;The Engineer - the player is allowed to take a token on a 4 of a kind&#10;(a crafty engineer always makes the best of a situation)&#10;&#10;The Mistress - the player allowed to take a 2nd roll of any dice they choose&#10;(one girl here and one girl there)&#10;&#10;The Cutpurse - the player can choose one die which will be locked and&#10;cannot be re-rolled by an adjacent player to their left or right as indicated by the die&#10;(the left hand never knows what the right is doing)&#10;&#10;The Alchemist - the player may choose any token in center not yet taken&#10;i.e. acts as a 5 wild&#10;(lead turns to gold)&#10;&#10;The Spy - The Roundabout die is lost by that player and placed back in the center&#10;(your secrets will gain you nothing)&#10;&#10;The first player to hold a Emperor, Lady and two Compass tokens wins the game.&#10;&#10;this game is based on the ancient roman game Jactus&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's feeding time for the chickens, and you've got a lot of hungry mouths to feed in your hen house. So out into the barnyard you go, looking for tasty spiders, worms, beetles, and bits of corn. All you need to do is grab it and bring it back to your henhouse. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other chickens in the yard that are trying to grab the same food! Will you be able to successfully maneuver your chickens to collect the most food and feed your flock?&#10;&#10;In Chicken Feed Stampede!, players control a pair of chickens trying to collect food as they run around the barnyard. While doing so, they have to avoid other chickens and the fox, which chases the chickens to the edge of the barnyard, forcing them to the edge to start over.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a set of eight action cards to determine how their chickens are moved each turn.&#10;&#10;There are four different kinds of food available, and each gives the player who collects it a different ability or score. Player order is managed by placing their turn markers on the &quot;Pecking Order&quot; board. Clever management of your actions to stay at the top of the pecking order is needed to win the game.&#10;&#10;The game board is comprised of a grid of various terrain tiles. A chicken's movement ability is based on the terrain of the tile it starts its move from. Using the boulders and gravel paths gets you around faster, but sometimes you need to get into the grass to collect the food you need.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;   - Modular Board featuring barnyard terrain&#10;   - 12 chicken tokens (chickeneeples!) in six colors&#10;   - 48 chicken action cards&#10;   - 36 food tokens (spiders, worms, beetles and corn)&#10;   - one fox token&#10;   - 6 chicken turn marker tokens&#10;   - 6 Rooster Crow special power tokens&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;It's War!! ...but in a nice way.&quot;&#10;&#10;Good: the Battle is a miniatures based combat skirmish game, in which you take the role of a character or characters and attempt to defeat your opponents by doing good and inflicting bad upon them. The core game, designed by us at Project Good is the game of Good: the Battle. The uniqueness of Good: The Battle is it's ability to use any genre, any miniatures, anywhere, anything else...? Yes there is, but it's all Good...&#10;&#10;Unlike the heavily stat-based games that you see everywhere nowadays, Good: the battle turns these statistics  into two basic attributes; Good and bad. Obviously the better you are at things (shooting, close combat, healing, etc.) the longer you will survive in this world, but everyone has a limit of how much Good they can do. Nasty things like damage, curses, etc can only be described as Bad things, but sometimes a bit of bad is exactly what is needed.&#10;&#10;There are thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of character miniature manufacturers out there; and every single one of these can be used in Good: the Battle - regardless of scale, setting, period, race, etc. Good: the Battle uses the actual miniature to give you benefits in the game. For example; a miniature equipped with swords will be better in close combat, than somebody with none. A miniature carrying a rocket launcher will obviously do more damage if it shoots you in the head. Huge dragons will have more hit points, and mice will have less. But this doesn't mean a one-armed dwarf mute who's only weapon is a bag full of dead hamsters won't be able to put up a fight...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game features a circular metal lithographed playing board, which is very similar to a metal tray.  The board has a &quot;gun&quot; at the bottom which shoots metal balls at metal airplanes which are placed at the 4 predetermined positions near the top half of the board.  A pullstring is wrapped around the spinner and then it is pulled like a top.  The metal balls are then loaded into the left side of the &quot;gun&quot; and the spinning mechanism &quot;fires&quot; the balls out the other side of the gun in rapid fire.  The metal airplanes have a ball-bearing on the underside of the planes that allows them to rest in the holes near the top of the board.  When a fired shot hits the airplane it is dislodged from its position and it falls toward the bottom of the playing area, thus crashing into the ground.   The player then scores points based on which airplanes are shot down.  Each player gets a set number of &quot;shots&quot; and the player with the most points after all players have taken their shots wins the game.  &#10;This game is made by McDowell Mfg. and was manufactured around the 1930's.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture and the slave insurrections in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), the richest trading colony in the new world,  shocked and terrified Western Nations. Not since Spartacus had slave rebellions succeeded on such a grand scale. However, this story cannot be confined to a single leader like Toussaint. It is far more complicated, riddled with intrigue and rife with defections. There is no shortage of villains, and heroes are often conflicted. On the surface, the topic is obscure but the ramifications for this conflict were incredibly far-reaching.&#10;&#10;Black Eagles is a card assisted, multi-player, area movement cube game that covers the period 1792-1804. Black Eagles is broken into four distinct scenarios: the &quot;Rights of Man,&quot; or the introduction of republican ideals to the island; &quot;Imperial Designs,&quot; or the invasion of English and Spanish forces; &quot;Civil War,&quot; internal conflict between the Mulattos and the rebel leaders; and finally &quot;Leclerc Invades,&quot; featuring Napoleon's attempt to restore slavery to the island.&#10;&#10;Black Eagles allows one (yes, there is a solitaire version) to four players to command one of five historical rebel leaders, Toussaint L'Ouverture included, as well as Napoleon's veteran general Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc. Those not commanded by players become factions available for alliance, along with the Gros Blancs, the Petits Blancs, the Spanish, the French, and the English, each provides the controlling player with a special ability. Alliances are fluid, as is the allegiance of the very units under your command. The more of the island's economy a player controls the more havoc he can cause with the funds he collects. On the other hand, the player who carries the least influence automatically controls the Petits Blancs and no matter how weak a player is, he can always attack a stronger player's economic base.&#10;&#10;Black Eagles is no longer in its infancy. Play testing has proven it to be well worthwhile. Scenario play ranges from 90 minutes to four hours. Components include a 22&quot; by 34&quot; map, 45 card events that affect play in various turn phases  --cards also provide resolution for the devastating Yellow Fever. THe game will include Player aids, hundreds of 6mm colored cubes (factional combat units), and several sheets of miscellaneous markers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game from India published for the purpose of educating children in the teachings of the guru Gnani Purush Shri Ambalal Muljibhai Patel, also known as Dada Bhagwan. It consists of two separate boardgames: &quot;Dada's World&quot;, which teaches about how to behave apropriately in given situations and answer questions about the guru's teachings; and &quot;Guess, Who Am I?&quot;, which focuses on identifying role models.&#10;&#10;Game 1 (Dada's World) - Players roll a die and move along a track which represents their journey through Dada's World, collecting rectangular plastic &quot;coins&quot; with a variety of point values. &#10;Landing on marked spaces along the track can either add points (Helped Poor Person: 100), subtract points (Killed a cockroach: -150), provide the opportunity to answer questions about Dada's teachings to earn points (Dadai Dhamaka), lose turns, take extra turns, go back to Home, and other similar effects. At certain points on the track, players have the opportunity to pay points to take a shorter route.&#10;The winner is the first player to make a complete circuit of the track and return to the start space with 1500 points or more. Players who complete the track with fewer than 1500 points must go back to an earlier square and try to accumulate more points.&#10;&#10;Game 2 (Guess, Who Am I?) - Players roll a die and move along a track collecting pieces of three separate puzzles. Most of the spaces on the board are marked with a statement associated with one of the three &quot;role models&quot; - Parents, Dadashri and Humanity. When landing on a space on the board, players must identify which role model is associated with the statement on that space (example: Space #17 &quot;We should bow down to them every day&quot; is associated with Parents). Correctly identifying the role model allows the player to take the puzzle piece associated with that space. &#10;Other spaces give the player a free random puzzle piece, allow the player to take a piece from another player, or cause the player to lose a turn. Players who reach the end of the track without winning the game move back to Start and continue to collect puzzle pieces.&#10;To win, a player must collect all 12 pieces of one of the three puzzles. He may then assemble the puzzle to see a picture representing one of the role models, then flip the pieces over to reveal a message.&#10;&#10;From the rule booklet:&#10;&#10;Hello kids!!!&#10;&#10;Time to enter DADA'S WORLD filled with excitement, fun &amp; learn.....&#10;&#10;This 2-in-1 Game Pack offer dual knowledge and fun, Get the tracks right from 'Home' to 'Simandhar City' and back 'Home' in Game 1.

These include ships, subs and air raids.&#10;- 36 contact counters - Using NTDS symbols, these will represent the location of the enemy forces (or uknown/neutral ones!), until they are positively identified.&#10;- A few system counters&#10;- 1D10 and 1D6 dice will be needed&#10;&#10;As a starting point, this game will have one campaign included (Cold War 1985), but others can be easily added later, either by just using the existing components/era settings or by creating new ones.&#10;&#10;WEBSITE (under construction): www.pbshots.biz/contact&#10;&#10;",

Players begin the game &quot;snowed in&quot; requiring them to &quot;dig out,&quot; or score 100 points before they may begin collecting points. The first player to score 1,000 or more points wins the game! The game has a strategy component where players may trap other players in the cabin, preventing them from scoring.&#10;&#10;Special scoring situations have easily recognizable winter themed monikers. Players encounter obstacles along the way in the form of certain types of die rolls (&quot;squalls,&quot; &quot;thaws,&quot; &quot;broken chairlifts&quot;) which may end their turn or put them in the cabin. In addition to obstacles there are special die rolls that immediately reward a player such as &quot;vacations&quot; and &quot;chairlifts&quot;.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Cabin Fever is designed for 2-8 players with an optimal number of 3 or more players. A game can be played with more than 8 players at the consequence of extending the game's duration. All that is needed in addition to the game is a pad of paper and a pencil or pen with which to keep score.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player rolls a single die to determine who starts the game. The highest roll goes first (after resolving ties). All players are considered &ldquo;snowed in&rdquo; and must &quot;dig out&quot; by rolling 100 points or more on the scoring dice. Once a player digs out he or she ends his or her turn and passes the scoring dice to the next player on the left (clockwise) and may begin scoring on his or her next turn. The first player to accumulate 1,000 points wins the game!&#10;&#10;The five same color dice included with the game are called scoring dice. Players start a turn by rolling all five dice (opening roll) in an attempt to create matching die faces. Players may elect to end their turn at any time and collect their points (with a minimum requirement of a matching pair). Players may continue a turn to earn more points but must roll at least one match to an existing match, or create a new matching set on each consecutive re-roll of non-matching dice. Dice that have been assigned to a match may not be re-rolled. If players fail to roll a match on a re-roll they immediately end their turn and do not collect any points.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;    * 5 Scoring Dice (white)&#10;    * 1 Vacation Die (green)&#10;    * Cabin game piece (clear)&#10;    * Cabin Fever rules sheet&#10;    * 3 &quot;I have Cabin Fever!&quot; stickers&#10;    * Palm-sized, clear acrylic, travel box&#10;&#10;",

In the Evening, players alternate placing one Star at a time in the Sky, on an empty square. In the Night, each player must move one of his Astronomer every turn. The Astronomer can move in a direct line in every direction, any number of unoccupied squares. He must land in an unoccupied square. The Astronomer may choose not to move, in order to &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; one of the opponent&rsquo;s Astronomers set in a neighbouring square. The result of a pinch is that the pinched Astronomer must move in the next turn. Moreover, it is forbidden to the opponent, in the second next turn, to pinch an Astronomer that occupies the abandoned square.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player who manages to place his Astronomers in the same way as the opponent&rsquo;s Stars. Translations, reflections and rotations are allowed. Also, a player can win by pinching an Astronomer that is not able to move.&#10;&#10;Sicic is latin for &ldquo;stellae inerrantes caeli imitatio consequi&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Online Play: Super Duper Games&#10;&#10;",

The player takes the corresponding assignment card and has to fulfill the assignment.&#10;The game also contents 'magic stones'. These stones are needed with some of the assignments.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to learn more about yourself, your friends or about your future.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes one clockwork, strawberry board, 4 worm cards (1 blue, 1 green, 1 red and 1 yellow) and 20 green worms with coloured tail ends, 5 worms in each of the 4 colours.&#10;&#10;You set the game up by randomly placing the worms in the holes in the strawberry and then each player selects a colour.  The aim of the game is to be the first player to get all 5 worms in your colour.  There is a lever at the top of the board, pull it and release to make the worms start wiggling (you'll have to repeat this frequently throughout the game as it only lasts for 10 seconds or so).&#10;&#10;Once started players take it in turns, beginning with the youngest player, to grab a worm from the strawberry.  If it matches their card they keep it, if not they put it back and then the next player goes.  You keep going around until one player gets all of their 5 worms.&#10;&#10;This is a very simple kids memory game with a dexterity element as you try and grab the wiggling worms as they move up and down in the board.&#10;&#10;",

Clones are extremely disposable, and inflicting serious injuries and death upon the opponent&rsquo;s team is a major part of the game&rsquo;s strategy. A decapitation will add an additional ball to the arena which can also be used as weapon.&#10;&#10;In leagues and tournaments, each player generates a unique team that carries on from game to game. Clones who suffer injuries or death in the arena will have temporary to permanent reductions to their stats, but are easily replaceable between matches. The ones that survive are awarded experience which can be used to improve attributes and purchase additional abilities.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Grid Snakes is a quick-playing game with some real-world dexterity elements for two, four, or six players (with variant rules for three, five, and seven to twelve players). You&rsquo;re a digital snake, trapped in an arena with several other snakes. As you move, you leave body segments behind you. Your goal is to eliminate your opponents by forcing your opponents to crash into the edge of the board or and section of any other player.&#10;&#10;Play is simultaneous (so there's no down time) and proceeds through the following phases: plan, challenge, resolve.  During planning, you have a just a handful seconds to pick a direction and a speed for your snake. When all instructions are revealed, any player may spend a token to challenge another player.  If you're challenged, you have to flick a token onto a chart; where it lands dictates your speed for the turn.  During resolution, you move the snakes, add body segments, and check for collisions.&#10;&#10;Grid Snakes uses a large and a small custom board, several small custom decks of cards (eight cards each), some nickels or quarters, and a lot of colored glass beads (or other small tokens). The rules and cards are available at: http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/165/&#10;&#10;Grid Snakes has fairly simple rules, but requires quick decision making and planning. Grid Snakes is appropriate for ages 12 and up. If you eliminate the timer, you could probably play this game with slightly younger children. If you allow multiple attempts on reflex challenges, you could go even younger. A four-player game takes 30 minutes or fewer to play. A six-player game takes 40 minutes or fewer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tigele is the first volume of a 4 volume game/game system. Tigele like the other Volumes is a standalone game. Meaning as it comes out of the box,  it is a working game. Tigele may be added to other volumes as an expansion. Or the other volumes may be added to it, in part or whole, as expansions. Or this volume may be mixed with parts of the other volumes to form whole new games.&#10;&#10;Tigele is a battle strategy game made up of 100 tiles comprised of 72 pictographs forming just several tile types. the game was played by a small community of individuals in the North west corner of Montana for almost 20 years. Slowly evolving into this publish version. (Long cold winters and beer)&#10;&#10;Oddities of the game:&#10;1) We call the game a board game, even though it is a tile game; because, the tiles in part make up the playing area, a 10 X 10 layout of tile we call a field. The field is comprised of two opponents laid out in 10 X 5 (1/2 the field we call the courts). That area once established remains a constant grid for play throughout the game. Thus the tiles making a randomized board.&#10;&#10;2) The tiles used above are the playing board and the playing pieces.&#10;&#10;3) The game uses the relationships of one tiles to another as a mechanic to manipulate luck, and unforeseen or uncontrolled  events. This also encourages ever developing tactics and interpersonal strategies (more so when later volumes are played in concert with one another).&#10;&#10;4) The box instructions gives two player mode instruction. but the game plays up to 4 players in the Volume One level. The 3 and 4 player modes of play are suggested on our web site.&#10;&#10;5) The game was designed for two primary reasons. To help keep the designer brother out of trouble and as a model of one basic form of social political behavior...Don't ask me.&#10;&#10;6) Hard rules augmented with a few soft rules. the soft rules force personal interaction and create a fog of war atmosphere...again don't ask me...it just works.&#10;&#10;7) Players on your side of play may or may not really be playing on your side.&#10;&#10;8) The game uses its art as a fog of war mechanism.&#10;&#10;9) The game has a slight learning curve; but the game is basic in  play.&#10;&#10;",
