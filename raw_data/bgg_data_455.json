    "Description": "&quot;The Amazing Adventures of Simon the Fisherman&quot; (aka apostle Peter)&#10;&#10;This is a religious trivia/party game with roll-and-move mechanics and a deck of trivia/task/event cards.&#10;&#10;The game board is a map of Palestine in 33 AD, where the game is set. Each player assumes the role of Simon (Peter) in travelling through the Holy Land in search of three Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven.&#10; By rolling a 6-sided die, the players move through land, mountain, and water routes. Each city on the map has a face-down counter; these counters represent events and items, including the Keys. When a player lands on a city, they must roll the die to determine whether they must a) turn the counter immediately, b) answer a trivia question, or c) perform a task. The biblical trivia questions are multi-choice (3) and on a correct answer the counter can be turned. The tasks are pantomimes such as &quot;sewing&quot;, &quot;smoke getting into eyes&quot; etc. If another player guesses the task correctly, the counter can be turned, and the guesser also gets an extra roll on her turn.&#10;&#10;A negative result in the trivia or task finishes the player's turn, but she can remain in the space and try again on the next turn.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on a violet space, an event takes place; these are also included in the trivia cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect three Keys and proceed to the finish (&quot;ship bound for Rome&quot;) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

In this 3-6 player map, players compete to build and deliver goods to steamboats which are moving up and down the Mississippi River. Instead of urbanizing towns into cities, players use the Steamboat Building action to build steamboats outside of port cities. Delivering to a steamboat provides players with a 1 income bonus, and goods can be transported from and through steamboats as well. Each turn, the steamboats move a certain number of spaces up or down the river.&#10;&#10;Age of Steam Expansion: Golden Spike: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in 1860&rsquo;s Western USA, where the Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad raced towards each other in order to complete the first transcontinental railroad system with the Golden Spike. This is a 4-player team-dependent map, with players delivering goods to cities along the main route to build more track towards Promontory; if one side reaches before the other, their opponents are eliminated. The map starts with pre-printed &quot;hidden&quot; track tiles which are revealed each time a good is delivered to a city along the main Sacramento/Promontory/Omaha line. The game ends on the turn that at least one team reaches Promontory; if both teams reach it, victory points are tabulated as usual. If only one team reaches it, the other team's score is reduced to zero (but the winning team still determines each of their score using the traditional manner).&#10;&#10;This expansion is professionally designed, printed and mounted on double-sided gameboard, just like the original Age of Steam map.&#10;&#10;",

The paper dolls are each in different colors, has drawings of three Pixietail creatures, and has three cut-out portions wherein Pixietail tokens may be inserted.  The object of the game is to be the first player to collect all three Pixietail tokens to insert in her paper doll and find the Castle disk.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with the Spinner to determine the area in the gameboard where she may select face-down Pink disks.  If the other side of the disk she picked up has a Pixietail image of the matching color and design (not yet collected), she takes a similar Pixietail token and inserts it in one of the cut-out sections.  She then returns the disks face-down in the same location in the gameboard where she picked them before.  If a non-matching disk was selected, it is also returned to the same location face-down and play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;If a player's doll collects all three Pixietail tokens, that player then picks only Violet disks in her succeeding turns.  If the Castle is then selected from the Violet disks, that player wins the game.  If the &quot;Duchess RavenWaves&quot; was selected from one of the disks, that player must remove one Pixietail token from her doll.  She then again is demoted to select Pink tokens only until she again completes all her Pixietail tokens.&#10;&#10;",

In this book there is a description of several board games, and the intention of this shastra being that people will enhance their brain power by playing them.'&#10;&#10;He goes on to conclude the book thus:&#10;&#10;I have described the famous games of my time. I do not claim this to be exhaustive, there are several games of various types played in the world and it is physically impossible to compile all of them. I have done my best to compile the most important of my time. ... I, Harikrishna, son of Venkatram was born in Aurangabad in south Maharashtra. I have described in this book many wonderful games and the ways to play them.&#10;&#10;It was about the same time that Krishnaraja Wodeyar of Mysore developed and promoted many interesting games.&#10;&#10;The game we have here is a simple strategy game described by Harikrishna as a game in 24 squares. We have used the Sanskrit description he has given as the name of the game. Chathurvimshathi Koshtaka simply means 24 boxes or squares.&#10;&#10;Contents: game board, two sets of 8 coins each, rule sheet.&#10;&#10;",

Note that although an army could march further in the allotted time than the game may allow, most armies were not able to uniformly march about to their heart&rsquo;s content. Bogged down by the wounded and sick, the need to secure supplies, broken artillery carriages and a rest periods caused most armies to move only when they could, not when they wanted to. Each strength point of troops represents roughly 200-300 men.&#10;&#10;The Key: Every game system has a key element that is critical to successful play. It in the 16th supply was the main concern of a commander who had any hope of success. In &ldquo;Campaign!&rdquo; supply has been portrayed in Action points. The more action points, the more an army can do. Action points are tallied at the beginning of each turn, and the closer an army is to supply lines and friendly towns, the more it will achieve.

It helps kids recognize when someone may approaching them inappropriately, taking advantage of them, or other possible dangers they could encounter.&#10;&#10;There are question cards for each of the locations depicted on the board: homes, school, church, courthouse, clubhouse, fantasy castle, and haunted house. For example, at the haunted house, the questions are about scary things, at the church they focus on God and religious differences.&#10;&#10;",

I may release a semi-automated editor for excel if there is any interest in such.&#10;&#10;Can I set lineups, call plays, make substitutions, etc?&#10;      You set your lineups and make substitutions. There are a few provisions for calling special plays, such as bunting, hit-and-run, and playing the infield &quot;in&quot;. The game being a self-contained simulation, it needs little user input. Having played other basetball games which feature individual player cards, setting of lineups, keeping track of stamina, etc., I wanted something that would yield even more realistic results with less work on the user's part.&#10;&#10;",

Then the defense spins the arrow and gets a letter result. The result of these two spins determines what happens to the ball.&#10;&#10;As an aside here is a couple of words of advice from the head coach about football strategy from the times.&#10;&#10;Question: With 4th down and a foot in a scoreless tie shall I attempt to make the foot or punt the ball. ANSWER from COACH: You should have really punted on 3rd down. By all means PUNT, failure to make a 1st down would put your opponent in good position to score.&#10;&#10;Question: Is it safe to attempt a forward pass while still within ones own 40 yard line. ANSWER: Usually it isn't. There are times when this play is worked with success. One can only depend on ones own judgment.&#10;&#10;Question: With the score 9 to 7 against me with 3 minutes to go in the game and the ball on my opponents 28 yard line what play would you use?  ANSWER: A wide end run to get the ball in the center of the field on 1st down and then I would try a place kick on 2nd down&#10;&#10;",

Like its predecessors, Sport of Kings, Cockpit of Europe and Charlie's Year, it examines the War of the Austrian Succession at an operational level. Italy is the stage this time. Physically isolated from the titanic struggles in Germany and the Low Countries, Italy was anything but a backwater: successes and failures here had an important impact on the war as a whole. The war for Italy opened at the beginning of 1742. The Spanish Crown, after lengthy preparations, successfully invaded Italy by sea, bent on acquiring a duchy for the Queen's son, Don Felipe, and on reclaiming Spanish dominance in the region. Distracted by events elsewhere, the Habsburgs and their British allies were unable to prevent this move, but soon rebounded, drawing as a reluctant partner the pre-eminent local power, Piedmont-Sardinia, and its Frederician-like ruler, Charles Emmanuel of the House of Savoy.&#10;&#10;QG can accommodate up to four players, though it is easily played with two, and can even be played solitaire. The four sides are Bourbon France, Bourbon Spain, the Habsburg Empire, and Savoy (Piedmont-Sardinia). Also available are the forces of Genoa, Modena, Venice, Naples, and some pesky Royal Marines. Other territories, like the Papal States, wield influence rather than the sword.&#10;&#10;A game on the War of Austrian Succession in Italy. In the same serie as Sport of Kings, Cockpit of Europe and Charlie's Year (Lace Wars). Both DTP and mounted versions exist.&#10;&#10;Map scale is 8.5 miles per hex. Most units are brigades. Units are rated for Strength (in battalions),&#10;&#10;- 6 maps&#10;- Three books&#10;- Charts&#10;- 1200 counters in 10 counter sheets (incl. markers)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Naval Warfare, 1560-1603&#10;&#10;Now then, what's Sail!  like anyway?&#10;&#10;We were after something more than fast play, but much less than complexity. These rules were originally meant for each model to represent more than one ship, and you can still play it that way. However at one-to-one it works best. As is our way, we wanted players to feel like they were playing their favorite navies. The tactics of one fleet will not work for another.&#10;&#10;Which nations are represented?&#10;&#10;We have decided to start out with Spanish/Portuguese, English and Dutch navies. French and Hansards are provided for to a lesser extent. Other navies, particularly Danish and Swedish, will be the subjects of later supplements.&#10;&#10;How many ships can you play a side?&#10;&#10;You can have from one ship per side up to forty, and still have a good time. As you'll see below, the game is intriguingly uncomplicated without being &quot;fast play&quot;, meaning no engagement is too small, and the larger battles can still be played without overly bogging down. We suggest each player control no more than 15-20 ships each, so with several players per side (and a big enough board) you could re-fight the whole Armada campaign!&#10;&#10;Does it take long to play?&#10;&#10;We finished a game with 15 ships per side in less than 90 minutes. Yet we do not consider&#10;these rules &quot;fast play&quot; (in other words, sacrificing too much realism for speed)&#10;&#10;Do I have to write anything down?&#10;&#10;Now you know how the Captain feels about record keeping..... Pen and paper are not required.&#10;&#10;",

The show was about two brothers and a drifter trying to run a stage coach stop for the Greater Central Overland Mail Company.

Players interact in both Earth Life and in the Spirit World and are eventually judged and assigned to a degree of glory. The game was created by Kathryn Matthews over a period of 12 years.  Her son, Jonathan, suffered from kidney failure at a young age which prompted her to donate her own kidney to him.  Over the following ten years, Jonathan suffered deteriorating health and required constant tending until his death in 1999.  It was during this difficult time that Kathryn found comfort in learning the doctrines of the Plan of Salvation and spending time creating a learning activity that teaches about the joy it brings.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Stratagame is as much about skillful diplomacy as is it about chess-like strategic know-how. The player who in the end owns most of the continent&rsquo;s resources wins this game of epic adventure.&#10;&#10;Stratagame is a strategy game in which 2 to 6 players try to capture the continent&rsquo;s resources. It is played on a chessboard roughly representing Europe. There are no countries or clearly defined territories in Stratagame. It has no preset historical framework and no realistic pretensions, therefore it is not a wargame or a simulation game. Stratagame combines the mechanics of games like chess with modern strategy principles. Compared to other games in its category, Stratagame has been designed to be simple and easily understood. There are no overly complex or difficult rules and the manual has only 6 pages of rules. However, as in chess, the simplicity of the rules does not guarantee an easy mastery of the game. Stratagame is generally played in 2 to 4 hours, depending on the number of players and strategies involved.&#10;&#10;Stratagame contains 6 armies of different colours each composed of 52 playing pieces. As in chess, when a playing piece tries to enter a square already occupied by an enemy piece, a combat occurs. Each playing piece has a Strength of 1 to 5. A playing piece&rsquo;s Strength determines the number of dice it rolls during combat. The piece obtaining the highest result on the dice wins the combat. As per other chess-like games, Stratagame can also be played without dice.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An interesting 2-player Bridge game manufactured in polished wood by Chas Goodall &amp; Sons Ltd, Camden Works London at some time in the early 20th Century. The main component of the game is a pair of stepped wooden slabs with 13 slots cut into them at 45 degrees so 2 dummy hands can be stood up at that angle, the slabs can then be placed on the table so one player can see the cards, but opponent can't.  The actual rules for this 2-player version of Bridge are on the back of the wooden steps.&#10;&#10;Although the actual date of manufacture has not been established, the game carries a patent dated 1905.&#10;&#10;",

First, players must decide if they play a certain level of difficulty, certain gender, or if they want a random game with all the cards shuffled together. The board is set upright between the two teams on two plastic feet and then both teams reveal a card for themselves only. They must then use the magnetic frames to mark all the letters appearing in the name - red frames are used to denote letters that appear in the name more than once.&#10;&#10;The gameboard is then turned the other way around and now the actual game begins, with the two teams competing in who is the quickest to guess the other team's name. (It must be agreed in advance whether all names that fit the given letters are allowed, or only the particular one in the card.)&#10;&#10;The winning team gets the card as a point, and the first team to get 10 cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

If no-one else knew the answer or everybody else knew the answer the competitor would have got minus points for making a too hard or simple question. If only one of the others came up with the right answer both of these competitors would have got the maximum points and so on.&#10;&#10;In early nineties another show, Junnutonni (~Juniorthousand), was created to satisfy the needs of younger audience.

    "Description": "Wehrschach, also called Tak-Tik, was published by the nationalsocialist German magazine &quot;Die Wehrmacht&quot; in 1937/1938. It brought modern pieces to a Chess-like board: Infantry, Armor, Fighter and Bomber planes, Artillery, and a unique piece (the 'Hauptfigur'), styled like an eagle, which abstractly represented the government, industrial base, and morale of the state.&#10;&#10;On an Board with 11 x 11 squares you play a chess-like game with 18 pieces per player, for instance the &quot;Jagdflieger&quot; or the &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot;, all 3D and of Bakelite. These can move only vertical or horizontal, but a different number of squares, with the exception of the &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot;, which might also move like the knight in chess, but without jumping over other pieces.&#10;&#10;To capture an enemy piece you need to threaten it with two of your pieces instead of just one.&#10;&#10;The board is divided through diagonal lines (the main road and the river) and two more lines crossing the 3rd and 9th row indicating walls and two lake tiles which block all movement except for the planes.&#10;&#10;Gameplay was more or less like chess, but with some special rules for the different figures. There were several ways to win: capture of the Hauptfigur; destruction of all enemy Infantry; reduction of his fighting power; occupation of his homeland; etc. This, coupled with the two-to-one capture rules makes it more challenging (and rewarding!) than Chess.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As far as I know this is the only set of miniatures rules specifically dealing with air-to-air combat between helicopters, though air-to-ground and ground-to-air combat is also covered. The rules are intended for use with 1/300th scale miniatures and the other game scales are as follows:&#10;&#10;1 model = 1 aircraft, vehicle, infantry platoon&#10;1 turn = 10-15 seconds&#10;1&quot; = 100 yards&#10;&#10;Each turn the player picks the speed and altitude for each helicopter they control, which determines how far they will move, how much they may turn and their chance of crashing into the ground, if flying too fast and too low. Combat is resolved using the usual die rolls and tables, with the different makes of helicopter being able to take different amounts of damage before they are eliminated.&#10;&#10;The majority of the rule book is taken up with the helicopter data sheets and there are no less than 46 of them. Ground elements are detailed generically. There are also five sample scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

To attack, each player rolls three dice and chooses two. They place those two dice next to a token, and if the total equals the value of the token, a hit is scored. Rolls of 2 and 12 are always hits. Unfortunately, this clever Battleship-based dice game is not very easy to find. Your best bet is to look in drug stores and grocery stores.&#10;&#10;",

The object of this game is just the same. Players have to collect interest badges by successfully answering questions on the subjects chosen.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players try to collect five badges and be the first to collect the trefoil badge. Players roll a dice to move around the board. Upon landing on an interest badge space, they must choose one of the tiles from a face down selection. Most of the tiles represent Brownie badges in several categories, a few are hazardous events, and one shows the trefoil, crucial to winning the game. To collect a badge of the revealed category, the player must answer a trivia question relating to the category. Badges are available in the following categories:&#10;&#10;Animal Lover; Artist; Book Lover; Brownie Friendship; Cook; Collector; Conservation; Craft; Discoverer; First Aid; House Orderly; Music Lover; Pony Rider; Rambler; Safety in the Home.&#10;&#10;If the question is answered correctly, the badge tile is placed on the player's arm card (representing the badge being sewn onto the player's shirt sleeve). If it is answered incorrectly, the tile is turned face down again. When a player has collected five badges on her arm card, she must try to find the Trefoil badge from the face down selection in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Players can steal badges from Brownies who trespass on another player's campsite. Bonus badges can be won by landing on toadstool spaces and answering a general knowledge question. The game can end prematurely if too many Brown Owl spaces are landed on.&#10;&#10;",
