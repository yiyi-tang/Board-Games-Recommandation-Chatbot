    "Description": "Sci-Die is a nanogame consisting of one business. In addition, each player needs three dice in their personal color. &#10;At the beginning of the game, each player rolls their dice and places one die onto the card as their Sci-Die. The other two dice are called Dice Bots and are placed adjacent to the card. On their turn, a player can either move a Dice Bot along one of the paths on the card, or turn it over an edge to reach an adjacent position. A point is achieved when both Dice Bots show the same number as the Sci Die of that player. First player to five points is the winner. &#10;Two variants with more interaction are provided.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blitzkrieg Deluxe is a &quot;generic&quot; World War 2 era wargame that pits two fictional nations against each other over a fictional land mass represented by a huge 34 by 55 inch map. The game is easy to learn with the rules clocking in at under sixeteen pages, but difficult to master as the options available to each player are numerous. Do you mass your assault at the enemy's borders, or do you employ naval forces to invade through a tenuous beachhead? How best to utilize your air forces to disrupt your enemy's economy and halt their advance into your territory?&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;In addition to the huge map that is presented in easy-to-print tiles at both letter- and tabloid-sizes, the game includes over 500 markers on four sheets, four setup cards, and a double-sided player's aid card containing all of the game charts for quick reference.&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;This game is a redesign of the original Blitzkrieg game published by The Avalon Hill Game Company in 1968. The project started initially as an effort to create a new, updated, and far more pleasing map on which to play the original game. This effort snowballed into creating an updated set of game pieces, including the addition of markers needed to indicate control and industrial conditions never included in the original publication. Of course, this also required the creation of new game charts to match. It wasn't too long before the rules were tackled as well.&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;While working through the rules and copious errata for the original game, it seemed appropriate to rewrite the rules as well. Given enhancements in game play since 1968, these rules have been completely overhauled and enhanced with new mechanics and combat result charts to inject more excitement than the original design. The &quot;basic game&quot; has been stripped out and the rules reorganized to follow the sequence of play. The concepts of &quot;initiative&quot; (allowing for the possibility of double-turns by a player) and &quot;straining&quot; (allowing an attacker to push harder to gain better results, but at a risk of losses) have been introduced. The game also includes a random game-end mechanic, allowing a side more or less time to complete its conquest. Additionally, the original combat results (attrition) chart has been completely redesigned to allow for more realistic outcomes.&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;In a nutshell, Blitzkrieg Deluxe is not your daddy's (or granddaddy's) Blitzkrieg! As a player you have the option to play the game with the original rules as written using the updated map and markers, or you can &quot;upgrade&quot; to the new rules.&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;Blitz on!&#10;&#10;",

MAGNA ACIES! is therefore designed to remain simple and to immediately put you players in a position to really lead an army of the Antiquity, making you relive the situations that in those days could make the difference between victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;You impersonate the commander of the army, who gives orders to the various corps from which the army is constituted: at the beginning of the battle, assign orders to your large units deployed in the field, depending on whether your plan provides that each of them must attack the enemy, or maneuver to reach a more favorable position, or even stand still waiting for the opposing charge or the development of events. Units that receive orders must act accordingly, until they clash with the enemy or until you deem it necessary to change the order for any reason.&#10;&#10;In short, you are reproposed for the problems that the leader had to face on the ground and only those; this perspective (which can be defined as &quot;great - tactical&quot;) involves simplifying (or automatically managing) certain aspects of detail that are not considered here as they are supposedly left to the initiative of subordinate officers, but allows you to play great battles in limited spaces and in a short time.&#10;&#10;MAGNA ACIES! can simulate the battles of Antiquity until the advent of firearms; it was designed with classic age clashes in particular in thought, but works well as long as squares of men and horses predominantly confronted with close combat weapons.&#10;&#10;I thought &quot;MAGNA ACIES!&quot; to be practical, fast and playable: in 15mm you can play even on tables less than one meter, the rules are round 25 pages including examples, illustrations and various chatter, the game tables and the &quot;army lists&quot; are included in a single A4 sheet, a 150 point game - army on each side can last an average of a couple of hours , once you learned the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Some 619,636 Canadians enlisted with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the war, and approximately 424,000 served overseas. Of these men and women, 59,544 members of the CEF died during the war, 51,748 of them as a result of enemy action. The CEF served with distinction at Neuve-Chappelle, and at 2nd Ypres in 1915 they made a legendary stand to hold the line during the first gas attack on the Western Front. Posted to the Somme in September 1916, the CEF fought the sanguinary battles for Mouquet Farm and Courcelette, taking the 2nd German line that was an objective of the failed 1 July attack. Posted back to Arras in 1917 the CEF finally cracked the defenses of Vimy Ridge in a brilliant attack, which had defied both the French and British for the past 2 years. Posted back to the Ypres area in the fall of 1917, the CEF was tasked with taking Passchendaele in October and November, in appalling weather.   This was the final push to that town that had been an objective since August. In abysmal weather the CEF finally captured it in November 1917.  In 1918 the CEF was in the forefront of the great offensive that ground down the German army in the west, in fact, the 2nd Canadian division advanced past Mons on 11 November 1918 to finish the war where it had begun for the BEF 4 long years ago.&#10;&#10;All of these battles were hard fought affairs, where no quarter was asked or given. Now, with this latest GWASL module you get to see if you can match the exploits of this fearsome fighting force on some of the most pitiless battlefields of World War I.&#10;&#10;Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Cheers For The Living - Bellewaerde Ridge, Belgium, May 8th 1915&#10;     High And Dry - Ypres, Belgium    WW1, June 2nd 1916&#10;     Kitchener's Wood - Langemark, Belgium    WW1, April 22nd 1915&#10;     A Cane And A Lionheart - St. Julien, Belgium, April 23rd 1915&#10;     Gravenstafel - Gravenstafel, Belgium    WW1, April 25th 1915&#10;     Courcelette - Courcelette, France, September 15th 1916&#10;     Sanctuary Wood - Hooge, Belgium, June 2nd 1916&#10;     The Pimple - Vimy Ridge, France, April 10th 1917&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     4 Geo Boards&#10;     8 scenarios in color format&#10;     368 die-cut counters - The Canadians&#10;     Color 3-hole rules sheet&#10;     Color cardstock folder style wrap.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The person who calculates the quickest and has the card with the correct solution puts the corresponding solution card on top of the equation card. The player obtains this pair of cards and places it in front of themselves.

Each player has eight pieces in their color.&#10;&#10;One unusual feature of the game is that the players must pretend that the board is vertical; a piece can only be placed if it is supported on both &quot;lower&quot; sides by other pieces or the board edges.&#10;&#10;The other unusual feature is that players may play pieces of either color. However, at the end of the game players only score for their own pieces.&#10;&#10;Scoring is for sets of three pieces at the points of an equilateral triangle. These can be made in three sizes which are worth from one to three points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "VIERSTRAAT RIDGE, BELGIUM, 2 SEPTEMBER 1918: The Hindenburg Line was originally organized for defense toward the end of the year 1916, and work was continuous in its preparation for a long time thereafter. &#10;The Siegfried Line makes full use, along extended stretches, of the front line of defense accorded by the Bellicourt-St. Quentin Canal. &#10;The strength of these defenses, increased as it is by inundated areas, provided extensive mutual flanking fire support. Good artillery observation rendered the line very strong. The Siegfried Line is considered to create the most favorable conditions for a stubborn defense by a minimum garrison. It is therefore adapated to the requirements of obstinate close combat.&#10;&#10;Ownership of GWASL 1 and GWASL 3 are required, as is your ASL-RB. &#10;All the other combat counters needed to play are provided in the form of 648 color die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;Vierstraat, Belgium&#10;&#10;     Captains and Majors, August 31st 1918&#10;     The Vierstraat Switch, August 31st 1918&#10;     Blind Courage, August 31st 1918&#10;     Redoubt Farm, September 1st 1918&#10;     Riposte In Lead, September 1st 1918&#10;     Back To Chinese Trench, September 1st 1918&#10;     Handiwork Of The Devil, September 1st 1918&#10;     Vierstraat Ridge, September 1st 1918&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The cards are first dealt evenly to all of the players. On their turn, a player rolls a dice and tries to match the dice with the cards he/she has that are of the same denomination, which is then placed in the discard pile. If he is able to discard, he throws again until he can no longer discard any cards, at which point the dice (and play) passes to the next player. Numbers are divided into blocked and free numbers. Free numbers can be used by other players to discard their cards if the player whose turn it was could not discard his/her cards. Blocked numbers can only be used by the player throwing the dice. Jokers serve as wild cards.&#10;&#10;",

Beware of sand pits, water ponds, and many other natural obstacles if you want to avoid any penalties!&#10;&#10;On your turn, play a card from your hand or push your luck with the first card of the deck. Then, add any card with the same value to boost your stroke even further. Caddies will let you add another card to the mix, and wedges will help you get out of the sand. The higher the value of your stroke, the further your ball will go! With trees to bounce off your ball, hills to change where it lands, and other golfers messing around the course, each game creates its own story.&#10;&#10;Choose the game length by playing 6, 9 or 18 holes and test your skills to elect the new champion!&#10;&#10;Play with 4 others concurrents, in teams, or simply try to beat your own score in solitaire.

    "Description": "Mountain is played with two decks of standard playing cards plus optional jokers.&#10;&#10;In the solitaire game the decks are shuffled together and 12 cards are dealt in a row to form the base of the mountain. The player takes one card from the deck at a time and places it in the discard pile; the top card of the discard stack is available to play on the mountain.&#10;&#10;A card on one level is placed above two cards on the next lower level. If the cards are different ranks and suits the new card must match the rank of one and the suit of the other; otherwise it must match what they have in common. (If the cards are identical any card can be played on them.)&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out and all plays have been made, cards score based on what level they are on.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game one player has a deck of red cards and the other black. The base is made up of alternating red and black cards and players draw cards into their hands, from which they may play any number of cards. The winner is the player with the most cards on the top level, but if a player can complete an entire level by themselves they win immediately.&#10;&#10;",
