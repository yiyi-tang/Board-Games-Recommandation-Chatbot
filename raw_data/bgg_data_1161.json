    "Description": "5 Different Boomtown Baseball Games&#10;&#10;Free! Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!&#10;&#10;disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:  The Boomtown &quot;Bats&quot; are hosting their archrivals, The Mudville &quot;Muggers&quot;, in another classic confrontation at famous Boomtown Stadium!  It's the top of the ninth,  Neither team has scored.  Who will win this critical game?&#10;&#10;PREPARATION:  Choose your team.  The teams bat with a lineup of four batters picked at random from their full team of nine.  A batter's lifetime &quot;stats&quot; are shown below his name.  The batting order starts at the top (near the pitch indicators) and is repeated if necessary by returning to #1 as the fifth batter.  Keep track of all base runner with pennies placed on the baseball diamond.  The &quot;Muggers&quot; bat first.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:  The pitcher throws each ball by placing his finger tip on the pitch of his choice and announcing either &quot;fast ball&quot;, &quot;curve ball&quot;, or &quot;slider&quot;.  The other player then scratches any one of his four &quot;swing&quot; boxes&quot; under the pitch for the player he has at bat (if all a batter's swing boxes are scratched for one type of pitch, the pitcher must throw something else). It will reveal one of the following results:&#10;&#10;HR (Home Run)  - It's a hit out of the park.  The batter and all runners score.&#10;&#10;X (Strike) - Get 3 strikes and the batter is out.&#10;&#10;W (Walk) - The batter advances to first base.&#10;&#10;G (Grounder) - It's a hit.  The pitching team must play the ball.  The pitcher scratches any one of his ten &quot;Infield&quot; squares to see the results of the play.&#10;&#10;FB (Fly Ball) - It's a  hit.  The pitching team must play the ball.  The pitcher scratches any one his ten &quot;Outfield&quot; squares to see the results of the play.&#10;&#10;When and Grounder or Fly Ball is played by the pitcher the following things can result:&#10;S (Single) - The batter and all runners advance one base.&#10;D (Double) - The batter and all runners advance two bases.&#10;T (Triple) - The batter and all runners advance three bases.&#10;HR (Home Run) - The batter and all runners score.&#10;O (Out) - The batter is out.&#10;DP (Double Play) - The batter and the furthest advanced runner (if there is one) are out.  Scratch two out squares on the scoreboard.&#10;&#10;Keep track of &quot;Runs&quot; and &quot;Outs&quot; by scratching the squares left to right on the score board.  After the &quot;Muggers&quot; have made three outs, the roles reverse and the &quot;Bats&quot; come up to the plate.  After the &quot;Bats&quot; have three outs, the game is over.  The team with the highest score wins.  In the event of a tie, play another card for &quot;extra innings&quot;.&#10;&#10;SPECIAL HINT:  You will notice, after playing a few games, that each of the nine batters on each team always bats exactly the same way every time.  For example, Homer Bundy, the slugger Right Fielder for the &quot;Muggers&quot;, always hits a home run if you pitch him a fast ball.  The more you know about each batter, the better you can pick the right pitch or choose the right swing.  Fast ball pitches tent to either be hit hard or get a strike.  Sliders tend to produce grounders, and curve balls tend to produce a lot of fly balls and walks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The maze walls (red lines) are impossible to pass and as they are rotating you can get trapped. Can you beat your opponents, who try to block you, and be the winner?&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player gets pawns of the same color according to the number of players:&#10;4 players: 4 pawns each &#10;3 players: 5 pawns each &#10;2 players: 6 pawns each &#10;The player who plays first is picked randomly. The order of other players is defined in a clockwise manner. &#10;Initially, the pawns of each player are placed at the first (Entrance - outer) zone of the maze.&#10;&#10;Each turn is comprised of two steps:&#10;Step 1: The first player moves his/her pawns and then rotates the walls clockwise (by 15o)  &#10;Step 2: The rest of the players do the same.&#10;&#10;The pawns can move only in one direction, either Radially or Peripherally, for as many fields as you wish until they are blocked by the walls of the maze or by an opponent&rsquo;s pawn. The walls (red lines) of the Maze are the natural boundaries of the Maze and you cannot overpass them with your pawns. You cannot overpass your opponent(s)&rsquo; pawns either.&#10;&#10;Anytime that a pawn is blocked in every direction either by the maze walls and/or by opponent(s) pawn(s), you have to immediately remove that pawn from the current turn of game and pick it out of the board. Next time you play, place that pawn in a field of your choice back into the Entrance Zone and do not move it any further. You can move your pawn normally when your turn to play comes again.&#10;&#10;The player who manages to reach the Escape Zone with all of his pawns first wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Generic units are also provided for the 1300 - 1550 period.&#10;&#10;A Generic ship list is given for each period (such as &quot;Third Rate&quot;, &quot;Fourth Rate&quot; etc.), as well as individual named ships (over 1,700 in total!), showing each ship's weaponry, size, maneuverability and suchlike.

At the start of the turn all ships make a mandatory forward move based on their direction relative to the wind (SPILL SAIL! WE'RE ABOUT TO COLLIDE), after which individual ships activate, making turns, and attacks (providing their crew is on the ball enough...). Crew quality determines if a ship is able to activate and also the speed at which they reload.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Co-op is part simulation, part send-up, of the unique experience that is living in a housing cooperative (&quot;co-op&quot; for short). For the unacquainted, living in a co-op is similar to sharing a house with roommates, but with a lot more structure... Members of a co-op typically share responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning, while house rules are established during meetings through direct democracy. Resources, such as food (esp. granola) and utilities, are usually purchased by and shared amongst the members. CO-OP was developed by two seasoned (with sriracha) members of a real housing cooperative, as an attempt to game-ify the fun and complexity of collective living.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player represents a housemate in the same co-op. Players must take 1 &quot;action&quot; on each of their turns, the most basic of which are Cleaning and Slacking Off. When a player Slacks Off, they convert some of the house's Cleanliness into their own Free Time (duh!)---this Free Time can be spent to gain points that help win the game. When a player Cleans, they gain access to Karma (by their good deeds), or may influence the very mechanics of the game by trying to pass a House Rule. Karma and Rules are represented by their own decks of cards: the Karma Cards confer secret advantages that may be played at a later opportune moment, while Rules are drafted from a row of 5 cards that are publicly displayed to all players.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that CO-OP is NOT a &quot;cooperative game&quot; (there are individual winners), and there can be a lot to keep track of if you want to best the other players (grrr). However, the play experience is usually quite casual---this is largely due to the Karma Cards, which each have their own co-op-y theme, and require the player to perform a mini-activity in order to gain the card's benefits. Some activities simply encourage players to share their life experience, while others might ask them to sing a song or tell a joke... something different every time!  CO-OP is a blast with friends and family, and also a great way to break the ice with perfect strangers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Departure on the Nile puts 2 to 4 players in the 1830s to 1880s in Egypt. During this period, Egypt under its rulers and the increased influence of Europeans experienced a tremendous upswing. The first railway lines were built, cotton was grown and exported, the Suez Canal was opened, as well as schools and hospitals built on the European model. Not least, the country also opened up for the emerging mass tourism, which brought a large number of people in the land of the pharaohs and pyramids. The players in Departure on the Nile embody young investors from Europe who want to contribute to the expansion of the country and invest in the Egyptian economy, solely with the aim of achieving the greatest fortune. Departure on the Nile is a classic worker placement game in which each player starts the game with only three of their own colonial officials. The construction of buildings, however, bring specialists into the country, who can recruit players using a novel mechanism (felucca travel and rail travel) and from now on can use. The game comes with a high level of interaction so it does not have the character of a multiplayer solitaire game. All players are involved at all times, whether through the use of the buildings (owners receive a bonus), by rail travel or the use of the Suez Canal where players can receive money and influence through their share certificates. Since the game is all about earning the most money at the end of the game, every investment in the game should be well considered. The game material is relatively extensive, the random game structure (bonus tiles, majority tiles, building tiles, personalities) guarantees a long game stimulus that prevents deadlocked strategies.&#10;&#10;",

During all his life, Axl has worked in one of the many orbital factories connected in the Human Edge System. Not long ago, his employers organized an illegal Aristeia! competition and Axl shined so much that they automatically decided to make him an AGL star.&#10;&#10;Hippolyta&rsquo;s character was created in close collaboration with Manu aka Kelthret, the first season AGL champion. He earned the right to participate in the design of an Aristeia! character. Manu shared with us his passion for the Infinity Myrmidons and suggested a Myrmidon Officer as a starting point. The result is a spectacular leader support, both in design and game profile.&#10;&#10;In addition to including the two pre-assembled plastic miniatures with the highest quality Corvus Belli seal, this Aristeia! expansion incorporates the 2 character cards, the 2 initiative cards, 8 tactical cards and the necessary markers to play this expansion.

    "Description": "The world is an irradiated wasteland, inhospitable to life. Hordes of bloodthirsty mutants roam this desolate hellscape in search of human flesh, but pockets of non-mutant survivors have managed to wait out the horror. They have gathered ranks, formed factions, and have emerged ready to rebuild utopia.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;In Mutopia, each player represents a team of human survivors. Survivors are categorized by virtue&mdash;guts, brain, brawn, heart, and soul. Players must advance Survivors and build structures in order to ascend from their shabby Communes and achieve Utopia. However, the more structures they build, the better their chances of encountering the Skull of Ruin. Each time a Ruin is rolled, a Ruin card must be drawn and a skull token placed on the player&rsquo;s survivor board. If a player&rsquo;s board fills up before they reach 15 ascendency points, the player flips over their board and becomes&hellip;.A MUTANT.&#10;&#10;Objective&#10;It takes guts, brains, brawn, heart, and soul to ascend in Mutopia. These are Virtues and the currency with which players advance Survivors and purchase Items and Structures. Structures and some Items are worth Ascendency Points. The first player to achieve 15 Ascendancy Points before filling all 10 spaces on their Survivor Board wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This set introduces the Harmony Rare card rarity for the first time. Secret Rares get a brand new foil treatment and are now textured, their 3D raised foiling follows the lines of the card artwork; this unique foil technology means it is embedded in the card itself rather than stamped on top of it. Secret Rares also have an improved pack-out ratio of 1 in every 4 boxes on average, or 3 per case, while Harmony Rares are found 1 per case as a case topper.&#10;&#10;Lots of new things are introduced from a gameplay standpoint with this expansion, including new mechanics, Abilities and rarity effects. The set is optimized for both Constructed and Booster Draft formats with effects now being in every rarity tier all the way down to Common (you can draft Common symmetries unlike with Galaxy Tides).&#10;&#10;Following the conclusion of the Crystal Forge storyline from the Exodus TCG Official Magazine Issue #2, turmoil is abundant on Eeventide when it is disturbed to the point where its portals are thrown off course and start colliding into each other. These collisions create massive rips and tears in the fabric of space and time, opening up a new form of dimensional travel. However, these dimensional rifts signify permanent damage to Eeventide's atmosphere. Sentient smoke-like creatures called Chronos spill into the world soon after. The Chronos' are seen ripping apart portals, further destroying the shortcuts available to Drifters. But the biggest secret of all lies within the planet itself. It's well known by this point that Eeventide has a will of its own, but what exactly will happen when the very landscapes are called to rise up to defend themselves...?&#10;&#10;Set Breakdown:&#10;&#10;This set consists of 91 cards, including:&#10;        3 Harmony Rares&#10;        8 Secret Rares&#10;        31 Rares&#10;        22 Uncommons&#10;        27 Commons&#10;&#10;Of the 8 Secret Rares, one of them (Grandaria, Forger of Songs) can only be found as a fixed box topper in sealed booster boxes and not in packs themselves.&#10;        The other 7 Secret Rares have a packaging ratio of 1 in every 4 boxes, or 3 per case.&#10;&#10;Box Toppers&#10;&#10;Box Toppers are extra/bonus cards included as incentive when opening an entire booster box or display.&#10;        Box Toppers are always Foil.&#10;        1 of the 2 Box Toppers in every box is &quot;fixed&quot;, meaning it is the same card in every box.&#10;        The 2nd Box Topper is a random Foil from the booster set (Uncommon or higher).&#10;&#10;Sneak Peek Creature Types&#10;&#10;Continuing a trend from the first booster set, there is a hidden pattern in each booster set that identify which new creature types the storyline will focus on in the near future. The pattern is 1 of that creature type in each main Rarity tier (Common, Uncommon &amp; Rare) within the set (excluding dual-types). For Converging Chasms, the new preview types are Chrono &amp; Machine.&#10;&#10;Creature Types&#10;&#10;This set introduces the following creature types:&#10;&#10;- Chrono&#10;  - Stag&#10;  - Owl&#10;  - Octopus&#10;  - Bull&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Dimension That Disappeared is the 3rd booster pack and the 5th overall set in the Exodus TCG.&#10;&#10;Details&#10;&#10;This set introduced the Afterthought mechanic as a new secondary Ability featured exclusively on Chrono creatures. Rares started getting their Ability &amp; Ability Name hot stamped to further enhance their foil treatment. Secret Rares continued with their 3D raised foil treatment and their pull ratio of 1 in every 4 booster boxes, or 3 per case. No new Harmony Rares were introduced as they were deemed exclusive to Set 4 Converging Chasms. The set instead brought massive support for a few Guilds, specifically focusing on Chronos, Treefolk and Shardfolk--even going so far as to mix the latter two's mechanics. This expansion set also assigns the new Box Topper Rare title to the box topper card, replacing its old Secret Rare title; this change was made due to the single SR that always comes as a box topper having a Rare foil treatment rather than the usual treatment for the SR rarity tier. Box Topper Rares have a 'fixed' pull ratio, meaning they always appear at the same rate, 1 per box and cannot be found in packs themselves.&#10;&#10;The booster display packaging was overhauled to a shorter 2-column box, doing away with the Styrofoam filler that was found in older booster boxes.&#10;&#10;'Scaling' effects are introduced in this expansion; effects &amp; Abilities that become more powerful depending on if the player pays additional cost(s) or is playing with a teammate in Multiplayer format. The set is optimized for both Constructed and Booster Draft formats.&#10;&#10;The planet's landscapes shaped themselves into 3 different, massive creatures in an effort to annihilate the legion of Chronos invading from a lost dimension. Eeventide's will manifested in the form of the 3 Harmony Rares during the war, causing temporary alliances between Guilds. But as portals continued to collide and Chronos infected Drifters and creatures alike, Treeforge Guild Leader Oliver Rose fought against the smoky onslaught. He used his Psylerran powers to seal off the dimensional rift between Eeventide and The Dimension That Disappeared...only to discover that another Guild Leader also took it upon herself to dive into the forsaken dimension at the last moment. Crystallus, the Shardveil Guild's tyrannical leader, was exposed as a puppet to the real Shardveil Guild Leader, Lucia Lievdrahs. Together, she and Oliver Rose must navigate the severed dimension to vanquish the source of Chronos' destruction and find a way back to Eeventide before they are trapped for all of eternity.&#10;&#10;Set Breakdown:&#10;&#10;This set consists of 77 cards, including:&#10;        1 Box Topper Rare&#10;        8 Secret Rares&#10;        27 Rares&#10;        18 Uncommons&#10;        23 Commons&#10;&#10;The 8 Secret Rares have a packaging ratio of 1 in every 4 booster boxes, or 3 per booster case.&#10;        The Box Topper Rare (End of the Rift) can only be found as a fixed box topper in sealed booster boxes and not in packs themselves.&#10;&#10;Box Toppers&#10;&#10;Box Toppers are extra/bonus cards included as incentive when opening an entire booster box or display.&#10;        Box Toppers are always Foil.&#10;        1 of the 2 Box Toppers in every box is &quot;fixed&quot;, meaning it is the same card in every box.&#10;        The 2nd Box Topper is a random Foil from the booster set (Uncommon or higher).&#10;        A new rule card explaining the Afterthought mechanic is included as a 3rd card with Box Toppers in this set.&#10;        The Box Topper Rare rarity tier is the equivalent rarity to a regular Rare, placing it below Secret Rare and Harmony Rare on the rarity mechanic latter.&#10;&#10;Sneak Peek Creature Types &amp; Product Pattern&#10;&#10;The trend of previewing upcoming factions has continued since the first booster set. However, that pattern has been shaken up with this set; Set 4 hinted at Chronos and Machines being the next fully supported creature types. While this set does contain full support for Chronos, Machines' new mechanic has not yet been spoiled and will see support in Set 6. The sneak preview creature types in this set that will gain full support in a future set are Machines &amp; Leviathans. Additionally, the alternating product pattern of decks &amp; boosters was switched up with two back to back booster releases.&#10;&#10;Creature Types&#10;&#10;This set introduces the following creature types:&#10;&#10;- Crow&#10;  - Peacock&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Buck&rsquo;s first real wargaming love was the Napoleonic Wars. This is his third set of published Napoleonic rules.  Battles for Empire was designed for those Empire-sized games. Wellington Rules was designed for much smaller games, in which players commanded brigade.  Fate of Battle is designed for larger games in which which players command one or more divisions. Like all the Look, Sarge family of rules, this game moves!&#10;&#10;Fate of Battle is the most complex of the Look, Sarge family.  We&rsquo;ve worked hard to remain true to the fell of the series, but we&rsquo;ve incorporated formations, skirmishing, and other period feel. You&rsquo;ll get the paper, scissors, rock of infantry, cavalry, and artillery in columns, lines, and squares.&#10;&#10;Many gamers are turned off by the Napoleonic Wars.  Years of pedantic, plodding, overly complex rules and the angry rules lawyers those systems seem to attract have convinced many gamers we know that the Napoleonic Wars cannot be fun to game. Members of our gaming club who have sworn off the period enjoy these rules and play them regularly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you roll a 1 or 6 you may bring a new frog into play from your PUDDLE to your STEPPING STONE (the first space on your journey around the board). But be careful as enemy frogs can TAG each other by landing on their space. The TAGGED frog is sent back to their start PUDDLE. You can also leap over enemy frogs. You cannot tag your own frogs or leap over them, so you have to manage your frogs carefully so that they don&rsquo;t get bunched up. Moves must always be exactly the number of spaces indicated by the roll of the die. A roll of 1 or 6 always gives you another turn no matter how many times it occurs. If you have only one possible move, you must take it. If you have no legal moves, you pass your turn.&#10;&#10;Once a player Fills up their BIG POOL by moving all of their frogs into it, they win!&#10;&#10;The game can also be played in teams of 2 vs 2. When one player&rsquo;s frogs are all safe they may move their teammates. TEAMMATES FROGS MAY TAG EACH OTHER! So take care that it is not the only option.&#10;&#10;",

They secretly write down a secret message to the player who has with the large mobile phone in the corresponding color. The message should consist of exactly 10 words.&#10;&#10;The 40 keys are turned to the black side, shuffled and randomly distributed to the 40 fields of the game board. Starting with their pawn at the positions marked with an arrow, the players play alternately in clockwise order. At first, they roll a dice and move their pawn according to the rolled number in any direction (horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal). The direction can be changed once during the turn. If the pawn ends his turn on a key, it is turned over. If it shows the player&rsquo;s color, they place it on the corresponding key of their large cardboard mobile phone and the player who wrote the message to that player tells the nth word corresponding to the number on the key. If the front of the key has a different color, the player puts the key next to their own mobile phone and no word is revealed. If the player rolled a 6, they get an additional turn.&#10;&#10;To receive the missing keys which are collected by the other players, they have to capture the pawns of this player. When a pawn is captured, is returns to the start position and the capturing player steals a key of their choice from that player.&#10;&#10;When player believes to know their sentence they yell &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;. After the turn of the current player, they have to guess the sentence and if it is correct, win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The questions are about the French region of Poitou Charentes.&#10;&#10;There are 3000 questions in 6 different themes; History, Geography, Science and Nature, Art and Literature, Entertainment and Sports and Leisure.&#10;Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

It is a simple, tactical and very dynamic game. It will immerse you in a rugby match as if you were there. An essential card game, designed for those oval ball passionate fans as well as for beginners that you should own by the end of the year.&#10;The game offers 3 different play modes for 1 to 4 players, with short rounds.&#10;&#10;The game is divided by rounds called &quot;challenges &quot;. These challenges represent the phases of a classic rugby match. Each player therefore tries to win these challenges to be able to score tries, by playing the action cards based either on the power (Physical game), on the dexterity (Hand game), or on the technicality (foot game). But beware, the strongest cards are also the most risky and in case of a risky play the referee can intervene at any time and whistle to mark penalties! And that way, we chain actions and challenges. The player with the most points after 2 halves is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;The game takes the form of a series of challenges:&#10;&#10;     Physical and powerful challenge: simulates actions like rucks, scrums, etc.&#10;     Hand Challenge: simulates skilful actions such as passes, interceptions, etc.&#10;     Foot challenge: simulates tactical actions such as kicks, penalties, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;Despite the small size of our game, the dozens of card and tactical game combinations in 3 game modes (Solo, Duel or Conquest for 4 players) offer very good replay ability. In addition, because the game is played very fast, it is particularly suitable to play small tournaments or championships in less than one hour.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These are resolved by matching the symbols on the event cards with the symbols on the dice. As you roll misses and are forced to set dice aside, you&rsquo;ll have to decide if you risk pushing on to profit from greater gains or not. If you roll too many misses, your delivery attempt will be cut short and your reputation will suffer. Events get harder as you press along the GUTR; the better your ship and crew the better your odds. The game ends when one of the players reaches the renown threshold. After which, players will have a chance to complete their turns, and the player with the highest amount of renown will be declared the victor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In Secret Cthulhu players are attempting to stop Cthulhu devouring the planet by enacting enough Rites of Salvation to protect the planet and all that currently live on it. Watch out though, there are secret Cultists among you, and one player is possessed by Cthulhu himself. These Cultists will be doing everything in their power to pave the way for Cthulhu, and the destruction and chaos he brings with him.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game each player is assigned one of three roles: Cultist, Investigator, or Cthulhu. The Investigators have a majority, but they don&rsquo;t know for sure who anyone is; Cultists must resort to what they know best to accomplish their goals: secrecy and sabotage. Cthulhu plays for the Cultists, and the Cultists know Cthulhu&rsquo;s identity, but Cthulhu isn&rsquo;t always aware of who his fellow Cultists are and must work to figure them out.&#10;&#10;If that's not enough, you need to be ready for whatever the Chaos Deck throws your way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Who would have thought that we would have to face each other in battle like this...&quot;&#10;&#10;Two strategists, who had once been fellow disciples and studied under the same master, find themselves devoted to carry out the most refined battle of wits, bearing the burden of protecting their home country.&#10;&#10;A strategist, however, will never enter the battlefield themselves. &#10;They send out instructions to the Shogun in action based on the information provided by the messengers rushing back and forth from the battlefield.&#10;Figure out the other player&rsquo;s intention with the help of the time lag in-between to aim for victory.&#10;&#10;The game begins with 3 kinds of game pieces, Infantry, Archer and Cavalry taking position. &#10;How do you establish an advantageous battle formation as you go into battle?&#10;&#10;The key to victory is to understand how to properly utilize the special command, the Chain Message, which allows game pieces of the same kind, positioned next to each other in a vertical or horizontal direction, to advance in the same way and in the same turn.&#10;Be conscious of coordinating your military forces and never dividing your formation.&#10;&#10;WHAT KIND OF GAME IS IT?&#10;&#10;Strategist Strategy is a strategy game for 2 players. The goal is to take down the Shogun of the other player by moving your own pieces, similar to Chess or Shogi.&#10;However, it has the following distinctive features.&#10;&#10;&#10;     You are free to place the soldier pieces anywhere you want at the beginning of the game. The players take turns, placing 1 piece per turn. The placement of the pieces shall be determined with ever-evolving strategies while watching the moves and battle formation of the other player.  &#10;     There are only 3 different kinds of soldier pieces.&#10;     You are not able to move the pieces immediately during your turn. You may only move them according to the commands issued by &ldquo;cards&rdquo; in the previous turn. It is not guaranteed that the game pieces will move as expected. &#10;     When pieces of the same kind are aligned next to each other, either in a vertical and horizontal direction, you may move them together in the same turn, up to more than 2 pieces at once. &#10;&#10;&#10;For example, 3 Infantry pieces in a row may move forward at the same time or multiple Archer pieces may shoot arrows at the same time. In order to win, it is key to establish a good set-up/formation for yourself and break up the set-up/formation of the other player. &#10;&#10;     After the initial placement,  the players decide in secret which game piece will become the Shogun piece, which is the defining piece for winning or losing the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;It is crucial to predict the Shogun of your opponent during the game play. &#10; In order to get a taste of being a real military strategist, we created this game for 2 players and added game elements that will hopefully remove unrealistic game elements that we had experienced in other strategy simulation games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Now you have components and a real monster to destroy the buildings.&#10;&#10;&#10;The art is based on the modern edition (Manddo Games), but the cards can be played and are compatible with all the editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Promo expansions celebrating Karen &amp; Amdreas Seyfarth as special guests at the XIV Festival Internacional de Juegos C&oacute;rdoba 2019.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                                &#10;                                                                                            &#10;                                                                                        &#10;                                                                                    &#10;                                                                                &#10;                                                                            &#10;                                                                        &#10;                                                                    &#10;                                                                &#10;                                                            &#10;                                                        &#10;                                                    &#10;                                                &#10;                                            &#10;                                        &#10;                                    &#10;                                &#10;                            &#10;                        &#10;                    &#10;                &#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Ahora los bloques de 1 planta van a ser m&aacute;s atractivos, porque te dar&aacute;n acceso a nuevas acciones en las manzanas de Manhattan.

    "Description": "Road To Riches is an updated and enhanced version of the award-winning Bulls &amp; Bears board game. It has been developed in collaboration between Mario Fischel, Ph.D., a former senior economist at the World Bank, and Krishan Puvvada, Project Lead, Education at Financial Times. Road To Riches has been successfully tested with students in the UK.&#10;&#10;Road To Riches is not only a fun and challenging game &ndash; it&rsquo;s a full-fledged &lsquo;Managing Money 101&rsquo; course!  Our program also includes quick and easy-to-digest instructional videos, a guidebook on personal finance, and lesson plans for classroom use.  Together, they form a crash course in personal finance that turns newcomers into masters, helping them win the game and at life!&#10;&#10;Players start out with $100,000 cash, roll the dice, and proceed around the board. Spaces on the board correspond to different life events such as getting paid a salary, going on vacation, or picking from the three decks of cards that sit at the center of the board. The three decks of cards are: news flashes, knowledge cards, and wild cards. Newsflashes provide a news story, and players must buy and sell investments accordingly in order to win or lose money. Users may accept advice from other players for a shared win or loss in the investment. Knowledge cards are multiple choice cards that teach users key finance information that will be used in the game and life. Wild cards are life events that will cause the loser to win or lose money depending on whether or not they own the right assets. To win, a user must double their money.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
