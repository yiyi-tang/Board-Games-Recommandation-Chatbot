The wise foresee an age of horror approaching, for the spirit of the earth is sick, tainted by deadly sorcery in a great conflict ages past. Not that the warlords of this bloody era care, not while there is glory to be won, territory to be wrested from the enemy, foes to be slaughtered. The so-called Noble Peoples &ndash; Men, Elves and Dwarfs &ndash; now struggle for power and influence, battling across the ruins of long-dead realms, or staking claim to new lands. Their ancient pacts are no more. The kingdoms that pledged their armies in service of those sacred treaties are gone into legend, the descendants of the noble princes who swore eternal oaths of friendship warring openly with one another. The glorious empires of those days are lost to the ocean, or buried beneath shifting sands, the palaces of the wise now home to kraken or shambling revenants, while the scions of their great houses are exiled or long-dead...&#10;&#10;This set contains a Kings of War 2nd Edition Gamer&rsquo;s Rulebook, and 93 multi-part plastic Undead and Dwarf miniatures, including:&#10;&#10;1 Skeleton Regiment&#10;20 Skeleton Warriors&#10;Hand Weapons and Shields or Spears and Shields&#10;Command components including Standard Bearer and Musician.&#10;Undead Dog&#10;20 Zombies&#10;10 Ghouls&#10;20 Ironclad&#10;10 Ironwatch&#10;10 Shieldbreakers&#10;1 Ironbelcher Cannon/Organ Gun with Crew&#10;Square Bases&#10;&#10;Miniatures are supplied unpainted and assembly may be required.&#10;&#10;",

The main purpose of the game is to bring the SDG of one&rsquo;s chosen role (stakeholder) to the highest level of discussion, that is global attention.&#10;&#10;Using cards you move your SDGs up on the scale. When an SDG reaches the top step, a vote begins. If all the players vote in favor, the round ends and the points are calculated. If even one player votes against, the SDG is placed on the lowest step and the round continues. Players have a limited number of votes against in each round.&#10;&#10;The game ends after completing the third round, or at the end of any round chosen as the last one. The player with the highest score is the winner. In the event of a tie, the players share the win.&#10;&#10;Summit 2030 is freely inspired by Stefano Luperto&rsquo;s &ldquo;King Up&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Green has Klingon, Hydran, and Vudar ships fighting a battle in an asteroid field. Will their fear, hate, and distrust find an end?  &ldquo;The Last Command,&rdquo; also by Green, follows a Carnivon in command of a Bear-Dog dreadnought.&#10;&#10;In addition to the story, History includes information on nobility titles and an article on Tholian military ranks.&#10;&#10;As is usual, Communications informs readers about the company&rsquo;s activities. Captain&rsquo;s Log #31 and SFB Module F2 have after-action reports. The company laid out its plans for new print releases and metal miniatures for the coming year, including the new Federation Commander. There are questions and answers about that new, faster-playing game. The Input Guide has guidelines for submissions to Federation Commander. Proposals for Star Fleet Battles are presented. Admiral Growler answers SFB questions. More &ldquo;Why&rdquo; questions get answered. There is a page of filk songs. Finally, there are the Star Fleet Awards.&#10;&#10;Federation Commander has prototype rules from Romulan Border. The first tactics papers appear. Finally, there is an example of play for the game. Later in the issue, the scenario &ldquo;Sabotage!&rdquo; provides a battle opportunity between the Klingons and the Federation.&#10;&#10;This issue includes five scenarios for Star Fleet Battles. &#10;&#10;     SL241, Circle of Vengeance, and SL242, Last Command, are based on the two stories in the issue.&#10;     Set during the Early Years, SL236, Web of Curiosity, involves an encounter between the Tholians and Klingons. &#10;&#10;&#10;SL243, Network Disruption, is tied to the Battle Group scenario that features the fleet of one of the Galactic Powers facing the Andromedans. &#10;SL244, Hearth and Home, has the Hydrans facing a Coalition fleet of Klingons and Lyrans.  &#10;Based in the Omega Octant, Dragonslayer SL245 has an Iridani clipper facing a Branthodon young dragonship.&#10;&#10;Database articles include battlegroups designed with 800 points and the optional use of partial X-refits. There is an article on the cosmic cloud. Kosnett&rsquo;s war is updated from its appearance in Advanced Missions. There is a guide for converting captured Klingon ships to fit into Lyran fleets and vice versa.&#10;&#10;The Tactics section has &ldquo;Victory at Origins 2005,&rdquo; by Ken Lin. The primer focuses on the Drex, located in the Omega Octant. There are three pages of term papers, including some encore term papers.&#10;&#10;The Venues section covers Star Fleet Command, SFB On-Line, playing by email, Galactic Conquest, Star Fleet Warlord, Prime Directive, and Star Fleet Battle Force.&#10;&#10;Federation &amp; Empire has a status update along with rules and rulings. There are four pages of tactical notes. Finally, there is the Q&amp;A section.&#10;&#10;New ships are added for Star Fleet Battles. The Klingons get &ldquo;collared&rdquo; ships:  DC7 collared battlecruiser and the DC5 collared war cruiser. The Vudar gain more ships with their command cruiser, advanced technology command cruiser, fast carrier resupply frigate, X-scout, and supply cruiser. The Vudar also get a medium bomber squadron, heavy bomber squadron, and bases for both types of bombers. The Federation receives its (old) light scout cruiser and its (old) heavy fighter carrier. The Klingons get a refitted captured Lyran war cruiser and Lyran destroyer. Conversely, the Lyrans get a refitted captured Klingon D5 war cruiser and Klingon F5 frigate. Federation Commander gets new ship cards for the Romulan King Eagle cruiser and K7R battlecruiser and the Gorn battle destroyer and battlecruiser. These four ships are in fleet scale.&#10;&#10;",

No plastic components.&#10;&#10;The aim of designers was to take some mechanics of different games trying to make their own version of Gwent. Tough, the idea evolved and mixed some concepts from Age of Empires, Stratego, or even Carcasonne.&#10;&#10;In Armi&ntilde;o the board and scenario is always changing, allowing a great replayability.&#10;&#10;Plays can last from 1 to 30 minutes, depending on strategy and luck. At the beginning of the game, the red carpet will be displayed between contestants, each of them having a King card from the maze. Then, the rest of the 42 field cards (white back) must be mixed and both players shall receive 17 face down cards. Then, the special cards (black back) will be mixed too and just one will be given to each player.&#10;&#10;The player will choose how to place cards on the cloth board. Decisions on how to place them will be based just in strategy.&#10;&#10;Each card has an effect written on it, so each turn a player must do an action with the cards. Move them or use them according to its effects.&#10;&#10;The special cards (epic, meteorite, transmute or breeze among them) can be used all along the game as many times as needed.&#10;&#10;Easy to learn but hard to master, Armi&ntilde;o is a strategic card game of medieval combat for two players, whose goal is to kill the opponent's king. Fast and destructive, in the eventuality you could not achieve the regicide, the winner will be the player obtaining most victory points.&#10;&#10;",

The Captain, of course, and two or three men he trusted.&#10;&#10;And one stranger.&#10;&#10;It is said that, once the treasure was safely buried, the Captain would ask who wanted to stay behind and guard it. In the stories, the stranger volunteers, hoping to take the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;So, the stranger is beheaded on the spot, their ghost left to haunt the place and guard the treasure for centuries. According to the stories, the stranger is bound to the place now, unable to leave, rest, or move on.&#10;&#10;Unless, of course, someone were to discover the gold they have been guarding. Unless they could find some way to convince someone, anyone, to face their fears, head out into the night, and claim the blood gold for themselves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Headless Guide is a game for a single person.

Once a player's calorie count is maxed out, they flip their game card over for one final chance. Eat one more meal and they're out of the game.&#10;&#10;Each chef has their own unique power ability and there are special cards in each deck, making each draw a tactical decision! A rubber band mechanic sees players getting more powerful and becoming bigger threats the closer they get to being eliminated.&#10;&#10;Food Coma is designed to be both a fast, fun party game that can be played in easy quick sessions and also a strategic game for more competitive players.&#10;&#10;All of Food Coma's over 100 images are hand drawn and the dozens of unique ingredient cards each have a clever name and witty tagline.&#10;&#10;Food Coma places strong emphasis on both visual appeal and gameplay integrity.

In the series, the protagonist Danielle pitches a card game where players create their own comic convention and play against other convention promoters.&#10;&#10;In The Long Con, players use pairs of guest and event cards to earn money or build their audience.  Money lets players add additional cards to their decks, while a bigger audience will upgrade their venue and ultimately win them the game.  The guests and events players can add to their decks give them more powerful combinations and unique bonuses.  In the end, the combinations of cards each player plays tell a fun, colorful story of how their convention grew into the ultimate con.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tiny Epic Dungeons is a fully co-operative dungeon crawler for 1 to 4 players set in the fantasy world of Aughmoore.&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Dungeons, players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss. Heroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes&rsquo; path. Where there isn&rsquo;t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.&#10;&#10;The game is played over two acts: The Dungeon, and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts, the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.&#10;&#10;After clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.&#10;&#10;These Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!&#10;&#10;Victory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss! In order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect legendary loot, and supreme spells&#10;&#10;Heroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect.&#10;&#10;Will you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact?&#10;&#10;The story is yours to tell in Tiny Epic Dungeons!&#10;&#10;The Deluxe Edition includes the Potions and Perils mini expansion and all Deluxe Edition Stretch Goals and Kickstarter Exclusive Content.&#10;&#10;The Potions &amp; Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!&#10;&#10;Mixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!&#10;&#10;Additionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players!&#10;&#10;",

It's an easy game to setup which only takes a couple of minutes. Players would need to eventually guess the four cards which are hidden from them at the beginning of the game. A dice makes the game more exciting as it allows players to perform certain actions depending on what is rolled. In this game it is easy to fool any opponent by asking for cards they already have and making it tough for everyone else to follow. &#10;It is a great game for family bonding!&#10;&#10;Best played with 4 players!&#10;&#10;",

You can use any one of thirteen different game sheets for each game; each tells a different chapter from the history of the worms, and has a few unique ways to score. There&rsquo;s one way to lose points on any sheet: leaving worms touching blank space. So fit your worms together cozily!&#10;&#10;At first you need only read 3 pages of rules, and then play Chapter 1, in which the eye is the only organ that has an action: to find food.&#10;&#10;Play at your own pace through the chapters. Each of the first 6 chapters introduces the power of one more of the six organ types: With a mouth, a worm can eat food to grow more organs. With a brain it can get some control of the colony&rsquo;s fate by changing die rolls. With a heart, a worm can grow longer. With a pointy tail it can team up into a &ldquo;Conga Line&rdquo;. And with &ldquo;collars&rdquo;, two worms &ndash; who love each other very much! &ndash; can make short baby worms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;The game's playtesting and development is documented in: &#10;[WIP] Worm & Cozy - 4th Roll & Write Game Design Contest - Contest Ready.&#10;&#10;",

It does not correspond exactly to the wars of Louis XIV, but concerns the future monarch because this event forged his character and participated in his absolutism. Casus belli: taking advantage of the weakness of royal power while Louis, the future Louis XIV, was still a minor, the parliament of Paris and the nobility (called the Princes) revolted at different periods and to different degrees against the regency ensured by Anne of Austria (widow of Louis XIII) and Cardinal Mazarin, hated by all. This weakening of France is a boon for Spain, still at war with France, to recover territories (Catalonia, Roussillon, the North of France).&#10;&#10;The kingdom of France represents the party of the Regent Anne of Austria, Cardinal Mazarin and the king's faithful (some military leaders move from one camp to another) and their allies (Duchy of Savoy, some German states, etc. .).&#10;Spain represents the party that brings together the princes as well as the various allies (other German states, Duchy of Lorraine, etc.); for simplicity this party is called the Coalition.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Norway was the first battlefield where British, French and German soldiers would battle on land in World War II. It would last longer than the Battle of France. It was the first modern combined arms operation with navy, air and land forces. One which the Wehrmacht performed to their German perfection.&#10;It was a gross violation of neutral states and Operation Weser&uuml;bung would conclude in the occupation of Norway and Denmark for the reminder of the war in Europe.&#10;&#10;Firestorm: Norway  uses  three  maps  to  plot  the  strategic  situation and show the effects of your table top games on the battles for Norway. All of the important units, territory, and objectives of the operation are represented on the map. Your units  will  clash  at  important  locations  with  the  best  forces  from  both  sides,  such  as  the  Gebirgsj&auml;ger,  Fallschirmj&auml;ger,  Alpine  Troops  and  Legionaries  as  well  as  the  Norwegian  army.&#10;&#10;Victory  conditions:  It  will  be  very  hard  for  the  Allies  to  achieve any kind of a real victory in Firestorm Norway and the  victory  conditions  reflect  this.  Events  in  France  will  overtake  the  Campaign  in  Norway  and  affect  the  support  of the British and French so the Allies will score points for holding out and slowing the German advance.&#10;&#10;All the rules you will need are included to play.&#10;Downloadable tokens are  provided  although  you  can  easily  substitute  them  with  other models.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Like 18WE/72, 18EE/82 is an operational strategy game based on Mike Hutton&rsquo;s popular 1862: Railway Mania in the Eastern Counties system covering Easter Europe.  It features a larger board, 21 major companies, and more offboard areas than either 18EA/62 or 18WE/72.  Any player familiar with 18WE/72 will very easily be able to enjoy 18EE/82, because the rules are almost completely identical aside from setup.&#10;&#10;18EE/82 features five regions instead of three, in which only three of four corporations are typically startable, as well as 3 minor companies in Hungary.  The four non-Hungarian regions feature randomly selected subsidies at setup, out of a pool of five.  These simple differences in setup present the players with major strategic decisions in what railroads to found, as well as how their companies will best be developed and operated.&#10;&#10;18EE/82 has extremely high replayability, due to its random setup at the beginning of the game.  Every non shell company is assigned a license type randomly (from expresses, freights, and regionals).&#10;&#10;18EE/82 has a larger board than 18WE/72, covering much of Eastern Europe.  The map also has more offboard areas, including the premier zones of Berlin and Constantinople.  Like in 18WE/72, there is no plain yellow track.  All track tiles are unlimited. Each company gets at least three track actions to determine tile placements and upgrades.  The map size supports more stations which can be acquired during the life of each corporation.  Each corporation may lay TWO additional tokens each operating round, instead of just one.&#10;&#10;The financial aspects of 18EA/62 you will find almost fully intact. There are parliament rounds, mergers, and refinancing, all as players know them from its predecessor game. Similarly both chartered and non-chartered corporations function in exactly the same ways.  This allows players to focus on the operational aspects of the game, without having to learn a new financial framework if they are familiar with either game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It is played on the spaces (squares) of an initially empty square board. The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 10x10 squares.&#10;&#10;Both players must have access to a sufficient number of disks of their own color and a sufficient number of neutral blocks.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA stack is a disk lying directly on the board along with all other disks piled onto it on the same square.&#10;&#10;The height of a stack is the number of disks in it.&#10;&#10;A group is a stack along with all other like-colored stacks one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent stacks of its color.&#10;&#10;Similarly, a patch is a square not occupied by a block along with all other such squares one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent squares not occupied by blocks. Note a patch may contain any number of groups, as well as empty squares.&#10;&#10;The size of a group or patch is the number of squares it spans.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlue plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, make exactly one of these board plays:&#10;&#10;- Place a disk of your color on an empty square.&#10;&#10;- Move a stack of your color any number of squares in a straight orthogonal line, without jumping over any blocks or enemy stacks, to a square occupied by an enemy stack of the same height. Then, remove this enemy stack, add a disk to your stack on that square and place a block on the square from which you just moved your stack. Note a stack can jump over friendly stacks.&#10;&#10;If you have no board plays available on your turn, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, for each patch on the board, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from it until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over in a patch owns the patch. Empty patches are owned by neither player.&#10;&#10;The player with the higher score in the resulting position wins. Your score is the sum of the sizes of the patches that you own. If there is a tie, whoever made the last board play loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means Orange will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;",

From then on, the players alternate performing two actions per turn. The available actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Placing a friendly stone on an empty light square.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Moving a friendly stone from a light square to an adjacent empty dark square.&#10;&#10;&#10;You can only pass your turn, or the second action of a turn, if you have no legal actions available. There will always be a legal action available to at least one of the players.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player who completes a chain of stones of their color touching the two opposite board edges of their color. A chain is a set of mutually connected stones. Two like-colored stones are connected if they occupy orthogonally adjacent squares or diagonally adjacent dark squares.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In return, you should do everything you can to get rid of the coronas. Whoever got rid of all of their coronas first wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are 60 action cards in the game. One action card is played per round. If you demonstrate strategic skill, you win the card game at the end.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player falls below 0 nerve cards, he is eliminated. So you always have to have at least one of these nerve cards in hand.&#10;&#10;When it is your turn, you have the option of using your action cards to have an effect on all players or only on a certain player - you can assign them even more coronas or take away nerves. After you have played an action card, you draw a new one.

Zack wieder drei Coronas gesammelt und drei Nerven verloren. Aber da! Ein Lichtblick! Impfstofflieferung in Sicht und endlich Sommer!&#10;&#10;Ein schnelles Spiel in dem man nicht nur die eigenen Karten im Blick behalten muss, sondern auch die der MitspielerInnen. Kann ich mit der n&auml;chsten Karte eine/n MitspielerIn rausschmei&szlig;en? Wer ist fast geheilt und braucht dringend mal wieder eine Schippe Corona? Werde deine Coronas los, behalte die Nerven und bring die anderen zur Verzweiflung.&#10;&#10;Dieses spannende Spiel, vers&uuml;&szlig; die Zeit nicht nur im Lockdown und l&auml;sst uns &uuml;ber Corona und seine Auswirkungen auch mal schmunzeln!&#10;&#10;Wer gute Nerven beweist und alle eigenen Coronas besiegt, gewinnt das Spiel.

The horses&rsquo; bridles were tightened by the auxiliaries. The armour shone in the splendor of the sun and it seemed that the light of day was doubled. The banners unfolded in the winds and offered themselves to the currents; they presented a delightful spectacle to the eyes.&rdquo; &ndash;comment by the author of the Relation Marchianensis de Pugna Bovinis on the French army&rsquo;s preparation for battle.&#10;&#10;Following the Third Crusade tensions among the monarchs of Western Europe was at a new high. Otto IV, King of Portugal and newly crowned Holy Roman Emperor was facing revolt in the German provinces, many of whom were actively supported by the French King, Philip II, The Emperor had also garnered the enmity of Pope Innocent III soon after he was crowned when Otto claimed the Kingdom of Sicily, which he then attacked in 1209, which caused the Pope to excommunicate him. English King, John, was also involved with a growing conflict with the French, who were steadily taking lands along the border with Normandy. Indeed, John had only recently assumed the thrown following the death of his older brother, Richard (the Lionhearted) during a siege to retake one of the castles the French had captured earlier while the English king was on crusade. Tensions boiled over to outright war when the Pope authorized King Philip to launch a crusade against the upstart Holy Roman Emperor and his allies. The Battle of Bouvines, fought near the city of Tournai, was one of the largest ever fought in the Medieval period, and its outcome would affect the course of history for centuries.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Theme&#10;The Art of Boxing Clever simulates almost all aspects of the real-life boxing match into a highly specific and player controlled, intense decision-making match experience. Aspects recreated in the board game include the stance and style of the boxers; boxer initiative, 10 attributes of the selected boxer; head/body area target selection; punch type selection, defence move selection; damage resistance attributes, increasing damage tracking; judge scoring, knockdown count sequence. In essence this unrivalled boxing game mechanism creates the feel of the real ebb and flow of a typical boxing match and the unpredictability of &lsquo;one punch can make all the difference&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal is to outthink and outmanoeuvre your opponent to consistently inflict damage by exploiting their weaknesses, whilst protecting your own. Damage is realised by the depletion of the opponent&rsquo;s card hand until either the hand is completely depleted, or a KO or TKO is achieved through a visible damage tracking system.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;The game centres around a timely selection of appropriate punch / defence cards from a tailored hand of cards specific to each fighter to inflict damage to selected areas of the opponent&rsquo;s head and body. Damage is tracked and consequences are specific to each fighter. &#10;Players select their boxer depending on style, stance and attributes. &#10;For each match-up a predetermined hand of cards is dealt representing the attributes of the boxer. &#10;A 10-round match with 3 scoring judges. &#10;Each round takes the form of 5 mini-rounds which involves 5 turns of attacking and defending. Each turn includes 2 potentially defendable attack moves, one to a selected area of the head and one to an area of the body. The selection of the cards and target area is critical to achieve damage. Any damage inflicted is tracked on the gameboard and consequences to the opponent&rsquo;s hand of cards is realised and the judges scoring is revealed.&#10;The play sequence thereby creates poker style opportunities for bluffing and counter bluffing, minimizing &lsquo;Chance&rsquo; to maximize player control, creating a high sense/degree of anticipation. &#10;The variety of the cards provide multiple ways and exciting combinations to out manoeuvre your opponent. The highly player controlled mini rounds are countered by an unpredictable judge scoring system, potentially influencing player strategy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board is a regular checkers board with indentations for balls to roll into place. At the beginning of the game the balls are placed on the board and the board is moved until all the balls are set in place. Any ball that rolled to the king row is replaced with a larger ball to represent a king and has all the powers of a king in regular checkers. Play then continues with regular checkers rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "F.1 Grand Prix is a game for 2-5 players. It is a true competition of Formula 1 miniatures on the Belgian automobile circuit from Spa-Francorchamps, one of the most beautiful automobile circuit in the world, by his trace and his landscape, that of the Belgian Ardennes.&#10;&#10;For to start, each player selects his car and his stand A B C D or E. Each car is placed in the car park stand, and now the game starts by the qualification, in order to know what pilot will occupy the  after the trails.&#10;&#10;Then the players start to race by drawing cards from a deck to determine how far the race around the track. Some cards force you to draw a card from a second deck which could be an advantage or dis-advantage for your car.&#10;&#10;The first player who achieves 5 circuit turns and who goes over the check pattern flag is winner. The others continue to play to know their arrival order.&#10;One suggestion! You can thus make championships in 3, 4 or 5 sleeves attributing for each competition, 9 points for first, 7 points for second, 5 points for third, 3 points for fourth and 1 point for the fifth. You determine thus the Champion of the Champions.&#10;&#10;",
