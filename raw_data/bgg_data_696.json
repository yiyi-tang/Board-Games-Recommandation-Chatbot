As you venture into the ancient Dwarven realm of Khazad-d&ucirc;m, you'll enter a place in Middle-earth far removed from the settings and creatures represented by the Core Set encounter cards. Dark tunnels teem with goblins, and any wrong turn could send you plummeting through pits to find yourself confronted by older and fouler things than Orcs.&#10;&#10;Therefore, in addition to expanding your existing game experience, Khazad-d&ucirc;m introduces nine all-new encounter sets. These unique sets, when combined into encounter decks (as instructed by the rules), make up the three included scenarios in Khazad-d&ucirc;m.&#10;&#10;Note: To play the scenarios in the subsequent &quot;Dwarrowdelf Cycle&quot; of Adventure Packs, you will need the new encounter sets in this expansion.&#10;&#10;",

Set up in advance by a shadowy group of scouts and bookies, each Circuit is unique. Some wind through planetary canyons, others through old mining tunnels bored through asteroids or through the swirling rocks of planetary rings. Racers must dodge obstacles as well as the weapons fire of their opponents to cross the finish line first to win fame and fortune!&#10;&#10;Solar Circuit Racing is a sci-fi racing game for 2-6 players. The game is played on a modular, customizable course made out of map tiles. Moving into a tile with an obstacle requires a piloting roll. Failing the piloting roll results in something bad happening, like smashing into an asteroid or scraping a wing along a canyon wall. Damage reduces the capabilities of your ship. Once you pass the roll, you can advance into the space and move on.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you will have to manage your limited engine power, and make decisions about how to spend it. Engine power can be used to advance through the course, to evade enemy weapons, and to make maneuvering through obstacles easier. Spend too much power on maneuvering and your opponents will jump into the lead, too much on advancing and you'll splatter against the obstacles. The first player to complete the decided on number of laps wins.&#10;&#10;",

Quorsum is unique, however, in that the board is never the same from game to game; rather, the 16 board tiles are picked at random before the game, so that players must constantly react to an unexpected setup.  Not only that, but the board continues to change throughout the game, as players try to flip key tiles from light to dark or vice versa.&#10;&#10;Luck is minimal: even the dice require skill, since players may decide how many of their dice to use for each important move.  The result is a fast-paced game in which players must constantly calculate the best path to take and the best way to hinder the opponent's tokens.  Although the experienced player will usually win, still there is often a chance for both players right up until the last move.&#10;&#10;Quorsum avoids both the predictable setup of most strategy games, and the swings of luck in most dice games.  The players' fate, therefore, is always in their own hands.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Enigma of Leonardo: Quintis Fontis is a specialized version of &quot;The Enigma of Leonardo&quot; designed for hardcore players, for those, that considered the core version too simple. Designed for those players, that enjoy strategic planning and quick thinking.&#10;&#10;QF is played using the same cards as the core set &ndash; each card has two symbols on it, there are 12 different symbols altogether. Most of the cards are identical to the ones in the core set, while others have different symbol combinations on them. The set also includes a few special text cards (action cards).&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is the same as in The Enigma of Leonardo, to collect Secret Keys, by making sequences of identical symbols but this time the game is played on one big field. The field itself is made during game play, the only restriction being its size &ndash; 5x5 cards. The first card is placed in the middle of the playing field, players then take turns at playing cards, increasing the field. In the end, the first card that was played might not even be in the middle anymore, it could be on the edge.&#10;&#10;Players can not only play cards on empty spaces, they can play cards on top of each other and can even replace cards from their hands with the ones on the playing field. The only condition is that the cards being replaced must share a common symbol. This playing mechanic allows for more complex combos, by careful planning, one can gradually replace all the cards on the field with symbols that the player needs.&#10;&#10;Just like in The Enigma of Leonardo, in QF players receive Secret Keys when they successfully make a row of cards with the same symbol. But now you can get symbols not only for 3 cards in a row, but for four and even five identical symbols. Qunitis fontis actually means &ndash; &ldquo;the fifth symbol&rdquo;, when translated from Latin. Rows can be made horizontally, diagonally and vertically just like in the core game but now you can receive the same key more than once by first making a row of three symbols and then adding cards with the fourth and fifth symbol.&#10;&#10;But it sounds much easier than it actually is. The game now uses a special counter-marker called &ldquo;veto&rdquo;. After playing a card, the player may choose to move the marker on any card (even the one he just played) on the playing field. The next player cannot play any cards that share a symbol with the marked card. It&rsquo;s up to the players to decide should they move the marker each turn or keep it in one place blocking a certain symbol combination for the entire game.&#10;&#10;Another new addition to QF are the action cards. There aren&rsquo;t much compared to another expansion of the game The Enigma of Leonardo &ndash; Novem &ndash; but they can alter the flow of the game. With these cards you can steal symbols from your opponents and prevent them from gaining new ones.&#10;&#10;The player who successfully collects seven Keys is the winner. If the deck is used up and no one has collected seven Keys, the one to collect the most is the winner. In case of a tie a key gradation has been provided.&#10;&#10;QF is basically a harder version of The Enigma of Leonardo: the rules are different but the cards used are practically identical. Meaning you can try playing The Enigma of Leonardo using QF or vice versa. It will be a slightly different game, but it&rsquo;s still possible.&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    The Enigma of Leonardo&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Most of the cards in this card game are letter cards, with which a word is formed; the rest are special action cards. Each player has six cards at the start of the game; the goal is to get rid of one's cards first.&#10;The first player plays a card on the table; this card will be the first letter of a word that s/he thinks about (but doesn't say out loud). The next player adds a second letter to the word, etc. There are many jokers, so there are also many possibilities for what a word might be. When a player doubts that the last player can still think of a word starting with the letters on the table, s/he can call the bluff. If the previous players cannot produce a word, the bluffing player must pick up the cards from the table, if s/he can, the accusing player picks them up. Instead of playing a card, a player can also choose to draw a new card from the stack, but still takes responsibility for the word on the table (i.e., if called, must produce a word with these letters).&#10;By placing a facedown card on the table, any player (out of turn order), can announce that a word is complete. The letters are then discarded and a new word is started.&#10;&#10;There are various special cards with which players can be forced to say a word with the current letters, cards can be passed to other players, etc.&#10;&#10;When a player plays his or her last card, the other players count the points printed on their remaining cards. These are their negative scores.&#10;&#10;",

Three red-backed &quot;mime&quot; cards are shuffled with the 26 red-backed scene cards to form a deck.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player draws the top card from the deck, then acts out a scene, complete with whatever thoughts, cries, declarations, etc. best fit the word bubble or thought bubble on the card. The other players race to identify which beige card matches the scene being acted out. Each player can choose only one card, and no card can be chosen more than once. If the correct card is chosen, the guesser scores the beige card and the actor keeps the red card; otherwise both scene cards are removed from the game and the actor takes the &quot;Malus&quot; card (whether from the table or another player).&#10;&#10;If a player draws a Mime card, he discards it, draws the next card, and acts out the scene but without any dialogue or sounds.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either two beige cards remain on the table or after the third Mime card has been resolved. Players scores one point per card collected, with the holder of the Malus card losing one point. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

She may make either a single step in any direction as a King, or may make two consecutive steps in any direction and may change directions in between. The only limitations are that the Sorceress may not return to her original square (thereby making a null-move) and may not capture a piece on the first move and continue on - her move ends with any capture.&#10;&#10;The Elephant may slide up to four spaces diagonally, or may step a single space horizontally or vertically. This piece has no relation to the Elephant of Shatranj.&#10;&#10;The Tiger may slide up to four spaces horizontally or vertically, or may step a single space diagonally.&#10;&#10;The Duke may slide up to three spaces in any direction. He moves like a Queen in Chess, except that he is limited to a range of only three squares&#10;&#10;and others&#10;&#10;Each player has 40 pieces (including 16 pawns)&#10;&#10;",

The 2007 printing of GtR I.V had cards that were 64.5 mm x 89.5 mm.  If you sleeve your cards or have a later printing (which is the most common edition of I.V), then the promo cards will work fine.

Each player (or team) has four markers.  The dice is rolled to bring a marker in play and or to move it along the track;  however, a marker can be moved only if the question asked is properly answered.  When a player answers without a &quot;hint&quot; (without asking which are the multiple choices listed on the card), that player can have an other question, so an other opportunity to move forward.  Under some conditions, the questions may also be used to perform a &quot;power-play&quot;, which could force an other player to move backward.  The first player to reach the flag and to answer properly the question wins the game.&#10;&#10;Canada Quiz has 250 question cards, with four questions (with multiple answers) on each, for a total of 1000 questions.  The trivia game is based on early the history of Canada, mainly covering the historical period from the very beginnings up to the Confederation.  Canada Quiz has been published in English and in French.&#10;&#10;",

In The Victorian Gamer you are one of the idle rich.&#10;No aristocrat worthy of his name would have been without a fast running footman or a stable boy who was a particularly able jockey. He would put up his &lsquo;man&rsquo; against another noble&rsquo;s &lsquo;man&rsquo; for an agreed sum. The sport was incidental; it was the outcome that counted, with the winner taking all. And of course, a whole new industry of side betting with bookies quickly emerged.&#10;The Victorian Gamer mirrors this era. There are three different events &ndash; running, rowing and horseracing - each one having its own unique gameplay. In addition, players can make bets against each other and/or with the bookie. And furthermore, to add a bit of extra spice there are three differently numbered dice to form the odds and affect the outcomes. &#10;In short, there are three different races, two ways of betting, but only one winner. For friends and  family with even the tiniest element of a competitive streak, The Victorian Gamer will provide hours of fun, not to mention a few squabbles, huffs  and sulks. Warning &ndash; NOT A GAME FOR BAD LOSERS.&#10;&#10;",

That player gets an additional 3 bonus VPs. Each player then counts the number of cakes, getting 1VP/cake and adding them with any bonus VPs. The winner is the one who gains the most VPs (i.e. the one who has eaten the most cakes in the shortest time).&#10;&#10;&#10;The new version of My Cake! has been released in September 2011.

There are multiple ways to win including holding locations and killing specific targets. The unique aspect to this game is the added element of weather, which can be used to blast players off the game board, thus drastically changing the layout of your opponent's defences in a single turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Game Components and Basic Gameplay&#10;&#10;Included: 1 Game Board, 40 Tokens (16 Dark Forest Yetis, 16 Order of the Fire Plains, 4 Spawn Location Markers, 4 Objecive Markers), 1 Weather Table, 2 Dice. Suggested use of your own Chess Board.&#10;&#10;Characers show a base strength rating of 1-5, that score is augmented by a single die roll which then determines outcomes when attacking and defending your position. Additionally, you each have a Leader and a Weather Master, both hold key powers towards the outcome of each battle. The Weather Table is placed next to the game board, the results from a die roll determine which row is affected and which direction the characers in that row are pushed by the weather. Choose a side, choose a scenario and be the first to accomplish one of your objectives.&#10;&#10;",

Each carts' contents overlap so taking fruit from the cart affects fruit taken later from the same cart. Using only cards, the Venn idea was definitely abstracted a bit.&#10; In Damsels in Distress, the players are wicked queens/witches that have determined through their talking mirrors, that damsels in the area are more fairer than they. Taking the fruit they poison the apples, feed the monkeys, draw cards, and hinder the prince charming on his way to save the damsel. The apples if given to the damsel before the prince arrives, will put the damsel into a deep sleep (coma). The player who does this will gain the prestige for doing so, of her wicked guild of witches and warlocks. The charming Prince of each Kingdom is headed towards his Kingdom's damsels, and each round saves one, unless hindered (slipping on a banana peel, perhaps? Or better yet, attacked by a band of flying monkeys?). In this community of Witches, there is more prestige for a collection of damsels from different Kingdoms.&#10;&#10;",

Some rough edges were smoothed and three new features were added: a procedure for free setups, play on a closed surface and a tactical approach to offering draws.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Schnapp's players need to guess which tiles on the table they need to slap to claim &ndash; but they might have a tough time interpreting what the target is as the cluegiver must do things like speak with his fingers between his teeth or hop around the table on one leg. Schnapp to it!&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out the 96 picture tiles face up so that they can be seen by all players. Each player receives a task card; this task card shows nine pictures that its holder will have to describe, a challenging task since the 96 pictures are grouped into 16 different families, with each family consisting of six very similar images.&#10;&#10;In each round, the player to the left of the active player starts the sandtimer, then the active player looks at his task card and begins to describe the icons and pictures on it for the player two spots to his left. He cannot show his card, point to tiles, or answer the searcher's questions; he can change which item he's describing at any time. The searcher can only say things like &quot;Done!&quot; or &quot;Got it!&quot; to spur the active player on to describe something new. Once the time runs out, both describer and searcher score points for all correct items grabbed, then those items are returned to the table.&#10;&#10;After everyone has been the active player once, the second round begins, with the active player first drawing a handicap card that imposes some condition on him while he gives clues to the same searcher as before. For the third round, the describer and searcher switch roles, with the new describer also having a handicap. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The rulebook for Schnapp's includes a few variants, such as one in which three people search for matching pictures at the same time and a fully cooperative game.&#10;&#10;",

Nott. All four of them were hanged in an abandoned barn behind the jail.&#10;&#10;Elias survived, against the odds, when he was cut down minutes after his short-drop attempted execution, by Deputy 'Clay' Beckwith - he and ten lawmen broke up the vigilante gathering. The records state that thirty men were arrested that moon-lit April night, but the records do not tell if the other prisoners survived.&#10;&#10;After being taken to Surgeon's Hall, the authorities decided to reprieve Elias and his sentence was commuted to transportation for four years. While serving his sentence, Elias turned to the teachings of the Good Book for guidance - returning to Repentance Springs a changed man. Soon, he found that his gunfighting and horse-handling skills had attracted the recognition of Ned McReady, who gave the man a badge.&#10;&#10;When Jack Colty rained bullets about town, Elias was one of the first to ride with Ned. The rest is history...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Originally from Ireland, Brady Logan had a chequered career before finding himself a deputy at Repentance Springs - he joined the navy in 1856 aged 15 years and 9 months, and spent most of his early career aboard HMS 'Royal Adelaide'. He also spent three months of his service in diving bells in the Mediterranean.&#10;&#10;The records show that he married on September 14th 1867 in St Senan's Church in Kilrush. It is not recorded if the couple had any children.&#10;&#10;Brady was later discharged (referred to as a 'bad chicken dinner') from HMS Liverpool for reasons unstated, but guessed to be insobriety on duty.&#10;&#10;After his wife died of 'The Shakes', Brady sobered up and travelled to America, visiting his sister and her mining engineer husband - both were employed by the Cottonwood Mining Company.&#10;&#10;Brady worked at Rattlesnake Creek for a time, utilising his knowledge of rifles and explosives to make a few bucks - even completing a contract for Fort Murphy up at Lincoln County.&#10;&#10;Colonel Ned McReady deputised Brady when the McSween brothers and gang kidnapped Jackie Peppin. During the gunfight at Peppin farm, on Sept 1st, 1891, Brady shot both brothers in the face at one hundred yards, and also 'Turkey' Joe in the buttocks. Ned is reported to have called Brady Logan 'The best shot with a rifle the Lord has ever seen.&quot;&#10;&#10;Noted to have an eagle tattoo on his left forearm, from his service days, Brady also sports a small scar on his upper lip - he insists it was cut by an Apache knife, others whisper that it was from years of playing the Mouth Harp. Badly.&#10;&#10;Married his second wife, Josie Hopkins, at St Ezekiel's Episcopal Church.&#10;&#10;Was also once struck by lightning during the summer of 1890.&#10;&#10;",

The scions of the first attempt to colonize mars, the Hegemony of Ares has risen to form a military super power that rival the Terran forces.  Now the two Empire's must fight for the future of the human race with new, terrible weapons and vehicles.

There are even some very light deck-building elements, allowing you to customize your play style with artillery attacks and buffs for your army, which can contain over 100 units at once!  All these elements are combined under a single, simple dice based ruleset that has two modes of play; Skirmish , which is a streamlined version  for beginers and nonwargamers, and Warzone, which adds tactical depth by adding cards, an upgrade tree for your units, and a terifying unit called the ultra mech.  The objective of the game is to destroy your enemies HQ structure, winning a battle in the war for the red planet.&#10;&#10;",

But someone is taking the concept to the next terrifying level.&#10;&#10;Abandoned and forgotten for over two decades, Camp Hackaway sits in the middle of a thick forest where foliage and undergrowth have nearly reclaimed the old campground. People from all over the world are being abducted and dropped off in the forest on the outskirts of Camp Hackaway, forced to become unwilling participants in the ultimate game of escape and survival. Each participant is given a flashlight three very simple rules: 1) Search the cabins of the campground, find the key to the old pickup truck. 2) Survive the random attacks crazed serial killer Hackin' Hank. 3) Escape in the old pickup truck and win the game. And it won't be as easy as Hackin' Hank constantly roams the campground, stalking the participants one by one.&#10;&#10;Body Count is a horror themed card/board game hybrid that utilizes tile-flipping mechanic to simulate the fog of war as the players roam the campground in the dead of night, unsure of their surroundings. The game board is made up of a 4x4 grid of 3.5 inch square tiles that begin face-down. As players move along the grid, they flip tiles to reveal their destination before moving to the next tile. If they discover a cabin, they may search it and possibly find items to help them fend of Hank if he attacks, but they may also find other, more horrifying objects such as severed heads and human remains that may trigger other events that can change the game and affect their chances of escaping alive.&#10;&#10;After each player's turn, a card is drawn from Hank's location deck to see where he pops up in the campground - if it's a location occupied by a player, Hank attacks. If a player enters a tile adjacent to a tile occupied by Hank, he gets the opportunity to stalk and attack them.&#10;&#10;The game board changes with every game so you'll never play the same game twice.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to SEARCH, SURVIVE, and ESCAPE?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deathmatch is a fast and tactical wargame for 1-4 players, which is based on different video game shooters. Each player takes the role of a group of soldiers who are fighting in a arena for victory.&#10;&#10;Deathmatch uses only cards and some markers for the characters. The different card types are:&#10;&#10;- Character Cards:&#10;Every character in the game is represented by a Character Card, which contains all necessary information (e.g. Attack-, Defense-Value, Action Points, Portage Capacity and their Special Abilities). Each Character Card has a normal and a wounded side.&#10;&#10;- Equipment Cards:&#10;Equipment Cards represented the different equipment in the game, like a M16, a PSG-1 or a Bulletproof Vest. Characters can be equipped with Equipment Cards, to increase their fight or defense ability. The equipment cards also serve as dice rolls. Each card has a Fate Number printed on it, which is between 0 and 5. In Combat you can play an Equipment Card from your hand to boost your Attack- or Defense-Value and then you always adds the Fate Number from top card of your Equipment Deck to determine the outcome of this action. Equipped Cards are no longer in your Equipment Deck and so their Fate Numbers are no longer in the dice pool. If your characters have good equipment, than the player will have fewer good Fate Numbers in his Deck. So each player has to find the right balance between right equipment and the remaining Fate Numbers in his deck.&#10;&#10;- Terrain Cards:&#10;A Terrain Card represents a part of the arena, where the characters compete against each other. Every card is divided in 6 (3x2) squares and has a different setup of covers and obstacles, like Metal Walls and Mud Pits.&#10;&#10;- Scenario Cards:&#10;Each Scenario Card represents a game mode, like Deathmatch, Capture the Flag or Domination. All necessary information is given on these cards. This includes information such as the special rules, the way to lay out the Terrain Cards to create the arena or the Winning Conditions.&#10;&#10;- Marker Cards:&#10;The Marker Cards represent the characters, special markers or items for the different scenarios. Before the first play, the players have to cut out the markers to use them.&#10;&#10;",

Fatigue, morale, supply and command are as important as fighting prowess and sheer numbers.  Units not just take physical losses but will become ineffective from fatigue and disorder long before they run out of men - unless you, in command, can manage them effectively and maintain their edge over two days of fighting.  Corps are normally activated by chitpulls, but for PBEM play a less interactive version is provided that still provides a significant advantage to the side that grabs the initiative in the battle.&#10;&#10;Map scale: 1km per hex&#10;Unit scale: divisions, 1000 men per strength point&#10;Time scale: 3.5 hours per daylight turn, 8 hours per night turn&#10;&#10;",

The flavour is smack in the middle of The Three Musketeers and pirate action of all kinds. Swing from those chandeliers or ratlines. Kick the chair or skewer the roast chicken.&#10;&#10;Flashing Steel was written to address a couple of key changes needed from Song of Blades and Heroes for this genre. One was to reflect the slower rate of fire for matchlock weapons. That was easy enough.&#10;&#10;The second was to bring in the flair and 'swashbuckling' aspects of the period into the rules. It is often forgotten that schools of martial arts were as thorough and widespread in Europe as they were in Japan in the 1500's through the 1600's. There were all kinds of flashy moves and clever tricks.&#10;&#10;So the rules weave in this kind of option to do more than simply move-attack-resolve-repeat. More than just strict combat options, the Swashbuckling rules allow you to be more interactive with your terrain. It opens up more of the game to narrative, or story-telling wargaming. All of which is part of the great Songs engine, of course. With Flashing Steel we have tried to extend and strengthen that side of the system.  -Andrew Boswell, designer&#10;&#10;",

Move is the distance the unit can move in inches, Attack the number of attacks per turn (most units have only one).&#10;&#10;Each game turn, units move or fire, then combat between units in contact is resolved (each unit adds a 2d6 roll to its STRIKE rating, the unit with the lowest result loses 2 points of STRENGTH). After combat resolution, units that have suffered losses must pass a morale test or rout. A routing unit must test morale again in the next turn and is removed from the game if it fails that second test.&#10;&#10;The rules also include a few special rules for flank attacks, cover, fortifications and siege engines.&#10;&#10;The rules come with a scenario (The Battle of Grey Rock) for which colour counters are included in the magazine.&#10;&#10;",

The gamemaster controls non-playing characters and is the only one to know each character's goal. Each character has three stats (SKILL, STAMINA and MOVE), some of them have extra rules, like a spell they can cast or a magic item they can use.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players move their character on the board, then characters adjacent to each other can interact, often by fighting but other interactions are possible (like exchanging objects, talking...). Combat is resolved using standard Fighting Fantasy rules.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last character standing, having fulfilled his/her objective.&#10;&#10;In April 2020, Ian Livingstone made the game available as a print and play with updated art assets. This is a free download, and he asks that a charitable donation be made to the National Videogame Museum. (See the Web Links section.)&#10;&#10;",
