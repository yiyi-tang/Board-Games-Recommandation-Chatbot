    "Description": "Card Bard is a two player card game in which each player takes the role of the magical traveling storyteller of old &mdash; The Bard.&#10;&#10;A player&rsquo;s deck represents their repertoire of ballads, stories, techniques, tricks, magical items, fantastical lore, and enchanting melodies that you will use to battle your opponent to win the hearts &ndash; and purses &ndash; of the folk of the land.&#10;&#10;During the game, players use their cards to perform Songs and collect Fame. The game ends when a player accumulates 15 Fame and has no currently active Songs. That player wins the game.&#10;&#10;Card Bard plays over a series of alternating turns that are made up of 4 steps. Each of these steps takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the step.&#10;&#10;1. Play: Use your available Actions to play or draw cards, and activate effects.&#10;&#10;2. Resolve: Resolve all effects still in play then check for the win condition.&#10;&#10;3. Recover: Recharge Actions, discard any unwanted and cards over the hand limit.&#10;&#10;4. Draw: Draw back up to the hand limit.&#10;&#10;While Card Bard can be played with the pre-constructed decks, much of the depth comes when players construct original decks. Each deck must contain exactly 31 cards, including their Bard and no more than three copies of any card, by name. Within these guidelines, any combination of song and composition cards can be used. The Bard card is a special card that your deck revolves around. Bards determine what types of cards you can play. All cards in your deck must either match your Bard&rsquo;s instrumental mastery type or be of a neutral type. Bards also have special effects that can be used by paying the costs associated with them, listed on the card.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

However, the day to day campaign activity of the combatants included reconnaissance, raids, probing actions, resupply and a host of other minor operations that frequently lead to small skirmishes.&#10;&#10;What I want to do in this volume of Refighting History is to take some of these actions, however small, and however sketchy in terms of accounts, and turn them into wargames. They will also demonstrate that you do not need large armies to wargame the Seven Years War.&#10;The Western Theatre accounts provide details of the day to day activity by both armies. Coupled with this, the great variety of light and irregular troops provides a whole range of different unit.&#10;&#10;The result is this volume with nine small historical actions refought on the wargame table. There is also a significant amount of background on the units involved coupled with art work to illustrate the uniforms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;The scenarios are compatible with many rulesets although Sharp Practice ! is recommended by the author (who uses his own modifications of his set The War Game Rules).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Having covered some relatively small actions in Volume 1 of Refighting History Volume 2 examines some larger battles. The battles in question come from the War of the Austrian Succession and more specifically the First Silesian War.&#10;&#10;The first battle is something of a wargame classic - Mollwitz. The Grant&rsquo;s first Mollwitz wargame is coved with an excerpt from The War Game describing how it was first fought back in 1968. The battle is then revisited and with quite different results. There is then &ldquo;A slice of Mollwitz&rdquo; looking at only one particular part of the same battle.&#10;&#10;The second battle, Chotusitz, is rather less well known and took place the year after Mollwitz. The battle includes an unusual twist but you will have to read it to discover what it is.&#10;&#10;The third battle is the rather obscure battle of Sahay. This battle required quite a lot of detective work and no small amount of conjecture. The end result is a most interesting action.&#10;&#10;In addition to the battles there is an update on Charles&rsquo; wargame armies and a section on battlefield manoeuvre in the mid eighteenth and its implications for wargaming.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes four variable turn scenarios: &#10;&#10;     Operation Barbarossa (1 to 7 Game-Turns),&#10;     The Road to Stalingrad (1 to 12 Game-Turns),&#10;     Fall Blau (8 to 17 Game-Turns), and&#10;     War for the Motherland campaign (1 to 22 Game-Turns). &#10;&#10;&#10;One of the nice new twists implemented for the strength chit system is the variable and increasing combat chit strength for the Soviets over time to model the increasing combat effectiveness of the Soviet Armies.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;    Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10 (no hidden units)&#10;    Time Scale: 1 or 2 months per turn&#10;    Map Scale: 74 km per hex&#10;    Unit Scale: Army (Soviets, Axis Minors) and Corps (German)&#10;    Players: one to two, best with two&#10;    Playing Time: 2-5 hours for scenarios, 8+ hours for campaign&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

There is substantial overlap between the volumes as each subsequent one was in part meant to update and/or collect much of the material of the previous.&#10;&#10;The original in the series, Chapter Approved, was published in 2001, with Chapter Approved 2003 following in 2002 and Chapter Approved 2004 in 2003 (the year in the title indicating the coming year rather than when it was published). They were also known as the Second, Third, and Fourth Book of the Astronomican, respectively, in homage to the original from Rogue Trader.&#10;&#10;&#10;Army Lists&#10;- The Cursed Founding for use with Codex: Space Marines&#10;- Feral Orks for use with the Codex: Orks&#10;- Imperial Guard Armoured Company&#10;- Kroot Mercenaries&#10;- Tyranid Seeding Swarms&#10;- Tau Rail Rifle for use with Codex: Tau&#10;- Mounted Daemonettes for use with Codex: Chaos Space Marines (3rd Edition, 2nd Codex)&#10;&#10;Miscellaneous Rules&#10;- Transport Vehicles&#10;- Vehicle Design Rules&#10;- Tyranid Monstrosities&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;- Pitched Battle Mission&#10;- Escalating Engagement Mission&#10;&#10;Codex Updates&#10;- Codex: Space Marines&#10;- Codex: Armageddon&#10;- Codex: Orks&#10;- Codex: Blood Angels &amp; Codex: Catachans&#10;- Codex: Eldar &amp; Codex: Craftworld Eldar&#10;- Codex: Necrons&#10;- Codex: Dark Angels&#10;- Codex: Dark Eldar&#10;&#10;Trial Rules&#10;- Trial Assault rules&#10;- Trial Vehicle rules&#10;- Minor Psyker Powers&#10;&#10;",

Te mice have to get from space 1 to space 64 without getting caught by the cat. If the cat and a mouse get on the same space, the mouse gets eaten and is out of play. If a player rolls more than he needs to reach space 64, he has to move the surplus points backwards.&#10;&#10;Movement is determined by 2 dice (only 1 die from space 60 onward). Only the mice may use the diagonal lines, the cat has to go around. If the cat gets on an unnumbered intersection near the image of a cat, it needs to roll doublets to move again or has to pay 3 coins in it's  third next turn. If a mouse gets near a hiding hole it may chose to stop there with it's last moving point, to be safe from the cat.&#10;&#10;If the cat rolls a doublet, it may move backwards to catch a mouse. If a mouse rolls a doublet or reaches a space with the image of a mouse, it's roll counts double.&#10;&#10;If the cat gets to space 64 before any mouse it wins the game and the whole stake. If a mouse reaches space 64 the cat may only move up to space 63 and wait there for the remaining mice.&#10;&#10;The players pay a stake of 2 coins for each mouse and the same amount of coins for the cat. If the cat passes a mouse the mouse has to pay 1 coin to the cat and vice versa.  If several mice use the same hiding hole, each has to pay 1 coin to the first mouse.&#10;&#10;When there isn't any mouse remaining in play, the mice in space 64 and the cat share the stake.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each Ingredient and Recipe is assigned a point value (top right corner of the card) based on the rarity of the required Ingredients, as well as the demand for those Ingredients in the Recipes. Collected Ingredients that aren&rsquo;t made into a Recipe are wasted in the players&rsquo; Kitchens. Points for wasted Ingredients are subtracted: wasting food is bad!

Can you overcome ancient challenges and bring about world peace? Global Crisis is a collaborative game (with a twist) where everyone is working to stabilize global chaos. The twist is that one player might be an agent of chaos. Yes, might. This potential saboteur raises suspicion and increases the challenge. Trust will have to be earned, hopefully before it is too late!&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;If players collectively score enough points, they win. Players score by passing as many global policies as possible (before time runs out) to address the five overarching sets of Global Challenges. If a player is the &quot;Agent of Chaos,&quot; that player can only win if the group scores in the lowest bracket possible&mdash;thus causing all other players to collectively lose.&#10;&#10;This game can be played with 2 to 5 players. All players begin with five cards. In the initial rounds, players gather as much information as they can about the cards in the hands of other players. Next, they will aid each other to remove challenge cards from their hands, organize them by sets (color), and finally try to score on each set. There are five sets of challenges that can score. Scoring is based on how many cards within a set the group can collect and whether the group can form a unique policy on each set&mdash;all before time runs out. Time expires when the players have formed a policy for all five sets of challenges, or when a player attempts to draw a card from the deck, but the deck has run out.&#10;&#10;Theme&#10;Global Crisis::, Earth 2265, the world is on the edge of total annihilation. Natural, social, political, military, and corporate forces have pushed humanity to the brink. The words of a Persian mystic and prisoner who foresaw the future 400 years prior stands truer than ever before...&#10;&#10;&quot;O ye the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye counsel together, and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind, and bettereth the condition thereof . . . Regard the world as the human body which, though at its creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with grave disorders and maladies. Not for one day did it gain ease, nay its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians . . .&quot; &mdash;Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h&#10;&#10;In fits and starts the process of creating global stability has been emerging for eons. Now the world faces it's most dire hour. The super-science of catastrophic weaponry, imbalanced and exploited globalization, and the unlocked potentials of Mother Nature's wrath have all given rise to myriad horrific problems which require a host of powerful solutions.&#10;&#10;Forces of light and dark battle openly in public discourse, secretly behind the closed doors of the powerful elite, and deep within the minds and hearts of all people. Despite those who cling to a world long gone, a consensus has formed among the world's peoples and great leaders: a new world must be made. Led by the charge of reason and fueled by a desperate hope, a rallying cry for peace is heard:&#10;&#10;&quot;The Great Peace towards which people of goodwill throughout the centuries have inclined their hearts, of which seers and poets for countless generations have expressed their vision, and for which from age to age the sacred scriptures of mankind have constantly held the promise, is now at long last within the reach of the nations.&quot;   &mdash;From &quot;The Promise of World Peace&quot; by The Universal House of Justice&#10;&#10;Is it too late to counteract eons of destruction? Can humanity set aside their petty squabbles, age old hatreds, and demagogue-stoked fears in order to bring about what is only dreamed of? And what of suspicions? Is everyone a trusted ally or do some lurk in shadow, attempting to plunge the world into a dark age of fallout and waste?&#10;&#10;You are the rulers and leaders who will settle the fate of the world, for better or worse!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They were designed primarily as bombardment vessels (hence the name bomb ketch), and were deployed against fixed land positions.&#10;&#10;Though the British first employed a bomb vessel in 1347, it was the French who would develop a design (in the late 17th century) closer to those seen in the Age of Sail. The British copied and refined those designs over the next century, which led to two-masted ketches. Further development over the age of sail would result in bomb vessels designed as full-rigged ships (with three masts) &ndash; which allowed them to function as escort sloops between battles.&#10;&#10;A bomb ketch is treated as a small vessel in Black Seas with a mortar mounted on the bow. It functions similarly to a gunboat, but benefits from greater speed and durability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The winner becomes the leader of the Elite Bot Army. The Age of the Human is over, the Age of the Bot begins! Go Droid!&#10;&#10;In Alpha Steel, players control futuristic bots on the planet of Ibun. The goal is to defeat all other bots and remain the last player standing, inside the arena.&#10;&#10;Everyone starts outside the arena with 1 rookie bot, 70,000 Azol (Azol- the currency in the game), 10 energy tokens, and 2 power cards. Each player starts with a rookie bot but can purchase a master bot during the game. On your turn, you will roll both dice.&#10;&#10;From each dice you can: gain energy or 30,000 azol or attack other players&rsquo; bots. If you roll the same on both dice, you get double! For each attack you roll, your bot deals damage to other bots. The amount of damage you cause is written on your bot card. If you&rsquo;re inside the arena, you attack everyone else. But if you&rsquo;re outside the arena, you will only attack whoever is inside.&#10;&#10;At the start, everyone is outside and the first player to roll an attack, enters the arena. All the other bots suffer damage. If you wish to leave the arena, you must wait till someone attacks you. Then, you pay the damage and exit. The player who had attacked you, must enter the arena.&#10;&#10;If you stay in the arena for one whole round, you get 30,000 Azol after your dice roll. When you are inside, you can never gain health.&#10;&#10;Power cards give your bots special strengths. you can play only one power card on your turn and must give it up after use. Some power cards can be played anytime. At no point can you have more than 2 power cards with you. Each power card has cost price and a profit or loss percentage mentioned in them. So, when you sell a card you do so either at a profit or a loss. All power cards sell at 50% loss, while all rookie bots sell at 50% profit. You can buy only one power card or a bot at the end of your turn. But, if you are inside the arena, you can buy a power card or bot anytime. If another player attacks you and you cannot pay Azol, you can sell your power card to get azol, otherwise you are eliminated. If you ever run out of energy tokens, you are eliminated!&#10;&#10;When only two players remain in the game, it is the final duel. Both their bots enter the arena. You cannot buy any power cards or bots. you also cannot get energy or azol from dice.However, you can use the power cards you already have. The duel continues till a player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;A round of play:&#10;Your turn begins by rolling both dice. Then, you can play your power card. Other players cannot play a power card unless it is a play anytime card. Now, resolve the dice roll. remember if you are inside, you attack everyone. if you are outside, you only attack the person inside. Next, you can buy a power card or a bot. the player inside can buy anytime, other players can buy only on their turn. If the player inside wants to exit, they must do it now. If they exit, you must enter the arena. A player cannot exit if you did not roll an attack. Your turn ends.&#10;&#10;Alpha Steel is a strategy based board game that is perfect for all ages. Whether it&rsquo;s game night with friends, weekends with family or to combine the power of learning and play for kids, the board game provides an awesome experience for all. Enjoy as you use your robot&rsquo;s special powers and tactics to vanquish other bots and lead the entire bot army.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

A 63 cm long wooden U-boat is used to store wooden torpedoes and fuel during the game. The deck&rsquo;s gun ammo is represented by wooden shells of different kinds and stored in a 20-round wooden magazine. All game tokens are made of wood and engraved as well. Burnt wood sets you back in time and deep under the surface of the ocean. You can call a wolfpack to support you or dive deep to avoid attacks while risking that the pressure may crack your hull every second.&#10;&#10;You play multiple missions in every chapter and have unique targets each time. Move your ship above a overworld map and choose your path there. Fuel is used to keep on moving or follow your targets and alter the weather and daytime conditions. Support tickets allows you to refill your ammo and fuel or order combat support via radio. If you encounter enemies at the overworld map you start a combat loop which will be ended after you defeated your enemies or managed to escape. After each mission you will update your crew or even buy new technology for your submarine.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Humans have entered the Space Age! As the Commander General of your space fleet, you are in charge of finding and capturing new planets and moons. But, you must use all your powers to defeat the other Galaxy Raiders. Ready?  Time warp...activate!&#10;&#10;In Galaxy Raiders, players are in charge of finding and capturing new planets and moons.&#10;&#10;Place the hexagonal boards in the center. Each hexagonal board has one planet and 4 moons on it. Yhere are two numbers in each half of the planet and one number in every moon.&#10;&#10;All players start with a console mat and eight pegs of one colour. The card deck consists of number cards and power cards. The deck is shuffled and each player gets seven cards. There is a dice with 4 operations &amp; 2 any operation symbols.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll the dice. Using the operation you roll and any two number cards you have, you must capture a number position on the board. Once your cards are played, they are discarded. Pick up an equal amount of cards from the deck. At all times each player must have seven cards with them. Rules for capturing a number position:&#10;&#10;You must capture at least one moon to be able to enter that planet.&#10;If you have captured all the moons, nobody else can enter that planet.&#10;You can enter a planet only after all four moons have been captured - either by you or by others. &#10;You need to capture both halves of the planet to win the planet.&#10;Once you win a planet, give the pegs of that planet back to the respective players and take the planet's hexagonal board and keep it with you.&#10;&#10;The power cards allow you to either evict another player from the moon or planet position or replace them in that position. If you cannot perform an operation, but have a power card then you must play it. You cannot simply skip your turn. But, if you don&rsquo;t have a power card you still discard a card and pick one up from the deck, you then either use your new card or pass your turn.&#10;&#10;The rules of entry, are first, moon then planet and rules of eviction, are first, planet then moon.&#10;&#10;The first player to capture two planets or with the highest points, wins the game. If all number positions are captured then there is a &ldquo;stalemate&rdquo;, then points are counted. the points system is:&#10;&#10;each moon equals 1 point&#10;each half of a planet equals 2 points&#10;total value of a planet equals 8 points&#10;Player with the highest points wins!&#10; Galaxy Raiders is a game of planning, strategy and negotiation. Challenge your friends and family to see who will emerge victorious in this engaging battle of wits. Enjoy with them as they set forth on a galactic conquest to capture planets and moons using your mathematical prowess. For parents with young kids, it's the perfect way to introduce them to an entire learning multiverse. See them transform into problem-solving geniuses right before your eyes! A true interstellar skirmish, perfect for all ages!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known the Russians had so many tanks I would not have attacked!&rdquo; --Adolf Hitler&#10;&#10;A Long, Hard Road: The Battle of Dubno is a moderate complexity level wargame simulation of the first major clash of large armored formations on the East Front.  After launching Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22nd, the First Panzer Group of the German Sixth Army led the offensive into the Ukraine. Critical to the German success in the opening days was taking the main road leading to Kiev and Kharkov, and the bridges spanning the Ikva and Styr rivers. Any delays or setbacks here could have severe repercussions as the other German Army Groups and panzer formations drove deeper along Sixth Army&rsquo;s flanks. Desperate to stop the German blitzkrieg, Joseph Stalin, over the objections of General Zhukov, ordered an immediate counter-attack. The largest tank battle of the war to that date was the result. Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;A complete game of A Long, Hard Road is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch map sections&#10;&bull;    279 double-sided, un-mounted counters.&#10;&bull;    One players&rsquo; aide sheet&#10;&bull;    8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Players will also need one six (D6) and one ten-sided (D10) dice to play the game. Each day turn of the game represents 8 hours of time.  Units are mostly brigades and regiments. Each hex is approximately 1.25 miles across.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

There are other various parts on the board, where you can either lose or gain tolar, or even an extra dice to roll. When another player lands on the same place as you, they cut you, and get all your unsaved Tolar and you go to a pre-mentioned spot on the board. Remember, you never lose your saved Tolar. ever. so, when someone cuts you only give them your unsaved Tolar. if you have saved all your Tolar, you give up nothing!

    "Description": "In the jungle, all the animals are gathering. They demand that all resources be divided rightfully among them. The stronger ones are taking more than the weak. That&rsquo;s wrong! But, who will ensure that peace prevails? The winner of this battle of wits will be the King of the Jungle!&#10;&#10;Fracto is a 3-in-1 card game to learn operations with fractions. It has a set of 80 playing cards. There are 3 kinds of fraction cards - number cards, image cards and word cards.When the sum of two fraction cards is equal to 1, it is called a whole pair. For example:  &#226;&#133;&#147; + &#226;&#133;&#148; = 1 : so, the fractions &#226;&#133;&#147; , &#226;&#133;&#148;  together forms a whole pair. where as &#226;&#133;&#154; + 2/6 = 7/6, so the fraction &#226;&#133;&#154; + 2/6 does not form a whole pair. Remember, here you can make whole pairs using only two fraction cards. The three different gameplay of fracto are: Whole-in-1, Deck of Fortune and Memory Hero. &#10;Let&rsquo;s look at the first gameplay: To play Whole-in-1, shuffle the cards and distribute 8 cards to each player. These are the hand cards. The main deck is placed face down in the centre of the table. Check your hand cards if you can make any whole pairs. if you can, then place the pairs face down on the table in front of you.At any given point in the game, you must have even number of hand cards. Pick the top card from the main deck. place it face up on the table. This is the discard pile. The player on the left of the dealer starts the game and it continues clockwise. On your turn, you can either pick up the top card from the discard pile or the top card from the main deck. Check if you can make a whole pair using the new card. if yes, then place the whole pair, face down, in front of you and discard any card from your hand cards into the discard pile. if you cannot make a pair, then put any of your hand cards into the discard pile. The turn moves to the next player. You must call out &ldquo;fracto&rdquo; whenever you have only 2 hand cards. This is applicable even at the start of the game. if you do not call out &ldquo;fracto&rdquo; and you are caught by another player, you must draw four cards from the main deck. You finish when you have made whole pairs with all your hand cards. There will be one card remaining, which will be discarded into the discard pile. When you have made all the whole pairs, you must show the whole pairs to the other players. If you have  made a wrong whole pair, you need to draw four cards from the main deck. you must also pick up the incorrect pairs and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Let&rsquo;s look at the second gameplay: To play Deck of Fortune, shuffle the cards and distribute equally until all cards are over, amongst all players. All the cards are dealt face down. you are not allowed to see your cards. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game. The game continues clockwise. On your turn, you pick up the top card from your player deck and place it face up on the table. This is the discard pile. You check whether the card placed forms a whole pair with the card below it. if it does, you pick up the entire discard pile and place it below your player deck. if it does not, the game continues and the next player places their card. This continues until a player completely finishes their player deck.&#10;&#10;Let&rsquo;s look at the third gameplay: To play Memory Hero, remove the red cards from the deck. Make a deck of blue and green cards. shuffle the two decks separately. Distribute 7 blue cards to each player. These are the hand cards. you can see your hand cards. Take 16 green cards and arrange them, face down, in a grid of 4 by 4.These are the table cards. The remaining green cards are kept separately as the main deck. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game and the game continues clockwise. On your turn, you will open any one table card, so that everyone can see it. If the table card forms a whole pair with any one of your hand cards then pick up that card, show the pair to everyone and set the pair aside. If you cannot form a whole pair, you keep the card back facing down. the game continues. Once a table card is used you must replace it with another card from the main deck, facing down. You can only combine one hand card with one table card. You can open a table card only on your turn. The game ends when a player completes all their hand cards.&#10;&#10;The perfect educational family entertainer with three engaging games packed in a single set! Fracto provides your kids with a blend of academics, life skills and moral values while they have loads of fun. Your kids will enjoy this fantastic 3-in-1 learning experience with their family and friends.

    "Description": "Discover the world of magic and become the master of spells. Gain special powers to create the powerful potions of the great wizards and witches. Use magical ingredients along with unique spells to cleverly outwit other mages. Your acumen and craft will help you gain victory in this fast paced, dual round tactical game. Leave everyone spellbound with your wizardry and rule the supernatural world!&#10;&#10;In Mystic Arts, players duel to win powerful potions of great wizards and witches. The goal is to be the first player to win two good potions.&#10;&#10;There are 3 types of cards - Ingredient cards, Spell cards. Potion cards. The ingredient cards are of 3 types: length, volume and weight cards. Spell cards are special power cards that can help you win a potion. you can play these for yourself or against an opponent. Some spell cards have the link symbol these cards attach to the ingredient card that is played. The potion cards are of 2 types: good potions and bad potions. Players must win the good potions and avoid the bad potions.&#10;&#10;To setup the game: shuffle the ingredient cards and spell cards, separately, and distribute 8 ingredient cards and 4 spell cards to each player. These are the hand cards. Shuffle the potion cards and keep them face down in the center. Player with the highest dice roll gets the player token and starts the first round. Then the player token will move clockwise after each round is completed.&#10;&#10;In one round of play: Open the topmost potion card. First is the ingredient round. Each player places an ingredient card, face down, in front of them. If it is a good potion, players must play an ingredient card that is closest to any one value on the potion card. If it is a bad potion, players must play an ingredient card that is farthest to any one value on the potion card.&#10;&#10;Remember, you can play only 1 ingredient card and once played you cannot change it. You must play your ingredient card face down. The type of ingredient card you play can be used only for the same type on the potion card. for e.g. value on the length card matches only with the length value on the potion card. You cannot use value of a length card for the value of weight on the potion card. Closest or farthest does not mean it needs to be less than the value, it could be greater also.&#10;&#10;Next, the ingredient cards are opened one at a time, starting with the first player and moving clockwise. Each player must call out the difference between the value of their ingredient card and the corresponding value on the potion card. Next is the spell round. Players will place their spell cards face down in front of them. Playing a spell card is optional. The spell cards are opened one at a time starting with the first player. Each time a spell card is opened perform the action written on it. the turn moves clockwise similar to the ingredient round. After all the spell cards are opened, the ingredient cards in front of each player are compared with their corresponding values on the potion cards. The player with the smallest difference between the ingredient value and the value on the potion card, gets the potion card. This applies to good potions and bad potions. If more than one player has the same difference, then the winner is decided by rolling the dice.&#10;&#10;This ends one round of play and all the played cards are discarded. the player token is passed clockwise to the next player. Open a new potion card. If a player gets a bad potion, they cannot play a spell card in the next round. The first player to win 2 good potions, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Mystic Arts is an amazing game of strategy, decision making and planning all woven together with exceptional twists. Players of all ages will relish this highly engaging and creative game. This is the perfect family entertainer which also helps acquire a plethora of essential life skills and moral values.

Join the fight with this fast-paced card game for 1-2 players!&#10;&#10;Based on the Gridcannon system, Eat the Rich sees players draw a single card each turn before placing it in or around a 9 card grid. If you draw a Noble (Jack, Queen, or King), place it around the perimeter of your grid (or an opponent's, if playing against friends). If you draw a numbered card, an Ace, or a Joker, place that card in one of the 9 spaces on your grid. Choose carefully, because you can only place a card on top of an equal or lesser-value card.&#10;&#10;Line up high-value cards for clever combos and calculated attacks on the nobles, but don't get ahead of yourself. If you draw a card you can't play, you'll lose points. Destroy all twelve nobles to win the game. A simple, intuitive score system allows solitaire or competitive players to track their progress.&#10;&#10;Includes 2 decks of traditional playing cards for classic games. Add a second set and play with up to 4 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You roll a die to move along the track and when you land on a green Bhengel and a grey Timber space you respectively add a tree to the forest or remove it. There are also spaces with a green/yellow dot that give you an item or word card respectively but only if there still trees in the forest. Then there are assignment spaces with a red dot (that tell you to go move ahead, move back, lose a turn, make everyone go to your space, take the long road through the forest etc.). When you land on a double-arrow space, you can decide which direction to move in and certain activity spaces also let you pick the direction. Apart from those little decisions, the game is all luck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Miniatures wargame rules for 16-17th century musket and pike combat. Published as an article in issue number one of FGU's magazine, Wargaming.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;The basic intent of these rules is to provide a fast moving and exceedingly playable game which can be fought to a definitive conclusion in slightly over an hour, including set up time . . . To achieve playability, the game and rules are simplified. The concepts are strategic, rather than tactical. For example, in the case of light infantry, no differentiation is made between types of missile weapons . . . In the same way, heavy infantry are simply heavy infantry, regardless of whether they are pikemen or halberdiers. A unit is representational rather than scaled.&#10;&#10;The first  great simplification is the use of the gridded square. We submit that its accuracy is every bit as good or better than haphazard inch-measured movement as usually used in other games . . . With a diagonal move counting 1 1/2, sufficient differentiation for different type troops is allowed. Movement of all troops can be made very quickly.&#10;&#10;The second great simplification is the use of an actual firing artillery piece . . . After movement has been made, the scale gun is replaced by a firing gun, &quot;to the rear, relative to the target&quot; and an actual missile is fired. Where the point of the missile lands is the basis for a one inch radius compass measurement; any troops within this radius are destroyed. This actual firing introduces many historically correct variables. A miss can occur at point blank range; a wild ricochet can destroy the firer's own troops or bounce into a seemingly safe position . . .&#10;&#10;There is an advantage to not using a rigid scale, such as 1/20 . . . We decided one economy sized regiments. As detailed in the section on organization, not one of the regiments has over 12 [miniature figure] men, and a good sized division contains only about 150 figures.&#10;&#10;The basic playing unit is the stand, with several stands per regiment . . . the exact stand size is immaterial, as long as both players use the same frontages.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rules&#10;&#10;",
