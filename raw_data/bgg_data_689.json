    "Description": "This is an abstract strategy game for two to four players based on a checkers theme. A spinner is employed for movement. Moves are made in a straight line, forward, backward or sideways, but not diagonally. The point of the spinner corresponding in color to the player's knights indicates the number of moves the player may make.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get as many knights as possible into any of the other players' castles, and also to score by capturing the opponents' knights. A capture may be made by a player spinning a number that will land his knight directly in a space occupied by an opponent's knight when not on the gold field or in a castle. Knights may be passed or jumped at any time but they are safe from capture on the gold field or in a castle.&#10;&#10;The winner is determined by the score of points. For each knight captured the player scores five points. For each knight moved to opponent's castle the player scores 15 points. The game can be played to conclusion, even though one or two players may be eliminated.&#10;&#10;",

If they grab all seven before the active player rescues a member of the royal family, that player's turn ends immediately.&#10;&#10;Whoever rescues the most members of the royal family wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Age of Dinosaurs is an interactive strategy board game.&#10;&#10;Theme: Players migrate populations of twelve dinosaur species across varying habitats in a quest to find food and avoid being eaten. Just as in a real ecosystem, each different species occupies its own niche, with different food requirements, fighting ability, speed, and favored habitats. The arrangement of the various habitats changes from game to game. To play the game well, a player must determine which combination of species will be most advantageous on a given board, and place their dinosaurs in locations where they will be able to find food and mates and avoid being eaten.&#10;&#10;Game-play: Play is organized into rounds. Each round consists of the players' turns and an End Phase in which the board is adjusted to prepare for the next round. Each player begins with 10 points of dinosaurs on the board, and increases this point total in two ways: (1) by successfully breeding dinosaurs to produce eggs, which hatch into new dinosaurs at the end of the round; (2) by introducing a new species during the End Phase.&#10;During a turn, a player rolls dice to determine the locations of new plant growth on the board, migrates dinosaurs to new locations, and attempts to feed and breed dinosaurs.  For predators, feeding involves hunting other dinosaurs.  Other players become involved with the current player's turn when their dinosaurs are hunted, and they must choose to fight or flee, and when they choose to play a card that impacts the current player's actions.&#10;During the End Phase, fresh kills become rotten carcasses, rotten carcasses rot away entirely, hungry dinosaurs starve, eggs hatch, and players have an opportunity to choose one of four improvements for the following round (various combinations of new dinosaurs, eggs, and cards).&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends when at least one player has reached 40 points at the end of a round.  The player with the highest point total at that time wins.&#10;&#10;",

Part of the challenge comes from being presented with two separate concepts drawn from separate card decks &ndash; for example, a liquid creature and a fad that appeals to kids &ndash; and figuring out how to merge these concepts creatively into a single creation.&#10;&#10;Each player takes one role card and reveals it to indicate his role for the game. The assistant director distributes pens and creation sheets to players.&#10;&#10;In each round, the director randomly selects one Cryptids card, such as &quot;vehicle creature&quot;, then everybody must draw a creature representing this category within one minute. The assistant director redistributes the drawings among players (with players not being allowed to look at them), then the director randomly selects one Show card, such as &quot;The creature is able to communicate and converse with humans! What is the secret behind it?&quot; Each player then makes his presentation using the caption and drawing in hand.&#10;&#10;Players then vote on the winning presentation by simultaneously pointing to the show they thought best, with the director breaking ties. The winner is selected to air on prime time, with the player who drew the cryptid receiving the prime time tile, and its reporter receiving the prime time host tile. Everyone gives them a round of applause.&#10;&#10;Play four rounds total with 3-6 players, and only three rounds with seven or more players. End the game by kibitzing over the suggestions that were botched and didn't merit air time.&#10;&#10;Can be combined with the material in the sequel CryptidsTV 2.&#10;&#10;",

This game has been entered in the 2nd NESTORTILES game design contest.&#10;&#10;Players are architects who construct buildings over three rounds. The player who lays out the best plan and builds the most appealing structure to the proper height at the right time will win.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players either draw a new tile, exchange two of their tiles for two new tiles or play a tile from their hand to their board.  Tiles must be placed adjacent to another tile already on the board; a tile placed on top of another tile must be a higher number; a tile cannot be the same color or number as the tile immediate beneath it or any adjacent tile.&#10;&#10;Round 1 ends when one player has 6 tiles on their board, round 2 ends with 10 tiles and round 3 ends with 14 tiles.  After every round, points are scored according to the number of dots visible on a player's board, points are lost for tiles still in hand and bonus points are added for tiles at the level of the round that just ended.  For example, at the end of round 1 players earn 1 point per tile at level 1.  The bonuses have the potential to score much higher after rounds 2 and 3.  At the end of the game, players earn a bonus by squaring the highest level on which they have a tile (e.g. having a tile at level 5 earns a bonus of 25 points).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "THE WARS OF THE ROSES are ON!&#10;Between 1450 and 1490 direct usurpation was the rule rather than the exception. Around a half dozen men claimed the crown of England-Henry Holland, Richard of York, Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck failed. Edward Earl of March, Richard Duke of Gloucester and Henry Tudor succeeded. Henry of Lancaster possessed it twice, while his son was dispossessed once.&#10;&#10;It is my opinion that this is one of our best campaign games. We managed to work in all kinds of period flavour while making the game easy and playable, in a system that brings a historical result. The decisions are agonizing, but play moves very quickly, and with most scenarios only a few turns long, you could easily get two into one game night!&#10;&#10;Most scenarios begin with few troops in play- a faction must use their nobles in the ancestral lands to gather Well-Wishers, Retainers and Array troops and lead them into battle. Spend too much time recruiting and you'll find your side already beaten leaving you nothing for it but to abandon your troops and flight to the Continent! You have to act quickly and often risk the game on one move that will make or break your claimant's chance at the throne...&#10;&#10;Above Description from game's web site&#10;&#10;The game is played after choosing a scenario depicting one campaign during the wars. Typical victory conditions include clearing a geographic area or capturing/killing specified enemy personalities. To that end players maneuver their nobles on an area map of England seeking to raise troops and then confront their opponent. A robust battle system is included, but battles may also be played out using the related &quot;A Coat of Steel&quot; miniatures rules if the players prefer.&#10;&#10;",

It's triangular (about 6.5 inches on a side) and is about 2.5 inches thick. On the middle of the right side is a long zipper that opens the bag. It comes in two flavors, tan with brown text and pink with purple text.&#10;&#10;The bag has a special rule for use in Munchkin games: &quot;When you take a Munchkin d6 out of the Munchkin Dice Bag and roll it, the Munchkin head counts as a 7, not a 1.&quot; This is referring to the special Munchkin d6s that come with Munchkin core sets, and which have a Munchkin Man head in place of the single pip for the &quot;1&quot;. (These dice can also be purchased separately.) So while you can use the Munchkin Dice Bag to store a large number of dice, the special rule only applies to the d6s with the Munchkin head.&#10;&#10;In addition to the special rule, the tan dice bag comes with two Munchkin cards. See the board game version for details.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;",

Dice are rolled to see if he is listening.  If he is not listening you roll to see what direction he is going to run.  Then dice are rolled to see how far your Dunger runs that turn.  Running into walls and boulders knocks your Dunger out but knocks some sense into them letting you control their movement better when they wake up.   Running into another players's Dunger results in a fight with the winner getting to decide the direction the loser's Dunger runs for his next turn.&#10;&#10;Dunger Derby the Board Game has easy to learn rules is meant to be played in 45 minutes or less for a great family game night.

The objective is simple, crash all the others cars out of the race. The last car running is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hex board divided into 10 zones. The player manages a hand of 7 cards to drive more aggressively or defensively. On a player's turn, the player first plays driving cards and moves through zones to build momentum. Then, if they end their turn adjacent to an opponent's car they make a hit. The player decides how much momentum to put towards the hit and can then add hit bonus cards. The opponent can then respond with defensive cards and hit bonus cards as well. Damage is then recorded on a player car card. Each player's car damage is hidden by a player screen but visual clues (damage) are placed on the physical car, other player can only see which sections have taken damage but not the amount. The derby cars are wooden game pieces where the 4 corner pieces(driver front, driver rear, passenger front and passenger rear) can be removed and replaced with corresponding damaged piece.&#10;&#10;",

The player then pushes the giraffe from one tree to another. If no blocks fall, the player receives a foliage card as a reward; if one or more blocks fall, the player gets no reward and the blocks are returned to the pool.

    "Description": "You are the Boss of a small tribe of Neanderthals.  But you won't stay Boss for long if you can't prove your superiority over the other tribes.  To prove your might, you must command your tribe to hunt, gather, or steal as many stones as possible.  When the stones are all gone, the Boss with the most stones will be universally feared and respected. Stones give much power.&#10;&#10;SIMPLETONS is a quick playing multiplayer card game that takes less than 5 minutes to learn, so you can jump right in and steal your neighbors stones!&#10;&#10;In a game of SIMPLETONS, each player has a similar hand of cards, each displaying a single action. Every round, each player selects one card from their hand and plays it face down on the table. Once all players have selected their action, they flip their cards up and resolve them. Players continue to play rounds until all of the stones in the supply are gone.&#10;&#10;Card selections include HUNT and GATHER - which allow you to take varying amounts of stones from the supply. Each deck also includes a RAID card for each opponent - which allows you to take half of their stones. Beware though, because every player has a DEFEND card, that will block opponents' HUNT cards - effectively causing them to skip their turn.&#10;&#10;SIMPLETONS plays quickly, regardless if you play it with 3 or 8 players - and features fun caveman cartoons.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are an inventor and engineer in a small rural town. When news comes of a wave of zombies sweeping over the region, you immediately turn to a way to stop them. By creating the Zombie Attack Prevention and Extermination Machine (which, with your characteristic acumen for catchy names, becomes the ZAP &lsquo;EM), you have enabled your town to weather even the most severe zombie invasion. Unfortunately, the ZAP&rsquo;EM is rather expensive to run, and after building it you are pretty short on cash. You decide to turn your ingenuity into a money-making scheme. By renting out your zombie-slaying capabilities, you can become one of the richest and most respected people in town. That is, assuming you can kill all these zombies in the first place...&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game you will place tiles representing homes, buildings, and terrain features-and, of course, zombies. As the zombies spawn and move around the board terrorizing (and killing) the inhabitants, you must chase them down and ZAP 'EM! If you are lucky, you may even earn some cash! Win the game by killing every zombie in town. You can also keep track of your high score (the amount of cash you have at the end of the game.) Other options include varying difficulty levels and a campaign system that allows you to string multiple games together.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Prepotent, players breed, bet on, and race horses. Designed by Tom Russell, Prepotent blends the short term tactical thinking found in its streamlined racing mechanisms with the long term strategy of horse breeding. Additional intrigue is found in the betting mechanisms: Do you want your horse to strive for only second place so the opponents lose their bets?&#10;&#10;In game terms, each player has two horses: one stallion and one mare. When players breed horses, they breed their mare to other players' stallions, and each player can set a stud fee for how much this costs. Players must decide if they want to breed a new stallion or new mare; with a new mare, desirable traits will last longer, but with a superior stallion, races are more likely to be won in the immediate future.&#10;&#10;Players can bet on each horse to win, place, or show. Money is made both by successful bets and by the player's own horse placing well in races. In addition, the older a player's horse is, the slower it becomes, but the more money it makes if it places well in races.&#10;&#10;Each horse has a set of traits, and when a new horse is bred, the most desirable traits are what players strive for.  Parent horses that are genetically compatible can offer gene traits superior to unmatched mates.  Each of these traits represents an action the horse is required to take during the course of the race.  Each race is four rounds long, and each horse has four traits, so each horse will use every one of its traits, helpful or hindering.&#10;&#10;Players acquire money by setting stud fees that other players must pay to breed with their stallions, winning bets on races, and having their own horse place well in races.  The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pox: Save the People is a new board game challenging 1-4 players to stop the spread of a deadly disease. Not only is the game fun, but through play, players understand group immunity and the need to vaccinate. Players ages 7-65, and both casual and hardcore gamers have enjoyed POX.&#10;&#10;Players cooperate to vaccinate and cure people on the board until the disease is fully contained, before the number of deaths exceeds acceptable losses or the disease becomes out of control. The players win or lose together. Players alternate drawing cards. Each card specifies how the disease spreads, and then which public health resources the player has available for allocation. It's important to protect the vulnerable people on the board, because if they become infected, they immediately die. But watch out! Don't neglect the infected people because they can die too if the infection gets too bad!&#10;&#10;Many public health groups need to better promote immunizations in order to continue to prevent vaccine preventable diseases. Vaccinations against deadly diseases such as diphtheria, polio, and whooping cough were standard public health measures, and they worked: kids today don&rsquo;t worry about getting polio, for example. But due to suspicions about vaccines and links to other diseases, more parents are refusing to immunize their children, and this could lead to a national health crisis. Parents mistakenly believe that vaccines aren&rsquo;t necessary any more, or that children develop immunity to these diseases automatically through time. These myths lead to disaster. Whooping cough is back, for example, for the U.S. has lost what is called herd immunity to this disease as the percent of vaccinated people is lowering, allowing ways for contagion to spread among the populace.&#10;&#10;Between POX's unique packaging and gameplay, what's stopping YOU from saving the people?!&#10;&#10;",

In game terms, every 6 you roll allows you to add another die to your roll. To balance the luck sometimes inherent to dice games, players have control chips that allow them to reroll dice, add additional dice, switch positions between cars, and even control other players' cars.&#10;&#10;With the track deck, players can construct traditional pre-configured tracks or race along a &quot;mystery rally&quot; route.&#10;&#10;",

The Challenges have varied requirements; some require an exact number, and some allow an answer from within a range of numbers, while still others demand an answer that is even or odd.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the player rolls dice, some with numbers and some with math operators (+ or -).  Players must use all the dice in any order, so long as the number dice are separated by operator dice.  If no solution is found, they may reroll some or all of their dice.&#10;&#10;On numbered spaces, the Challenge must be solved in a number of attempts less than or equal to the number shown on the space.  Some spaces picture a potato and are a &quot;Hot Potato&quot; zone, where any player may win.  All players compete at the same time to see who can solve the Challenge first.&#10;&#10;When someone wins a Challenge they roll a Number Die, move that many spaces, then take another turn.  This continues as long as they are able to solve the Challenge, and passes clockwise when they can't.&#10;&#10;When a player passes the Ketchup Packet marker, anyone who is behind gets to slide forward to the closest &quot;Catch Up&quot; space.

With new unit types, a rulebook with four new scenarios, new cards, new commanders, and even more, this expansion will bring greater variety to your Battles of Westeros experience and awesome power to your House&rsquo;s cause!&#10;&#10;Ally yourself with three new commanders, sworn to protect the smallfolk against all who would harm them: Lord Beric Dondarrion, Anguy &quot;the Archer&quot;, and Thoros of Myr. Dubbed the &quot;Lightning Lord&quot;, Beric's sigil is a forked lightning bolt, and his weapon a flaming sword. Swift in battle, he is a leader who will stand against any enemy. Anguy is an archer with a reputation across Westeros for devastating accuracy and can avoid capture by using his surroundings to his advantage. The red priest of R'hllor, Thoros of Myr, is a formidable warrior but his greatest strength is in his ability to assist his fallen Brotherhood members...&#10;&#10;The Brotherhood units continue the Battles of Westeros trend of representing ally forces with tan-colored miniatures. However, unlike all other Battles of Westeros sets, Brotherhood Without Banners does not include any banner or pole components, as these outlaw warriors neither answer to a liege lord nor ride under any flag. These units do not follow normal activation rules and are controlled through a new mechanism: Brotherhood tokens.&#10;&#10;This expansion also features new thematic keywords, such as Call to Arms and Scrapper. Call to Arms represents the Brotherhood's ability to incite the local peasantry to take up arms and join them on the battlefield. Scrapper is attributed to units who are stubborn and hardy fighters, aggressive even when defending.&#10;&#10;",

Chess Dungeon applies the orthodox game language of Chess to an emergent playing space.

Each card may serve as either tiles of the &quot;board&quot; (&quot;Land&quot;), or be tabled (&quot;Declared&quot;) to place the Chess pieces upon a Land card.  Two cards are played per turn until players' cards run out.  In this way players determine the size of the game (thus its approximate duration) by agreeing to how many cards may be played in a game.  Players may also agree to different piece limitations and so forth.  The aims are: be the last player alive (not checkmated), avoid stalemate, and win cards from other players in order to gain points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introduction&#10;&#10;You are the Bretwalda, rulers of Anglo Saxon England. It is 400AD and Britain is on the brink of a power vacuum as Rome looks to leave these shores and defend her empire closer to home. Foreign invaders, like the Picts, Scots, Vikings and Saxons, will take advantage and claim this land for their own. Romano-British rule is coming to and end and we are at the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era. You must defend the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy from these foreign invaders and quash the rebellious Britons. But history is written and there is an ever looming threat. In 1066, William Duke of Normandy became king of all England and ended the Anglo-Saxon era once and for all. Can you make this land your own before the Norman invasion?&#10;&#10;Seofan, the Anglo-Saxons board game, is a game for 1 to 4 players. You progress through the game from 400AD to 1066AD. Your Bretwalda will travel the seven kingdoms of England along roads like the great Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street, seeking to control towns by building forts (to exercise your military might), monasteries (to convert the pagan settlers), mints (a source of wealth), and burhs (Anglo-Saxon settlements of power). You will use warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders to settle and defend the kingdoms, and resource cards to fund your settlement, your armies, your church and your economy. Each turn your Bretwalda can take actions to travel the seven kingdoms, to enact great battles, to convert pagan settlers, to trade, and to build your realm.&#10;&#10;Game events will be throwing unexpected surprises at you as you proceed through each decade, like the legend of Arthur, the writings of the Venerable Bede, the Viking invasions, the revolutionary laws of Aethelberht, Offa and Ine, or the glorious coronation of King Alfred the Great. These events may be your saviour, or they may signal your downfall. All the while, rebellious uprisings can cause the level of civil unrest to rise. Can you conquer and control the seven kingdoms before the level of civil unrest explodes, and rewrite history by building a permanent Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman invasion of 1066?&#10;&#10;Overview of Gameplay&#10;&#10;The game can be played solo or co-operatively, with 1 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;The game board shows a map of the seven kingdoms of England (Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Sussex, Kent and Wessex), and the towns of those kingdoms in which you will settle, battle, trade and rule. These towns are linked by roads along which the players (and invaders!) can travel.&#10;&#10;Each game turn is broken into distinct phases. In the Draw phase you draw resource cards from a resource deck into your hand. In the Actions phase each player has 4 actions which they can use in a variety of ways: they can spend resource cards to place red, green, yellow and blue blocks (representing warriors, farmers, missionaries and traders) across the towns of the seven kingdoms; they can build mints, forts, monasteries and burhs; they can travel the map from town to town, repelling invaders and rebels (represented by black blocks); they can trade or crusade or appease local unrest, and progress through the game by adding a decade to the game calendar. During the Conflict phase you resolve battles between your warriors and the pagans. During the Rebellion phase you draw cards from a rebellion deck, which determines in which towns the locals are rebelling against your rule (and more black blocks appear). Finally, in the Progress phase, you can advance the game time through the seven eras from 400AD to 1066AD, and an event card is drawn to re-enact real events from history on the game board. You can choose to progress more slowly, giving you more time to build and settle and defend the realm, but when you do the level of civil unrest will rise too. As you progress through the game you progress through time, and real events from history will throw up surprises - some good (like a great coronation feast), and some bad (like a mutinous group of mercenaries).&#10;&#10;To win the game you must control all seven kingdoms. To control a kingdom you must repel, defeat, convert or settle all black blocks in the kingdom and build one of each type of special building (fort, monastery, mint, and burh). This allows you to place a celtic cross in the kingdom and cement your rule. The special buildings can only be built by settling your warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders in the towns on the game board. You must do all this before the level of civil unrest rises (through out of control rebellions and invasions) and before the Norman invasion of 1066.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Where's Tinker Bell is not a traditional board game in many ways, although there are certain elements like turn taking which are the same. The game comprises of a revolving green plastic base which looks a little bit like a small green hill. On the top of the hill you place a small plastic model of Peter Pan. He doesn't serve any purpose in the game at all, but the girls quite like him! There are eight plastic bluebell cups which are placed over eight holes on the revolving board. Under one of these is placed a small Tinker Bell fairy and the aim of the game is to discover exactly where she is! You might think this all depends on guess work but it does not because Tinker Bell makes a 'tinkle bell' sound when she moves.&#10;&#10;So how does the game work? After you have put all the above pieces in place, each player then receive a number of playing cards. These have pictures of Peter Pan, Wendy, John and Michael, and depending which cards you have determines whether you can spin the revolving board or not! It does not tell you who should go first in the instructions but we normally say it is the youngest player. So if that player has the appropriate card, they can trade it in for a spin of the board. And this is what happens...&#10;&#10;Firstly they have to be quite careful because if the board is spun too heavily all the bluebells will go flying. If you spin it too gently Tinker Bell will not make a sound. Therefore, the key to success in this game is getting your spin just right! If you do, the board should spin round and you should hear some tinkling music which hopefully should lead you to working out which bluebell Tinker Bell is hiding under! Now this is actually easier said than done! As an adult with probably better levels of concentration than my daughters, I find it quite difficult. You really need to have total quiet and place your ear as close to the board as you can! Then it is possible to get a good idea where she is although I still think it comes doen to a certain amount of luck!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overview&#10;A solitaire print-and-play siege/defense game. Using just a standard deck of playing cards and a record sheet, the player defends a city against a stream of attackers, trying to hold out until the deck is exhausted, at which time a score may be figured based on how well the city survived.&#10;&#10;Originally created on a business flight because I wish I had something I could play on a tiny airplane tray and all I had was a deck of cards and a notebook, it has been playtested and developed further as a submission for the Solitaire Print and Play Contest in July 2011.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;The record sheet divides a city into four sections, each with defenders, walls and city ratings. Each turn, the player will use hand cards to generate reinforcements, repairs, defensive sorties and other special actions based on the rank and suit of the cards he has. Afterward, the enemy troops appear based on card draws where each suit corresponds to a quadrant of the city and the rank indicates strength. However, each suit of enemy has an ability or advantage that makes them a little different from each other when attacking or appearing. The attack process is straightforward and occurs automatically each round after both the player and the enemy have played their cards.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game the player may make more informed decisions about how to spend his cards based on which cards he's already seen come out of the deck, but luck (good and bad) is still present in which cards he gets in hand to spend and where and in what order the enemies arrive. Many cards can be spent in more than one way by the player, so there is a degree of hand management as well.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to play with a standard deck of cards and a record sheet, making this a very portable, small-footprint game. I've played it holding the whole deck in one hand and simply placing the discards face-up at the bottom of the deck, while making my notes and tracking information on the record sheet.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns playing cards and casting votes attempting to be the first to reach the stated goal conditions.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players draw a card, and then play a card.  Certain cards require a vote.  Each player starts with one vote, but may acquire more through some cards.  If a vote passes, the card is played.  If it fails, the card is discarded.  Either way, the player's turn is considered to be over.&#10;&#10;The victory conditions fluctuate, ala Fluxx, with goal cards being played by the players on their turn.  The first player to match the current goal condition wins the game.&#10;&#10;Mostly a joke game, this game satirizes politics with cards such as &quot;Everybody Wins - Current game ends with everyone winning&quot; and &quot;Communism - All players play with their hands face up on the table. Anyone may play cards from anyone elses hand.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
