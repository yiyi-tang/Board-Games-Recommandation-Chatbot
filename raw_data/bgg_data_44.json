    "Description": "Translated from the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Deep below the world of wasteful humans lies another yet uncharted world, oblivious of the ado of surface dwellers. Only the most courageous creatures from the world above will descend to the mysteries of the underground and board one of the legendary sewer frigates to challenge destiny and to amass immeasurable treasures.&#10;&#10;In Sewer Pirats, deep underground in a maze of domed caverns, narrow tunnels, and piped passages, a motley cast of rodents, insects, and other vermin sail the treacherous waters of human refuse aboard bizarre vessels in search of discarded booty. In order to claim the best haul from the abandoned flotsam, players must make careful use of the unique abilities of their crews' rats, cockroaches, weasels, and other critters. Don't settle for less than left-over fast food and dumped toys. Go for your goal to become a true legend among the sewer pirates.&#10;&#10;Players compete in deception and tactics to fill the best positions aboard the three pirate frigates. A pirate's rank determines his share of the expected loot &ndash; but even the best crew ain't worth nothing without their talismans. Each of the three frigates has its special fetish, and no pirate would dare to board her without the matching talisman for fear of terrific calamities.&#10;&#10;Sewer Pirats includes three levels of difficulty as well as thirty detailed pirate figures, twenty Color-Click&trade; bases, and a rich assortment of game boards, tokens, and cards. Starter rules get you into the game quickly, and a Crew Member Auction variant increases the strategic depth and lighthearted action.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you roll six dice (three white and three black); two dice (one white and one black) form an action. Every roll you must pick exactly two dice to take out (any colour). In the end you combine the six dice any way you want, no matter in which order you chose to take them out of your rolls beforehand. You can use only two actions on your turn. On your development sheet you enter the actions chosen for this turn and note your points. You can also decide to &quot;expand your lab&quot; which will give you bonus actions or points. Other players may pick any action combination from your dice roll to add to their sheet. Do not forget to fight Octopodes. The game ends when each player has 6 turns. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players set up the two different starter armies consisting of seven holy warriors, seven power-harvesting pawns and two power-harvesting uber-pawns. Fourteen warriors came with the starters, fifteen from the first expansion, and fifteen from the final expansion. Instead of the initial fourteen warriors, players may chose to draft seven (per side) of these 44 warriors which are summoned onto the board one-at-a-time during play. They can be promoted to more powerful chess/shogi style movement using power crystals. Many of these warriors have special magic powers (e.g., teleportation, resurrection, obliteration) which can be turned on by spending crystals.&#10;One of the most exciting things about this chess/shogi variant is that there are multiple ways to win: &#10;&bull; Creating a mating solution that forces surrender - Capturing the Navia (She's like the chess/shogi king)&#10;&bull; Getting one's own Navia across and off the other side of the board &#10;&bull; Economic victory by attaining enough power-crystals for your Navia to blast your opponent off the board.&#10;&#10;",

Within a few weeks, the Admiral Graf Spee sinks nine freight ships and sends almost 50,000 gross register tons to the seabed.

In order to protect their freighters in the best possible way, the Admiralty had no choice but to reinforce the English fleet in the South Atlantic by sending three cruisers in what is known as &quot;The Battle of River Plate&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Hunt is an asymmetric duel in which one player assumes the leadership of the British Royal Navy, while the other player represents the German Kriegsmarine. Each player has their own deck of cards. In order for the German side to win, it must stay hidden from the British while sinking five cargo ships. The British player must hunt down and fight the Admiral Graf Spee in a final naval battle, in which case the side that ends up with less damage wins.&#10;&#10;Will the Royal Navy be able to take advantage of its numerical superiority, or will the Kriegsmarine be the ones who with their cunning and refined strategy manage to overthrow their rival?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

With each turn, players must draw an Ideology Card and take stands on divisive and urgent political issues. These choices will help them gather resources to influence voters or purchase strategic powers. Players can build diverse Ideologies with every policy decision, to best reflect their beliefs and play style. As they progress in the game, players must choose between sticking to their ideals or molding them as per their needs. In a game of trading, coercion, and strategy, players must do whatever it takes to survive and dominate.&#10;&#10;The map is split into 9 zones with each zone having a different voter-count required to form a majority. The player with the highest majority votes - when all majorities are formed - wins the game. To influence voters, players will need unique combinations of the four resources at their disposal - (campaign) Funds, Media (attention), (public) Trust and (street) Clout. At the beginning of their turn, each player must answer an Ideology Card. Every answer on an Ideology Card belongs to one Ideologue. There are four Ideologues in the game - The Capitalist, The Showstopper, The Supremo, and The Idealist. As players collect more cards belonging to one Ideologue, they will unlock new powers that can help them cement their own positions or destabilize opponents.&#10;&#10;Players must constantly juggle with the trade-off of giving answers that grant them the resources they need in that moment or investing in long term strategy with answers that strengthen their Ideologies to unlock greater combos later in the game.&#10;&#10;Players must also navigate the effects of Headlines (triggered by placing Vters in volatile zones) and Conspiracy Cards (which can be purchased at any time in the game), providing them with a wide toolset to seize power or throw a spanner in the works of a rival.&#10;&#10;Placing you in the shoes of a politician, the gameplay is often aggressive, action-packed and laden with long-term strategy building.&#10;&#10;",

Heroes have to battle it out against a team of villains played by either a villain player (in the 4vs1 mode) or an AI-controlled villain (in the co-operative mode). Depending on the game mode chosen, missions generally take between 30-120 minutes.&#10;&#10;Change Is Constant is volume one in IDW's series of &quot;Adventures&quot;-branded miniatures games. Both it and volume two (City Fall) are standalone games, while also being compatible with one another. Change Is Constant follows the first two story arcs of IDW's TMNT comic universe series, while City Fall focuses on the story of one turtle's unexpected recruitment into the Foot Clan.&#10;&#10;Each standalone box contains five unique heroes and a variety of villains associated with each story, with more than forty miniatures total.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This entry is for the original Jenseits von Theben; for the new printing by Queen, go to Thebes.&#10;&#10;Jenseits von Theben is a game of competitive archeology.  Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Periodically, there are expositions at major European cities, and the archaeologist who shows up on time with the best collection of artifacts (plus a minor die roll) wins the purse.  The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and presents the biggest collection to the European exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact cards.  The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;.  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.&#10;&#10;The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Thebes&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There's live jazz everywhere you go, and NOLA is world-famous for its street performers. Make sure you don't miss the spontaneous wedding parades, known locally as &quot;second lines&quot;, that roll through the streets!&#10;&#10;Play it safe or go wild &mdash; it's your choice. As you navigate the city, your map will serve as both a guidebook and a memento of your trip. Reunite with your friends at the end of the night to compare notes and swap stories.&#10;&#10;In French Quarter, you choose dice from the card row to take actions and travel via different methods of transportation with varying distances: walking, carriage ride, taxi, streetcar, riverboat, or just hanging out to socialize.&#10;&#10;As you travel around the city, you get to visit buildings and see performers where you stop. All these activities slowly fill up tracks that chart your experiences with food, culture, shopping, mysticism, and partying. You have to make tough choices between in-game bonuses and score multipliers! After eight hours of gallivanting about town, players compare their end results to see who had the most memorable night in NOLA.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It has been posted on Consim that because Tunisia had a long run, that the later copies may have a newer version of the of the generic OCS countersheet.&#10;&#10;The original game had four countersheets. The inventory listed in the game specific rule book has the following. Two sheets numbered 1 and 2. These have the unit counters for the various sides depicted in the game. Countersheet 3 has 80 generic OCS makers. Sheet 4 is listed as having 140 counters and has more generic OCS counters.&#10;&#10;From the discussion on Consim it seem that it is possible some copies had the &quot;Countersheet 4&quot; replaced with a sheet labeled &quot;Countersheet OCS Markers&quot;. So be aware that it is possible that there are two different counter mixes for this game. One with the newer version of the generic OCS counters (with 280 counters.)  and the original &quot;Countersheet 4&quot; with a 140 countersheet.

Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game (with optional rules for four-player tag-team play) based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or &quot;Lucha Libre&quot; (a.k.a. free fighting). Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a &quot;count of three&quot; to win by a pin.&#10;&#10;The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice.&#10;Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die.&#10;&#10;Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. &#10;The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc.  Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit.&#10;If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent.&#10;&#10;Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the 'three count' begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match.&#10;&#10;In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Comet is characterized by fast gameplay despite high variability and strategic depth. In the prehistoric past, you try to save extinct and endangered species from their final extinction. So you do nothing less than change the course of history! You can cleverly combine card skills to save the animals from the threatening comet.&#10;&#10;The basic techniques and rules of the game are quickly learned. However, this does not mean that Comet is quickly mastered! Each game presents a new challenge as you must cleverly adapt to your opponent's actions in order to win.&#10;&#10;1. You can make animals hatch to use their card abilities after you have moved them to the safe cavern. Saved animals will score rescue points in different ways at the end of the game. However, you also need other animal cards to move your saviors around the board (and thus move your animals to safety). Be careful how you use your cards!&#10;&#10;2. Different types of cards deepen the strategic choices. Skillfully use the ability of your asymmetrical hero cards and optimize the possibilities of the silver and golden animal cards. When the pile of silver cards is used up, the comet phase begins and initiates the end of the game.&#10;&#10;3. Even the movements on the game board want to be well planned. Opposing saviors can be jumped over to reach the save cavern faster - this can be good for you or your fellow players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A war game that fits in the pocket!&#10;&#10;When pressed for time and table space and the hankering for battle hits, this is the perfect remedy - and it is portable!&#10;&#10;Tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army: just determine the size of the battle and create your own army from a pool of existing troops.&#10;&#10;Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.&#10;&#10;Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.&#10;&#10;Celts vs. Romans is the first in the Ancients line and also the first in the Pocket Battle series. Each Pocket Battles game will feature two armies from a particular era or genre (yes, fantasy and sci-fi, we are looking at you).&#10;&#10;The basic rules of the game are fairly simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).&#10;&#10;On you turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one existing token on your unit, it would cost you two additional tokens to activate; if you had three tokens on the unit, it would cost you four additional tokens, and so on).&#10;&#10;After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.&#10;&#10;The battle is over when one army defeats the other.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;60 tiles, 6 dice, 20 wound/order tokens, 2 player aids, 1 set of rules.&#10;&#10;Romans: 1 aquilifer, 5 archers, 4 auxiliares, 1 ballista, 3 cataphracts, 3 cavalry, 1 centurion, 1 imaginifer, 1 imperator, 5 legionaries, 1 onager, 3 praetorians and 1 scorpio.&#10;&#10;Celts: 1 champion, 1 chariot, 1 druid, 2 gaesatae, 1 hero, 3 horsemen, 4 javelinmen, 3 noblemen, 3 noble cavalry, 4 slingers, 5 warband, 1 warchief and 1 warrior queen.&#10;&#10;",

Focusing only on increasing your popularity won't earn you any money, yet failing to spread your name won't make the rich or helpful guests come your way. &#10;It's a matter of deciding which characters (cards) will help you increase your popularity and which character cards you want to attract as guests. &#10;Once a player runs out of cards, the round is over, and all cards remaining in your hand become minus points, thus depleting your hand of cards quickly is important. Only the one who has attracted the richest guests (earned the most money) after three festival nights (rounds) will be the one who deserves to carry the title of &quot;Mai-Star&quot;.&#10;&#10;This game's setting is same as Master Merchant.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Quiet Year is a map game. You define the struggles of a post-apocalyptic community, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year. Every decision and every action is set against a backdrop of dwindling time and rising concern.&#10;For a long time, we were at war with The Jackals. But now, we&rsquo;ve driven them off, and we have this &ndash; a year of relative peace. One quiet year, with which to build our community up and learn once again how to work together. Come Winter, the Frost Shepherds will arrive and we might not survive beyond that. But we don&rsquo;t know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something.&#10;&#10;The game plays through a year of relative peace for a small post-apocalyptic community. Players take turns playing through weeks in this year. Each week, the active player draws a card from the top of the deck (which represents the year), and reads the card. They carry out the actions or answer the questions that are specified on the card. Once the card is resolved, some quick upkeep occurs: projects that the community has in motion get closer to completion. Finally, the active player picks an action from a short list: hold a discussion, make a decision, discover something new.&#10;&#10;The three actions give players a meaningful and difficult set of choices: do you spend time listening to others, in the hopes that they'll listen to you in kind? Do you pursue your own goals, ostensibly for the good of the whole community? Do you focus inward or outward?&#10;&#10;The game is played using a deck of cards &ndash; each of the 52 cards corresponds to a week during the quiet year. Each card triggers certain events &ndash; bringing bad news, good omens, project delays and sudden changes in luck. At the end of the quiet year, the Frost Shepherds will come, ending the game.&#10;&#10;",

Add the five colored will-o'-the-wisp marbles to the bag.&#10;&#10;On a turn, draw a will-o'-the-wisp, then place it at the top of one of the six starting channels and let it go. If the will-o'-the-wisp hits a figure, the ball will stop. Pick up this figure and move it to the next open colored space on the winding path that matches the color of the will-o'-the-wisp. If you're moving a sorcerers' apprentice, you might want to do it quickly because if the will-o'-the-wisp hits that same figure, you can move it once again! Don't rush moving the witches, though, since you want them to move as little as possible. If a will-o'-the-wisp doesn't hit any figures, then you must move a witch of your choice to the next matching colored space. Once all five will-o'-the-wisps have been drawn, return them to the bag and start again.&#10;&#10;If you manage to move four sorcerers' apprentices to the bottom of the mountain before three witches get there, you win! You can adjust the difficulty of the game by requiring more sorcerers' apprentices or fewer witches or both. Alternatively, you can play the game competitively, with each player or team trying to get their group of four figures down the mountain first.&#10;&#10;[Admin note: Magic Mountain is listed for 2-6 players, whereas Zauberberg is listed for 1-4 players, but the gameplay seems identical in both releases.]&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This simulation of the Second Manassas campaign is the first volume in Avalon Hill's new series of strategic Civil War games. Future games will link up with the Stonewall Jackson's Way map to portray much of the Civil War's eastern theater. This is one of the first Civil War games to concentrate on a specific campaign rather than a single battle. Despite its rich detail, the game is fairly easy to learn and play. Indeed, several scenarios can be played to completion in about an hour. &#10;The two beautiful game maps portray central Virginia as it was in the summer of 1862, featuring roads. turnpikes, railroads, rivers, mountains - even bridges and fords! These highly accurate maps are based on original Civil War maps in state and county archives. The players control Union and Confederate military units in turns representing one day of real time.

To win, your Diplo team has to eat more leaves than your opponent's team&hellip;unless one of you decides to call the ferocious T. Rex to get rid of all his opponent's Diplos!&#10;&#10;To set up Jurassic Snack, create a square at random with the four playing boards, place four Diplos of your color on the matching egg spaces, then shuffle the grass tokens and place them face down on the 28 empty spaces. Two actions are available on a turn: moving a Diplo of your color or moving a T. Rex. The players take turns performing two actions each, which can be the same or different, and which can involve the same Dino or T. Rex, or not.&#10;&#10;A Diplo has one single goal: eating grass tokens. It moves in a straight line until it's blocked by another Diplo, a T. Rex, the edge of the playing area, or a grass token. In this last case, the Diplo takes the grass token to eat it and immediately applies one of the six effects: birth, T. Rex appearance, Diplo move, etc.&#10;&#10;The T. Rex has one single goal: scaring the Diplos away. The movement rules for the T. Rex are the same as for the Diplos'. When it meets a Diplo, the T. Rex is placed on the Diplo's space, and the Diplo is placed back into its owner's pool.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no grass tokens remain in the playing area. The player who has eaten the most grass wins. A game can also end when a player has no Diplo of their color in the playing area.&#10;&#10;",

This is a strategy game at heart, but with a special focus on characters, intrigue, and drama.

To do that, you need to groom your family over the generations, build and develop your dominion, be shrewd in the realm of diplomacy and intrigue, and use your vassals wisely to grow your wealth and military power, while at the same time fulfilling your duty to partake in the crusades to the Holy Land.&#10;&#10;To win, you need to survive invasions, plots, crusades, and even marriage! Or at least have children or siblings standing by to take over the throne if your regent dies. Failure to raise a suitable heir can mean the end of your dynasty.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

After playing a card, the compass moves in the direction indicated by its needle, but after every movement, the direction of the needle can potentially change, forcing you to move in new directions. Learning to control and predict these movements is vital to success in the Duskworld!&#10;&#10;Collect all the memory fragments that are scattered in the game board to save Ethan and win the game!

    "Description": "Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by Patricia McKillip's Riddle-Master fantasy trilogy (Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister in the German translation), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.&#10;&#10;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.&#10;&#10;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.&#10;&#10;A later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.&#10;&#10;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.&#10;&#10;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.&#10;&#10;",

These are played one face up &amp; two face down. The aim is to get the most points. You get 1 point for a stand-alone-hut. You get more if you have huts on adjacent spaces. You have one TIKI (statue) to bring your opponents into trouble. You can put this one on any space you want. If your opponent wants to build there a hut: Bad Luck. There are also two cards which you use to change the color of a hut (to make it yours).&#10; The game ends if one player managed it to place all his huts on the island or if one beach is complete with huts and/or tikis at the end of a turn.&#10;&#10;In the advanced rules, it is possible to legally &quot;cheat&quot;. If you play more than three cards, you can build more huts. If you play less than three cards, you can build more easily &mdash; but to prevent some excess, there can be only one denunciation every turn, and you can only denounce another player if you cheat &quot;less&quot; than your opponent!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "from GMT website:&#10;&#10;We are proud to announce the companion game to GMT Games' award winning Europe Engulfed. In Asia Engulfed the action takes place across Asia and the Pacific covering the entire war from the attack at Pearl Harbor to the final collapse of the Japanese empire.&#10;&#10;Asia Engulfed is a complete stand alone game or it can be combined with Europe Engulfed to simulate the entire Second World War. A complete set of combined game rules allow for unit transfer, production allocation, and combined victory conditions.&#10;&#10;Asia Engulfed focuses on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. Players actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in 6-to-9 hours once players become familiar with its elegant game systems.&#10;&#10;Wood Block Units:&#10;Wood blocks are used for both land and naval units to provide a realistic fog of war. Different colors are used for not only the different nations but also for land and naval units so there is no confusion as to what is what and who is who. Only the controlling player knows where their elusive carriers are until combat is engaged. Players will have to decide during their naval reaction move if they have the guts to intercept the enemy's unknown forces.&#10;&#10;Supply and Oil:&#10;Asia Engulfed incorporates a unique and simple system to realistically portray the Japanese resource limitations. The further your empire expands from Japan the harder it is to supply and operate your far-flung forces, not to mention defend your perimeter with a navy limited by its oil reserves.&#10;&#10;China, India, and Australia:&#10;All three are in play and potential targets for Japanese expansion. Could any of them been captured if Japan had focused its resources? While it isn't likely, they are targets that the Allies have to defend and often seem just out of reach. Optional rules can bring the Soviet Union into the game.&#10;&#10;Redesigned Air System:&#10;Air assets are critical to a successful campaign in the Pacific, influencing both movement and supply. A carefully designed area map allows air units to exert control into adjacent areas and move across areas to the next airbase without having to worry about tracking range or counting hexes. Carrier air assets are represented by their own counters allowing for their losses to be tracked separately from the carriers and for the Japanese to husband their elite pilots.&#10;&#10;Redesigned Naval System:&#10;The naval system is totally redesigned from Europe Engulfed and along with the air system an integral part of Asia Engulfed. Basing limits, extended range movement, naval reaction movement, carrier day or surface ship night combat, surprise effects, port attacks, invasion support, it's all there and when combined with block limited intelligence and a healthy dose of lady luck every engagement brings the thrill of a potential victory and the fear of a devastating defeat. Even submarines get to put in an appearance as they try to pickoff stragglers.&#10;&#10;Production and Strategic Warfare:&#10;Asia Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include Special Actions, Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, Cruisers, Submarines, Land Based Air and Carrier Based Air units, Infantry, Marines, and an assortment of strategic assets. The USA conducts a strategic submarine campaign against the Japanese naval transport system and later in the war is able to direct strategic bombers over Japan.&#10;&#10;Special Actions:&#10;Special Actions are an innovative rule system to allow for not only extended operations during the course of a normal two month game turn but also to represent each sides unique capabilities. From code breaking to emergency rebasing, special actions provide a wealth of options for the player who has been able to commit the necessary resources to build them.&#10;&#10;Rulebook and Playbook:&#10;The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, combined game rules, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play.&#10;&#10;Integrates With: &#10;&#10;    Europe Engulfed: WWII European Theatre Block Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The first settlers of mars are arriving soon, but the colony is not ready yet! You are the robots that are trying to build the colony before the settlers arrive. The goal in Magic Maze on Mars is to build &quot;domes&quot; where the settlers can live, then to guide them to their domes when they arrive. When time runs out, they are out of oxygen.&#10;&#10;To begin, place the starting tile in the middle of the table. Deal out the appropriate action tiles and shuffle the four A tiles in a pile face down.&#10;&#10;Creating resources: A player with blue on their action tile can always create blue resources at the blue factory so long as a resource is not already there. The player simply takes a blue resource from the bank and places it on the resource station next to the factory. The resources of other colors are built on the factories of their color, with these factories becoming available when you build new tiles.&#10;&#10;Moving resources: Players can move resources along the roads with a color that they have on their action tile. A player might have an action tile that shows red and orange, so they can move resources along red and orange roads. You move resources from one &quot;station&quot; to another, but each station can hold only one resource, and resources cannot move through a station that holds another resource.&#10;&#10;Note: When moving resources, you must physically move the resource all the way, so the other players can see what is happening. Even if there is a long stretch of road that you are able to move on, you cannot move the resource directly.&#10;&#10;Building new tiles: To do this, you need to have a resource of the station's color on the station, e.g., a blue resource on a blue station. Once the resource is there, a player with this color on their action tile can remove the resource and place the top tile face up at the position. Place the tile with the small arrow pointing from where it was build.&#10;&#10;Watching the time: As in Magic Maze, players have a time limit in Magic Maze on Mars. To flip the sand timer, you must move any resource onto a timer space. Return the resource to the bank and place a timer token on the timer space to show that it cannot be used again. By doing this, you send a signal to the settlers that the colony is not ready yet; they will then orbit Mars once more before landing, but they can't do this indefinitely.&#10;&#10;Building domes: Some tiles have spaces available for domes. In order to build a dome, you need to place the depicted resources on the dome spot, e.g., green, yellow, and red. When all the necessary resources are placed on the dome, any player can put all the resources back in the bank and place a dome (taken from the communication board).&#10;&#10;When you have built all the domes, the settlers arrive. Place all the settlers on the rocket. Then move the settlers just like you move resources. You have won as soon as one settler inhabits each dome. There cannot be more than one settler on each station, and they cannot walk through resources. Once the settlers arrive, you can no longer flip the sand timer! (It does not help to send them messages about orbiting Mars since they are already here.) If time runs out, you have lost.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

These falling stars crashed to the surface, and in the ages to come, became enshrined in legends as the Lost Legacy. Discover where the Lost Legacy can be found and win the game!&#10;&#10;Lost Legacy: Second Chronicle contains two sets of game cards: Vorpal Sword and Whitegold Spire. Each set can be played independently or mixed together with other sets to create a unique custom set.&#10;&#10;As for how to play, Lost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.&#10;         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.&#10;         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.&#10;         End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses. In Whitegold Spire, when someone discovers the Lost Legacy, the game ends, everyone tallies the value of the cards they've played and the card left in hand, and whoever has the highest total wins.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mysterious and intriguing temples call for exploration by brave adventurers. Powerful arcane runes were hidden in these ancient magical ruins protected by dark and deadly curses. Only the most courageous and adventurous Curse Breakers may enter the temples, break the dark curses, and bring back the arcane runes for the magic academy for its glorious bounty. Through teleportation, you can collect crystals of various colors from all over the world, and put them on your very own Crystal Grid in the correct order. Only then will the power of the crystals fuse together, and be powerful enough to break the dark curses inside the temples. Are you able to rise among your peers, and become the most reliable and professional Curse Breaker the magic academy has ever seen?&#10;&#10;In Mystery of the Temples, players take on the role of Curse Breakers, traveling between the wilderness and the temples in order to collect crystals of various colors. Fusing the colorful crystals on the Crystal Grid in the correct order breaks the curse of the temple, and you earn runes and victory points in the process. Once a player has broken five curses, the game ends. Whoever has the highest amount of victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

You will be able to build city landmarks as for example the 'Brandenburger Tor' or the 'Dresdner Dom' in one of the 12 possible cities. All these landmarks will be in the box as plastic miniatures of significant detail.&#10;In short: A must have for all German Catanien and a good addition to the collection of every other wood-for-sheep-enthusiast.&#10;&#10;On the box: Discover and settle germany!&#10;Explore and settle the storied land of Germany using the elegant, award-winning game design from The Settlers of Catan. Here, you will find great social interaction, simple rules, beautiful German geography, rich history and lore, and 12 wonderfully-sculpted landmarks.&#10;Catan Geographies: Germany is a game about trade, building, and settlement. Start with town halls in 3 cities. Then build roads to neighboring cities, where you can purchase landmarks and new town halls. Town halls create resource production, while the unique landmarks generate special awards. Both yield victory points - as do the Longest Road, Largest Army, and historically-based victory point cards.&#10;So, have fun with friends or family while casually discovering the novel geography and history of Germany.&#10;&#10;",

From your incredible Factory, you must race to claim ownership over the magnificent ruins of an abandoned clockwork metropolis. Each game plays in under an hour, and because only nine of the city tiles (from dozens available) are randomly chosen and placed each game, no two games ever play the same.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you roll a number of production dice and activate City Tiles, then you move your automaton workers and perform a variety of actions (such as drawing and placing gears to reactivate areas of the city, sabotaging opponents, and activating unique steam powers) as determined by your resources. Along the way, you will develop your Factory with special powers which set it apart and provide you with powerful bonuses.&#10;&#10;As the city is revealed and its abilities are discovered, players must concoct plans to accrue prestige and hinder opponents so that once Opening Day arrives, they will emerge victorious! Do you have what it takes to set the City of Gears in motion?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Hearts and Minds: Vietnam 1965-1975&quot; is a card-driven wargame covering the American buildup of troops and arms in Southeast Asia as to our decision to begin troop withdrawal: 1965-1975. The game is quick (3-6 hours) and clean (map using area movement). Hearts and Minds uses most major events of the period, including proposed events such as the Macnamara Line which was never actually built. Although nominally a combat game, the mechanisms actually revolve around both sides occupying South Vietnamese provinces for propaganda purposes. The heart of the game is political influence. There is little doubt that the Allied player will eventually withdraw his American boys from the quagmire, but the question is, how quickly and in what numbers?&#10;&#10;Hearts and Minds contains 80 cards, counters to represent the American army, the ARVN army, the NVA army, VC units of varying hidden strength, the Cambodian army, the Laotian army and a small contingent of international allies. Turn markers, withdrawal markers, reduced movement markers as well CAS (Close Air Support), communist Air Suppression and artillery are also included. More rules cover Air Cavalry, Naval support, Riverine interdiction, and bombers. Untried troops are a liability in the game; Veteran troops are a necessity. Ultimately, the Communist player must deal the American such a crushing public relations disaster that he will abandon his Southeast Asian allies before the momentum of those allies stalemates the irreversible infiltration of South Vietnam.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While fleeing from starving wolves and wild sabretooth tigers, will your tribe of cavemen manage to survive in, let alone conquer, the merciless Valley of the Mammoths? Will it escape the stampeding woolly rhinoceroses and the massive mammoths, only to be reduced to pat&eacute; under the heavy clubs of their rival tribes? In these chaotic times, man must fight for everything, his adversaries are without pity, and nature herself is in a state of violent upheaval.&#10;In Valley of the Mammoths, you must contend not only with rival tribes (the other players) but also with wild, untamed, unpredictable nature. To feed themselves, your tribe will have to devote themselves to hunting, gathering and fishing. They may even attempt to innovate by developing agriculture... But all is not peaceful in the Valley, opposing tribes will attempt to hunt YOUR bison &amp; mammoths, to gather YOUR fruits &amp; roots, to fish YOUR rivers &amp; lakes... and to even steal YOUR WOMEN! You will have to fight them off, and protect your food supply... all the while keeping a watchful eye on the smoldering volcanoes - after all, one never knows.&#10;&#10;Originally published only by Ludodelire in French.

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Central Europe, 1618. Germany is a jigsaw puzzle of independent Electorates, Bishoprics, Dukedoms, and Imperial Free Cities nominally under the control of the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. An alliance of Protestant leaders rebel against the Emperor, who raises armies to suppress them and regain Catholic property lost during the Reformation; the surrounding kings of Spain, France, Sweden, and Denmark intervene to stake their own claims. Germany is plunged into thirty years of war that will last until 1648, when the exhausted combatants sign a peace establishing the competing spheres of interest that will control Germany for the next two centuries.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thirty Years War&quot; recreates this conflict with the award winning wargame system used in GMT's Wilderness War, Paths of Glory, and For the People. There are four scenarios provided: the Full Campaign (14 turns), Early War (5 turns), Intervention (3 turns), and Apocalypse (5 turns).&#10;&#10;This is a two-player wargame; one controls the Protestant forces (German Protestants, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, France) while the other runs Catholics (the Empire, Bavaria, Spain, and occasionally Saxony, which can switch sides during play!). The heart of the game is the playing card decks of 55 cards that each player receives. Playing a card gives a player the option to move and attack with an army, to recruit new units, to bank up money to pay ever-hungry troops, or to declare an event.&#10;&#10;The Peace of Westphalia made certain that Germany would remain divided for another two centuries. Can the Catholic player defy history by recreating the power of the old Holy Roman Empire? Does Gustavus Adolphus survive to dictate peace to the Emperor in Vienna? Thirty Years War allows the players to determine these and other historical what-ifs, while opening a window onto one of the most influential events in European history.&#10;&#10;COUNTERS: 456 full-color die-cut counters.&#10;MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;CARDS: 110 Strategy cards&#10;OTHER: Two 10-sided dice, 32-page Rulebook, 2 Player Aid cards&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 2 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE: 3-5,000 men each&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: David Fox&#10;DEVELOPER: Michael Welker&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

MacGowan&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG user description:)&#10;&#10;A direct descendant of Paths of Glory, 30 Years War covers the confusing post-Reformation conflict in central Europe, as the Holy Roman Empire attempts to reassert domination over the protestant states. On the side of Catholicism we have the Holy Roman Empire (Austria and some of Northern Italy at this point) and Spain, opposed by a cast of thousands: the German Protestants, Sweden at the height of her power, France, England, Denmark, and others.&#10;&#10;While there are some new mechanics, virtually the entire game is borrowed from elsewhere: Leader activations and movement are as in Hannibal, combat is straight out of Paths of Glory (minus the flanking), and Siege resolves much Hannibal. Your armies have to be paid, with Aid Points that are received just like Paths of Glory's RPs. An interesting twist is that the movement and support of armies results in the landscape getting Pillaged, so as the game goes on the board becomes less and less capable of supporting military operations.&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the eight exploration cards, each of which shows a different polyomino.&#10;&#10;On a turn, reveal the topmost exploration card. Each player then marks off spaces in the shape of this polyomino on one of their pyramid cards. The first space covered on a card must be the entrance square. If you cover gems, torches, or skulls, mark off these spaces on your personal player board; if you cover a potion, erase two covered skulls. If you cover a red X, mark one additional space, either on this pyramid board or your other one; all marked spaces must connect orthogonally.&#10;&#10;If you cover the tomb on a pyramid board, set that board aside and take a new board from the four on display or from the deck. When you've completed your second, fourth, or sixth pyramid of the same color &mdash; and the deck includes three colors &mdash; score the highest color bonus available.&#10;&#10;After seven exploration cards have been revealed, the round is over. Shuffle all eight cards, then start a new round. After four rounds, players count their scores, earning 10 points per tomb reached, 5 points per pair of colored gems found, 5 points for each round in which they covered at least one torch, and their color bonuses, after which they lose points based on the number of skulls covered. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The rules are designed to be simple, fast and fun so that a mini campaign of several games can be played in a single evening.&#10;&#10;The game uses only 6 sided dice and requires approximately 5-10 models per player. The rules recommend 15 mm figures on a 60x60cm play area, but can be played in other scales. There is nothing scaled in inches or centimetres, three measuring sticks to measure all distances and ranges. Alternatively the game can be played without measuring sticks on a hexgrid.&#10;&#10;The game includes statistics for 180+ monsters and heroes, and details to be able to create your own. Also there are campaign rules where your warband grows more powerful after every battle, and six basic scenarios.&#10;&#10;There are some stand-alone games based on the same system, which could also be used as expansions to the base game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Song of Arthur and Merlin (2008) - Arthurian supplement featuring sections on the historical Dark Ages king, the Welsh legendary king, and the Hollywood king.  Originally an expansion, in 2011 this was re-released as a stand-alone product.&#10;     Mutants and Death Ray Guns (2008) - a post-holocaust skirmish game.&#10;     Song of the Splintered Lands (2009) - Sourcebook based on the Splintered Light miniatures line.&#10;     Song of Drums and Shakos (2009) - a Napoleonics skirmish game. &#10;     Flying Lead (2010) - a game of gang warfare to Pulp action, from military operations to black-clad assassins.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The bugs are plastic winks in three different shapes and sizes.  Two six-sided dice determine which bugs you may move on a turn.  Enemy bugs and bases are defeated by landing your bugs on top of them.  All bugs also feature special abilities, such as allowing multiple moves or firing projectile winks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Munchkin Apocalypse is a core set in the Munchkin series with an end of the world theme that includes natural disasters, zombie takeovers, Armageddon, alien invasions, nuclear war, etc. And while this is still a standard Munchkin game where you try to level up by killing the monsters, stealing the treasure, and stabbing your buddy, there's a new &quot;Seal&quot; mechanic that significantly changes the gameplay.&#10;&#10;Seals are a reference to the biblical seals of the Apocalypse. They can be opened and closed, although it's typically more difficult to close them. Once seven Seals are open, the game ends immediately, and the player with the highest combat strength (excluding levels) is the winner. The Seal mechanic adds a sense of impending doom to the game, meant to mimic the sense of impending doom for a real apocalypse. It also tends to create situations where the group works together to close a Seal in order to prevent a player from winning via the Seal mechanic. So there is more teamwork than in a regular Munchkin game.&#10;&#10;The balance of the deck is also different than the other Munchkin sets. There are a lot more Disaster cards, which are equivalent to traps and curses, so bad things tend to occur more frequently. Also, there are more monsters, especially high-level monsters. To offset this, however, there are more item enhancers and high-bonus items. It's been stated in the Munchkin forums that Munchkin Apocalypse is harder to play and is intended more for seasoned Munchkin veterans.&#10;&#10;Munchkin Apocalypse has four new classes but does not have races, powers, or other &quot;thingies&quot;. It includes Undead and Shark monsters, which follow special rules.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 180 cards (92 Doors, 76 Treasures, 12 Seals). The Seal cards are a different size than the regular cards--they're square and are shorter but wider (2.75&quot; x 2.75&quot;). The included d6 is orange with lime green pips, similar in color to the orange dice in the +6 Bag o' Radioactive Munchkin d6.&#10;&#10;",

Transform your fresh, vibrant green tea leaves through fermentation, elevating them to rich, aromatic brown leaves that grow in quality &mdash; and value! &mdash; as they mature.&#10;&#10;Harness the power of your deck of cards to orchestrate up to four main actions each game round. The strength of these cards is important for performing the chosen action; the higher the strength, the better the effects you will achieve. With your cards, you will build new tea gardens, acquire new cards, trade your tea with eager caravans, ferment your tea leaves, and harvest more tea. Couple your main actions with the power of secondary actions to navigate the river, produce tea cups, or practice tea studies at the university.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Burma - The Campaign for Northern Burma, March-August, 1944, is the sixth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers, and covers covers the 1944 campaigns beginning with the Japanese &quot;U-Go&quot; offensive and ending up as what would be know as Imphal-Kohima, the most dramatic defeat ever inflicted on a Japanese army.&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1944, two equally matched opponents faced each other in the jungles and mountains of Northern Burma. During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.&#10;&#10;Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply, elephant and oxen transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.&#10;&#10;Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).&#10;&#10;Scenario Info:&#10;&#10;    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns&#10;    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet&#10;One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet&#10;Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)&#10;Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The Battle of Versailles&quot; was a fashion show held in 1973 in Versailles, France that pitted five American designers against five French designers. The American designers, including Anne Klein, Halston, Oscar de la Renta, Stephen Burrows, and Bill Blass, were considered to be more innovative and less traditional than the French designers: Yves Saint Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Emanuel Ungaro, Pierre Cardin, and Christian Dior. The American designers ended up winning the competition and solidifying their place in the fashion world. The event was widely covered in the media, and is considered a turning point in the history of fashion.&#10;&#10;In the game The Battle of Versailles, players take the role of either the France or U.S. team, facing one another by playing action cards to show off their best dresses, to attract the most popular celebrities, or to annoy the opponent by spreading bad gossip. They also compete to contribute more than their opponent to the reconstruction of the palace of Versailles.&#10;&#10;The French player has five actions per round, representing the classic but overly-long show (2h 30min) that it put on, while the American player has only three actions per round as their show was fresh, innovative, and short (only 37min). Correspondingly, the game has different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The French team tries to keep its prestige in the fashion industry, while the American team tries to steal the French prestige.&#10;     Both teams fight to control the most influential celebrities in the fashion world.&#10;     The Americans try to show off the best innovative features on their dresses.&#10;     The French try to contribute as much as possible to the reconstruction of Versailles in order to raise their national pride in this beautiful palace.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Adventure, intrigue, and flowers! Botany is a strategy board game where you take on the role of a Victorian Era flower hunter as you explore the world to gather fortune and fame and be named the Royal Botanist. In Botany, each player takes on the role of a character whose abilities will shape the way they play the game. Will you focus on exploring the globe in search of the most valuable specimens? Will you make quick and efficient trips to gather reputation quickly and build your estate?&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with a set of randomized goals that they then use to plot their path to victory. When players set out from their estate, they have access only to the coins they can carry with them. They can use these coins to traverse the globe and gain crew members and items to improve their odds of surviving the unknown, enhance their abilities, and increase the efficiency with which they traverse the map. However, there is danger in spending too freely, and players must ensure they have enough wealth on hand to return to England with their specimens intact.&#10;&#10;Turns in Botany are streamlined in order to minimize downtime and keep players engaged. Players will move around the map, build their character, and experience the story of their rise to fame, all with an eye for efficiency. Points are gained by improving the quality of your garden, retrieving live specimens from around the globe, and adding preserved flowers to your botanical press. The specimens that players hunt, the goals they focus on to achieve victory, and the events they experience create a unique feel across each game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.&#10;&#10;Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.&#10;&#10;As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.&#10;&#10;Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might? Or will the Allies, in their outdated machines, halt the Japanese onslaught much earlier?&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:    &#10;&#10;     88 full-color, die-cut counters.&#10;     150 full-color Playing Cards&#10;     6 Campaign Map Displays&#10;     One Bombing Display&#10;     One Resource Sheet&#10;     One 16-page Rulebook&#10;     One 20-page Campaign Booklet&#10;     8 Target Displays&#10;     Three Campaign Logs &#10;&#10;&#10;Designed by Dan Verssen&#10;Developed by Mike Lemick&#10;&#10;",

There are still survivors among the ruins &ndash; we must take them in our care and cure them. In order to stay ahead of the plague, we must implement new inventions and technologies. Our influence will expand as we rebuild, but the plague will still lurk in the shadows, ready to strike when we least expect it. Once it does, it will be difficult to adapt, but we will survive. In addition to the procurement of important resources, our imperative will be to get the plague under control.&#10;&#10;In Pest, players slip into the roles of leaders of the ruling houses of a once great empire that was struck by a cataclysmic plague. The plague has left much of the empire in ruins, so now it is up to the players to restore it to its former glory.&#10;&#10;Pest is played in 6 rounds. Each round before players take their turn, a plague card will be revealed which shows how the plague will spread in that round. On their turn, players will be able to select among many actions on their player board using a unique action selection system. Thus, players will be able to move their containment team on the board, quarantine and cure infected people, rebuild, assign workers, harvest for resources, and more.&#10;&#10;As their house influence grows, players will be able to play more actions, generate more resources, and house more people. This will bring forth new technological advancements which are much needed to get the plague under control.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the 6 round is over and players count their final amount of Renown (victory points). The player with the most Renown is the winner and declared the savior of the empire!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
