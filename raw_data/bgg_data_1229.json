Each player matches multiple variables to complete their matching sets, while learning about the sea creature on the card.&#10;&#10;Each card has unique poem that encapsulates an interesting fact about the sea creature.&#10;&#10;The game also includes a strategy mode where players can choose to match one or more objects in a game to score points. While players may be tempted to target patterns that score the highest points, they will soon learn that waiting for their cards of choice may not be the best approach, as other players race to finish the game before they do.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You, the royal messenger, must return to the palace and deliver the urgent message you've received from the scouts as quickly as possible.&#10;Fail to deliver your message in time - and the palace will come under attack before the High King's armies have been mustered!&#10;&#10;Quick as you are, this challenge may be too hard even for you, messenger. The palace is far away, and it'd normally take you seven days to cover the distance. Now, you only have five. What's more, the roads have become much more dangerous of late. Nevertheless, set out you must, if the High King is to receive the warning in time!&#10;&#10;Your goal is to return to the palace and deliver your message in five days or less. Along the way, you will face several challenges and come across several people and animals. Each day will present a new challenge or encounter. While some will hinder you, others will help you make it to the palace in time.&#10;&#10;Your base speed is 40 miles per day, and the royal palace is 280 miles away from your starting point. You won't make it in time unless you somehow manage to increase your speed. Perhaps something or someone along the way will help make you faster...&#10;&#10;Each time you play, you will draw up to five cards - one card each turn - and face at least three different challenges. It is up to you to decide whether you take on the encounter of the day or avoid it. While some encounters can be automatically avoided, others require you to successfully hide in order to avoid them, and some encounters simply cannot be avoided. You must take on at least three of the encounters you come across (including those which cannot be avoided).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to be the first investigator to defeat a horrible monster called a Shoggoth and win.&#10;&#10;The game sets up in about 2 minutes, plays in about 20, and is put away in about 2 minutes.  The rules are free, under creative commons, and all you need is a standard deck of cards, a d6, and 3 different colored poker chips.  You will also need to provide your own player tokens or pawns.

The game map shows most of California (known as Alta (upper) California. The owners are Mexico &amp; the Californios or Californians). The object of the game is for the Californians to retain Alta California while the goal of the Bear Flaggers and United States troops and sailors is to seize the soon to be Golden State. The fighting itself was not particularly bloody and involved relatively small numbers of troops. There are two major events that influence the course of the game. One is the outbreak of the Bear Flag Revolt just before the formal Declaration of War between the United States and Mexico is known of in California. The other is the rebellion of Southern California over the initial occupation by the Americans. The game is a TWO-ACT play. Several key and often-random events may play a powerful role in he final outcome of the fighting. The game will take 1-3 hours to play to completion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The huge customization options allow each of your gladiator's game cards to be totally unique, created almost from sratch to suit your tactics.&#10;&#10;Once in the arena, you must test your ability to think fast and use cunning tactics to attack your opponent's weak points. But your opponent is not the only obstacle to victory; the perils of the arena await you as pits of death and wild beasts threaten your band.&#10;&#10;Finally, don't underestimate the importance of pleasing your followers. Having the crowd by your side will often make the difference between victory and defeat!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deluxe copies of Tiny Epic Mechs come with Kickstarter-exclusive content and are not going to enter normal retail circulation. In addition, the deluxe version includes all of the stretch goals from the Kickstarter campaign.&#10;&#10;From the description of Tiny Epic Mechs:&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of.&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. They compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. These actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill.&#10;&#10;Your programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own.&#10;&#10;",

The differences between them are the difficulty and the levels of the wall that we set to climb: &#10;&#10;     In Basic mode, the wall to be climbed will have three levels. &#10;     In Advanced mode, the wall can have more levels, a different shape or it can include some special settings. &#10;&#10;&#10;If it&rsquo;s the first time you play, we recommend the Basic mode; once you know the mechanics, we encourage you to follow the rules to set up the game in Advanced mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Just make sure you brought spare ammo.&#10;&#10;The game engine is intended for solo play from the get go:&#10;This means we've avoided complex rules that are easy to lose track of, kept the number of exceptions and special cases to a minimum and all solo play mechanics are integrated directly into the core rules.&#10;&#10;No need to flip back and forth between Movement and the Solo mechanics any longer.&#10;&#10;If you own both this and the Five Parsecs From Home, Salvage Crew or Gang Warfare rules, they are compatible.&#10;&#10;This permits you to build a character under one campaign system and then move them to the other over time.&#10;&#10;Want to go freelance?

    "Description": "Poker Family is a card game variant of Poker that allows beginners and families to play the game.&#10;&#10;Poker Family is a card game for 2 to 8 players, suitable from about 6 years. It takes about 45 to 120 minutes, depending on the number of poker chips used or the amount of play money. The game comes with a poker card deck of 55 cards; a set of double-sided cards with poker chips on one side and play money on the other. Additional accessories are also included to make the poker rules and the flow of the game more understandable to younger players and beginners.&#10;&#10;Poker Family is played according to the rules of Texas Hold'em: The cards are shuffled well. The players next to the card reading place the Small and Big blind. Each player gets 2 cards. There is a first round of bidding (call, raise, fold). Then 3 community cards are revealed. The 2nd round of bidding takes place. The 4th and 5th community cards are revealed, followed by the bidding rounds. The players remaining at the end of the round who have not folded show their poker cards in the showdown. From their own 2 cards and the 5 revealed community cards, the players try to form the highest ranking cards. The player who has formed the highest ranking cards at the end of the game gets the pot of poker chips or play money.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You&rsquo;ll create this adversary by combining a Nemesis (who they are), with an Archetype (what army they lead), and a Scenario (what they are doing). For example you may battle Erling Khan the Deathdealer who is Leading the Invasion. Each of the four different oversized Nemesis Cards comes with a large standee and a unique &quot;Nemesis Deck&quot;.&#10;At various points in the game, you will reveal the top card of their Nemesis Deck. Each card can generate multiple different effects depending on the game state. The Endbringer defense is spread out among Symmetry Cards, one per battlefield (per player in the game). As Symmetry cards take damage, put damage counters on them. When a Symmetry Card has damage equal to its defense, it is destroyed. Flip it over to reveal a devastating effect the Endbringer unleashes in retaliation. Destroy all the Symmetry Cards and you win the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on the 17th-century pistol dueling game for iPhone &quot;Pistols at Dawn&quot; by Cedar Hill Games and Tobyn Manthorpe.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing cards to move their crosshairs to stay on target or to move the opponent's crosshairs off target. There are three types of targeting cards that move a player's crosshairs, their opponent's crosshairs, or both. Players can earn &quot;shot points&quot; which can be used to purchase special abilities from the shop.&#10;&#10;Play alternates between players until both players pass. A player will only pass if they cannot play a card or purchase abilities. After both players have passed, any crosshairs in the red zone score a hit on their opponent.&#10;&#10;Keep your opponent off-target while you take aim and fire.&#10;&#10;Regarding the iOS app that this game is inspired by, &quot;Pistols at Dawn, a great game that no one played.&quot; Tobyn Manthorpe&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
