    "Description": "This is a game intended to teach children about dogs. The rulebook has a general information section on dogs, including what meaning of different behavior in dogs, what an angry/scared dog looks like, and how to teach children about dogs. Sometimes, the rules instruct the players to act dog like (barking, rolling etc.)&#10;&#10;The game includes a board with an imaginary village printed on it, 4 playing pieces (dogs) on plastic bases, a deck of cards which represent 24 breeds of dog - some of which are &quot;leaders&quot; - and one 6-sided die. All of the dogs belong to families living in the village, identified by the first letter of a dog's name.&#10;&#10;The game is subdivided into 6 different variants:&#10;&#10;Game #1: 2-4 players, 10-15 minutes. This is described as a &quot;warm-up&quot; game, the board is not used. Players are &quot;leader&quot; dogs trying to gather their own pack by drawing cards blindly. The player with the most dogs after all non-leader breeds have been drawn wins.&#10;&#10;This game also has a solitaire variant.&#10;&#10;Game #2: 2-4 players, 30 minutes. Again, the players represent leaders trying to gather a pack. This is accomplished by visiting the 4 houses in the village to pick up dogs, then take them to the dog park.&#10;&#10;This game has rule variants to make it a bit more challenging.&#10;&#10;Game #3: 2-4 players, 20-30 minutes. Again, the players represent leaders, but this time they already have a pack. The players must return the dogs in their pack to the families, then find a way to their own house.&#10;&#10;Game #4: 3 or more players, 10-20 minutes. This time the players must co-operate to gather a pack and take it to the dog park, playing against time (die rolls).&#10;&#10;This game also has a solitaire variant.&#10; Game #5: 2-4 players, 20-30 minutes. This is basically a version of the Game of Authors - players are trying to complete series of dogs belonging to the same family.&#10;&#10;Game #6: Solitaire, variable playing time. The aim is to rescue dogs from the kennel by pairing up the kennel dogs with free dogs.&#10;&#10;",

Instead, players builds their own word puzzles in front of them. Letters are worth points (vowels are worth 1 point, consonants 2 points, and super consonants J, K, Qu, X, and Z, are worth 4) the object of the game is to be the first player to reach 500 points. Every player randomly selects eight tiles and places them face down. Simultaneously, players turn them over and begin building the puzzles with as many letters from their individual pile as possible. Once someone has used up all eight tiles, he or she says &quot;Saygo&quot; and all players will select another tile. If nobody can use their tiles it is a stalemate, and everyone selects another tile. Should players find they can not use all of their tiles, they have the option of rearranging their puzzles as often as needed, in attempt to use all letters. The game continues until all tiles are used and the last person to use his/her last tile yells &quot;done&quot;. Once the group verifies the accuracy of the winning player's words, the winner collects the remaining letters and adds them to his/her score. Once a player has 500 points (that number can be lowered or raised if desired), the round is finished and players can play again.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Tour Through The British Colonies and Foreign Possessions is from an original hand coloured lithographic game published in about 1850 by John Betts of London. The game is a whistle-stop tour around the world from London via Africa, India, Japan, the West Indies, the United States of America, Canada, and finally, a race back to London. The first part of the journey includes the choice of two routes. The overland journey visits the city of Alexandria and the sea cruise calls in at Sierra Leone and the Cape.&#10;&#10;With 36 stops along the route, the visitor participates in a remarkable, colonial experience of the world.&#10;&#10;The game includes a box, mounted color map, reproduction rule book and catalog, The Historical Games Collection catalog, four re-created pawns lightly tipped in colors, and a six sided teetotum (spinner - dice were considered at the time as something used for gambling).&#10;&#10;Game play involves spinning, moving your pawn the appropriate number of spaces, and then reading the educational paragraph about the colony or possession you have landed on.&#10;&#10;The reproduction edition's rulebook notes: &quot;These rules are copied directly from the originals and reflect the moral and social outlook of early 19th century imperialist peoples. The facts and attitudes are often wrong, intolerant and patronizing and should be read from a historical perspective.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Noble Game of Elephant and Castle was first published in 1822 as a hand coloured engraving by William Darton of London.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a magnificent board depicting an elephant surmounted by a howdah (ornate carriage) with an Indian mahout (driver). The mysteries of the Orient are discovered through a grand tour from the Frozen Ocean in the Arctic wastes of north Russia thence south through Asia into India, China, and Japan. The game was published at the height of the British Empire and outrageously describes the appearance, customs and culture of the region's peoples, comparing their way of life to that of the British.&#10;&#10;The game comes in a box with a mounted full color reproduction board, reproduction rules, Catalog of The Historical Games Collection, four &quot;travelers&quot; (pawns) - each lightly tipped with a different color, 16 counters (chips, each with the rose face lightly colored to match pawns), and a teetotum (top with eight sides, numbered 1-8 - dice being items of gambling).&#10;&#10;Each player spins and moves their pawn a number of spaces, attempting to progress to 25 by exact count. Each space has a description in the accompanying rule book to be read aloud, describing the scene from an area of Asia.  The counters are used to mark off missed turns assigned by the descriptions.&#10;&#10;The rules note: &quot;These rules are copied directly form the originals and reflect the moral and social outlook of early 19th century imperialist peoples. The facts and attitudes are often wrong, intolerant and patronizing and should be read from a historical perspective.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;You asked for it (didn't you?), and now it's here (well, almost). Packing with forty professionally printed, and glaringly-glossy pages (including cover) and filled with World at War wisdom, the World at War: Gamer's Guide is on pre-order. You'll find a preview of the upcoming World at War boxed game, World at War: Blood and Bridges. Two new scenarios, Clearing Hell's Highway, and Poor Bloody Infantry.  Two battle reports with semi-fictionalized accounts recounts of WaW scenarios (Some of you call these after action reports). A ten page article examining strategy in the World at War series and the specific tactics needed to win all six Eisenbach Gap scenarios.  Even variants for night fighting, and a design your own scenarios &quot;how to&quot; article. And much more... including a unit-by-unit analysis of the platoons of Eisenbach Gap...&#10;&#10;World at War has been a pleasant, if mild, surprise for Lock &lsquo;n Load Publishing. I designed the game because I wanted to play it. Yes, in the back of my mind, I felt that there might be a market for something depicting the war that never happened, but primarily I created the game because it interests me.&#10;&#10;In ten years of writing and designing, that&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;ve found that works. I&rsquo;ve designed and written on spec, and gave those pieces my best shot, but it seems that the games, the writing, that gets my juices flowing are the things other people also enjoy.&#10;&#10;I absolutely love playing World at War. I like the combat system, am intrigued by the era, and fascinated by the idea of a series of games that link together to tell a story. So, I&rsquo;m happy that other people enjoy it too.&#10;&#10;I also hope that this guide enhances your enjoyment. We have strived to make a guide that is visually appealing, interesting, and diversified. Inside you&rsquo;ll find articles on strategy, the percentages of rolling dice in World at War, battle reports (or after action reports as some of you prefer), and unit analysis. What you won&rsquo;t find are dry as dust articles on the actual forces that lined the West German border or mind-numbing diatribes on Soviet Doctrine. Why? Because that stuff just doesn&rsquo;t interest me.&#10;&#10;There are lots of tables comparing the strength and weakness of an M1 Abrams platoon and a T-72 platoon in the World at War system. And we go through the platoons of Eisenbach Gap, unit-by-unit, and even provide a walk through for winning Blind Sided (a Death of the 1st Panzer scenario.)&#10;&#10;All this in a beautifully laid out, two-color 40-page glossy magazine. Yeah, this one's printed. You can hold it in your hands.&#10;&#10;Not a stand-alone game.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;&#10;    World at War: Eisenbach Gap&#10;    World at War: Death of the 1st Panzer&#10;&#10;&#10;",

First of all, movement is controlled by a deck of standard playing cards (with some extra Aces and Kings) -- most cards move a pawn forward by their face value, but some have special powers (get a pawn out of the starting area, move multiple pawns, trade places, move backwards, etc.).  Additionally, while the game can be played as a free-for-all, it is also possible for players to split into partnerships and aid their partners in the race to victory.&#10;&#10;The game is subtitled &quot;An International Card Game,&quot; featuring rules in eight different languages and decorating its board with the flags of many of the countries where it can be played.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Who is the Salvan&egrave;l?&#10;The Salvan&egrave;l is a goblin that frequently appears in the legends of Trentino, in northern Italy. Until not many decades ago, in every valley you could find someone who said they had seen the Salvan&egrave;l, even though actually encountering him was extremely unlikely.&#10;They described him as a small man, boyish-looking, and always with some red feature on him: a hat, clothes or hair.&#10;&#10;This time the Salvan&egrave;l, running to and fro, has left his magical tracks everywhere. Anyone who treads on them by mistake is bound to get lost - and after much wandering, finds himself back where he started. Now you are lost in the wood too!&#10;To get back home you must make three good moves to reconstruct a path that will take you out of the wood. But the goblin will also help you, if you meet him!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of every turn, the guide picks a colored card. This card has two effects:&#10;1-The Salvan&egrave;l immediately moves toward the border indicated by the card, and if he meets a player... He immediately gains an extra turn!&#10;2-The player indicated by the card plays his turn... And if he meets the Salvan&egrave;l... He plays again!&#10;&#10;In every turn, players can use one of these moves:&#10;1-Spin:choose a tile and rotate it in any direction you like&#10;2-Puff of Wind: move one or more tiles of a horizontal or vertical line&#10;3-Jump: move your token from the tile where it is to another one next to it.&#10;&#10;The first player who jumps out of any tile on the side of his colour wins!&#10;&#10;",

They conducted unorthodox operations, such as reconnaissance, sabotage, prisoner snatches, rescue of downed airmen, ambushing the enemy, and in many cases out guerrilla-ing   the guerrillas.&#10;&#10;These missions were almost always carried out on the enemy's home turf, with the odds stacked against the interlopers. FNG: Unconventional Warfare is all about these men and the deadly missions they went on.&#10;&#10;FNG: Unconventional Warfare (UW for short) UW introduces the &quot;tactical role-playing&quot; side of FNG. UW blends the traditional role playing game with a fast and easy combat system designed for a more personal level. Combining these two aspects allows players to enjoy the cinematic aspect of role-playing while keeping the excitement of a miniatures wargame.&#10;&#10;UW has a unique campaign system that generates your Missions and links them together in a simple yet realistic way. UW also features a character advancement system that allows you to &quot;personalize&quot; your troops.&#10;&#10;And like all Two Hour Wargames rules they're designed to be played with any figures you already have and in any scale! Play solo, play on the same side, or play head-to-head it&amp;#65533;s up to you! So pull out those favorite figures, pop in your favorite 60's CD, and remember... JUST PLAY THE GAME!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This two-player strategy game is based on trying to cross the board with your pieces to get into a goal area, removing it.  The first player to get 3 of his pieces into the goal wins.&#10;&#10;The unusual mechanic to this game is that you can move any piece on your turn, yours or your opponent's, any unblocked distance on a line.  If you move your pieces, the end space must have a different number of adjacent pieces from the space where it started, while if you move an opposing piece, it must end adjacent to the same number of pieces.&#10;&#10;",

First, players progress through &quot;Desert Shield&quot;, in which they collect cards that can later be used to defeat threats.  Second, they move to &quot;Desert Storm&quot;, in which they use their cards to overcome obstacles on the board.  When a player reaches the middle of the board, they have won the game and liberated Kuwait.  &#10;If you encounter an obstacle that there is no card for, then you must restart Desert Storm.  If this happens three times in a row, then Desert Shield must be repeated as well.  There are also locations on the board that will send you back to the start.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dresda is a &lsquo;fast-play&rsquo; fantasy battle skirmish system designed for small numbers of troops yet involving more than a little role-playing on the part of the players. Indeed, unlike many conventional wargames with little or no &lsquo;role-playing&rsquo; element, in Dresda you are your units' Commander in the field, and you not only have the responsibility of commanding the unit in battle, but also the headaches of paying your troops, buying their equipment and generally trying to improve your (and their) financial position.&#10;&#10;Dresda is a scenario driven game, not points based one. This means that careful thought needs to be given to the designing of scenarios by the GM. So, although you can line up your troops on opposite sides of the table and simply advance until you bump into each other in the centre, you'll find this isn't really much fun, and you'll quickly find that your games will be much more enjoyable if you (and/or a good GM) put some effort into designing an interesting or challenging scenario.&#10;&#10;Of course, it also helps to create a feeling of unit continuity by treating your unit as a group of individuals rather than disposable 'cannon (or halberd)-fodder'. Name each of them, decide what they like to eat, drink and how they feel about their Mum, and suddenly you can see them as characters in a role-playing game, not just as troops in a &lsquo;one-off&rsquo; wargame.&#10;&#10;Over a number of games you'll see your unit develop, watch their fortunes wax and wane and individual characters come and go. Eventually you'll find that some of these factors will start to dictate your actions on the battlefield, for instance you may see &lsquo;heroic&rsquo; traits develop in one character or cowardly traits in another as the miniatures begin to become characters in their own right, and not just anonymous lumps of painted white metal.&#10;&#10;The Aim of the Game&#10;&#10;The basic aim of Dresda is to raise a small unit of fighters, fight battles and get rich!&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, whilst this basic aim is simple, it isn't necessarily easy. What's more, this is likely to be a more 'hands-on' experience than you may be used to, even in skirmish wargaming. That's because you, the Player, will take on the role of your unit's Commander, and will be represented on the battlefield by a miniature figure!&#10;&#10;",

The game comes with 5 dice: A white Tee die, a light green Fairway (F) die, a blue Water (W) die, a yellow Sand (S) die and a dark green putting (G for Green) die. Except for the putting die, the dice have letters on them indicating the next die to be cast. The putting die has numbers on it.&#10;&#10;Each hole, a player starts by rolling the Tee die (the first stroke). Subsequently, the player rolls the next die indicated by the previous die, adding one stroke to their score for each die rolled. However, when the Water die is rolled, the player adds 2 strokes instead. When the Green (G) is rolled, the player rolls the putting die and adds the number rolled to his/her score - the hole then ends for that player and his/her score is the number of strokes played. Players can play 18 holes for a full round of golf. The lowest total score wins.&#10;&#10;It's easier to get a hole-in-one in this game than in real golf - roll 'G' on the Tee die, followed by a roll of '0' on the putting die.&#10;&#10;",
