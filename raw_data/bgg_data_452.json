    "Description": "This game's theme is of a horse race held in Siena, Italy twice each summer. The city is comprised of 17 fiercely competitive neighborhoods (contrada) that each have their own flag and coat of arms (stemma). Ten of the 17 neighborhoods compete with one horse each in the race. The jockeys' garb are each inspired by their neighborhood's flag &amp; stemma. A piece of fabric is embroidered with the contrada's stemma and this item is attached to the horse's head (I presume via braiding into the mane but I do not know) A horse is disqualified if its head piece is not present at the finish. The jockeys ride bareback and carry a large riding crop called a nerbata. Although striking other horses and jockeys with the nerbata is not permitted, it does happen fairly often.  The winner of the Palio is literally the horse that crosses the finish line first, the rider is not required to be mounted. The people of the winning neighborhood brag about the victory constantly until the next race.&#10;&#10;This game is a very rare simulation of the Sienese Palio published in a sort of game collection series, the Italian &quot;Era della Guerra&quot; journal.  The journal has several pages about the game's theme which will help you understand and appreciate the game.  Example; The first question you will ask is: &quot;Why doesn't this game have a start like other games that I have played.  Its simple, in horse racing the gate opens and the horses can only run in one direction.&quot;  I'll give away the answer, in the text of the journal you will learn that there is no starting gate, just a rope pulled tight across the track.&#10;&#10;Unlike the real Palio, where only 10 &quot;contradas&quot; among 17 are allowed to participate in the horse race around Piazza del Campo, &quot;il Gioco del Palio di Siena&quot; is open to 8-17 jockeys (a player may control more than one horse). Each &quot;contrada&quot; has 2 pawns: the &quot;montata&quot; and the &quot;scossa&quot;. The first one shows the horse with its jockey, whereas the &quot;scossa&quot; shows the runaway horse without its jockey. The preliminary actions include: drawing lots for contrada and for horses &quot;tratta&quot;, holding a sealed first price auction for jockeys, establishing a secondary purse that amounts to side bets among extra hostile &quot;contradas&quot;, determining the post line up via a humorous and combative iterative process. Finally, the race starts.&#10;&#10;A rather sophisticated dice rolling system determines horse movement. There are two very sharp turns on the race-track where players must see if their horse falls or throws its rider.  Throwing a rider does not put the horse out of the race, the player replaces the &quot;montata&quot; pawn with the &quot;scossa&quot; pawn.  Players may give a nearby Horse-Jockey a wack with their club-like nerbata.  However, wacking another horse-jockey with your nerbata can back fire on you. It is a good idea for the Player to hold back enough money from the earlier game phases to bribe other Jockeys during the race.  The race-track is divided into 293 boxes, each with a number.  The numbers on the spaces determine the turn order within each round, which is important in most all racing games. The numbers are distributed in a manner so that there is a logical best path.  A horse that can get on this best path will gain ground on the leaders and the leader can pull away from the pack, unless another player has bribed the jockey!!  Il gioco del Palio di Siena lasts for 3 complete laps.&#10;&#10;Nell&rsquo;ora di Sunto (the bell in the Mangia tower), al tempo della Gloria!&#10;&#10;",

Ships have enough detail to make them interesting and distinctive, but not so much that they each need record sheets to keep track of them. This should allow small games of a dozen ships per side to be played as enjoyably and effectively as giant games.&#10;&#10;Battleshift refers to starships shifting in and out of hyperspace during the battle. Though it is a staple of sci-fi, few games really let players use hyperspace tactically. With good planning, squadrons and taskforces can leap from one part of the battle to another, escaping from certain destruction or closing a trap on an enemy taskforce.&#10;&#10;Battleshift also features a suppression system, which causes squadrons to lose accuracy as they take fire.&#10;&#10;Fleets are bought at the start of the game, based on a point cost system. Fleets are composed of Taskforces, which are in turn composed of Squadrons. Each squadron may have 1 - 7 ships that must stay within 6&rdquo; of each other.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "King Coal was produced by Westar Mining (a now-defunct Canadian company) as a promotional game, although it is unclear how many copies ended up being distributed, or to whom.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player proceeds through a series of initial phases in order to get an operating coal mine - exploration to find coal deposits (either small or large), proving-up, capitalization (capitalizing a small mine brings less cash, but requires a smaller winning total as well), and construction.&#10;&#10;After a player has finished construction, his or her mine begins production, which is the main part of the game. Each turn, the inflation rate is determined, each player decides whether to run their mine at full production, reduced production, or not at all, and pays the appropriate costs. There are costs for labor, ports, rail, power, and equipment.  After costs are paid, market price is determined and players collect revenue. There are card decks associated with production and marketing which may affect results (there are also cards for earlier phases).&#10;&#10;Players can purchase various assets to produce better results or avoid bad events - they can buy production contracts, marketing contracts, pollution control systems, and insurance policies. Also available are assets associated with all costs except labor - a player purchasing one of these receives the appropriate costs each turn instead of the bank. These assets can be taken over by other players.&#10;&#10;There is also a simplified version of the game which begins in the construction phase and eliminates some of the event cards and minor assets.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Pentagon Game is a simple wargame on the Vietnam War. The four players (rules are also provided for two or three) represent the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), South Vietnamese Army (ARVN), Viet Cong (VC), and the US Armed Forces. There are also civilian units. The map shows North and South Vietnam plus adjacent areas on a square grid.&#10;&#10;The system has more of the flavor of an abstract strategy game than a typical wargame. Units have low movement allowances (1 or 2), although regular armed forces can move greater distances by road or rail. Combat is deterministic.&#10;&#10;Some of the VC player's units start mixed in with the civilian units, only he or she knowing which ones they are. To fight, they must be revealed. The US and ARVN players can attack civilians if they think they are VC, but if they are wrong the VC player gets to add more concealed VC to the game. If the VC/civilian ratio becomes too skewed the ARVN player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The goal for the NVA and VC players is to occupy a certain value of cities on South Vietnam. The US and ARVN players win by either occupying enough cities in North Vietnam and reducing the VC level, or by eliminating all overt VC units and clearing South Vietnam of NVA units.&#10;&#10;There are some additional game elements, such as a deck of event cards which can be drawn in lieu of one's turn (or if an incursion of Laos occurs), reinforcements, and the possibility of Chinese Army forces entering.&#10;&#10;The game is packaged in a red folder which pretends to be a CIA briefing folder. In addition to the game rules, the booklet inside the folder contains &quot;briefing&quot; materials - a time line of the Vietnam conflict, analysis of the phases of insurgency, and a (somewhat satirical) glossary. Attached to the folder are a counter sheet containing 782 counters (all the same color), a map, and a sheet of 28 event cards.&#10;&#10;",

All too often, science fiction films and games assume that starships will behave in the same way as terrestrial ships or aircraft. The truth is quite different as you will see. Once you have played one or two games, the movement rules will become second nature; they're actually much simpler than those used by most other games.&#10;&#10;Rules, counters, map, and ship record cards are freely available in Adobe PDF format.&#10;&#10;",

With this in mind we have adopted a number of basic standards throughout.  All die rolls are made on a single d6 (with high numbers indicating a favorable result), modifiers are kept to a minimum, and realism is achieved using scenarios rather than &quot;point value&quot; forces.  It is our belief that the man is more important than the weapon he uses, consequently you will not find endless tables of technical data on various rifles etc., only generic weapon types.  It is the way the weapon is used, and the quality of the soldiery using it, that affects the outcome of the situation.&#10;&#10;",

The theme of the game is a race to the finish around through the village of Odorville. Players evade traps set by with a lively the naughty skunk StinkySmellsTM who makes the players smell different smells as they move around the board.&#10;&#10;Odorville is made up of different venues where people today encounter smell. Rigorous market testing among kids and parents help identify the venues. The game starts out at a farm and then proceeds to the beach, garbage dump, laundry, candle shops, restaurants, outdoors, garages and ends at the carnival. The board is littered with over 300 elements of smell. Another innovative idea on the board is a changing path which changes according to the landscape the player is currently on. In the farm the player is on a dirt track which changes to grass in the maze, sand on the beach till it ends in cobble stones at the carnival. The best part of the game is not the board or the lovable characters but the scratch and sniff smell cards.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 45 cards &ndash; 30 of them with smell and 15 cards that have no smell but require the player to identify things that smell on the board. The smell cards are broken in to 3 categories &ndash; good, bad and mystery. The game comes with smells like skunk, manure, peppermint, BBQ sauce, popcorn etc. Additional refill packs can be purchased with different smells or different themes.&#10;&#10;",

A ball of the same color is attached to the disk via a 12 foot length of twine. An outside player (&quot;the umpire&quot;) uses a spinner to direct the players how to loop their ball-on-a-string around another player's body part. For example, if the spinner indicates &quot;Yellow, Left Leg,&quot; then the current player must loop their ball-on-a-string around the Yellow player's left leg. Play continues until only one player is left who is able to complete an indicated move.&#10;&#10;Tagline from the box: &quot;The most hilarious... knottiest... fun game for the whole family.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
