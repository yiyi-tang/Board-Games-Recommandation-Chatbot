Some cards are marked as scoring cards, and when the fourth scoring card is drawn, a new farm is scored.

In Fossilis, 2 to 5 players become paleontologists working the dig site with shovels, whisk brooms, and chisels looking for a find that could make their career.&#10;&#10;Each round, players get two actions to dig at the site or make an extraction. As they remove the top layers of sand, clay, and stone, they'll discover trace fossils, which can be exchanged for tools, the plaster necessary to extract bones, and discovery points. As they delve deeper, precious bones will be exposed. They can make a careful extraction if they have the right amount of plaster, but sometimes shifting the earth to cover up a find and slow down the competition is the right move. Bones on their own can be valuable, but museums are really interested in more complete specimens. Sets of bones can be exchanged for museum cards worth big points!&#10;&#10;Fossilis features a unique 3D dig site board, with recessed pockets filled with dinosaur bones, and thick, chunky terrain tiles that cover the dig site. Players have to use strategy, timing, and a little bit of luck if they want to make the best discoveries, get their name in all the paleontology journals, and of course, win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Note: The Kickstarter edition supports solo play and includes other game related content.

It is as close and yet far from Chinese Mahjong as Sh&ocirc;gi (Japanese Chess) can be the same and yet different from original Chess. Mahjong was brought to Japan in 1904, but the Riichi form that is used in modern times probably originated from the 1920s. Today, the worldwide famous Mahjong Association officially recognized the complete rules of Riichi Mahjong for Tournaments.&#10;&#10;The main differences are :&#10;1) The 1-Yaku minimum: In order to win a hand, it can only be validated when your hand has at least one of the Yaku (specific hand combinations) in it.&#10;2) Dora: A specific bonus tiles are indicated by the flipped tile from the dead wall and providing other possible Han bonus.&#10;3) Riichi: When a player is Tenpai (one tile away from having a Mahjong hand, valid or not), he can bet a 1000 points chip to add one Yaku to his hand (thus validating a possible invalid hand).  Winning with a Riichi hand allows access to the hidden ura-dora, which is an added dora indicator located underneath the revealed dora tile.&#10;4) Abortive draws: Specific conditions, which ends a hand without winning prior to the drawing of all tiles, aside from the dead wall.&#10;5) Scoring system: Much more complex than in Chinese Mahjong, it is based on hand combinations (Yaku) providing multipliers (Han) that combine with some other circumstantial points like the type of tiles in the hand (Fu) for any 4 han or less.  The combination of Han and Fu correspond to a chart (and even an equation) to finally produce the hand's scoring points (Ten).&#10;&#10;Some other minor elements in the Riichi Mahjong differ from the original Mahjong but are not important enough to be fully mentioned, like the Red 5 tiles (a non-official variant sometimes used which gives bonus like the Dora) or the validation of some Yaku (when the hand must be kept hidden or not, depending on the Japanese region where the game is played).&#10;&#10;",

In this dexterity/stacking game with a whimsical theme and beautiful design, players take turns rolling a die to determine how they must place their wooden ladder (it must touch one other ladder, two other ladders, or be the highest point. Ladders will shift as more pieces are added, adding an element of suspense and unpredictability. Raindrops are given to players whose ladders cause the structure to collapse; the winner is the player with the least amount of raindrops at the end of the game!&#10;&#10;",

Initially the temples offer up victory points or some form of in-game bonus. When the final token is taken, a relic is placed there to be collected. The players earn large victory points for collecting relics of different types (set collection) and players can also earn bonus points for creating long routes and traveling along these to collect relics.&#10;&#10;",

Running trains earns money and this money is either divided by the shareholders or kept in the company's treasure for further investments (like buying better trains or constructing track). This decision influences the value of the company's shares &mdash; and not the player with the most stock or the most beautiful constructed track wins the game, but the player with the most riches in terms of cash and shares.&#10;&#10;18CZ is unique as it uses three different corporation sizes, five small companies with 50%-25%-25% shares, five medium companies with 40%-20%-20%-20% shares, and five big companies with the usual 20%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10% share distribution. Each company size has a different set of trains, and the key focus in this game is that bigger companies can absorb smaller companies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Xenon is a valuable noble gas that is found in very trace amounts in Earth's atmosphere. Due to the difficulty and expense of isolating high-purity Xenon for various technological advancements in recent years, the need for Cryogenic Distillation of Xenon is on the rise.&#10;&#10;Xenon Profiteer is a highly thematic, deck-deconstruction, euro game for 2-4 entrepreneurs in which each player takes control of their own Air Separation Facility and distills Xenon from their Systems to complete lucrative contracts. You will also physically expand your facility by building upgrades, pipelines, and acquiring new contracts and connecting them to your Center Console.&#10;&#10;In a decidedly different take on the classic deck-building format, Xenon Profiteer not only actively encourages players to remove cards from their decks, it is absolutely essential in order to isolate Xenon. Each turn begins by strategically removing cards from your hand (and deck) through Distilling based on the real-world hierarchy of elements. The goal: only have Xenon remaining in your hand. The problem is, of course, the only way to gain more Xenon, is to bring in more AIR. And AIR is composed of all kinds of other pesky elements that make isolating Xenon difficult.&#10;&#10;To combat this, you will need to Buy powerful upgrade cards for your facility in order to become more efficient. These upgrade cards can either be purchased for a lower cost and placed into your system (deck) or installed directly to your facility to be used every turn for the remainder of the game. Or maybe, if you are low on funds, you might decide to place a Bid Token onto an important Upgrade or Contract, thereby giving yourself a discount on a future turn and causing other players to pay YOU extra if they decide to purchase it instead.&#10;&#10;After a player has either completed five contracts or installed five upgrades, the game end is triggered and the player with the most Xenon points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Do you have the ingenuity, strategy, and tactical fortitude it takes to be recognized by several reputable business publications as the owner of the most influential domestic supplier of Xenon?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "They ravaged their Mother, the Earth, and bound Her with sorcerous chains. The moon caught fire; the sun froze. In the veins of the world, her lifeblood choked to dust. The oceans boiled to miasmas that clotted the skies. Rocks fanged up from the stubble of dying forests. As She began to rot, Her creatures, Her children, survived as best they could. Tearing at each other, prowling in Her fetid hollows, breeding abominations. Feasting on Her, Fungi and moulds become sentient.&#10;&#10;And, as the ages pass, some lineages of men grow monstrous, even as others diminish, weaken and become easily their slaves. These &quot;higher&quot; men feed on the lesser, growing in strength, and hurl their tribes one upon the other in terrible truceless wars &mdash; until one tribe crushes the others into kneeling submission, under a lord, nameless save for his title: Tyrant!&#10;&#10;But though decayed, She was not slain. With the little strength remaining, She seduces Worm; the least, the most abject of those creatures bred for meat. Unlikely savior, through sorcery, and helped by unlooked for allies, Worm follows the thread of his fate to Her. If he can free Her, Her blood will spout into a flood and frenzy of returning Life. And her hatred will swell Worm into being Her champion, Her consort, and Her AVENGER, the Horned God!&#10;&#10;Based on the graphic novels by the acclaimed Adrian Smith, HATE is a highly kinetic, endlessly brutal campaign game of post-apocalyptic survival. Up to six players battle through a multi-game Chronicle where they use their unique clan to savagely plunder, mutilate, and demoralize their opponents. Death is permanent for clan members; once they die, they are out of the game. The player who most expertly uses savagery (gained by doing unspeakable violence upon their foes) to upgrade their warriors and resources (gained by plundering the land) to unlock powerful new abilities from their village will win the game, but only the player with the most hate will become the Tyrant and rule over the rest!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You decide to ride your mount one final time before the snows come to buy and sell as much as you can...and maybe even collect some precious pearls along the way.&#10;&#10;Whale Riders is a new design with a classic feel from game designer Reiner Knizia. In 45 minutes of play, 2-6 players race to the end of the Ice Coast and back, buying and selling as many resources as possible to make the money needed to acquire the richest prizes. Will you skip opportunities to gain the greatest treasure, or will you make your money slowly along the way?&#10;&#10;Each player has two actions per turn, but a lot they want to accomplish. Sail? Buy? Sell? Draw more order cards? All the while, your opponents might be sailing past and beating you to what's on offer down the coast! Once all the precious pearls have been purchased, the game ends and the player with the most pearls wins!&#10;&#10;Whale Riders has simple and short rules, but offers a lot of interaction and interesting decisions for players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;",

He can repeat a school year and get new friends, start smoking, take part in a Bible discussion group and have his first sexual intercourse during Oktoberfest &ndash; all very realistic. Every event in the life of a character has some effect on his main characteristics - tobacco addiction, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, wealth, health, sadness, spirituality and wisdom. Excess comes at a price, though, and when a characteristic gets too high, it cancels another one &ndash; if you smoke too much, you get thin; if you get too fat, you must stop drinking; if you drink too much you lose your wisdom, and so on &ndash; once more, very realistic. During game, you can get friends, and often more, with other player&rsquo;s characters. This is an important feature in the game, since what happens to you usually affects, in good or bad, your friends, and this is one of the main interaction aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;Description from Bruno Faidutti's ideal game library.&#10;&#10;",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Pok&eacute;mon is a Collectible Card Games based upon Japanese anime that have found success internationally, and is one of the longest surviving CCGs currently available. Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering.&#10;&#10;Many people who buy the product often do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.&#10;&#10;Each player plays the role of a Pok&eacute;mon trainer that use their Pok&eacute;mon creatures to battle the Pok&eacute;mon creatures of the other Pok&eacute;mon trainer.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, and be the first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that include your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players, or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.&#10;&#10;You start the game by drawing seven cards to your hand.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prize cards.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.&#10;&#10;Players take alternating turns during which they can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a card from their deck to their hand&#10;     Play Actions:&#10;         Put Basic Pok&eacute;mon in play from their hand to their Bench&#10;         Evolve their Pok&eacute;mon&#10;         Attach an Energy card to one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)&#10;         Play Trainer cards (Only 1 Stadium card and 1 Supporter card per turn)&#10;         Retreat their Active Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn - trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards))&#10;         Use Abilities&#10;    &#10;     Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.&#10;&#10;The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.&#10;&#10;There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.  Gotta collect 'em all!&#10;&#10;",

After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.   In addition, several other tracks are available - there are two course collections which can be purchased separately and a third (web-published) collection.&#10;&#10;",

If they can fit this shape in their grid, they do continue normally next round; otherwise they are eliminated from play.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players have been eliminated, the deck of puzzle cards has run out, or a player has completely filled their grid.

    "Description": "Spire's End is a solo and cooperative card game with enemy encounters, interactive story-driven scenarios, and high-end art &amp; design.  It's a unique gaming experience without a lot of baggage. Simple set-up, intuitive rules, and minimal components. No DM, no bookkeeping or character sheet. Just you, an oversized deck of cards, dice and cube markers.&#10;&#10;I am trying to harness my childhood entertainment, raw, analog and unknown. My influences include a wide range of childhood nostalgia like &rsquo;70s D&amp;D, Planet of the Apes, The Time Machine and Land of the Lost. There are hints of Zork, Monkey Island, and &rsquo;80s-&rsquo;90s fanzines.&#10;&#10;It should feel like something tucked away in the closet for decades that you just discovered. Admittedly with some modern aesthetics&hellip;, we will pretend it&rsquo;s ahead of its time.&#10;&#10;It's the grisly tale of a strange tower that emerges in the heart of a bustling Viking city. The townsfolk have vanished. It&rsquo;s up to you to mount a rescue and unravel the mystery at any cost.&#10;&#10;You move through the game like a book. But in this case, it's a stack of ominous cards. Flip them over, make difficult choices and let the story unfold. You have 7 adventurers (7 chances) to face the countless dangers of the spire. The core gameplay mechanics revolve around combat.&#10;&#10;To perform actions &amp; attacks it will cost characters hit points. Every action is a risk. To execute stronger attacks you will need to spend more hit points. This makes for tense, close, ruthless battles. Higher risk garners greater rewards, but at a higher cost. Choose your actions carefully!&#10;&#10;This is a Six-Chapter adventure, each of which includes a major encounter, loot, choices, dice events and a lot of surprises!&#10;&#10;",

Each player's board has a different combination of colors and required moves, so blue on one board might be go straight one block, while someone else goes two blocks and a third player must make a turn. Players make their moves in turn on the shared map board, then mark the icons of what they've seen at various intersections on their player board. Different types of riders all score differently, and placing checks on your personal board for passengers and areas (sight-seeing spots, stations, universities) before other players do can earn you extra bonus points, so strategically planning your route while keeping in mind your main destinations is very important.

Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their cable cars), and (3) the souvenirs that they've collected, with a full set of seven souvenirs being worth 12 points.

In Epic, the turn sequence is easy but there are many options to choose from. You begin the game with a hand of five cards &ndash; each card costs either one gold or is free. You get one gold each turn &mdash; you don&rsquo;t need to draw special resource cards or energy cards just to play with your other cards. Instead of figuring out which cards you might be allowed to play, you choose which card you want to play.&#10;&#10;Epic is non-collectable, so every box contains the same 120 unique event and champion cards, with 8 double-sided cards to represent temporary &quot;token&quot; champions. One box supports preconstructed, sealed and draft formats for 2-4 players, two boxes up to 8 players, and three if you want to create a full constructed deck or a &quot;cube&quot; environment for drafting.&#10;&#10;",

As an aristocrat in the late 19th century, you have bought land, hired a gardener and set out to find the best plants there are.&#10;As you know, the visitors are very picky about the plants they want to see, so your job is not only to acquire the plants, but also to sort them according to the visitors' preferences.&#10;In Botanicus, you compete for the best action-spots in a unique selection mechanism, and then make the most of the options available to you. You have to collect new plants, take care of them, water them and keep an eye on the gardener. Last but not least, you have to collect some money along the way to pay for all this.&#10;In the end, what counts is how many visitors you satisfy and how beautiful your garden is.

    "Description": "Key Harvest is the fifth game in the key series of games published by R&amp;D Games.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to score the most points.  Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board.  One point is scored for each field tile in the player's largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group.&#10;&#10;Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board.  The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.  When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action.  Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands.  There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player.&#10;&#10;There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry.  On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters.  The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player's store.  On their turn the other players may match the store owner's bid in both the number and type of crop counters.  If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner.  If no other player has matched the store owner's bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.&#10;&#10;When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.&#10;&#10;When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker's ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.&#10;&#10;Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).  A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a).&#10;&#10;Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag.  The bag also contains a number of event tiles.  The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile.  When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played.&#10;&#10;One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game.  No points are awarded for ties.  Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board.  The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Nr. 4 in the QWG Master Print Edition series, as Demetra&#10;&#10;",

Once everyone does this, draw the topmost level card to see whether players suffer damage from the monster on it. Players can then decide whether to leave the round and bank their treasures, or whether to press on; if they go on, they draw another treasure card, then reveal the next level card. If you take total damage equal to your number of hearts, you fail and are out of the round, losing any treasure that you had.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has left the round, whether by being knocked out or by passing and banking their treasures, players can buy building cards, such as bowling alleys, arcades, and soap makers. Buildings cost 1-5 treasures, and you must pay different treasures when buying a building that costs more than 1. Each building gives a one-time or permanent effect. Maybe you'll collect jump tokens that you can use to clear monsters so that you don't take damage; maybe you'll acquire a hospital that gives you coins when neighboring players fail the level; maybe you'll buy more hearts to let you run farther in the future; and maybe you'll collect coins, which can be the most precious item of all since the game ends after the round that someone collects 20 coins.

    "Description": "Dead Cells: The Rogue-Lite Board Game is a dungeon-crawler that offers a cooperative rogue-lite experience inspired by the Metroidvania genre, playable with 1-4 players, and with a gameplay of around 45 minutes. Explore the ever-changing island of Dead Cells in this ruthless dungeon crawler. Explore. Kill. Die. Mutate. Repeat.&#10;&#10;Choose one of the four Beheaded (Woah, hold on... Isn't it supposed to be only one of these guys? Is this one of those stupid time-loop plots?) As you resurrect with very little clue of what&rsquo;s going on, you will...&#10;&#10;&bull; Explore Biomes. Choose your path wisely within a sprawling, ever-changing castle! Will you upgrade one of the character powers with a scroll? Or will you choose a chest to equip a new weapon? Will you find the hidden runes that will open new paths and access new biomes? This won&rsquo;t be a walk in the park, though. Because the island is infested with the abominations born from the Malaise, be ready to&hellip;&#10;&#10;&bull; Kill Enemies. Each character class has unique power sets and a deck of action cards. For each enemy encounter, you will only need to pick one action card to cover all three phases of a fight. Loot equipment, gold, scrolls, and Cells from the corpses of your enemies and get stronger, but beware... Your health pool is limited and sooner or later you will...&#10;&#10;&bull; Die. Wandering through enemy-infested dungeons isn't the safest activity, even for your beheaded heroes. There will eventually be one monster too many, or you could step on a fatal trap and lose all your scrolls, equipment, and accumulated gold. But this is far from the end for you! Even in death you will be able to keep your precious Cells to&hellip;&#10;&#10;&bull; Mutate. The Collector will let you spend your Cells to buy permanent mutations that will give you more power... forever! Choose cards to buy from three different decks: Brutality, Survival, or Tactics. Get action cards to enhance your card deck. Find blueprints to grow your loot deck. Increase your health pool. Unlock additional item slots, and much more&hellip; Unless you prefer to throw your Cells into this mysterious well... It seems like a pretty stupid thing to do with your hard-earned Cells, but hey, you do you, bud... Death is no excuse to take a nap, so...&#10;&#10;&bull; Repeat. Death is not the end either! You&rsquo;ve already lost your head, remember!? As the day starts again in a new loop, use your new permanent mutations to exact revenge on whatever killed you last time. Go further and deeper into the island and kill the bosses to access new starting biomes. Previously-played biomes keep changing as stronger monstrosities spawn in them, along with powerful new items. (Damn! Will this game ever end?)&#10;&#10;Official Dead Cells page for FAQ / Rules / Player Aids downloads: https://deadcellstheboardgame.com/FAQ/&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Dragon's Gold, each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they have only one goal: gold, silver, jewels and magic objects. As for actually killing a dragon? It's a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.&#10;&#10;As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds. The Black Diamond is worth 19 points [in the 2011 edition], but negates a player's score for all colored gems.)&#10;&#10;",

The core rules are fairly straightforward, and a game can be completed in 90 minutes. The game is played over three turns; in each turn you whizz around the planets and moons claiming tiles. The tiles grant you cards, allow you to build a factory or mine, let you hunt strange beasts, or simply earn you some money. Other tiles allow you to attack other players or add to the crisis level on the planet/moon in question. You have to be careful with crisis tiles as if you let too many build up, bad stuff &mdash; Martian invasions, robot rebellions, space pirates, etc. &mdash; starts happening.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The zombies have taken over in City of the Living, a new edition of the game first released as Prosperity. We must rebuild, but amongst the masses of dead, our cities of the living must do it better than they did in the past. Hold off the zombies and build up your territory to be declared the best leader!&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;Prosperity&#10;&#10;You're the leader of a great nation which is currently expanding. Over the course of the seven decades covered by the game, you will have to invest in infrastructures and industries, provide your country with energy and invest in advanced research in order to remain competitive &mdash; but prosperity has a price. You owe it to future generations to leave them a healthy world. Pollution lurks, but will you be able to limit it?&#10;&#10;Prosperity has players building up their countries on a grand but abstract scale, with them needing to balance concerns over energy and ecology with the constant need for capital and the long-term goal of prosperity points.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 24 tiles available, half on the energy side of the shared game board and half on the ecology side. Two tiles on each side are placed on levels 1-6, with the players each having two research markers &ndash; energy and ecology &ndash; that start at level 1. Each player has an individual game board with color-coded spaces for tiles, a pollution track, and tracks for energy and ecology. A stack of 36 tiles &ndash; with tiles arranged by decades: the six from 2030 on the bottom, then the five from 2020, and so on to the five from 1970 &ndash; is set up during the playing area.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top tile from the stack, then everyone resolves the symbol highlighted on the tile:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Energy &ndash; for a positive value, earn money; for a negative value, lose money or increase your pollution&#10;    Ecology &ndash; remove or add discs to your pollution track&#10;    Capital &ndash; earn money for each capital symbol on the tiles you own&#10;    Research &ndash; advance one research marker one space for each research symbol on tiles you own&#10;    Prosperity &ndash; score points for each prosperity symbol on tiles you own, but only if your pollution isn't maxed out&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has done this, the active player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take money.&#10;    Remove one pollution marker.&#10;    Move forward one space on one research track.&#10;    Buy a tile, with the amount owed being based on whether the tile is energy or ecology and the level of your corresponding research marker. If you buy a tile of the same level, the cost is &euro;100; if the tile is of a higher level, you pay &euro;100, plus &euro;100 for each level; and if the tile is lower, you pay a flat &euro;50.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players have limited space for tiles on their individual boards, especially since the tiles and spaces are color-coded, but players can cover existing tiles, if desired, losing any benefits (or penalties) in the process. Some parts of the individual board are off-limits to new infrastructure until you first provide transport; toll roads, highways and even train systems have drawbacks of their own, but ideally you'll be able to build your way past those trouble spots without causing too much pollution.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is drawn, that player finishes his turn, then everyone scores: twice for their energy and ecology levels, one for capital (with money being converted into prosperity points), once for research on both tracks (with points for those researching the most), and once for prosperity. Whoever tallies the most prosperity points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Outnumbered and out-gunned, the French were defeated and forced to retreat. But later that same day, French reinforcements arrived under General Desaix, and in what amounted to a second battle the French counter-attacked and won, taking thousands of prisoners and driving the Austrians from the field.&#10;&#10;Thus was won the battle of which Napoleon was always the most proud &ndash; Marengo.&#10;&#10;Bonaparte at Marengo recreates that dramatic battle. The game is simple and fast-playing, departing from almost all of the standard conventions of wargaming in order to achieve the look and feel of nineteenth century linear warfare.&#10;&#10;In the summer of 2007, a sequel with a modified system was released: Napoleon's Triumph&#10;&#10;",

Gold Rush Hysteria was pulsing through the veins of the country and tens of thousands were willing to risk it all for the chance to &quot;have it all&quot;.&#10;&#10;Lost Valley is a game about the Klondike stampede that rushed North. It's about the grueling journey: traversing Steep Mountain passes with heavy loads, through severe weather, and ever-dwindling resources.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, players must explore the ever-expanding lost valley in hopes of discovering a gold vein in a mountain, a virgin forest to provide timber or a fishing spot along the river to provide food. The map will be different each time you play, so you never know what lurks around the corner.&#10;&#10;As you set out from the outfitters with everything you own strapped to your back, you must balance carefully the resources that you need. Of course you will need tools, dynamite and timber to extract mountain gold, but you'll need to make sure you have room for food, rifles and fishing poles to help you survive in the wilderness.&#10;&#10;Grab your horse, your pack, and your whiskey because &quot;The Gold Fever is Raging&quot; in the Yukon.

In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess.

They work to achieve various goals by constructing buildings within the town, adventuring throughout the region, navigating relationships with the mysterious sprites who inhabit the valley, and developing their character-specific professions.&#10;&#10;As an open-ended game, Mythwind has no distinct conclusion. Although many players may find a natural end point to their game at the conclusion of the story, players can continue to play the game for as long as they would like over as many game sessions as they wish. As players progress through the game, their town will develop and grow, reacting to changing seasons and to the members of the community over time. Progress made can be easily saved using the provided game trays, which offer a quick and easy solution for both tear-down of the current game and setup of future games.&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the first player to successfully create 7 or more honey tokens in their hive. It's up to you how to achieve this: Do you focus on nectar collection, increasing your bee population, expanding your hive, seeking favor with the queen, or splitting your resources to accomplish all of these? Whatever you choose, the natural world is a competitive environment and you can be sure the other players will be looking to maximize their advantage.&#10;&#10;Waggle Dance is designed to be a highly accessible language independent game with a simple rule-sheet appealing to all levels of gamers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Matter swirls around a new born star, coalescing on the planetoids that orbit it. Planets evolve, grow and migrate in their orbits, forming a unique solar system by the end of every game. Planetarium is a game of creation, chaos and terraforming on the grandest scale.&#10;&#10;Players are competing to crash combinations of elements onto planets that then allow them to play cards to evolve the planets in a variety of ways, with each player looking to evolve planets in the system to suit their own secret endgame goals.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player will firstly move a matter or planet token in a clockwise direction around the star. The board is mapped with a series of lines, tracing orbits around the star, and it is along these lines that the tokens are moved. If a matter token moves onto a space occupied by planet token then the matter token is placed on the player's mat (on the respective planet). In the same way, planets can also be moved onto matter tokens, placing the matter tokens on the player's mat.&#10;&#10;In the second part of a turn a player can play Evolution cards from their hand at the cost of the matter tokens they have collected on their player mat (some cards have other special requirements to play). If a player plays a card, they score the cards points and check to see if their card has changed the state of the planet from hostile to habitable by checking the total habitable and hostile points played to the planet (some end game goals require planets to be hostile or habitable). The player may then draw a card from one of three decks, Low Evolution (cards that score less points but require less matter to play), High Evolution (cards that score more and are harder to play), and Final Evolution (cards that can only be played on a player's final turn).&#10;&#10;The thematics of the game have been developed with an eye on the science, led by a scientist working on NASA's search for life on Mars. Evolution cards thematically include all kinds of planetary phenomenon, from asteroid impacts, atmospheric effects, to geological events. Final Evolution cards mark the relatively stable state a planet is in at the end of the solar system's development and include classifications for the final planets such as Hot Jupiter or an uninhabitable frozen dwarf planet.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a beautiful game board with handfuls of matter tokens, approximately 36 Evolution cards and 16 Final Evolution cards (all with unique space art and flavor), player mats, and player and score markers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Winston Churchill once said - &quot;The Balkans produce more history than they can consume.&quot; And the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina showed just that. The war that erupted in the spring of 1992 brought bitter fighting, indiscriminate shelling of civilians and a wave of atrocities. The war was fought by: three local ethnic groups (Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats), paramilitary formations from Serbia and Krajina, Croatian armed forces, foreign Muslim volunteers, UN peacekeepers, and NATO airforce. Events such as the Siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre became iconic of the conflict, as the war became the single most important historical event in Balkans since the WW2. And still - it's objective history has yet to be written.&#10;&#10;Brotherhood &amp; Unity is a 2-3 player card driven wargame which depicts the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992-1995 (&quot;Bosnian War&quot;). The game shows all of the major events: from the siege of Sarajevo (shown in separate, detailed map), to the ferocious battles for the Posavina corridore, and desperate defence of the Bosniak enclaves. Main features are: Point-To-Point movement system, play driven by Strategy Cards, quick combat resolution (no CRT),  streamlined rules and fast gameplay. Interaction between warring sides (Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats) creates an intensive and exciting gameplay experience.&#10;&#10;Player's military strength fluctuates based on historical facts, with Serbs starting superior in all aspects, and Bosniaks struggling to organize an effective fighting formation. Military units represent Brigades - standard military formations of the time, ranging from 1500-2000 soldiers. They have different combat and movement values (based on historical data), which forces players to use different tactics for different opponents. Majority of these units are non-motorized infantry formations (moving only several spaces per round), but with the use of special offensive cards players can increase their mobility and surprise the opponents.&#10;&#10;The game simulates three distinct sides in the war: Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats - with no clear border separating them. That provides an interesting set of choices to players: to attack or to fortify, whom to ally with, and when to change sides. That leads to many turnarounds and pragmatical alliances with former enemies - as was historically the case.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a deck of Strategy Cards, simulating a variety of historical events. The player starts an action round by playing a Strategy Card from his hand. A card can be played as an event (Combat Card, Offensive, Interrupt, Foreign Units and Other) or as one of the game actions (Movement, Attack, Strategic Redeployment, Diplomatic Action or Reinforcement). The events and card values have been carefully created to mimic the historical events and choices. Since each game uses only a part of the available card deck, players can't be certain which cards will be drawn during the game. That creates a &quot;card fog-of-war&quot; and makes the game more replayable.&#10;&#10;Game uses Strategic Will point system to keep track of the victories and losses, and to determine the final score. It is affected by a number of things: capturing or losing regions, capturing or losing key spaces, eliminating or losing units, and as a result of events. One of the most important aspects of the game is capturing player's own key regions - which were different for each side, and which reflects the different aims the each side had.&#10;&#10;The Foreign Attitude is another major track in the game which represents the diplomatic stance of foreign powers (European countries, USA, Russia, and UN) towards a player. It is affected by capturing cities (thus creating refugee crisis) and as a result of events, and generally represents a player's international reputation. When it reaches certain levels, negative effects occur - from reduction of movement, to NATO air strikes, to even losing the game.&#10;&#10;The game enables player to invite United Nations to create UN Safe Areas, thus giving a player some kind of protection from being overrun. NATO Air Strike happens when players overreach themselves, capturing too many cities too quickly, thus creating a major refugee crisis and media outcry. Without careful diplomatic balancing, the greatest offensive can thus be derailed and bring a player to the brink of destruction.&#10;&#10;Supplies are scarce and can be cut-off, thus starving and eventually eliminating the unsupplied units. Combat results are easy to calculate, and are based on unit attack and defence values modified by terrain and die roll results (no CRT is used). Rules are streamlined to reduce clutter and unnecessary actions, which enables a fast gameplay - the full game is usually played in bit over two hours.&#10;&#10;The name &quot;Brotherhood and Unity&ldquo; comes from a socialist Yugoslavia doctrine created to inspire unity between 7 nations from which Yugoslavia was created. It was also a main motto behind the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina &ndash; nicknamed &bdquo;Small Yugoslavia&ldquo; due to its ethnical, cultural and religious diversity. The irony is that when B&amp;H got engulfed in a war, there was neither brotherhood nor unity to be found .. what followed was four years of bloody warfare. It remains to be seen will B&amp;H rise above the legacy of The War and reach (or surpass) the prosperity it enjoyed during a socialist Yugoslavia.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;Solitaire suitability: 5 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 1 year per turn, 2 months per action round&#10;Map Scale: Point-to-point strategic level&#10;Unit Scale: Brigades&#10;Number of Players: 2 to 3&#10;Suitability for Solitaire: Medium&#10;Average Time to Play: 2 to 3 hours&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1 22&quot;x34&quot; Mounted Map&#10;260 9/16&quot; Counters&#10;96 Strategy cards (in 3 decks: Serbian, Croatian and Bosniak)&#10;3 Player aid cards&#10;1 Rulebook&#10;1 Ten-sided die&#10;1 Box and lid set&#10;&#10;",

Each Ranger comes with a unique combat deck representing their special skills and fighting style. From the Red Ranger's leadership karate skills, to the Yellow Ranger's Sabertooth ferocity, to the Blue Ranger's tactical mind, each ranger brings a unique set of skills to the table. You need to use your powers well if you intend to save Angel Grove!&#10;&#10;In each game, you need to protect four combat zones that are being targeted by the evil Rita Repulsa. Each round, enemy forces deploy onto these zones and cause chaos among the populace. Who knows what sort of strange monsters Rita has cooked up for the Rangers this time?&#10;&#10;During play, Rangers must manage their actions and coordinate their defenses, moving to the locations under the most threat and doing battle with enemies. Finding time to rest and recover between engagements as they prepare to defeat the mastermind behind this plot.&#10;&#10;During battle, each Ranger and each enemy in the location participate in the combat sequence. Enemy cards represent enemy actions and health. Rangers can attack these cards to disrupt their attacks. Each minion card the rangers defeat removes one minion figure from that location. Monsters are much deadlier foes with a variety of special attacks that you'll need to deal with and defeat before you send them packing! A Ranger's combat deck represents their health, with each card played and blow sustained slowly whittling away at their options. They'll need to find time to rest or power-up at the Command Center if they want to stay fresh for the next fight!&#10;&#10;As the Rangers defeat enemies and progress through the game, they'll unlock Zord cards which provide them unique abilities and special actions they can perform. Eventually they'll be able to unleash the full power of the mighty Megazord!&#10;&#10;Each game reaches its climax with a confrontation with the enemy Master, a devastatingly powerful foe who must be thwarted if the Rangers wish to save the city!

They manage all the events happening during the game, and try to stop the Hero from completing his objectives.&#10;&#10;The Hero can only see the Sector of the map he is in, and from there he will have to explore the map. All kind of horrors may be hiding in the darkness, so he will have to be cautious. At the end of each round, the portions of the map he explored will be removed from the table: only the Sector he is in will stay visible... the Hero will have to put his memory to test, if he doesn't want to get lost!&#10;&#10;The story of the game will be unfolded through several scenarios, each one divided into several chapters. Each chapter has an objective for the Hero to complete, while the Evil players will have to stop him (or try to fulfill a different objective of their own). The outcome of each chapter will influence the gameplay of the subsequent one: each scenario is conceived with a branching storyline that can adapt to the actions of the players: if the Hero completes his goals, his life will be easier in the next chapter... but that is also true for the Evil players!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We need only lower our gaze from the stellar night skies to the planet below to see that beauty surrounds us! The biomes of planet Earth are as diverse and wondrous as the living creatures that populate them, and ideally you'll see more than your fair share of them in the strategic card game Subastral.&#10;&#10;In the game, you collect cards that represent your notes on eight different biomes: subtropical desert, savanna, tropical rainforest, chaparral, temperate grassland, temperate forest, taiga, and arctic tundra. You start the game with three random cards in hand; each card depicts one of the eight biome types and is numbered 1-6. Eight cards are placed onto six clouds in the center of the table, with the deck to the left of the #1 cloud and a sun card to the right of #6.&#10;&#10;On a turn, play a card from your hand onto the matching numbered cloud, then collect any pile of your choice to the left or right of the pile on which you played. If you choose a cloud to the left toward the deck, you add the cards on that cloud to your hand, then draw an additional card from the deck and add it to your hand. If you choose to the right toward the sun, you add those cards to your &quot;journal&quot;, which is your collection of cards. Cards from the same biome go in the same pile, and you build piles from left to right in your journal as you collect cards from new biomes, with those piles being numbered 1-8. To end your turn, you draw a card from the deck to fill the empty cloud space.&#10;&#10;When you hit the &quot;game end&quot; card in the deck, complete the round, then play one additional round. Each player then scores for their journal in two ways: Score for your two biomes that have the most cards, with each card in those biomes worth as many points as the number of the pile. (In other words, whatever two biomes you start collecting last, you want to collect a lot of them since those cards will be worth the most points.) Next, you remove one card from each biome left to right until you hit an empty space or run out of biomes; the set is worth 1-36 points depending on the number of cards in it. Then you create another set collecting cards from left to right, etc. until your leftmost biome is empty. Whoever has scored the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Will your journal of research notes on the planet's biomes be deep and diverse enough to stand out amongst your peers?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Skytear is a competitive card-driven miniatures game inspired by MOBA video games (like League of Legends) featuring 32 heroes from an original fantasy universe.&#10;&#10;Using a draft system that supplements regular deckbuilding, players pick heroes from four factions in order to flexibly respond to their opponent's selections.  Then, using these heroes, players compete to take control of the lanes and lead the minions there to assault the enemies' towers, or enter the dome to take control of the outsider there. In doing so, they will win one of the three victory conditions selected at the start of the game, allowing for potential bluffing or feints by switching objective.&#10;&#10;Skytear is diceless, instead revolving around modifiers printed on each power card. This duality of effect means deckbuilding is a nuanced issue: cards that are most beneficial when played (and likely will) come with a negative modifier, reducing the effectiveness of most attacks. At the same time, drafting a particular hero provides you with their associated cards, meaning flexibility can be integrated into your hero selections.&#10;&#10;With two maps, 32 heroes, and over 65 power cards at launch, Skytear is an extremely replayable tactical experience.&#10;&#10;",
