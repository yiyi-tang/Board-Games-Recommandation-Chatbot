    "Description": "The Charleston Game plays a lot like Monopoly with one catch: players must answer Examination Questions about Charleston's history or culture correctly to purchase properties when they lands on them. Knowledge of Charleston is the only currency in this game. Acquired property cards contain information that can aid owners in answering future questions.&#10;&#10;When a player lands on an already owned property, there's a Showdown between the player who landed on the property and the property's owner. (If one or both players have no property, no Showdown occurs.) To resolve a Showdown, both players put up a property as a Wager, then roll the dice. The player with the highest roll (reroll any ties) draws an Examination Card and attempts to answer the question. If he answers correctly, he wins both properties. If he answers incorrectly, the properties go to his adversary. The answers to all of the questions on the Examination Cards are in the Official Rule and Answer Booklet that comes with the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all property is claimed by the players.&#10;&#10;The game states that it was Authenticated by Historic Charleston Foundation, Inc.&#10;Cover picture &quot;Adapted from a Lithograph by Smith, Painting by Hill 1850. From the Collection of the South Carolina Historical Society.&#10;&#10;Description from Rules:&#10;The Charleston Game is a family-type game which reflects Charleston's beauty, history, and culture. It may be enjoyed by all ages and should provide an exciting educational benefit to the players.&#10;&#10;The object of the Charleston Game is to obtain  the most property by correctly answering Examination Questions concerning the history and culture of Charleston and South Carolina. Players travel around the board landing on various types of squares. Fact Cards contain important history information which will aid a player in answering Examination Question. They also provide instructions for a player which may be helpful or harmful.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of the property is claimed by the players. The winner is the player with the most property cards. There are no losers in this game. Everyone goes away with a little more knowledge and appreciation for the cultural and historical background of Charleston.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Proxy Wars is an expandable two-player game in a contemporary but slightly fictional setting. Players represent a battle-ready faction and use their agents to fight for control of a customizable board, which is set up individually each game. To win, agents must occupy valuable tiles worth victory points (VPs) or wipe out enemy agents or do both.&#10;&#10;Proxy Wars is a full-fledged strategy card-based board game, and the game mechanisms include tile-placing (the cards form the board) and deck-building elements. You are to decide how to best deploy your faction's power and agents to outwit your opponent with ingenious cutting, positioning and attacking strategies. Each player starts with ten agents (playing pieces) in his headquarters and a set of faction cards. Players alternate turns, choosing one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Play a new card &#10;     Recruit an agent &#10;     Move an agent &#10;     Attack enemy agents &#10;     Take card actions &#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players total the number of agents they control, along with any VPs that they have accumulated on their cards. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;To play Proxy Wars, you need at least the two basic sets: GreenEngage and MegaCorp; Proxy Wars: Oath Bound, which contains additional cards for both factions, is recommended.&#10;&#10;",

The main components of the game are 45 unique planet tiles that contain 1/2 of a planet on each of the 6 sides.  The tile distribution ranges from having all sides represent the same planet to having up to 6 different planets represented.   Players are randomly assigned exclusive planets that they need to score points for.  On their turn, they will first perform a preliminary action in which they place or rotate a tile.  Next, they perform a primary action by placing a tile and calculating the resulting score.  The scores increase exponentially as more planets are matched at one time.  Players discard one card at the end of their turn and then draw back up to the hand limit (3 for 2-4 players, 4 for solitaire).  The game ends when the planet tile draw deck is exhausted.  Players calculate their score by multiplying the score of their lowest scoring planet by 3 and then adding that to the score of their highest scoring planet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Decktet wiki: Rule of the land was benevolently shared by the six Crowned Princes. Every five years the people would elect one of the Princes to lead the land for the next five years. Before the election, the Princes would hold a series of debates in which they would demonstrate why they were most fit to lead for the next five years. The debates were always reviewed by the three major newspapers and typically two of the papers' editors would agree that one of the Princes won the debate while the third paper's editor would choose someone else as the clear victor. In the end, the people would vote and a new leader would rule peacefully for another five years.&#10;&#10;Election Day takes great advantage of the structure of the Decktet cards. There are 6 suits with 2 suits on each card. Each suit represents a prince. Each player plays one card face up on their turn until all players pass, ending the debate. The suit appearing most frequently during the debate keeps two of its highest point cards as influence points until the end of the game. The next most frequently appearing suit keeps one of its highest point cards until the end of the game. After all the debates, the influence cards accumulated are added up and the suit with the most influence indicates who the winning prince is. The player who backed that prince is the winning player.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game contains a tool box, six chips which show two different tools on their two sides (each tool appears twice) and 16 repair cards which show things that have to be repaired and the three tools needed for that.&#10;&#10;One card is flipped open and all chips are put into the tool box. The active player shakes the tool box well, then flips it over and checks whether the chips (which fell out) show the three necessary tool symbols. If yes, then the player gets the card. If not, the chips are returned to the tool box and the box is passed on to the next player. The player with most cards at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Then imagine what it would be like to strap it on some unsuspecting soul.&#10;Now let's imagine putting that person through a series of all sorts of embarrassing questions. Can't you just see all the other guests laughing every time the machine registers a lie? Imagine the fun, imagine the spectacle...Imagine no more!&#10;&#10;Call it the perfect ice breaker, a novelty, a gizmo from hell, call it idQuest the lie detector game.&#10;&#10;idQuest is a socially interactive adult party game that consists of a hand held lie detector and 216 socially provocative questions. The lie detector was developed and patented by a police polygraph examiner and an electronics engineer. The questions are designed to contrast the id and the ego. The questions are about things that most people have done or thought about, but don't want to admit.&#10;&#10;Players are divided up into two teams. After determining who will be questioned first, the question cards are then randomly selected and read to all players.&#10;&#10;The other team must then discuss which question will generate the highest emotional response from the player being questioned. Once this has been decided, with the lie detector engaged, the two questions are asked. The hand held lie detector will then display the size of the emotional response to each question using an illuminated bar graph. If the opposing team guessed correctly the device sounds an incriminating alarm and they are awarded a point.&#10;&#10;You'll laugh at each other! You'll laugh at yourself! You'll find out how much you don't know about friends, and how much we all have in common.&#10;&#10;Nominated by the National Research Council as one of the most innovative projects of 1996.&#10;&#10;",

During strategic rounds (representing one quarter of a year) the hacendados bid on investments, construct enterprises, bribe troops, plot revolutions, and spy on each other.  During tactical rounds (each a single day) the players move their troops, indians, bandidos, railguns and policia around the map to harass (tax, kidnap, arrest, burn) one another and to protect their own enterprises.&#10;&#10;The hex map covers a large swath of northern mexico and the southwest US... ranging from El Fuerte Sinaloa in the South, to Florence, Arizona to the North, to Yuma, Arizona in the West and El Paso, Texas in the East.  Each hex is 10 miles.  Players moving units in tactical rounds must contend with all of the hazards the wild west has to offer via an event table.&#10;&#10;Semi-cooperative play is often rewarded, as there are no rules regarding transactions and deals that can be made, and many enterprises are highly dangerous and the risk is often best distributed among multiple players.  There can, however, only be one winner... and deals are only as good as your ability to enforce them with strength of arms.  Welcome to Mexico.&#10;&#10;Players can run for office, lead revolutions, or become bandit leaders, but the hacendado with the most gold (ill-gotten or otherwise) at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Lords of the Sierra Madre (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this promotional board game by Swedish insurance company Skandia, players move around a Monopoly-style board, drawing various types of event cards. They will get the chance to invest in property like cars, houses or diamonds, hoping to sell them at a profit or else convert them to cash at the end of the game. They may also get to purchase tickets in an intermittently triggered lottery (because winning the lottery and speculating in diamonds are the two surest ways of getting rich, or something).&#10;&#10;Everything and anything in the game is in danger of damage or accidents, although having the right insurance helps with this. Several of the risk vs. reward elements of the game are easily solvable and serve to encourage behaviour that is illegal or economically irrational in reality, like casino gambling or diamond smuggling, which seems a little odd considering the theme. The game is played for an arbitrary amount of time; the rules suggest playing until a point in time agreed upon in advance is reached, after which five more moves are played out. The player with the most money is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher of Satori: the Radical Forgiveness Board Game. . .&#10;&#10;Satori is a really fun way to let go of emotional baggage &mdash; forgiving yourself and others in the process &mdash; easily and quickly. It promotes laughter, enlightenment, insight and growth &mdash; both spiritual and personal.&#10;&#10;Quite amazingly, 'Satori' gives us the exact insights we need to move beyond vicitimhood and to heal our lives. The game mirrors for us our own wisdom in having created the very circumstances of our own healing. It leads us to where we can reframe the past and see the perfection in it. It can be prophetic in showing us issues we didn&rsquo;t even know we had. And It connects us to the truth of who we are. It&rsquo;s quite a game!&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;&#10;The goal is to proceed through four levels of consciousness in order to get to Satori &mdash; total awareness.&#10;&#10;EVENT AND CONTEXT CARDS&#10;&#10;Each player picks an Event card and a Context card. (9 times out of 10 these are a direct hit on an issue the person needs to work on). Each player in turn creates a victim story around that situation and places his/her playing piece in Victimland to start the game.&#10;&#10;THE LANDING SPACES&#10;&#10;Of course the journey is one fraught with difficulties and repleat with blessings, depending upon which space you land.  The landing spaces will direct you to look at your beliefs, blocks, karma, stories and projections etc., with instructions or by drawing cards.&#10;&#10;NEW STORY CARDS&#10;&#10;These help you shift out of your victim story - with all its negative beliefs and energy blocks, and move into a new story.&#10;&#10;'SATORI'&#10;&#10;No matter who gets there first, we want for everyone else to come to Satori. At that point, each player gets a chance to reframe their story and to read an affirmation.&#10;&#10;THE RESULTS&#10;&#10;People report feeling lighter, feeling free from pain or the weight of guilt and anger, more compassionate and more loving.&#10;&#10;",

Once immersed, not in Archimedes' bathtub, but in a fascinating universe in which you might perhaps be brought to exclaim &quot;Eureka!&quot;&#10;&#10;(Translation from the instruction package)&#10;&#10;&quot;Eur&ecirc;ka!&quot; is a game in which multiple players compete in trying to complete more of the 13 numbered sets of 4 cards than any other player. Every card contains several (around 5-10) trivia questions. After having distributed the cards evenly among players, gameplay starts. On his turn, a player will ask for a particular card of a set of which he has at least one other card. Its owner will ask the first question on the card - should that card ever be asked again, the second question will be asked, and so forth. Whenever a player answers correctly, the card is transferred to him; whenever a player completes a series or wrongfully answers a question, it becomes the next player in clockwise order's turn. The game ends either after all sets are completed, or after a set time deadline, to the players' choice.&#10;&#10;Questions vary in difficulty, as some of them can easily be answered by any 6th grader while some others require an acute knowledge of particular disciplines. Mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science and biology are all disciplines that this game addresses.&#10;&#10;(Description by BGG user jgag)&#10;&#10;",

This practice was a key part of the Bushido, the code of the samurai warriors, and was used to avoid falling into enemy hands, and to attenuate shame. One might say that death is the very center of the Bushido, as the overall purpose- to die well and with one's honor intact.&#10;&#10;You are a Daimyo, a powerful feudal ruler in ancient Japan. You must hire samurai to protect your land, and win battles courageously. The first Daimyo whose clan obtains the &ldquo;Seven Virtues&rdquo; of the Bushido will be announced as the winner.&#10;&#10;What's new in the 2nd Edition? The major revision is the replacement of koku (rice) cards with koku chits. Koku can be added to your inventory each turn which dramatically speeds up game play, allows for quicker seeding of samurai and creates bigger, more exciting battles. Additionally Seppuku takes advantage of The Game Crafter's custom dice and packaging giving the game a much more professional look. Enjoy!&#10;&#10;",

A defender's lucky roll dodges or even catches the ball, taking the thrower out and bringing a friendly player back into play!&#10;&#10;Momentum breaks ties and Coaches mitigate luck with smart use of Extra Effort! tokens and unique Player&#10;abilities.&#10;&#10;The Coach that knocks out all the other Coach&rsquo;s Players wins!&#10;&#10;Playing time is normally under 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game of claustrophobic terror and survival in a hostile environment.&#10;&#10;In an underground military base, experiments are done in order to create a new biological weapon. Mutations of dangerous infectious agents and other threats are kept there.&#10;Suddenly an accident occurs in a laboratory, releasing a lethal virus all over the place. Some of the first victims already suffer the effects of the new disease, and rise up from the dead, returning to life as zombies hungry for human flesh.&#10;Some survivors still resist the virus, but their time is short. At any time, they can become a feast for the undead, or succumb to the disease and increase the horde of brain-eaters.&#10;&#10;The players are in the role of some of these survivors, and should explore the site facing the zombies, find the experimental cure and escape.&#10;&#10;Prepare, load your weapons and run! There is only one way out.&#10;&#10;A summary of the gameplay:&#10;&#10;The characters start at the central sector of the board, that is already revealed. The goal is to find the antidote and escape through the hatch in the center of the board. To do this, the players must spend action points to do actions like walk, fight and search.&#10;When a character enters in a unrevealed room, he must take one tile from the pile, and place it adjacent to the room he is coming from, connecting the doors. Then he rolls the encounter dice, that shows if he met zombies, items or nothing.&#10;The fight is conducted by the range and the requirements that each weapon has to kill or hurt the zombies. Then the player rolls a dice and see if the result satisfies those requirements. He can spend action points to add to the result.&#10;The items are managed in the inventory, that shows how many items the character can carry.&#10;When the player choose to search, he takes a card from the correspondent sector pile. It can be items, good or bad events, weapons or the antidote.&#10;When a player finishes his move, then the next player plays with the zombies on the board. He can move and attack with all zombies.&#10;After that, the same player now plays with his human character, an it goes on. When the round is complete, move the players' infection marker. If someone passes the last&#10;mark, he becomes a zombie.&#10;There are some details in the rules about spending action points, fighting, events and items.&#10;The first player to find the cure and get back to the hatch is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
