It comes with a new board, 46 new destination cards and a set of rules (in several languages) to create a new game. The Ticket to Ride: Switzerland map and rules first appeared as an exclusive map for the Ticket to Ride computer game. In addition to being specifically designed for a smaller numbers of players the map has several new features. Locomotive cards are used exclusively for tunnels (which work as they do in Ticket to Ride: Europe). Some destination cards have an end point inside Switzerland and other possible ends in adjacent countries (the value of the completed card is based on the farthest possible connection completed). There are also destination cards for connections between adjacent countries.&#10;&#10;Although not officially sanctioned, it works fine with Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries also. Due to Ticket to Ride: M&#195;&#164;rklin's different distribution of train cards, Ticket to Ride: Switzerland is not considered to be compatible.&#10;&#10;Part of Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented / Re-printed in:&#10;&#10;    Ticket to Ride Map Collection 2: India & Switzerland&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Whoever has the most ants when this occurs wins the game!&#10;&#10;During your turn, you lay tiles to build the tunnel system your colony thrives in, or play special cards to harvest food and water so you can multiply faster than your opponents.

Following generations of tyrannical monarchy, the fledgling republic of Rome has become a political battleground for a few old and powerful families, each now vying for control and influence. As the city grows so do familial ambitions.&#10;&#10;Change is inevitable and the Republic will soon fall, only to be replaced by an empire the likes of which the world has never seen... but a great empire needs an emperor of great conceit and wiles. With the rules, alliances, and strategies ever changing, it might not be who you think.&#10;&#10;The Republic is a game of political intrigue and city building for three to six players. Although tile placement and economics are important considerations, the true focus of the game is on the politics. Each round, players are required to vote on laws that drastically alter the way the game is played, often affecting players in radically different ways. The winner of the game is usually the first player to collect a set amount of Imperium, a resource which can be earned through well-planned construction or lawmaking.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Die Welt des 31. Jahrhunderts is the complete future-history of the BattleTech world.  Authors Mai and Nick have taken every BattleTech product, including board games, novels, graphic novels, computer games, role-playing products, comic books, and the CCG to create an encyclopedia of every person, place, and event outlined.  This book is profusely illustrated with many color plates and the book is over 500 pages long.  Included are a complete timeline of the BattleTech Universe, complete listings of every BattleTech product in a variety of media, and a list of every BattleMech model in both English and German.  The book sports a fantastic cover by Joern Rauser.&#10;&#10;This book was published in German, and although there have been talks of an English translation, no such translation has yet appeared.&#10;&#10;",

Most of the spaces on the board correspond to one of the four categories, but some spaces allow a player to choose which category they want to answer a question from. Some spaces require a player to draw a &quot;Miracle&quot; card which will give the player some benefit like skipping ahead on the board, while other spaces require the player to draw a &quot;Pitfall&quot; card. These cards have negative effects like, for example, causing a player to lose a turn. There are spaces that allow players to take shortcuts along the path and other spaces that require a player to take a longer detour. Finally, there are slide spaces which allow a player to slide forward or backward one space to get to a category space that might make it easier for the player to answer the question. The box includes 800 questions, with 4 questions per card.&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up.&#10;&#10;",

Chemical elements can be combined to form compounds that can be used in the game.&#10;&#10;Homepage:  http://www.elementeo.com&#10;&#10;Description from the Maker:&#10;&#10;In the Elementeo Chemistry Card Game (v1), elements have their own personalities -- Oxygen becomes Oxygen Life-Giver, Sodium becomes Sodium Dragon, and Iodine becomes Iodine Mermaid. Players can create compounds and play with element in the game. Elementeo includes five different levels (element, reaction, compound, alchemy, and fusion) and has elements, compounds, and alchemy cards (which include black holes and nuclear fusion).  The goal of the game is to capture your opponent's electrons and reduce them to 0.&#10;&#10;What People Have Said About The Elementeo Chemistry Card Game (v1):&#10;&#10;&quot;This young inventor has stumbled upon something that will stimulate minds and make people more interested in science&rdquo; - Dr. Tom Lane, Past President, American Chemical Society.&#10;&#10;&quot;Elementeo teaches kids to see elements and compounds not as boring things to be memorized but as interesting personalities and powerful agents at work in the world. Which is of course exactly how real chemists and scientists see them. If they come away from the game remembering a fun fact about an element, or understanding the basic notions of bonding and charge, they will have a powerful head start in understanding chemistry&quot; - Theodore Gray, co-founder of Wolfram Research (makers of Mathematica) and Popular Science columnist.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Elementeo builds on games like Magic: The Gathering and Pok&eacute;mon by appealing to kids with its fun factor, but also focusing on the education side. The world should take notice.&rdquo; - Peter Adkison, CEO of Hidden City Games, and former CEO of Wizards of the Coast (the makers of Magic: The Gathering and distributors of Pok&eacute;mon).&#10;&#10;Update: The first version of Elementeo (v1) has sold out, the next version (v2) is expected to hit amazon.com in the beginning of summer 2012. Alchemist Empire, Inc also released an Elementeo App on the Apple App Store for students to explore the elements and create their own Elementeo elements.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sockeye follows the life-cycle of a Sockeye Salmon.  It is designed to be a fun educational exploration of salmon information.&#10;&#10;Players begin as salmon eggs which hatch into fry.  The fry grow into fingerlings in a lake and then proceed to the ocean.  This course is reversed as the salmon returns to the same spawning bed were it was born.  Along the way there are many hazards to the growing salon; from river dangers to being eaten by animals and people.&#10;&#10;The game is a standard roll-and-move variety.  The frequent hazard spots move the player back or forward a number of spaces; make a player miss a turn; or require a particular number to be rolled before continuing.  The last hazard, three spaces from the finish, is particularly nefarious as it sends the player all the way back to the beginning.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a map of the Sockeye spawning rivers of BC Canada and a detailed description of the life-cycle of a Sockeye Salmon.  The game artwork is beautiful, from the board to the fish-shaped playing pawns.&#10;&#10;",

Well it covers the Lincoln County War, the unpleasantness in Tombstone. The Demise of the James/Younger Gang, the gold fever in the Black Hills that led to the Great Sioux War of 76 as well as the founding of Deadwood, lots of Apache trouble, the Nez Perce, the flight of the Cheyenne from Indian Territory...and a bunch of other stuff.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;re talking Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday, Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand, Geronimo, and Wild Bill Hickok to name a few. This is the time period that made the Wild West wild and burned it into the hearts and minds of every kid growing up. Except in Six Gun Sound we dig deeper into it to let you &ldquo;live&rdquo; the time period. How so? You choose what you want to be. Marshal, Outlaw, Ranger, there&rsquo;s up to six different professions. So different that each one has a unique Encounter system that allows you fight the battles that these Gunfighters, Cowboys, and others would fight. What&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Encounter&rdquo; system? It&rsquo;s what tells you who, what, and when you&rsquo;re going to meet when it&rsquo;s fighting time. Now add this to the &ldquo;Campaign&rdquo; system and you&rsquo;re not just gaming the Wild West, you&rsquo;re living it!&#10;&#10;With the &ldquo;Campaign&rdquo; system you can travel all across the US and into Canada or Old Mexico if you like. We&rsquo;re talking about 22 different areas that you can travel through. Each one is rated by how &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; it is&hellip;or not. For example, so when you go through Indian Territory expect to find&hellip;you guessed it, Indians. All the work of dreaming up your next bank robbery, gunfight, cattle drive and many other encounters are already done. We&rsquo;ve done all the work, we&rsquo;ve built and populated your world, and all you have to do is enjoy and play the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Pirelli Rallye Monte Carlo game represents a rally race with the board representing a Leg that consists of four road sections and three special stages.  The object is to be the fastest over three legs or three runs over the entire track.  In the 1980's the sport was a bit different.  Road sections were over public streets and going too fast or too slow garnered a time penalty. The Special stages were over closed public roads, private roads or trails in rural areas and speed was not restricted. In the game, the Road sections have a set number of dice throws in which a player is to travel the section with his car.  You may roll one or two D6 that have numbers 1,2 or 3 on the faces. Finishing in less rolls garners a 10 second penalty and finishing in too many rolls gets a 5 second penalty. For each special stage, a card is drawn with details of that stage and players must try and choose the best tyres for that stage, with weather conditions being a contributing factor.  Then an Unexpected Weather condition card is drawn.  The tire choice combined with info from the two cards modify the die rolls during the Special stage. The player then chooses to roll the red die that has more pips and two crash faces or the blue die with less pips and only one crash face. Along the Special stages are spaces that result in car damage if a player lands on those spaces. Prior to starting the race each player may place Repair Stations along the Road sections to repair damages incurred along the Specials stages. If a player lands on a Damage space in the first Special stage, that Damage penalty, 10 seconds, will be applied thereafter to each section until the player meets the requirement for entering one of his Repair Stations.  The player who completes the three Legs in the fastest time wins the rally/game.&#10;&#10;Basically a roll and move game with a bit of flare within the theme of the sport as it was conducted at the time of the game's production.&#10;&#10;This being a game for the Pirelli tire company, there is more information concerning tires in the game materials than is necessary to play the game.  The only tyres available are from Pirelli and the game materials seek to show how each tyre should be used, with the rulebook containing a lot of information about how rallies were organized and run at that time and how to choose tyres for each stage.&#10;&#10;",

System.&quot;&#10;&#10;Made available through Wyre Forest Games Club as a free download:&#10;&#10;The game strives to capture the &quot;feel&quot; of the period using two or three &quot;divisions&quot; or &quot;battles&quot; of grouped warrior bands of Retinues and Contingents, rather than a number of independently-maneuvering &quot;units&quot; of like-armed soldiers.&#10;&#10;The qualities of Aggression, Formation and Strength are key along with Leadership which seeks to maximize these qualities to gain advantage over opposing troops.  These qualities ebb and flow depending on the fortunes of the unit, nearby friendly units, and Leaders.&#10;&#10;The actual resolution of combat is literally resolved by each player engaging in a single round of rock/paper/scissors for each pair of units, or aligned groups of soldiers from a unit, brought together in melee.&#10;&#10;",

Due to a  the simultaneous explosion of several stars, the universe collides in only one dimension.&#10;&#10;Drakons are oviparous and enormous. They gather in developed communities, with high technology. Their strength and aggressiveness is remarkable.&#10;&#10;G&ouml;denors haven't a special natural strength but a high level of intelligence, becoming one of the most dangerous races in the world.&#10;&#10;Both races have met, unfortunately, and so have created two forces that will fight to the death for the control of the new world, to conquer a new place to live and improve.&#10;&#10;Drakon's force is commanded by Clain, the Manan, and is composed by two Dux-Manan and Atter-Manan, Arnor and Cowtor which have in charge three expert Mereos: Sunno, Cornex and Artak.  G&ouml;denors have the same forces in their side: Arco(Manan), Daro(Dux-Manan), Rotx(Atter-Manan) and the Mereos(Sazzer, Preto y Malk).&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to conquer the opposite military base. It's achieved by getting one the characters to the mountainous enemy base.&#10;&#10;Each of the characters have different attributes that can be used in combat against enemy creatures.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with only the Manan and will get through the different places by throwing a dice. Your forces could be increased by gathering new soldiers and getting additional powers, all of these using cards, supplied in Oracle squares. Other special squares will grant you access to mountains (Climbing) or get you frozen (Dimensional Door).&#10;&#10;To stop enemy forces in their advance to your base, you can attack them with your ground forces, by placing them adjacent or by using the heavy artillery placed in mountains. Artillery will give you the opportunity to fire one of the missiles, trying to knock down opposing forces.&#10;&#10;There are additional powers attained through extra cards.&#10;&#10;",

These scenarios can range from a simple brawl in the streets to a battle of wits between two masterminds, or anything else you can think of, making this much more than just another game of superhero combat.&#10;&#10;As of November 2008, no further information on this game is available, and the homepage is no longer registered.
