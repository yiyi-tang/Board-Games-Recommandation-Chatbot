    "Description": "Pizza Puzzles bring delicious art and a fun jigsaw puzzle experience to your table. Our pizzas are silly and fun to look at, but more importantly, they're puzzles you can build with your friends and family. A single slice is just one of eight smaller puzzles in the box. As you complete each smaller puzzle, you can assemble the entire pizza by slice. On each pizza you'll find countless toppings - the more you look, the more details you'll find!&#10;&#10;Puzzles come with symbols on the back of the pieces, allowing you to assemble your puzzle by slice! Pick your preferred slice (maybe the one with your favorite topping) and chow down. Friends and family can race to finish their piece of the pie.&#10;&#10;",

They rake in a certain amount of money and fame but require specific gladiator teams.&#10;Combat: Each lanista organizes one or more fights between their own gladiators. Random draws determine the outcomes. Players can manipulate the odds in various ways.&#10;Healing &amp; Resting: If a gladiator physical integrity is compromised, he must be healed...or there can be an accident that yields prestige.&#10;&#10;Random draws use a bag loaded with tokens of various colours. Players manipulate the token counts to influence the odds. This matches electoral systems used in Antiquity.&#10;&#10;Lanista is accessible and educational; it will please newbies and grognards, be they inclined to compete or to manage.&#10;&#10;",

To achieve this, players hire workers and pitchmen, expand their stores trying to get the most of the small place they can use, advertise their business, and even sell some of their goods via their e-shop.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 8 rounds. &#10;Each turn is divided by 3 phases:&#10;The Action Phase, that is a worker placement phase. &#10;The Flow Phase where the micromanagement of the employees, customers and clothes happens.&#10;The Upkeep phase, where players pay the rent and their employees, as well as they setup the game for next round.&#10;&#10;By the end of the game, players score the customers they served, their reputation, as well as they lose some Victory Points for every customer left inside their store and the tiles on the board that were left unoccupied.&#10;&#10;The player who managed to get the most out of their store, is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Revolution &amp; Reaction: The Spanish Civil War, 1930-39 is a two-player wargame, depicting the political and military conflicts in Spain between 1930 and 1939. In the game, one player controls the Republican forces (consisting of liberals, socialists, communists and anarchists), and the other controls the Nationalists (consisting of the Falangist and Carlist factions).&#10;&#10;Players not only fight each other, but must manage and coordinate their own political and military factions. The loyalty of your factions to the cause is never certain!&#10;&#10;The game system adapts the key mechanics of Matt Calkin's Sekigahara game (2011, GMT). Players receive a hand of cards each turn which are used to play for the actions, and to deploy game pieces into battle. In Revolution &amp; Reaction, there is a political phase, in which players try to gain political control of the various areas of Spain by placing influence blocks; in the military phase, players move their units and start combats in locations on the board (towns cities). Blocks and cards are hidden from the other player, so the opponent's true political and military strength is only know in struggle.&#10;&#10;The game includes diplomacy and elections, special units (such as the International Brigades), and rules to simulate the outbreak of war, giving the game a strong connection to the real history of the Spanish Civil War.&#10;&#10;",

Hamas acts as a situationally controllable faction that acts more independently from the UNLU - helping and hindering both factions at different times.&#10;&#10;Issuing Operations and exploiting events, players recruit and deploy units to control territory and/or foment uprising. The game is played over 3 rounds composed of hands of cards that are played as actions or events.  If, after this time, the Israeli player cannot maintain national will (support for the conservative administration), they will lose the game.&#10;&#10;The UNLU&rsquo;s goals are two-fold: 1) sustain on-board protests and transition them into general strikes, and 2) influence international concern by engaging in non-violent efforts.  ISR aims to control the occupied territories by 1) suppressing civil disobedience in map locations, and 2) establishing intelligence networks within the communities to implant operatives or encourage collaboration with the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in suppressing the civil unrest.&#10;&#10;Additionally, automatic victory conditions exist for both sides. The UNLU player may win if international concern sways in their favor; that is, in the form of UN intervention due to human rights abuses. The Israeli player may automatically win if they deploy all of their intelligence networks, effectively snuffing out the resistance at the source.&#10;&#10;",

Manchmal hilft er Seelen gestorbener Dahan auf ihrem Weg, bevor b&ouml;sartige Geister sie verschlingen k&ouml;nnen. Obwohl er allgegenw&auml;rtig ist, bleibt er r&auml;tselhaft. Sogar die Dahan, die ihn den Wegbereiter nennen, sind sich nicht sicher, ob er wirklich neue Wege erschafft oder findet, was bereits da ist. Ist die Parallelwelt, durch die er sich bewegt, &uuml;berhaupt r&auml;umlich oder eine andere Daseinsform? Die Gedanken, die er kommuniziert, sind so fremdartig, dass sie sich nur schwer in Worte fassen lassen.&#10;&#10;Finder unsichtbarer Wege ist ein zus&auml;tzlicher Geist f&uuml;r Spirit Island mit sehr hoher Komplexit&auml;t Dieser Geist bewegt die meiste Zeit Invasoren und manchmal Dahan, Pr&auml;senzen oder Tiere.

Ohne eine M&ouml;glichkeit vernichtete Pr&auml;senzen zur&uuml;ck ins Spiel zu bringen, kann er es sich nur selten leisten, Invasoren zu zerst&ouml;ren. Daher ben&ouml;tigt er eine passende Starke F&auml;higkeit &ndash; oder Mitspieler, die ihn bei Angriffen unterst&uuml;tzen. Da er die Topologie der Insel &auml;ndert, steigert sich die Komplexit&auml;t f&uuml;r alle Spieler &ndash; vor allem in gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Spielen!&ldquo;&#10;&#10;",

But do not lose sight of the people votes: there can be only one president.&#10;&#10;The protection of Turalia is a familiar semi cooperative game for 2 to 4 players. Suggested age is from 10 years and game complexity is low. Each game will take about 30 to 45 minutes. Game materials are a main board, a secondary board, some cardboard tiles and the following components in five colors: wooden cubes, wooden discs and six sided dice.&#10;&#10;The game main mechanic is action selection. Players will throw dices and group them by values. A player will select a dice from a group and, for each other dice on that group, the fire will advance. If a city has too much fire, the fire will be out of control in that city. If that happens in too many cities, players will lose the game.&#10;&#10;Then, the player will perform some actions and deploy some new units in the south. At the end of the turn, if there are enough units in a city, that city will be fortified. But only one player can fortify the city. Also, fortifying cities will improve all players actions: more movement, more fire extinction, etc. And the player with more cities fortified will win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Even though it&rsquo;s critical that tasks be carried out in a timely manner, the sleepyhead dwarves never rush to get things done. As the proprietress of the workshop, you need to manage the dwarves&rsquo; various abilities in order to produce a beautiful necklace.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, the starting player (who holds the hearth card) selects one dwarf card from the two in their hand and places it so the card is visible to all other players.

After all abilities are executed, the player picks any card from the upper row of cards placed in the middle of the table and adds this card to his or her hand.

Their task is to play the role of a wise sorcerer defending the fortress and collect four treasures before the ghost reaches the top of the castle tower.&#10;&#10;How to play?&#10;Although you all play on the sorcerer&rsquo;s team, each player makes their own moves each turn. Of course, this does not mean that you cannot consult other players &ndash; many sorcerers are better than one! Each turn starts with drawing three cards in a pile and putting them in a row. The youngest sorcerer on the team starts their turn and then performs the moves indicated by the cards in order (left to right). After the moves are completed, the used cards are put aside and the next three cards are drawn and put in a row by the next player. You can also play alone and go on a creative and exciting adventure when there are no other board game lovers nearby!&#10;&#10;You can draw:&#10;&#10;     arrow cards: move the sorcerer to an adjacent field on the board, in the direction indicated by the arrow. NOTE: in each turn, you can rotate up to two of these cards by 90&deg; in any direction, or you can leave them as they were lined up;&#10;     loop cards: repeat the movements indicated by the cards to the left of this card twice, one by one, if this card is placed first from the left, it remains inactive;&#10;     sorcerer cards: move to any of adjacent fields on the left, right, above or below;&#10;     ghost cards: move the ghost token one field up.&#10;&#10;&#10;There are special fields on the board, which may make it easier (or more difficult) for you to collect treasures:&#10;&#10;     if you enter a teleportation gate field, you can magically move the sorcerer to any other gate field;&#10;     if you enter or pass through a field with a sorcerer&rsquo;s wand, you &#10;&#10;&#10; can move the ghost token one field down;&#10;&#10;     you cannot stop or pass through the ghost fields; turn the arrows to walk around them.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you enter the treasure field, put it in one of the boxes at the top of the board. If you use all the cards before the end of the game, shuffle them carefully and stack them again (since there are 35 cards, only two cards are dealt in the last turn). If the sequence you draw makes movement impossible (for example: even after turning the cards you hit a ghost field or you can&rsquo;t walk because of the end of the route), you move the ghost token one field up. You will win if you collect all the treasures before the ghost moves to the last field of its route and leaves the castle tower.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

If tied, then it is won by the player whose two cards produce the higher total when multiplied together. If still equal, then you will both have played equal cards.

    "Description": "Deluxe Guadalcanal: The Battle for Henderson Field is a grand tactical game on the efforts of the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army to capture and hold the island of Guadalcanal during the beginning of the island-hopping campaign to push back the Japanese empire. &#10;Errors in strategy and logistics at large made this effort extremely difficult for the Marines, as they held on to the island in the face of Japanese on-slaught with dwindling supplies. &#10;Players experience huge swings of fortune from one side to the other and back again as the battle for the island unfolds. Critical to the efforts of both sides is the capture and holding of Henderson Field, an air strip whose control dictates air supperiority and the ability to land supplies and much needed reinforcements.&#10;&#10;The game includes a huge 17&rdquo; by 55&rdquo; map, provided in easily printed letter- and tabloid-sized sheets (8.5x11&rdquo; and 11x17&rdquo; respectively), that covers the northern extents of the island. Combat units are mostly battalions, with a smattering of regiments and companies, representing infantry, armor, and artillery. There are also specialized units such as engineers and LVTs that aid in the maintenance or destruction of Henderson Field as well as movement across the difficult jungle terrain.&#10;&#10;The basis for Deluxe Guadalcanal is the original Guadalcanal game published by The Avalon Hill Game Company in 1966. The project began as an effort to create an updated version of the original game&rsquo;s map, providing some tweaks here an there for accuracy or playability. Once completed, it was not that much of an effort to also create a new, colorful set of counters (including new informational markers) that simplifies play. It was then a short, additional step to rewrite the rules in a manner that incorporates some of the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; rules, some new rules and mechanics, and known errata to create a new, cohesive rules set of under twelve pages.&#10;&#10;Now, YOU can refight the battle for Guadalcanal!&#10;&#10;&ndash; Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
