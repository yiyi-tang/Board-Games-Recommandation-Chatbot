    "Description": "Crono is a construct from many eras ago and is the keeper of the Black Rose Lodge in Prague.&#10;Over the years he has often been mistaken for a Titan or giant, but few have lived long enough to tell the story of their encounter with him.&#10;Crono is nourished by the vital energy of his victims. He is unable to synthesize the energy he needs on his own, so he sucks it out of his prey. In fact, it isn&rsquo;t uncommon to see a dying body hanging off his flesh... before meeting its own tragic end. &nbsp;&#10;The legendary scenario to which Crono is linked takes place inside the Black Rose Lodge in Prague where the &ldquo;Lodge&rsquo;s Vendetta&rdquo; room is found, replacing certain game boards in the core box.&#10;Mages brave enough to venture into this legendary encounter will have the possibility to use one of the 4 activation tokens of Crono&rsquo;s room once they enter.... at their own risk and peril.&#10;&#10;",

The grid board has 9 small box grids, and each box grid has 9 numbers.&#10;2. The first player selects one of the box girds and places a chip on one of the 9 numbers in that box grid. &#10;   At this time, the player tells the selected box grid and the number where the chip is placed. &ldquo;No. 3 of Grid 5!&rdquo;&#10;3. The next player must place a chip within the small box grid number following the number where the previous player placed his or her chip. &#10;     (Yes. The previous player placed it on No. 3, so this player can only place it on the box grid 3.)&#10;4. If all the numbers in the box grid are full, you cannot place a chip on the number of that box grid from the next turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;         END OF THE GAME **&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;1. If someone places 3 chips in a row, the game ends immediately and that player wins. &#10;The chips must be placed in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.&#10;[NOTE] This includes cases where the line crosses each small box grid.&#10;2. If all of the chips are used and there is no winner, it is a draw and we should start the game again.&#10;&#10;&#10;         Contact Publisher&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;MAGICBEANGAMES(Republic of Korea)&#10;e-mail : magicbean@magicbeangame.com&#10;&#10;",

The game ends after three rounds, which means you will only take a maximum of six moves in the entire game and you must watch the other players carefully to determine the best move to take.&#10;&#10;The basics of this game are taken from a card game called 51 that is fairly well-known in Japan but not outside of it.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#144;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#157;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#162;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#230;&#143;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&rdquo;&#231;&#183;&#143;&#230;&#155;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#136;&rdquo;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#231;&#185;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#191;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#166;&#179;&#229;&#175;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, you place the card, which you have previously taken, in front of you.

You score big points by making a larger chunk of connected gears.&#10;&#10;If you took a card with a smaller number in your previous turn, you take your turn earlier.

Humankind has its guardians, however few and far between, and they fight for their lives with matching ferocity. Who will survive another showdown on the gloomy streets of Dark City?&#10;&#10;Dark City is a party game in which players choose iconic characters from the cast of a horror movie &ndash; vampires, werewolves, zombies, hunters, priests &ndash; then face their opponents in a fierce battle of wits, inference and finger-pointing.&#10;&#10;Every round, the Acting Player randomly discards three cards from the deck. Then, one by one, players draft a monster or guardian at their choice from among the remaining cards. Players attack their chosen target by aiming their monster&rsquo;s or guardian&rsquo;s signature gesture at it. Then players have a chance to flee the battle, trying to prevent their opponents from scoring. Attacks are resolved in initiative order. Successful attacks &ldquo;kill&rdquo; their targets and allow players to achieve their monster&rsquo;s or guardian&rsquo;s goals. Players whose monsters or guardians have &ldquo;survived&rdquo; the encounter and achieved their goals score experience points (XP).The game ends when one or more players gather enough XP to meet at least one of the four victory conditions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset. &#10;Each player has a flight of four fighters, represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &ldquo;performance rulers&rdquo; that represent the aircraft&rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed.&#10;Each performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.&#10;TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.&#10;&#10;This set contains the Me-163, the only rocket-powered aircraft to see combat.  Scenarios include:&#10;Bat Out Of Hell:  Komets bounce a flight of P-38 Lightnings&#10;Point Defense:  Me-163 Komets assisted Fw-190D fighters attacking a formation of B-17G bombers and their P-51D escorts.&#10;Red Komet:  Returning from a mission with no fuel, a lone Me-163 has to glide past marauding P-51D fighters to return to base.&#10;&#10;",

After applying the Traits, the final Power values are compared to affect the Node track (score).  Cards have a cool off period before returning to the hand.  Choosing the right Power value and right Trait becomes a mind game against your opponent.

    "Description": "Catch Me! is a simple card game for 2 to 6 players. Each player receives a stack of face down cards displaying patterns in different colours. In the middle of the table there's a wooden stick up for grabs. Every round, a player turns over one of their face down cards. If two players have cards of the same pattern in front of them, both players compete to &quot;catch&quot; the stick first. The loser of this duel receives the winner's active cards to add to their stack. Whoever gets rid of all their cards first wins the game!&#10;&#10;Duel cards are included as a variant.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

An aspiring restaurant entrepreneur must make wise decisions to manage day-to-day operations and keep loyal customers happy, while always innovating to draw new customers through the door. But beware, competition is fierce as other restaurateurs are also looking to build their own reputations and secure their own loyal customers.&#10;&#10;In Dining Dynasties, each player must work to draw in business, find loyal customers and create exciting new dishes! Players manage all aspects of their restaurant in a fast paced competition with their rivals to offer the finest cuisine and carve out a share of the ever changing customer base. To do this, players must build and maintain a hand of cards to create a unique business plan of options. Players may focus on marketing to advertise for new customers and seek out unique sales opportunities, improve the mood of the restaurant by building a professional staff and improving restaurant d&eacute;cor, or a combination of all. Yet another option is to invest in the menu and seek to claim the title of finest cuisine among the competitors! A unique meta-game within each game round has players strategically playing menu cards to vie for the title of finest cuisine, which may provide an immediate valuable customer bonus.&#10;&#10;Dining Dynasties also allows players to increase the restaurant size. Do you want a small gourmet bistro or a huge dining establishment? The options are yours to choose, with each new room tile providing new worker placement opportunities to further your restaurant goals. But be cautious, expanding at the wrong time can take a toll on your available cash.&#10;&#10;Over the course of nine rounds, players strive to build the most valuable restaurant by earning reputation, increasing sales and building infrastructure. The player who chooses the most effective business plan, and best mitigates the ups and downs of the market, will emerge the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

If the chosen player cannot answer or chooses not to, they must draw two cards, then the next player plays. If they answer the question, then they get to play a card. The game includes special cards, so the player questioned might be able to bounce the question back to the original questioner, pass it on to the next player, or require more people to answer as well.&#10;&#10;If you have no matching cards on your turn, you draw a card and your turn ends. Alternatively, you might play a special card that reverses turn order or changes the color of cards that can be played.&#10;&#10;Whoever plays all of their cards first wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is based in London in 1890, and the player is setting up a department store.  The store consists of a number of departments, which each need to be filled with stock.  Customers come to the store with a list of items that need to be bought.  If all items are sold by a single player's department store, then that player wins that customer.  If the customer still has items remaining to be bought, then they move onto the next player's department.&#10;&#10;This is mainly a card-based game, where customers, items to be bought, and departments are represented by cards, and stock is represented by small wooden cubes.  On a player's turn, they can choose a customer from 3 available customers, who each have a number of items that they want to buy, the number of which are decided by the roll of a dice.  Only the number of items to buy is visible to the player, not the actual items themselves, so it's only when the customer is chosen that the items are revealed and the player knows what can be sold.  Players receive money for items sold, which can then be used to buy new stock or new departments at the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;The game relies on players choosing the right departments to set up, depending on what other players have already chosen, and deciding which departments should get restocked and at what time, especially when money is limited.  A player wins by being the player with the highest number of customers that had all items sold during one turn.  There are bonus points available for having the majority of customers in each family of customer.&#10;&#10;Game contains 70 cards, 50 wooden cubes, 1 dice, 45 &pound;1/&pound;2/&pound;5/&pound;10 notes and a rule book.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

If too many people travel to the same location, the mobile app will eliminate some of them.&#10;&#10;Location cards have special abilities that may modify the usual flow of the game, but play will continue until there are two players left who face off in a showdown.  Depending on their choices, there may be one winner, two winners, or they may both lose!

Harm cards lower hand size, so keeping an eye on each other is an integral part of the gameplay, as cards drawn at the end of a round could be helpful, they could be harmful, or they could be another villain to fight!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Crisis is a board game that was included with a 1990's issue of The Economist magazine.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on the international bullion and currency markets.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a mixed hand of currencies and gold, and attempts - through bluffing and card play - to establish monopolies in one or more holdings.&#10;&#10;The game is a mixture of roll and move combined with card play, management and counting.&#10;&#10;The game provides rules and board, but the players must provide cards and a die.&#10;&#10;There is no designer credited.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
