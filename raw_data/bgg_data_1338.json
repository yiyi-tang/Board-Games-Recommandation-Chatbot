Hafizullah Amin, a dedicated communist, leads Afghanistan ineffectually. In Moscow, the Politburo chafes under his failure to unify an increasingly unraveling ally. The aging Leonid Brezhnev has been slowly persuaded that, absent decisive Russian action, Afghanistan will fall from the Soviet orbit.&#10;&#10;In what they see as a quick &ldquo;regime change&rdquo;, the Politburo directs Soviet forces to deploy throughout Afghanistan under the guise of assisting Amin. On December 27, 1979, Amin&rsquo;s palace is stormed and he is shot dead (then grenaded for good measure) and replaced by pliant Soviet puppet Babrak Karmal. Success! Or is it...?&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Great Game, Cold War version. &ldquo;Save Afghanistan, Comrade!&rdquo; pits you as the Soviets and communist Afghans against the Mujahadeen for dominance there. You have until Summer, 1992 (50 quarterly turns) to clear the Provinces of Mujahadeen to win. Or will you, like Brezhnev, find the Mujahadeen to be an indomitable enemy?&#10;&#10;",

It is a card game that wants to collaborate with the task of revitalizing Mapuzugun, a language spoken by the Mapuche people, a people pre-existing to the national states of Argentina and Chile. Languages are one of the most beautiful and wonderful human creations. More than 7000 languages are spoken in the world and, in Argentina, in addition to Spanish, there are more than 20 languages of different indigenous peoples. But many are at a disadvantage compared to Spanish and are at risk of disappearing.&#10;&#10;It has 2 game modes:&#10;&#10;M&uuml;rkantun&#10;Objective: find the pair.&#10;On their turns, players turn over two cards trying to find the corresponding pair (Ex: Mara- R&uuml;gk&uuml;n). If they do not match, you must leave them in the same place. Whoever finds the most pairs wins.&#10;&#10;Konew&#10;Objective: each participant has to guess which card was played from the clues provided by the other players.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck without looking at it. The other players, in turn, must provide a clue in Mapuzugun about the appearance of the image of the card that the player has to guess (Ex: it does not fly, it has feathers). If they guess, they keep that card. If they don't guess, the card returns to the bottom of the deck. The one who collected the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;The guessing game (Konew) is an ancient Mapuche game. Older people say that in the winters when families were gathered in their homes they used to play to tell riddles, thus the cold weather passed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;How the Union was Saved: the American Civil War 1861 - 1865&quot; is a two player strategic wargame depicting the entire American Civil War. One player controls the forces and resources of the North and the other those of the South.&#10;&#10;During each Game Turn, which represents three months of actual time, players must consider how best to spend their precious Resource Points (RPs). These are used to build and maintain the chains of depots necessary to keep armies supplied and enable them to move and fight, as well as to construct fortifications. Generally, the RPs reflect the superiority of the Northern economy and resources; but, the actual number available each Turn is subject to a random modifier and cards depicting some of the most significant events of the war. The latter add historical colour and, often, increase the tension by throwing a spanner in the works of the most carefully laid plan. Those who have played the critically acclaimed How the West was Saved will recognize this approach.&#10;&#10;How the Union was Saved it is augmented by a new mechanic which emphasizes the &ldquo;fog-of-war&rdquo;. Only army commanders are deployed on the Game Map. The strength of forces under their command (comprising artillery, cavalry, and infantry) is hidden from the opponent until combat occurs and, even then, the total strength of one or both sides may not be revealed. This device puts players in the shoes of army commanders, able to gain an advantage through the clever use of bluff and deception; but, also vulnerable to a stinging reverse if, for example, they mistake a major offensive operation for a feint. It has produced some really exciting games during testing.&#10;&#10;",

These maps are filled with various scenes in which inhabitants and magical creatures take part.&#10;Players learn a mission which consists in finding a particular event on the map on the basis of its description, the coordinates of this place are a password to open a PDF with the next task (for this purpose we use a computer or a phone - to read tasks from PDF files). In this way the players go through the story scenarios during which they also draw on the map and color its elements. The game is cooperative and players win when they manage to solve all puzzles and learn all passwords in a given scenario. All scenarios make up one big campaign&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The player with the highest point total wins&#10;&#10;-Bee home- a puzzle about creating a bee route to the hive.&#10;The player arranges a travel route for 3 bees of different colors from random pieces. The player who arranges the route first wins&#10;&#10;-Block Craft - extracting resources from a mine.Players draw a pit shape which they then draw on their choice of 6 pit maps. This way they extract treasures while avoiding weak points that can collapse the mine. The player who has the highest treasure score at the end of the game wins&#10;&#10;-Just Run- a dog race on an obstacle course&#10;Players roll two D6 dice. They choose one of the results and move their character by that many spaces on the map. In this way they earn points and collect sets. Getting to the finish line first also gives a big point bonus. The player with the highest amount of points at the end of the game wins the game&#10;&#10;-Impostor- find hidden on the map space traitors.One player secretly marks the position of the 3 astronauts. The other players use 10 questions to try to guess the position of each astronaut. Players who guess correctly are awarded points. Then they switch roles.

After 5 courses, the player with the highest sum of points wins&#10;&#10;-Pixel People- Players draw a task then arrange the human elements (heads, torso, legs, shoes) into a whole human. Each element has a point value, the goal is to create a man who will have the same value as the task. We arrange 3 people as quickly as possible, the player who does it first wins the game&#10;&#10;-My farm- Each turn, players roll a pool of 6 D6 dice. These resources serve as currency with which they buy and improve animals living on the farm, build fences. Some animals can only live in an enclosure with certain others. Each animal gives a certain number of points. The player who has the highest point total at the end wins&#10;&#10;-Seeker - Each player gets a board with 100 drawings labeled with numbers. One player chooses a picture and describes it, the rest of the players have to give the number of the picture as quickly as possible, the first one who does that gets a point. After 10 turns we count the points and the player who scored the highest amount wins&#10;&#10;The games form a coherent set, outside of which they are not accessible in any way. Each of them contains some educational element and they are designed for children 5+&#10;&#10;",

Players then argue their card choices to the judge who may then ask for a red &quot;Modifier&quot; card to be played by the chosen players.  The judge makes a final ruling on whose cards best describe the blue card played.  The winner is awarded the blue card. The role of &quot;Judge&quot; for the next round is awarded to the winner.  After a predetermined number of rounds by the players, the player with the most blue cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Weather also have a say in the matter by the roll of a die.&#10;&#10;If the group managed to counter a far-right exaction (indicated by the efficiency level reached for that activity), their morale will increase, otherwise it will decrease.&#10;&#10;For some activities there is also a risk of getting arrested and even put to trial.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is quite open, the players may decide of their objectives (a certain level of morale after a specific number of months) or they can use one of the included scenarios (objectives to reach within a time limit).&#10;&#10;",

He died in the battle of St. Matthews day, alongside with Lembitu, defending his country from the Livonian order.&#10;&#10;You're going to need six D6 dice (preferrably in two colours, 3 each), pen and a sheet of paper. Each player receives 3 dice of the same colour.&#10;&#10;During their turn player 1 places one of their dice (while keeping the result) in one area and then may activate the special bonus of that area.  After that it's other player's turn - and it continues until both players have placed all their dice on the gameboard. No area may have two dice from the same player or with the same result.&#10;&#10;After a round ends players receive victory points for controlling the areas (in addition to the victory points received from the area bonuses, if any). Area is controlled by the owner of the die with the highest number. Those points are recorded on the paper and then new round starts.&#10;&#10;Game ends after round three and all victory points are added together.&#10;&#10;Full English language rules are available on the web site.&#10;&#10;",

By laying down and replacing the 9 Pathway tiles on the board, you control your troops' laser to shoot down enemy fleets and establish safe encampments for back-ups. The side that first strikes the enemy Home Planet will claim victory!&#10;&#10;Players place place or remove tiles on the centre board, or exchange one for another from hand.&#10;&#10;The game ends and you win when the enemy Planet Tile (like the King in chess) is removed from the board. The game may also ends in a draw if both players are exchanging the same 3 tiles on the same spot for over a full cycle.&#10;&#10;",
