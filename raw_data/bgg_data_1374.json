Strixhaven is divided into five colleges, each representing the two diametrically opposed colors of magic favored by its elder dragon founder: Silverquill (black-white), the college of communications; Prismari (blue-red), college of the arts; Witherbloom (black-green), college of biology; Lorehold (red-white), college of history; and Quandrix (green-blue), college of math. The university is also home to the famous Mystical Archive, a magic library that is said to contain a copy of every spell ever cast.&#10;&#10;The set contains 275 cards, as well as 63 special Mystical Archive cards that are alternate-art reprints of popular instants and sorceries from Magic's past. It is sold in draft boosters, set boosters, collector boosters, theme boosters, and bundles.&#10;&#10;",

The deck also contains &quot;volume up&quot; cards that only add a single component such as onion or cheese.

That player loses the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to the balance mode, the game also comes with two 2 player modes, Nico Burger Cooking and Nico Burger Sandwich&#10;&#10;Nico burger cooking is a speed variant in which players reveal several order cards then race to build and wrap up the burgers with the included paper wrappers. The fastest player wins.&#10;&#10;Nico burger sandwich is a checkers/chess like variant played on the included paper board where players move their markers a single space orthogonally in an attempt to capture opponent's pieces by &quot;sandwiching&quot; an opponent's piece between two of their own.&#10;&#10;",

Then Admiral of the Fleet and its companion publications The Flag Officer's Handbook and AOTF Scenarios Volume I may be just what you are looking for.&#10;&#10;Due to the popularity of surface-only engagements and the difficulties inherent in an accurate portrayal of the additional dimensions required by the addition of aircraft and submarines to the game table, AOTF focuses exclusively on surface warfare during the age of the battleship.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Paraguayans captured the town and fortified surrounding area soon after war broke out the year before. In July a massive offensive organized by General Hans Kundt by the Bolivians was launched to retake the area which they hoped would lead to the fall of Concepcion.

Players will lead either the English forces of King Henry V or the French nobility in the levying of forces, management of logistics, and campaigning through Northern France. Designed by Joe Schmidt, Henry aims to create a more streamlined version of Levy &amp; Campaign that is equally suitable for someone&rsquo;s first experience  or a quicker lunchtime gaming session.&#10;&#10;The English player will build their army at the outset of the game, and in doing so set their victory conditions based on these choices, and then begin their campaign. While the English march through Normandy, the French Nobles will need to rapidly respond by levying their forces and navigating the internal court politics of their ongoing civil war between the Armagnac and Burgundian factions. Then, once ready for battle, the French will attempt to hunt down and prevent King Hal and his happy few from returning home.&#10;&#10;The Levy &amp; Campaign system offers us something more focused on the human element. Humans need to be fed, and that food needs to be both secured and transported. Without that, even the greatest of armies will fail. Henry endeavors to lift the veil of the mythology of the Battle of Agincourt to offer a more detailed look into the circumstances that created the legend.&#10;&#10;",

Each piece has a number on it that corresponds to the height stack needed to use its movement ability. Stacked pieces can unstack, but only one at a time and can only move like the piece unstacking.&#10;&#10;Turn Overview: On a players turn, they may move any one of their 16 pieces according to traditional Chess piece movements. A player may use any of these movements to stack one or more pieces on top of another. If a stack of pieces already exists, a player may unstack the top piece according to it's Chess movement ability. Only one piece can unstack at a time. After a player makes one move, play proceeds to the next player.&#10;&#10;Like traditional Chess the game ends when one player Wins by capturing their opponent's King, or results in a Stalemate if no players posses the ability to capture their opponents King.&#10;&#10;Other variants of play include: &#10;  Minimizing the board to 3 or 5 lanes, and following the recommended setup.&#10;  Using the Stowe Backgammon Dice to have players moves be determined by rolling a dice.&#10;  In Wild West Chess players simply stack on top of opponents  when capturing pieces. If de-stacked opponents gain back control of their piece(s).&#10; ",

But it's not just a wedding celebration&mdash;it's also the kickoff for a dark ritual that could allow Olivia to take over the world, unless some brave heroes can crash the party and object in time!&#10;&#10;Innistrad: Crimson Vow is a direct sequel to Innistrad: Midnight Hunt, sharing several of the same mechanics and themes. However, where Midnight Hunt shone a spotlight on werewolves, Crimson Vow has a vampire theme. Each vampire card in the set has a special &quot;fang frame&quot; showcase version that appears in boosters approximately half as often as the normal version. Additionally, 18 cards from the set were given a special re-skin representing characters, locations, and events from Bram Stoker's Dracula. These &quot;Dracula Series&quot; cards feature a full-art borderless frame and are found only in collector boosters and as box toppers.&#10;&#10;This set contains 277 cards (100 commons, 83 uncommons, 64 rares, 20 mythic rares, and 10 full-art &quot;Eternal Night&quot; basic lands) and is sold in draft boosters, set boosters, collector boosters, theme boosters, and bundles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This expansion for Magic: The Gathering returns to the gothic horror world of Innistrad. Since we last visited Innistrad in Eldritch Moon, Emrakul's lingering presence has been causing the days to become shorter and shorter, and if nothing is done to stop it, an eternal night will soon fall across the land, leaving nothing to stop the werewolves and vampires from overrunning what's left of humanity. At the Harvesttide Festival, a group of witches has gathered all the defenders of the day together at the Celestus for a last-ditch ritual to bring back the sun&mdash;but the werewolf leader Tovolar and his Dire Pack are ready to lay siege to the festival to stop them.&#10;&#10;Innistrad: Midnight Hunt features the return of the ghosts, zombies, vampires, werewolves, and humans of previous Innistrad sets, but with a special spotlight on werewolves. The set contains more werewolves than any other expansion in Magic history, and all of the werewolves (as well as the witches) have a special alt-art &quot;equinox&quot; showcase version that appears about half as often as the normal version. The flagship mechanic is Day and Night, a revamp of the original werewolf mechanic from Innistrad. Other new mechanics include Disturb, Decayed, and Coven.&#10;&#10;The set contains 277 cards (100 commons, 83 uncommons, 64 rares, 20 mythic rares, and 10 full-art &quot;Eternal Night&quot; basic lands) and is sold in draft boosters, set boosters, collector boosters, theme boosters, and bundles. Two tie-in Commander decks were also released alongside the main set: Coven Counters, a green-white deck themed around the Coven mechanic, and Undead Unleashed, a blue-black zombie deck based on the Decayed mechanic.&#10;&#10;",

The set is designed to evoke the feeling of D&amp;D.

Special showcase frames evoke classic D&amp;D module covers and monster entries. Many of the spells have names like &quot;You're Ambushed on the Road&quot; and &quot;You Come to a River&quot; and offer you a choice of what to do. Even the basic lands have flavor text providing a small adventure hook.&#10;&#10;The set contains 281 cards and is sold in draft boosters, set boosters, collector boosters, theme boosters, and bundles. Four preconstructed Commander decks were also released alongside the main set as tie-ins.&#10;&#10;",

The theme of the game is deep-sea diving with a beautiful and apparently quite large illustrated board. The visual interest is much of the natural appeal of the game, which is a simple roll-and-move race.&#10;&#10;It's a nearly straight drop for the first 25 to 30 spaces on either side. Landing on circled spaces, which become more frequent from that point on, send a player back three spaces. There are a couple of obvious &quot;log jam&quot; areas on either side where players may find themselves circling for several turns.&#10;&#10;The game is undated but likely comes from 1910&ndash;1920. Brian Love's &quot;Play the Game&quot; (1978) suggests one player is red and one is yellow (matching the tracks on the board), but we do not know if this is supported by the original designers.&#10;&#10;",

Fatal Knockout comes with six fighters with completely unique decks. Player's play cards which allow them to move, change orientation, and attack on the board. On top of that, each fighter has one-of-a-kind abilities that are triggered by playing cards.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they draw to their hand up to three cards. The leader of the round places one card face down, the second player follows. At this point the leader can choose to play another card, or reveal. This continues until either the leader reveals all cards or players run out of cards.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will be dealing damage to each other with fighter specific cards. The game ends when there is only one fighter left standing, the player left standing is the winner.&#10;&#10;Fatal Knockout can be played with just two players, but can also be played in a tournament style where players advance through brackets with the aim of being crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;",

In addition to the forces in the basic package, American forces will have at their disposal combat engineers from the Big Red One, a battalion of Rangers, an infantry regiment from the 29th Division and the 743rd American Tank Battalion. The German forces were not left behind and had at their disposal a battalion of the Festungkompanie, Panzer-Aufklarungs and a Panzergruppe of the 2nd Panzer Division to fiercely defend the beach. Let's not forget the addition of the High Command which will allow you to play the American and German air force, but also to rain artillery on your opponent, will you choose the explosive or smoke shells?&#10;&#10;New heroes are available for both sides, and a plethora of equipment and support options.

Recruit graduates (or loser dropouts!) to form a Party of 4 heroically brave and / or extremely gullible Adventurers to Explore Forgotten Ruins, Battle Fearsome Monsters and Loot Unique Treasures (or everything that is not nailed down... and maybe even some things that ARE nailed down!).&#10;&#10;Players create characters, train them and send them on dungeon crawling adventures to gather loot.  The game ends when the characters return from dungeon (or die trying).&#10;&#10;",

The moment has arrived to seek out the best specialists of each guild and to apply their skills and knowledge to turn this monument into something that will even surprise the Tsar himself.  It&rsquo;s necessary to send contractors to the far reaches of Russia to be able to stand out from the competition and achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Contractors is the first expansion of The Red Cathedral, the hit game from Shei Santos and Isra Cendrero in which players construct Moscow&rsquo;s St. Basil&rsquo;s Cathedral and compete to make the most memorable contribution and win the favor of the Tsar.  The expansion is also illustrated by Pedro Soto and Chema Rom&aacute;n, two artists inspired by the work of Ivan Bilbin, the Russian artist renowned for his majestic representation of Slavic folklore in his works.  The Red Cathedral stands out among recent games for its original rondel mechanism, winning the hearts of thousands of gamers around the world.&#10;&#10;The expansion comes in a box that contains almost as much content as the original game and takes the experience into another dimension.  In Contractors we find 10 new guilds that can be combined with those from the basic game, 6 additional blueprint cards, and a new card for the solo mode.  Many of these new guilds use the Contractors module, which among other things, adds a new board containing a map of Russia.  We will send our contractors throughout Russia to recruit the talent of the best specialists and artisans of the country to aid in the construction of the cathedral.&#10;&#10;As in the original game, each of these guilds contains 3 different cards, of which one per guild can be included into the game, meaning that Contractors offers 30 new different ways to play The Red Cathedral.  And among other highlights are a black die that can be used alongside the 5 existing dice used to obtain resources, diamonds which serve as a wild-card form of resource, and the contractors, which are Cossack meeples that incorporate a worker placement element into the game.&#10;&#10;",

Will they manage to prevail or will they get squashed by the Ottoman empire?&#10;&#10;1821: Fight for Freedom is a strategy card game that puts the players in the role of the rebellion's main characters. By playing cards from their hands, the players try to gain control of large areas of Greece and minimize their opponent's potential. Whoever manages to gain control of these areas, is the game's winner!&#10;&#10;In the game, the players have cards in their hands with the main characters from Greece's War of Independence. They also have 3 cards in front of them, representing 3 large areas of Greece. Each player, on their turn, may place more units in those areas or discard cards to move the existing units. When units of opposite sides end up next to each other, battles occur which are determined by the units' strength and cards played for support. If a player ends up having a total of 10 or more power in one area, at the beginning of their turn, they gain a control marker in that area. The first player to place a control marker in each area or 5 markers in total, is the winner!&#10;&#10;The game is also played with 4 players in teams - 2 vs 2. In this case, the player fight for the control of 4 areas in total and the winning team is the one that either places a control marker in all 4 areas or places 7 control markers in total.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;&Mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#206;&#172;
