    "Description": "Each player tries to erode their mountain and generate the most amount of sediment in their delta. Players erode their mountains with the processes they successfully bid on and acquire. The sediment supplied to the delta becomes the coinage used in the bidding process. Mountains uplift 1,500 meters per turn until one player reaches 8,000 meters, or until the &quot;Active Uplift Shutdown&quot; event card is drawn. Then, it's a race to see who can erode their mountain away the fastest. When a player successfully erodes their mountain, the game ends. The winner is the player with the most sediment in their delta, after subtracting any sediment that remains in their mountain.&#10;&#10;To the play the game, you need to print out a copy of the rules, the bidding row, the game cards (the card types include event, process, mountain front, and mountain type), and enough game boards for the number of players that will play. A cool rock and a cup to hold the sediment is also needed. You will also need to buy a couple boxes of Jujubees (you can eat them while you play), as they are the &quot;sediment&quot; used in the game.&#10;&#10;The designer recommended printing the game materials (except the rules) in color, on 11&quot; x 17&quot; cardstock. To make the game, the designer recommended using a paper cutter, a glue stick, scissors (for minor clean up), and scotch tape.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Erosion&quot; v. 1.0 ZIP file was available for download as of May 9, 2008 at the designer's former webpage&#10;&#10;The files have been unavailable since Sierra Madre Games announced that they were publishing a revised version of Erosion in 2009.&#10;&#10;",

Each have three pieces, moving by rolls of a die along interconnected paths that lead to the treasure. The paths are organized in three distinctive levels with paths between them. The players can knock out other player's pieces by landing on them so they start over (just like in Ludo). The paths include special spots, including green spots (skip three turns), red spots (slide down to an earlier path, like in Snakes&amp;Ladders) and blue spots (entrance to the next level).&#10;&#10;It is clearly of german origin since it is designed by Rolf Kauka, a famous german cartoonist. German publications and name are unknown. A swedish low-cost version was sold in Sweden in the 1970's, most likely produced by Klee. Although Klee is not printed on the game, Klee made other games in identical boxes with similar part numbers.&#10;&#10;The game is mostly known in Sweden through a famous comedy sketch from the late 60's, with four adults trying to socialize by playing the game but the play quickly turns into bickering. This makes the game particularly interesting as a game that everybody knows about but few have played.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 Boardgame&#10;12 playing pieces 4x3 &#10;1 dice&#10;&#10;",

Add to that the earthquakes, mudslides, flooding, and avalanches and it is easy to see why Kamchatka is literally a force of nature.&#10;&#10;The fauna is just as imposing: Giant roc-like eagles reign from above (seriously, google Stellar&rsquo;s Eagles-these things are unreal!); huge sockeye salmon are plentiful in the many rivers and waterways; walrus and seals live and breed along the shores; herds of reindeer number in the thousands; and there is a greater density of giant grizzly bear in Kamchatka than anywhere else in the world.&#10;&#10;GAME&#10;In Kamchatka you must fight to survive.  Time stands still here: You play an indigenous hunter hundreds&mdash;even thousands&mdash;of years ago surrounded by Kamchatka&rsquo;s frigid seas, great rivers, dense forests, and snowcapped volcanic mountains.  Your village depends on you and your small hunting party to hunt, trap, and trade in order to search out the resources they need.  You will risk your life on this journey through Kamchatka&rsquo;s harsh bush and in its treacherous seas to bring back the required resources to your villagers.&#10;&#10;Kamchatka is designed to play solitaire or for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;",

The games were likely published concurrently (1987) or quite close apart, which make them among the last publications of Paletti.&#10;&#10;The general idea of the game is to try and climb the rock on which the philosopher's stone (Viisasten Kivi) lies; this happens by picking cards and answering the questions correctly to move three spaces ahead, up to a maximum of two cards per player turn. Unlike usual trivia games, this is a bit more casual in that mixed in with the question cards are also event cards which work like event cards in a typical roll-and-move game ie. pass a turn, move ahead two, move back one etc., with flavor text. There are also blank cards which can either be used to make house questions or to be optionally mixed in the deck too, in this case a blank card simply means &quot;pass the turn&quot;.&#10;&#10;Includes 150 cards; 100 question cards with 5 questions each, 25 event cards and 25 blanks, in three decks with tuckboxes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deep Blue Death is a simple &quot;beer &amp; pretzels&quot; wargame for two players. Each player controls a fleet of submarines and decoys by issuing a limited number of orders each turn. Players must manage their resources carefully to win. Victory conditions depend on the scenario.&#10;&#10;The PDF includes rules, counters, scenarios and a map.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;In the year 2020 mankind finds themselves with little but submarines after a terrorist attack. Use your sonar to distinguish between subs and decoys. Fire rocket powered torpedoes through the water at 200 miles per hour! Dodge enemy torpedoes with noisemakers or evasive maneuvers. But manage your resources carefully; when you&rsquo;re out of torpedoes, you&rsquo;re just a target.&#10;&#10;",

So they start tasting everything: cheese, chocolate, butter, plums, frozen pizza,&#10;spinach, potato chips, canned fish, raspberry marmalade&hellip;&#10;Suddenly their faces go all funny with squares. &ldquo;I feel really sick!&rdquo; moans Tim Taster-lots. &ldquo;I have eaten so much I can't move&rdquo;, complains Daddy Taster-lots. They all know they have eaten too much. But what should they have eaten and how? Can you help?&#10;&#10;Throughout the game you collect the foodstuff that your body needs during the day. Doing so, you should collect neither too much nor too little foodstuff. The food pyramid printed on your stamp sheet shows how much and which foods you should eat during the day. Each little box of the pyramid corresponds to one portion of the foodstuff shown.&#10;Example: Your body needs 4 portions of fruit and vegetables while you should only eat 1 portion of sweets (a portion is as much as fits in your hand).&#10;The aim of the game is to be the first to have checked all the boxes on your nutritional sheet with a stamp.&#10;&#10;",

The sooner you guess, the higher the possible points; but beware, once a guess has been made, that's it. A wrong guess scores nothing at all. Players have to decide whether to gamble for an early guess, or to hold fire and try to score extra points for having the correct country, body and engine type cards in their hand.  This game includes over 70 large, beautifully photographed classic cars, old and modern. Launched by Top Gear, the hugely successful BBC TV programme.&#10;Game components:&#10;1 x playing board&#10;1 x pack of 72 car cards in full colour&#10;2 x packs of 50 cards comprising;&#10;- Pit Stop, &#10;- Engine Type, Body Type and Country of Origin.&#10;6 x assorted coloured playing pawns&#10;1 x hide and reveal mechanism&#10;1 x 6-sided standard dice&#10;1 x 6-sided coloured spot dice&#10;1 x rules sheet&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a hunting game that consists of driving out to the hunting lodge, spending 5 days (laps around the lodge area) hunting, then driving back home.  Aside from rolling dice to determine how far to move the game is played primarily with a big composite spinner, which determines the outcome of things like shooting game, luck at the horse track, and playing poker.  Everyone starts with $300 and 5 credentials.  Driving is mostly uneventful except for small financial transactions.  Luck &quot;in the field&quot; is determined by flipping over situation cards when you land on situation space.  Some cards have animals you can try to shoot at, others have bad luck type situations you need to over come by moving or playing a credential card.  Each time a player circumnavigates the lodge (spends one day hunting) they receive a credential and have an opportunity to answer a hunting or safety related question for a cash bonus.&#10;&#10;",

Slowly and carefully, he takes the big magic cube from the pedestal. 'Now, how did that correct spell go?'. Then he remembers. With a firm voice he shouts 'Butterfingers Cube', takes his magic ring and lets it skillfully fall into the cube. The other apprentices hold their breath - if nothing falls out of the cube, Bobby will pass the test.&#10;&#10;Whoever can hold the magic cube with a steady hand and skillfully let the objects fall inside, will be left at the end of the game with the fewest objects in front of them.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
