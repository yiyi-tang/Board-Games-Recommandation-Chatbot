    "Description": "Now the Hunt for Blackbeard is on again. As Blackbeard, you must select your anchorage carefully, as you&rsquo;ll need all your guile to survive. Will you cash in for the diversions of a pirate&rsquo;s life, or return to acts of piracy as your money runs out? The hunters are coming&mdash;evade them, or prepare defenses and risk luring them in? As the Hunters, how long can you afford to press your stable of informants and arm your expedition? You know Blackbeard: he will not sit idle. His ambitions may expose him, but he is getting stronger day by day. How will you approach&mdash;a flushing strategy, or a precision strike? Be careful, as your quarry is apt to bite!&#10;&#10;Hunt for Blackbeard pits two players against one another as hunter and hunted in a fast-moving game of detection, deception, and confrontation.&#10;&#10;Hunt for Blackbeard is a two-player boardgame that portrays the effort in 1718 by the colony of Virginia and the Royal Navy to track down the notorious pirate Blackbeard (Edward Thatch) as he sought refuge in colonial North Carolina. It features the historical events, places, and personages involved in Blackbeard&rsquo;s demise 300 years ago, and the real-world challenges of &ldquo;golden-age&rdquo; piracy and pirate hunting. Players. One player takes the role of Blackbeard and the other the pirate hunters. Blackbeard seeks to commit acts of piracy or to enjoy a pirate&rsquo;s life while remaining free. The hunters try to discern Blackbeard&rsquo;s plans to thwart his piracy. The game may end in a battle in which either the hunters capture Blackbeard or the pirate wins by seizing a hunters&rsquo; ship as his prize!&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;In each of up to four turns, players draw secret tiles that gradually reveal opportunities for Blackbeard to pursue his piratical aims and for the hunters to interview informants who may know of Blackbeard&rsquo;s whereabouts.&#10;&#10;The players next commit Action pawns behind their screens to prepare defenses, sail, scout, or plan piracy. Blackbeard then secretly records any changes to the information on the main map. As the hunters take their turn, they inspect markers on the map&mdash;often secretly&mdash;as they seek Blackbeard, his camp, or any wake of his passage. Blackbeard will not know how much the hunters have learned before they strike!&#10;&#10;Combat ensues if hunters catch up with Blackbeard&rsquo;s sloop. If Blackbeard remains unchallenged at the right location, he carries out his piracy, placing gold cubes onto tiles among those drawn. Blackbeard can win through piracy while evading the hunters. But if a boarding action occurs, the winner automatically takes the game, enabling the pirate to win by girding for a fight and luring the hunters in.&#10;&#10;-extract from publisher description, with a correction from the designer&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of a round, each player is dealt ten ingredient cards. The sand timer is turned and every player has sixty seconds to create three dishes; an appetizer, an entree, and a desert using the ingredient cards in their hand and a pantry that all players have at their disposal. At the end of the sixty seconds each player must write down their three dishes on their menu score sheet. Then going clockwise each player starting to the left of the dealer presents their three dishes to the other players. If there are no objections to the dishes presented, the score is tallied based on the value of the ingredient card and which dish it is used in.&#10;&#10;After four rounds the player with the highest score is considered the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Before there was Empire, there was a ...Partnership? Yes, it was a world of clients and patrons where the words &quot;The Senate and People of Rome&quot; were not the hollow phrase it became under the Empire. For Senators, engaging in business was taboo, but money-making (even from graft) was not, and citizens of the growing Republic shared in their patrons&rsquo; wealth and prestige. But it was at best, a limited liability partnership, an unsuccessful general might merely be banished and replaced by another, but an unsuccessful legion might be....decimated.&#10;&#10;ROME, LLP is a solitaire game of the Roman Republic as it grows from a small city state in 400 BCE to an empire in 27 BCE, when Octavian took the imperial name of Augustus. A prequel to Rome, Inc.: From Augustus to Diocletian, you will again be running a business, but this time the &ldquo;Republic of Rome&rdquo; is starting from scratch with minimal resources and highly competitive rivals, Brennus the Gaul, Hannibal Barca, Mithridates the Great, Spartacus, and Queen Cleopatra.&#10;&#10;The pair of consuls rule Italia, allowing the player to choose which of the co-CEOs are best for the job in hand, with a censor to maintain public morals, and an obstructive tribune representing the workforce, vetoing senatorial appointments, and changing the game by proposing new laws.  Provinces are controlled by a Governor, who collects taxes, quells insurgents, and fights wars, but may March on Rome and make himself Dictator For Life. The player operates behind the scenes, promoting and removing consuls, censors, governors, and tribunes (and dictators in a real emergency) as Roman legions monopolize the Mediterranean.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by winning Prestige, earned by prudent administration, annexing provinces, winning wars, and plying the people with bread and circuses. If the barbarians take Rome, the Republic will fall and the game ends in in defeat, but bankruptcy and popular revolution will have the same effect. You alone control the mechanics of a rising republic, choosing four distinct &ldquo;starting points&rdquo; (400 BCE, 267 BCE, 149 BCE, and 82 BCE) and running scenarios lasting 10-40 turns, depending on your business acumen and endurance. Each turn represents 5-15 years, with 10 turns in each of the four scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher &#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ironsides is an area movement and impulse game depicting four battles of the English Civil Wars; First Newbury, Second Newbury, Preston, and Worcester. In addition, there is a bonus scenario for Third Newbury, where the Parliamentarian armies declined to fight another battle.&#10;&#10;One player controls the Royalist armies of King Charles I, King Charles II, and the Duke of Hamilton. The other player controls the Parliamentarian armies of the Earl of Essex, Earl of Manchester, Sir William Waller, and Oliver Cromwell.&#10;&#10;Philip Jelley uses the same grand tactical area/movement design as Lilliburlero (ATO 40), with counters representing the generals and regiments of horse, foot, dragoons and artillery that fought in the battles. Each turn represents one or two hours of time, with weather and nightfall affecting command, control and activation. Scenarios are included with historical and free deployment, and optional units. Players may deploy on the edge of the maps and manoeuvre to a battlefield of their own choosing. Ironsides contains 470 &frac12; inch counters, one full size and two half sized maps, and a six-page rulebook.&#10;&#10;FIRST NEWBURY, 20 September 1643: The Earl of Essex had marched his army deep into the midlands to relieve the Parliamentarian stronghold of Gloucester only to find the road back to London blocked by the Royalist Army at Newbury. In the bloodiest battle of the war so far 28,000 men fought each other to a standstill in the hedgerows as the London Trained Bands fought off charges by Prince Rupert&rsquo;s Cavaliers. Horrified at the slaughter King Charles I withdrew to Oxford, and Essex returned to London in triumph.&#10;&#10;SECOND NEWBURY, 27 October 1644: After their victory at Lostwithiel King Charles I and Prince Maurice entrenched their armies around Newbury, only to be surrounded by the Parliamentarian armies of Essex, Manchester, and Waller. Outnumbered three to one the war might have ended in an afternoon, but after desperate battle the Royalists survived long enough to escape during the night.&#10;&#10;THIRD NEWBURY, 9 November 1644: Reinforced by the remnants of the Northern Royalists under Prince Rupert, King Charles I returned to Newbury to relieve Donnington Castle and recover the artillery left there after the last battle. Manchester refused to fight, Cromwell accused him of incompetence, Manchester accused Cromwell of insubordination, and the resulting furore led to the creation of the New Model Army. This is the battle that might have been.&#10;&#10;PRESTON, 17 August 1648: The captive King Charles I made a deal with the Duke of Hamilton to restore him to the throne with a Scottish Army. Hamilton invaded England with the help of Sir Marmaduke Langdale&rsquo;s Northern Royalists just as uprisings across England and Wales stretched the New Model Army to the limit. Cromwell force-marched his &ldquo;Ironsides&rdquo; 300 miles from Wales to join John Lambert&rsquo;s Northern Army so they could attack the Royalists despite being outnumbered two to one. They defeated Langdale on Preston Moor, and caught Hamilton&rsquo;s divided and disorganised army crossing the River Ribble. After his victory Cromwell marched on London, purged Parliament, and executed the King.&#10;&#10;WORCESTER, 3 September 1651; Charles II succeeded his father as King of the Scots, but Cromwell invaded Scotland and destroyed the Scottish Army at Dunbar on 3 September 1650. Raising a new army, the young king slipped past Cromwell into England, and tried to rally English Royalists to his cause. Cromwell followed him with the New Model Army, gathering County Trained Bands as he marched south. Intent on a battle of annihilation that would end the civil wars for once and for all he surrounded the Royalists at Worcester on the River Severn. Seeing the Parliamentarian army divided by the river, Charles II attacked one half, but was defeated as Cromwell used a bridge of boats to reinforce his threatened flank. The Scottish army was destroyed and Charles escaped into exile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Place secret bids on 14 unique characters (7 male, 7 female) worth points based on their industry experience.&#10;&#10;Each round you are dealt 9 cards and are faced with three new porn stars at the center of the table. All players sort the cards in their hands and simultaneously at the count of three you place between 1 and 7 cards face down in a pile in front of you to bid on the first star. Cards are then revealed one at a time around the table, starting with the top card in your pile, and some hilarious and unexpected situations will arise as cards begin to interact with one another.&#10;&#10;Highest Bidder: Porn Stars utilizes programmed actions. Once placed, you cannot rearrange the order of the cards in your bid pile. Some cards are Cash Cards which add to your current bid, others are text-based Effect Cards including &quot;Draw a random card&quot;, &quot;The next card revealed by an opponent is invalid&quot;, &quot;The current Porn Star is worth double points&quot;, and more.&#10;&#10;The game continues for 5 rounds with the final round having only two Porn Stars that are automatically worth double points. Will you go all-in on the most valuable stars or will you spread out your bids for an larger orgy of lower-scoring talent?&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Who was the first one to get into the right line?&#10;&#10;Set up&#10;Place all 4 animal tokens to form a square where everyone can reach. Then shuffle the cards well and form a face-down pile in the centre of those tokens.&#10;&#10;Playing Game&#10;Starting with the youngest player, open the card and put into the middle of the items. When the scoring is solved, play continue to next player in a clock-wise direction.&#10;&#10;Objective of the game&#10;The player who chooses the correct animal will get 1 point each. If a player mis chooses it, that player will get -2 points per each. Players cannot have negative point therefore the lowest point is 0. Whoever gets the 15 points first, will win the game. If there is a tied, all players continue playing until one of the players achieve highest score alone.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It is played with a unique deck of cards numbered 1-13 and each card has an ability written on it.&#10;&#10;The objective of a round is to get rid of cards in your hand by playing them onto separate piles in descending order from 7 to 1, and ascending order from 8 to 13. The objective of the game is to be the wealthiest Kingdom at the end.&#10;&#10;There are four &quot;suits&quot;: Kingdom of Dragons (orange), Kingdom of Pixies (purple), Kingdom of Seafarers (blue) and Kingdom of Animals (green). In general, it is good to have cards of mid values as these must be played before the higher and lower cards can be played.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with 20 coins each. At the start of each round they must pay 1 coin in tax to their Kingdom. When a player plays the &quot;Tax Collector&quot; (number 11) they get to collect all taxes currently on that Kingdom.&#10;&#10;A round ends when someone plays their last card. All other players must pay coins based on the cards still in their hands &mdash; very low and very high cards cost more.&#10;&#10;If at any point someone is unable to play a card they must take &quot;the Plague&quot;. Whoever has the Plague when a round ends must pay an additional penalty of 3 coins.&#10;&#10;There's a second deck of cards called &quot;Prosperity Cards&quot;. Whenever you play the number 12 of any Kingdom you get to draw a Prosperity Card. These cards have special perks such as forcing another player to play a specific card, or moving the Plague to another player. They are kept face up in front of you and can be activated at any time during the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone runs out of coins, at which point the player with the most coins is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Legendary Bahadurs (LB), a new expansion for its game Aristeia!, which will expand the options available to players and the versatility of the games with four new characters, each one with a new playstyle. Legendary Bahadurs is not a complete game, you need a Aristeia! Core Box to play.&#10;&#10;This expansion sees the return of four of the greatest Bahadurs &quot;Aristeia Champions&quot; to the HexaDome. The famous commentator of Vissiorama and five-time Bahadur, Final Boss, has decided to return to the competition by gathering a team of old companions. Shona Carano, a remarkable swordswoman; Koorie Queen, the very first Bahadur; and Oberon, a support geist.&#10;&#10;Shona Carano's game role.&#10;Shona Carano is a specialist in short-range combat, where she is quite lethal. It&rsquo;s a profile that stands out in scenarios where there are character clusters, or it&rsquo;s important to conquer and defend a Scoring Zone.&#10;Some of her tactics have the ability to execute free actions.&#10;Her Attributes are average, and her Defense is low, so she has to act quickly and take great care of Enemy Shooters.&#10;&#10;Koorie Queen's game role.&#10;She is a harasser specializing in the hunting and incapacitation of support characters, or characters with a low Hit Points value.&#10;She makes use of the Hidden State only while performing Offensive Actions.&#10;Her Bounce Ability is perfect to finish off injured Enemies. In addition, it imposes the IStunned State.&#10;Koorie Queen&rsquo;s Defense and her Agility, in combination with her Switch, make her very elusive.&#10;&#10;Final Boss' game role.&#10;This is a complete profile if there ever was one. Final Boss is an off-tank with stamina by virtue of his good Defense and his Automatic Ability i-Khol, with the ability to deal damage over a short range with his Attack.&#10;He has great Brawn and Agility values which give him the ability to activate his Switch and impose the IStunned State within short Range.&#10;You can impose the States Dazzled and -2U, which gives him a bit of control ability.&#10;&#10;Oberon's game role.&#10;Oberon is a support character that works with our Tactics deck, and imposes a new State in the game: Silenced. Taking into account the Mulligan at the start of the game, and the cards &ldquo;I have a Plan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Catch your Breath&rdquo;, it won&rsquo;t be difficult to get the desired Tactics with Oberon on hand.&#10;At the cost of discarding a Tactic, it offers the opportunity to add Yellow dice to any Roll of an Ally. This variant of Focused is extremely useful for anyone who uses &quot;!&quot;.&#10;As is standard with support characters, his Defense is weak and his Hit Points value make him a very fragile target.&#10;&#10;The expansion introduces the Silenced State.&#10;&#10;",

Use the lower half of the cylindrical package as your Dice Cup. Grab a piece of paper and a pen for scoring (not included).&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME&#10;The object of the game is to use as many of the 28 Word Dice as possible in the three minutes allotted to form logically correct sentences. All sentences must intersect at one or more points.&#10;Correct: They desire her lips&#10;Incorrect: They lips her desire&#10;The player or team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;&#10;     Any number of consenting adults may play. Create two or more equal teams of players. If there are only two players, you can just play with yourself.&#10;     It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who goes first, so to start, the first team places all 28 Word Dice in the Dice Cup. The bottom half of the package is used as the Dice Cup. Shake the Dice Cup thoroughly, and roll all the Word Dice onto the playing surface.&#10;     Invert the timer immediately and begin forming sentences with words on the top side of the Word Dice. Play stops when the timer runs out (after approximately three minutes). IMPORTANT! Any blank Dice rolled may be used as any word the&#10;&#10;&#10;players desire. It should be noted, however, that blank Dice have no point value when calculating the point total.&#10;&#10;     Any noun may be made plural. Example: Man to Men or Woman to Women&#10;     Any verb may have an -S, -ING, -LY, or -ED added to suit the sense of the particular sentence it is used in. Example:&#10;&#10;&#10; I SPANK SHE SPANKS YOU ARE SPANKING WE SPANKED&#10; (Note: the ending of -PERY may also be added to the verb SLIP, making it the adjective SLIPPERY.)&#10;&#10;     You may use any punctuation you like! This is one time where you don't need to panic if you have a missing period.&#10;&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;&#10;     Five points are scored for each Word Die used at the end of the three minutes.&#10;     Deduct three points for each Word Die not used.&#10;     Any Word Die used in two sentences is given a double value&ndash;&#10;&#10;&#10;10 points!&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME&#10;The suggested game length is three rounds...if you can last that long. The person or team with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner, and presented with an M.D.W. (Master of Dirty Words).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "OBJECT OF THE GAME&#10;Collect five (5) Pillow Cards by matching the answer of the &ldquo;Room Owner.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;     Place 30 Image Cards inside the Wood Box. All other Image Cards may be set aside. They won&rsquo;t be used in the game. The Image Cards do not need to be played by number sequence.&#10;     Give a matching set of three (3) Choice Cards to each player: Disturb and Join In, Shut the Door, and Call the Police.&#10;     Place the Pillow Cards in a pile to the right of the Wood Box.&#10;&#10;&#10;Now you are ready to play.&#10;&#10;WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE &ldquo;DO NOT DISTURB&rdquo; CHOICE CARDS&#10;There are three choices, and these are the choices that players need to match to the Room Owner to win pillow cards. &ldquo;Disturb and Join In&rdquo; &ldquo;Shut the Door&rdquo; &ldquo;Call the Police&rdquo;&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME (LET&rsquo;S DO IT)&#10;&#10;     The player who most recently spent a night in a hotel room goes first and is the Room Owner.&#10;     The Room Owner opens the Door of the Wood Box (without showing the other players) and sees what is happening behind the Door.&#10;     The Room Owner then takes one of his/her three Choice Cards and places it in the bottom section of the Wood Box. It is important that the &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; side is face up so that other players don&rsquo;t see the answer when they open the Door.&#10;     The Wood Box passes to the next player on the left to open the Door and make his/her choice. The player places his/her Choice Card in the bottom section of the Wood Box with the &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; side facing up. All players are trying to correctly match what decision the Room Owner will make, not what they would do. To win a Pillow Card, players must match the response (Choice Card) that the Room Owner selected.&#10;     Play continues clockwise until all players have opened the Door and chosen the Choice Card that they think the Room Owner selected.&#10;     Once the Door has been passed to all players and returns to the Room Owner, he/she opens the Door and takes all of the Choice Cards out. Each player who matched the Room Owner wins a Pillow Card. If all players match the Room Owner, then the Room Owner also gets a Pillow Card.&#10;    . The Wood Box is then passed to the player on the left (the next Room Owner) who takes out the prior Image Card and secretly reveals a new Image Card so that other players don&rsquo;t see the image. (The Image Cards are all stacked in the Wood Box, so when the prior Image Card is taken out, a new one will be revealed.)&#10;     The Room Owner then selects his/her Choice Card and puts it in the Wooden Box with the Do Not Disturb side up. Play again passes to the left as each player again chooses a Choice Card and places it inside the Wood Box. Play continues in this manner until one player has collected five Pillow Cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME&#10;&#10;     The first player to reach the RED space wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The countless seances and spiritual meetings awoke something dark and sinister and ancient. Madness and misfortune swept through the city, as those dark and ancient things they woke tightened their grip on the city.&#10;&#10;The local people, in their wisdom, blamed the madness on toxoplasmosis from cat poop. All cats were banished harshly from the city. A few werecats living nearby found out about the terrible mistreatment of their fellow feline friends and have come to the city looking for some payback....and tasty meals!&#10;&#10;Vampires who have &quot;lived&quot; unnoticed in the city for nearly 2 centuries have decided that the time is right to take control of their city...before something else does!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The rail busses reflect passenger transport by rail in rural areas of the Bergisch Land, which was not attractive enough for the use of normal passenger trains. The challenge for 18BL is to find the right mix of locomotives and rail busses according to the available rail network and the connected cities and towns.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rail Roads &amp; Robber Barons is a board/card game inspired by the 18XX series of games.  All the fun and strategy of trains, stocks, delivery's, profits, and hand management, in about a fifth of the time!&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 1 to 6 players.  Solo play is handled by the use of AI decks to represent other players.  There are standard AI decks, which are a challenge all by themselves, or you can chose to play against other legendary Barons, each with their own strengths and play styles.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of Rail Roads and Robber Barons of the mid to late 1800's as rail lines grew to cover the United States and immense profits were there for the taking... with the right moves.  The choice of which Baron and which Company to take at the beginning is very important, as each gives a player unique advantages.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by Action cards, which the players use to guide their turn.  Once an Action card is used, it can't be used again until you step back for a turn and retrieve them, so you have to plan ahead and pay attention to what your fellow Barons are doing.  Don't get caught with that vital Action card you need unavailable to you!&#10;&#10;As players place down their trains and complete the available contracts, they earn money that can be used to upgrade their trains or buy stock in theirs or other player's companies.  Balance is required, because if you invest heavily in the stock market early, you may be caught short when your train is too slow to fulfill the remaining contracts.  As a Baron completes contracts and upgrades their train, their stock becomes more and more valuable and it much more expensive for you to buy into.  Stocks also pay out dividends when their Baron completes a contract, giving a player much needed cash, but careful decisions are required to manage the best use of a player's money.&#10;&#10;Buying more powerful Engines is the key to making more money, but even here many choices face each Baron.  The first train purchased in each strength is a prototype that comes with a special ability that allows the player to modify or even break the game rules, however these Engines are more expensive then the standard ones.  A player can also pay extra when they purchase a train to skip a level or two and dramatically increase their engine power, but doing so costs much needed capitol.  As stronger Engines are purchased, the price of the weaker engines becomes reduced.  So, a player can be patient if they want, let others pay heavily to upgrade and then swoop in and buy that slower train at a hefty discount, then use their extra funds to buy stock or save to upgrade to faster Engine themselves at a later time. Both strategies, and many in between, can win the game, but the player has to adapt to what the other Barons are doing and flexibility is the key.&#10;&#10;Even the completing of contracts requires decisions.  Do you place one of your trains to claim the payout, or do you invest even more in the delivery and place one of your few City Station tiles instead.  As you complete Routes, you will be placing cargo in the Depot, and your Routes with Cities in them give you even more crates in the Depot, which will result in larger payouts at the end of the game.... but if you spend too many resources on your Cities, you may lose valuable time while you replenish your hand, time other Barons are surely using to make more money.&#10;&#10;In the end, players cash out their stock, count their funds on hand, receive bonuses for the trains they've purchased and the cargo they have waiting in the Depot.  The Baron with the most money wins and becomes a legendary Tycoon!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A two player abstract wargame simulating a revolutionary movement in a fictional South American country. The wargame mechanics were influenced by Irish Freedom by David Kershaw and Guerrilla Checkers by Brian Train.&#10;&#10;One player takes the role of the Government and aims to stay in power, through any means necessary, by the end of twenty turns of play. The other player leads the Rebels and is seeking to become the next government by taking control, support, legitimacy and finally the capital, from the Government player. If the Rebel player wins the game starts over but this time with the players swapping sides - the units present at the end of first game become the starting forces for the next game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Steam TTS link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1547060021&amp;searchtext=viva+la+revolution&#10;&#10;PAXims review: https://paxsims.wordpress.com/2018/11/10/playtesting-viva-la-revolution/&#10;&#10;",

But while you collect carbs in front of you, the real action in Money Buns happens above the table between the players. Trade zealously or you might get stuck taking your buns out of the oven before they are ready!&#10;&#10;Buns come off your conveyor belt every turn whether you want them or not so even the most timid players will be trading away with enthusiasm.&#10;&#10;Players each start off with a hand of carbs and are working to build up collections of the same carb on the table in front of them. The more copies of a carb in a batch, the more money the baker makes when they sell. Some carbs are rarer than others, and as such, they will earn a baker more money per card.&#10;&#10;The catch is that players only have 3 ovens to bake carbs in, and you can't put your ginger snaps in with your challah bread, so when new carbs come off a player's conveyor belt, they might have to toss out a batch before it can be sold for profit. To avoid this fate, players can trade with each other during their turn, often bluffing or hiding info about the most valuable carbs they may have to offer.&#10;&#10;Each turn the active player adds carbs from their hand into their ovens, adds new carbs into the mix from the draw deck, and optionally trades with other players. If desired, the player may also cash in their batches for money to make room for a new carb collection in that oven and to inch closer to victory.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the player with the most money after three rounds of play.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
