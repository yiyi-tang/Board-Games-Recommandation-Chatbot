Five... Four... Three...&#10;&#10;The Thing is an unauthorised non-collectable, non-profit game for two to six players, based on the 1982 horror movie masterpiece &quot;John Carpenter's The Thing&quot;, and simulates the paranoid members of an American Antarctic research facility (Outpost 31) being overrun by - or conquering - a parasitic alien organism capable of perfectly imitating its victims. One player begins as the Thing - all the other players start as human.&#10;&#10;The game is primarily played out using six asymmetrical card decks - three decks for each side (each deck corresponds to a different section of the narrative). Managing your hand of cards, and when to use each deck, is key to winning the game.&#10;&#10;The twelve members of the Outpost 31 team cards are positioned between the players, with each human player taking one character. The team then have to overcome various encounters, while trying to stay alive, in an effort to stop the Thing. Encounters are directly taken from film events, and are sorted into three separate acts - the second and third acts are shuffled, and then all three acts are placed together, forming one narrative (in this way, each game is a little different). Some example encounters: Autopsy of Norwegian-Thing, Battle in Dogtown, Explore Norwegian Base, Conduct Blood Test, and Investigate Crashed Saucer Site. In addition, the Outpost team must allocate men to tasks that may aid in their victory over the Thing. The truth being that the humans will not be able to achieve all that they want to do and will have to prioritise. All the while, the Thing player will do all in its power to thwart the human players, while attempting to construct its Blair-saucer in a secret ice cavern by cannibalising parts from the bulldozer, radio room, and helicopter.&#10;&#10;During the game, at various stages, the Thing player has the opportunity to place infection or dummy infection cards under the human character cards. Later in the game, the Thing may even directly infect other players (unbeknownst to the remaining players), or give the impression to the others that it has! The humans must keep their wits about them if they are to fight and win against the Thing, or they may find themselves fighting each other....&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;1. The Outpost #31 team win if they survive the final confrontation, having destroyed the camp and sabotaged the Thing's Blair-saucer - and have killed all the Things.&#10;&#10;     If they are mistaken and some Things remain: the Things win.&#10;     If they killed a non-infected player: the Thing wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;2. The Thing wins if it completes construction of its Blair-saucer.&#10;3. The Thing wins if all the humans have been assimilated or killed.&#10;4. The Outpost #31 team win if the survivors manage to fly to the coast in the helicopter.&#10;5. The Outpost #31 team win if they contact McMurdo base by radio.&#10;&#10;Please note: This game is strictly for adults - with profanity and horrific imagery on many of the cards.&#10;&#10;You can find the game here: The THING Card Game now Available!&#10;You can explore the rules here: THING Rulebook&#10;And you can discover the deck guide here: Visual THING Deck Guide&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Things&#10;     The Thing: Man Is the Warmest Place To Hide&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game uses a unique system of movement for trucks, wartraks and bikes to locate riches and beat up rival mobs.

Each player starts with a random card in their play area, and the remaining cards are divided into stacks, with one being face down and the others having the top card face up.&#10;&#10;On a turn, draw a card from the top of any stack, then either place it adjacent to a card already in your field or on top of a card in your field. If you draw a face-up card, flip the next card in the stack face up. When a player takes the last card from a stack, they place it, then the game ends.&#10;&#10;At game's end, every 4 in your field must be part of a group of exactly four 4s, and the same goes for every 3 and 2 in your field. Each 1 must not be adjacent to another 1. Any cards that violate these rules are removed from your field (including any covered cards), and you lose 1 point for each card removed. Then, for each group of colored cards in your field that contains at least five adjacent cards, score 1 point for each of these cards. Finally, if a card with a butterfly is adjacent to a card of the same color as the butterfly, score 1 point for that card. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Deutschland&quot; contains historical events related to Germany, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Doctor Zero plays differently, having a deck of dedicated cards that determine what they can do: spawn new mutants, move them, or attack officers. The game is scenario-based, and the five episodes form a complete story of Doctor Zero's rise and fall and the officers' epic fight against him. Each episode is playable (and re-playable) on its own, having unique winning conditions and different set-up.&#10;&#10;Imagine a strategy dungeon crawler board game, played in the &quot;1 vs. all&quot; mode &mdash; but in a unique &quot;new retro&quot; setting heavily inspired by B-class action movies and the atmosphere of the 1980s era!

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;",

While the steam locomotive hisses as it is refilled with water from the spout, smiling ranch owners think of the riches they will receive once the train reaches Chicago. Some of them were smart enough to buy shares in the railroad, which finally reached the town this spring. Business is booming!&#10;&#10;In Texas &amp; Pacific, 2-6 players represent wealthy investors and ranchers in the 19th-century U.S. Midwest and Texas. Players buy stock certificates from the major railroads of the era. They compete to earn the most money during the game by carefully timing dividend payments and expanding the railroads across the plains. Stock pays dividends, but has no value in the final scoring. At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pandemain: Traditional Farmers' Bread is a worker placement and bread making game for 1 to 4 players, where you must run a small bakery business located in the village of N&ouml;rdlingen, during the fascinating period of the Middle Ages. Buy ingredients in the market, get flour by visiting the mill, bake your bread in the Feudal Lord&rsquo;s oven and try to sell it in nearby villages. Satisfy the demand with high quality bread and improve your reputation to prosper and emerge victorious. Face the difficulties of the harsh medieval life, in which only a few peasants escaped the servile dependence of the Feudal Lord.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in the medieval region of the Duchy of Schwaben during the year 1276, in the domains of Emperor Rudolf I of Habsburg and under the watchful eye of the Inquisition. The historical base of the game has been verified in ancient documents and history books, and its mechanics are based on readings from original literature of that time. Explore this enigmatic period hidden under layers of mud and ash, and discover the real day to day of the period&rsquo;s peasants.&#10;&#10;Pandemain: Traditional Farmers' Bread is played in turns. Each player starts with four workers and they can get another one if certain conditions are met.&#10;&#10;There are 5 game rounds divided in 4 phases each, with a variable element at the end of the game. In the game, some actions that are chosen by the players (worker placement), and all actions will lead to the selling of the bread they bake in the nearest villages or to the Feudal Lord, which additionally gives you favors (set collection). Each type of bread is sold at a different price and have different point values. The players must collect the correct ingredients for each recipe, bake high quality or low quality bread and sell it, for which they will receive the gratitude from the villages (set collection), allowing them to make extra actions and receive extra points. The players can hire and improve their master bakers (set collection), which allows them to bake the highest quality bread, provide benefits, and increase their reputation. Cows, oxen and wagons add some variability when the players go to acquire the ingredients.&#10;&#10;The Inquisition is also relevant: the players will make donations to the church, which gives them influence to avoid losing points each round and, in return they will give some benefits and points. And not only that, the church also controls the turn order.&#10;&#10;What changes every round?&#10;- Bread demand in each village&#10;- Flour available in the market&#10;- Feudal Lord's servant position&#10;- Inquisition advance&#10;&#10;What changes every game?&#10;- Available master bakers&#10;- Villagers in the villages&#10;- Feudal Lord's favors&#10;- Benefits when donating to the church&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "New England Simulations revisits a familiar World War II venue -- the hedgerows of Normandy -- with some refreshing twists in The Killing Ground: Campaign for Normandy, July-August 1944&quot;. The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).&#10;&#10;As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.&#10;&#10;The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.&#10;&#10;The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.&#10;&#10;In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment. The system adds a level of uncertainty to the game that leads to unexpected combat results and tempers any tendency to attack without some forethought.&#10;&#10;Although primarily designed for two players, the game can accommodate up to four given its size and attention to detail. The Killing Ground includes five scenarios, all historical.&#10;&#10;Game Scale&#10;Units: Primarily regimental with tank and other support units as battalions.&#10;Time: Each game-turn is 1 day.&#10;Map: 2.5km per hex.&#10;&#10;A complete game of The Killing Ground will include the following:&#10;1 rules booklet&#10;1 Combat Manual&#10;2 map sections (22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; each)&#10;3 different countersheets (900 counters printed front &amp; back)&#10;6 different charts (Combat Results Table, Allied Air Allocation Chart, US Army Support Points chart, British/Canadian Army Support Points chart, Game-Turn Record Track, Scenario Card).&#10;2 six-sided dice&#10;1 game box&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Overlord: D-Day and the Beachhead Battles&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Belote is probably the most played game in France, essentially by adults (youngsters will probably play the &quot;coinche&quot; variant or Tarot during high school).&#10;&#10;It has been known since around 1930 in France, and is played as a family game or as a gambling game (even if the latter has been prohibited in bistros).&#10;A 32-card deck is needed (that means a poker deck without cards 2 &ndash; 6 and without jokers). &#10;Belote is a point-trick taking game for 4 players.&#10;&#10;Players forms teams of 2. Partners sit at opposite seats.&#10;The dealer gives everybody 3 cards face down, then 2.&#10;After that, the first card of the deck is turned face up. Its suit will serve as trumps.&#10;Then, each player announces whether they will take this card or not. If a player takes it, they receive the face-up card. Then the dealer deals 3 cards to everyone except the taker, who receives only two. That makes for 8 cards for everyone.&#10;If no player takes the card, we take another round were each player announces if they take the card, but also announce the suit that will serve as trumps if they do (instead of the suit of the face-up card).&#10;&#10;After that, it is similar to Tarot: First player plays a card, then each player can play a card of the same suit or a trump. If you can't play the led suit, you have to play a trump. If your partner wins the &quot;pli&quot; (trick), you don't have to play a trump.&#10;When 8 &quot;plis&quot; have been played (when no one has cards in their hand), points are counted. The team with the most points win.&#10;&#10;Point values for the cards each partnership has taken in tricks:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Trump suit &#10;&#10;         Point Value&#10;&#10;         Other suits&#10;&#10;         Point Value &#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         J &#10;&#10;         20&#10;&#10;         A&#10;&#10;         11&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         9&#10;&#10;         14&#10;&#10;         10&#10;&#10;         10&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         A&#10;&#10;         11&#10;&#10;         K&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         10&#10;&#10;         10&#10;&#10;         Q&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         K&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;         J&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Q&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;         9&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         8&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;         8&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         7&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;         7&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;     La coinche (belote coinch&eacute;e, belote bridg&eacute;e) in which everyone is dealt all the cards and player bids the number of points they're going to make. The highest bid plays first. This has become the &quot;standard&quot; version in France these days.&#10;     La belote de comptoir is more rapid than belote, and involves heavy alcohol drinking for all players.&#10;     La belote d&eacute;couverte is a variant for 2 players, used essentially to teach the game to a new player.&#10;     Klabberjass (a.k.a. Klobyash) is the 2-player variant played around the world. Jo-Jotte is 2p belote scored on a bridge pad.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Combat losses and heavy straggling have thinned the Army of Northern Virginia to the point where only the best remain in the ranks. The Army of the Potomac is at hand with twice as many troops. While the safest course would be withdraw into Virginia, rest the army and seek battle on another day, Robert E. Lee decides to stand and fight at Sharpsburg.&#10;&#10;On the Union side, George B. McClellan is no longer as confident of victory as he was a few days ago, when the discovery of Lee's marching orders gave Little Mac all the information he needed to defeat the enemy in detail. Now the Army of Northern Virginia is concentrated. While McClellan is sure he faces an enemy that vastly outnumbers him, he must fight and win here to preserve the Union.&#10;&#10;This is the second edition of In their Quiet fields, the very first Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series game. With its intense drama and hard-hitting action, it has long been a favorite of CWB aficionados. Both players face tough decisions: the Confederate player is stretched to the limit by an opposing army twice the size of his own. And while the Union player has tremendous numbers under his control, getting his sluggish commanders into motion poses a challenge.

    "Description": "Part of the publisher's Heirloom Games Series, this is a reproduction of a game first printed in 1962.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;Harry&rsquo;s Grand Slam Baseball Game simulates a real baseball game. The Visiting Team bats in the top half of each of the nine innings and the Home Team, in the bottom half. Runners move around the bases, and runs and innings are recorded on a stand-up scoreboard screen. The game uses a special deck of 54 cards, which represent typical baseball plays. When a manager&rsquo;s team is at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will help score runs. When not at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will result in outs for the other team.&#10;&#10;The designer on his original edition: &quot;The scoring rules are simple and logical, and differ only slightly from the official rules of baseball. The elements of luck and skill are balanced carefully, so as to make each game an interesting and different contest.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game includes rules for the Heirloom edition as well as the original 1962 rules, which contain instructions for playing with 3 or 4 players plus &quot;Slugfest&quot; and &quot;Shutout&quot; variants.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Each player draws a hand of 3 cards, which when played will result in a play result. At the beginning of each half inning, the batting team plays a card for the first batter. The play is then resolved and the player draws a card to bring his hand back to three. The pitching team then plays a card to derive a result for the second batter and draws a card to replace into his hand. Play goes like this until three outs are made.&#10;&#10;There are two different types of special cards in the game. Substitute cards, when drawn, are immediately played face up in front of the player drawing them, along with another card drawn from the deck and placed, unseen, on top of it. A player may use the substitute card as a &quot;pinch hitter&quot; or &quot;relief pitcher&quot; in the game when his hand does not have a useful card (i.e. a hit when he is at bat or an out when he is pitching). The substitute card is then flipped over and played.&#10;&#10;Wild cards are those which only affect base runners and do not resolve an at bat (e.g. wild pitch, passed ball, stolen base, balk). When one of these cards is played, the result is noted, but then play passes back to the opponent, who will play a card to resolve the at bat.&#10;&#10;After every three innings, both players return their hands to the deck, reshuffle the deck, and receive a new hand of three cards. After nine innings, whoever has the most runs is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1829 was the first of the 18xx series. First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.&#10;&#10;This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.&#10;&#10;The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.&#10;&#10;Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.&#10;&#10;In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.&#10;&#10;The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.&#10;&#10;Expanded By:&#10;&#10;    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)&#10;    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    1829 Conversion Kit&#10;    1829 Northern Board&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The shadows arrived on the moon. From that day on, a mass of shadows (called Sheol) similar to a black tide began to form until it shrouded the moon completely and the moon &quot;cried&quot; the shadows down to Earth. Although technologically advanced, people had no means to stop the shadows, which slowly filled the Earth and exterminated almost all of mankind. The planet was fully enveloped in layer of clouds so dark that sunlight could not filter through and the survivors took refuge on the Isle of Light, also called the Citadel, the last outpost of mankind. In fact, Lux, a type of light radiation capable of destroying shadows, was discovered too late.&#10;&#10;Enclosed between the immense walls that surround the many square kilometers in which the intricate levels of the citadel arise, humans have slowly forgotten the external world shrouded in darkness and exhausted themselves in a series of internal political, cultural and economic struggles. In fact, over the decades, the citadel has become a collection of decadent people, mixing nanotechnology with superstition, millenary beliefs with cyber-empowerments, chaos and the emergence of new castes.&#10;&#10;Only the Scouts, explorers of the unknown and raiders of the outside world, have not forgotten that the world belongs to mankind and that mankind shall reclaim it one day. In this game, you are one of them.is set in a not-too-distant future. After the Moon's Weeping, Earth has turned from being the realm of man to a place reigned by shadows. The only bastion of salvation is the Citadel, where the last survivors of humanity found shelter to survive. It is from here that the Scouts head out to explore the desolate lands of Sheol in search of resources.&#10;&#10;Sheol is a cooperative game, playable solo or up to 4 people, with an emphasis on storytelling and strategy. Sheol is set in a coherent universe where game mechanics and setting are deeply interconnected. It is organized in campaigns, in turn, subdivided into missions. In each mission, players will have to coordinate their efforts tactically to complete the objectives and defend the central game area (the Citadel) from the enemy invasion. The story will progress, mission after mission, allowing characters to discover the secrets of the Sheol&rsquo;s world and unlock more items and skills.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Block sets for blue and red players and maps 1 to 4 are included in the base game.&#10;&#10;There are many supplements available, including basic block sets for four additional colors (black, orange, green, and gray), ten-unit elite sets for each color, maps with various terrain, and a logistics expansion which provides a twist on production and adds other strategic elements to the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War &#226;&#128;&#147; Additional Blocksets&#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War &#226;&#128;&#147; Elite Blocksets&#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War &#226;&#128;&#147; Extra Maps&#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War &#226;&#128;&#147; Logistics Set&#10;&#10;&#10;Victory FAQ based on info in the rules forum here and elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Victory: World War II &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition published in 2019.

    "Description": "Trans Europa &amp; Trans Amerika includes two simple railway games in the same box that use the same rules, but are played on different maps, which provide different playing experiences.&#10;&#10;In each game, you start each round of play with a secret set of five cities strung across either Europe or the U.S. (depending on the side of the game board you're using) that need to be connected by rail. On your first turn, you place your starting station somewhere on the game board. On each subsequent turn, you place either one or two rails that connect two points on the board; you can place only one rail if you're crossing a river or a mountain ridge with that rail. All of the rails that you place must touch your starting station or connect with other rails in a network that touches your starting station. Thus, each player builds their own network initially, but as soon as those networks connect, you can place rails anywhere off that connected network&#10;&#10;As soon as a player connects all five of their cities in a network, which could happen on another player's turn, the round ends. Whoever has connected all of their cities scores 4 points; each other player scores 0-3 points depending on how many rails they would need to place to connect all of their cities. You then clear the board, shuffle the cards, and play another round. The first player to score 13 or more points wins! The player who can make the best use of the other players' networks is generally victorious.&#10;&#10;Trans Europa &amp; Trans Amerika includes 19 special cards that can be used to provide more variety in gameplay. At the start of a round, reveal one of the cards; the effect of this card applies to all players during this round, perhaps with everyone discarding their rose card and needing to connect only four cities, or having a mountain pass count as only one rail played, or placing three rails on a turn, or revealing two of their cards so that everyone can see where others are going in particular parts of the map.&#10;&#10;",

(2) A player adds his third card to the pile and correctly repeats all the sounds, ending with &quot;Ouga Bouga!&quot; As a reward, he distributes the cards in the center, as well as any penalty cards previously collected, among all the players.&#10;&#10;After a round ends, every player refills his hand to three cards and another round begins.

But the struggle for the Empire's future takes place not only at the noble courts. In Vienna's slums and alleys swashbucklers, musketeers and thugs wage a secret war on behalf of their powerful superiors.&#10;&#10;Anno Domini 1666 is a tactical adventure miniatures game in which two players pit their bands against each other in order to achieve specific goals defined by a scenario. The game takes place on boards depicting 17th-century Vienna with a grid overlay. Dice rolls are replaced by cards either played from a player's hand, or drawn blindly from a deck. A scenario's objectives may include defeating the opponents in combat, but also stealing a valuable object or breaking out a hostage, among others.&#10;&#10;The theme and characters of the game are based on real-world history, historical novels (such as Three Musketeers) but also feature magic, alchemy, wizards and fantastical creatures. The participating factions are the Poles, the French, the Ottomans and the evil sect Broken Cross. They can get help from the Vienna locals (thugs, urchins, merchants) and famous mercenaries. The process of building a band is fast and streamlined thanks to a draft system.&#10;&#10;Game components will included top quality miniatures (with all unique sculpts), several sheets of counters, custom card decks and multiple maps and scenarios.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s Kickstarter campaign is scheduled for spring 2018.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Following on from Napol&eacute;on 1806 and Napol&eacute;on 1807, Napol&eacute;on 1815 brings its own unique challenges to this well-tried and highly acclaimed campaign system.&#10;&#10;For up to three players, assume the role of Napoleon, Wellington, or Blucher, making the key decisions that will determine the fate of Europe.  As Napoleon, will you adopt your own version of his &ldquo;strategy of the central position,&rdquo; driving a wedge between the enemy armies and then annihilating each of them in turn?  Or perhaps you will choose a different course, or find that change is forced upon you?&#10;&#10;Time is of the essence, for if the armies of Wellington and Blucher do join, the emperor&rsquo;s final throw of the dice is likely to end in defeat.&#10;&#10;Napol&eacute;on 1815 is intended for both the seasoned grognard as well as eager young conscripts with a desire to understand how history is made.  A simple but historically faithful set of rules means that all the key aspects of campaigning in the Napoleonic era are present for players to interact with.  Both subtle bluff and the blunt application of massive force will have their place as events unfold.&#10;&#10;The history books tell us that Waterloo itself was fought on an overcast day, June 18th, that had been preceded by a night of torrential rain.  Denis Sauvage, born on a Waterloo anniversary nearly two hundred years later, has looked back to that other time, a time when armies gathered and the cannon thundered.  This is a game he was destined to create.  Telling a different story is now up to you.&#10;&#10;",

She is an avid reader of Agatha Christie, a world traveller, and more British than 5 o&rsquo;clock tea. Oxford University admitted her after implementing quotas for female students in 1927. She followed in her father&rsquo;s footsteps and graduated with the key to unlocking her dreams: a degree in criminal law. Now Claire Harper investigates, observes, discovers, and thwarts. There&rsquo;s no mystery that is too twisted for her brilliant mind, no case that&rsquo;s too hard for her to crack. Claire Harper isn&rsquo;t just a detective. She&rsquo;s the very best.&#10;&#10;In each chapter of Suspects, you will read Clue cards to progress through the plot like a book, discuss and reason amongst yourselves, and form hypotheses. Your goal is to score the most points when you answer the questions about the case. The &quot;faster&quot; you answer (i.e. having drawn and read as few Clue cards as possible), the more points you will score.&#10;&#10;",

Now it's your chance to catch this criminal before it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;As a master agent of the elite global task force, The Rigel Group, you expertly hunt down cunning spies and deadly double agents.

This isn't just any spy; one false move could end your mission... permanently.&#10;&#10;Harsh Shadows is a solitaire game of espionage. To set up, place nine location cards in a 3x3 grid, then place discovery cards under each location. Place three file cards near the locations, then place case cards under each file. Place decks for arrow cards and additional discovery cards nearby, along with two agent tool cards. The spy and agent cards start in different locations.&#10;&#10;You are the agent and go first, moving to an adjacent location and revealing a discovery card, which could be an item, clue, or bomb; item and clue cards go in hand, while bombs force you to discard. You can use a location's special ability and clues to reveal case cards under files. You might be able to place a tracking bug on the spy.&#10;&#10;For the spy's turn, the arrow cards move the spy to an adjacent location, where a new discovery card is placed at random. If the spy moves to your location, discard a card. If you can't discard a card or discover you've discarded an item matching a case card, you lose immediately.&#10;&#10;When the discovery deck is empty, the spy attempts to escape. You must have placed a tracking bug on the spy, have the three item cards in hand matching the case cards, and make it to the spy's current location before the spy escapes.&#10;&#10;",

Curtis. This battle decided the fate of the trans-Mississippi region. Historically, the Union prevailed and Missouri was denied to the Confederates.&#10;&#10;The game covers the two days of the battle, and creates rules for reorganization during the night. Rebels start the game with the initiative as Union brigades race to meet and slow the massive CSA advance, allowing later Union troopers to move into defensive positions.&#10;&#10;Initiative passes to the Yankees on the second day, if the Rebels don't win outright on the first day. Victory is determined by killing units and capturing geographical objectives.&#10;&#10;Each Game-Turn represents 30 minutes of real time, and each hex covers about 125 yards from hexside to hexside. Each Strength Point is the equivalent of 100 men or 1 gun. The system created a set of standard rules for all the GBACW games, and then added exclusive rules specific to that battle. 200 counters.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, place all the cups face down on the table, shuffle them, then group them together. On a turn, a player can capture a stack that's adjacent to one of his own stacks as long as his stack is the same height as or taller than the adjacent stack. As long as a player's color stays on top of the stack, he controls that stack. If one or more stacks are isolated from the main group and all of these stacks are controlled by the same player, he can take possession of them, removing them from the game. When all the cups have been captured, players stack all of the cups they captured and whoever has the highest stack wins.&#10;&#10;",

Like traditional werewolf games, Ultimate Werewolf Extreme has all sorts of roles and a moderator to run the game, but Extreme reworks this in several ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A free, moderator assisting app that helps create and execute games with ease - automatically scanning each player's face and role using micro QR code technology&#10;    An abundance of information on each card: role name, role description, role art, team, traditional balance value, info value, moderator difficulty, wake order, wake frequency, game length impact, and special considerations.&#10;     A new role-balancing system based on information vs. the number of werewolves in any size game.&#10;     Optional rules to increase difficulty, such as invisible Lycans, alternate nominees, celebrations after werewolf elimination that reduce village abilities, and elected judges that determine whether a nominated player is eliminated or not.&#10;     Enough cards in the base game to play three simultaneous games of Ultimate Werewolf Extreme.&#10;&#10;&#10;Most importantly, the game is integrated with a new app that makes moderating easier than ever before. No more writing down all of the roles and who is assigned to them, or trying to remember some of the complex interactions that happen when using multiple special abilities. The app has two major parts: A deck configuration tool, and a game moderator assistant. The deck configuration tool creates a deck based on user-set parameters, such as number of players, moderator difficulty, info value, or traditional role balance.&#10;&#10;The game moderator assistant automatically scans cards, player names, and player faces, placing them into the app and using that information to run the game. While a moderator is still required to run the game and monitor the app, much of the critical bookkeeping, such as tracking the players who are still in the game, which actions should happen in what order at night, and timing each of the games all happen automatically. This app is not needed to play, but it will make moderating a breeze with a timer, turn order, and loads of special features!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Without knowledge of their opponent's fleet position, they move their ships, conduct aerial reconnaissance (calling out hexes and waiting for their opponent's response, as in Battleship), and designate areas for air strikes.  The strikes are revealed and resolved before proceeding with other naval engagements (ship-to-ship combat, bombardment and invasion of land targets).  Battles are resolved by comparing a die roll to the unit's strength for successful hits instead of referring to charts.&#10;&#10;The game ends in 25 turns or if one side has been totally eliminated.  If both sides remain till the end, the victor is the player with the most Victory Points, which are awarded for enemy losses or control of Midway atoll.&#10;&#10;",

Young boys worked as a couriers delivering letters and orders between squads of rebels, running through the underground sewage canals of Warsaw. Many of them died on that duty.&#10;&#10;In &ldquo;Little Insurgents&rdquo; each player takes command of a unit of three Scouts with the goal of delivering the most orders on time. The scouts from different units are racing against each other to be first, but they also have to co-operate. If the order is not delivered on time crucial parts of the city, or even whole districts can be lost to the occupiers. If too many orders fall into hands of the enemy all players lose.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two variants of rules: basic and extended, with basic being easier and involving more random elements. It is suitable for young players and families. The extended variant, dedicated to adults and gamers, involves special actions, more planning and secret goals.&#10;&#10;The game will be published by Egmont Polska in the autumn of 2009 with rules in three languages: Polish, English and German.&#10;&#10;The game was developed in cooperation with Polish Scout Association (ZHP) and the Warsaw Rising Museum.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rebel Raiders on the High Seas is a comparatively short and simple game of the naval conflict at sea and on the great rivers in the American Civil War. Easily playable in less than three hours, Rebel Raiders on the High Seas is a strategic contest between two players, one seeking to reunite the Union by force, the other to maintain its new independence in the face of the escalating industrial might and resolve of its northern brother. More of a representation than a detailed simulation of that conflict, the game is intensely engaging, highly interactive and moves along quickly, with players constantly responding and reacting to their opponent&rsquo;s moves.&#10;&#10;Although Rebel Raiders on the High Seas is not a card-driven game, the cards ensure that each game is very different, and that a strategy which worked in one game may not prove as efficacious in the next. The game is also customizable with a menu of elective rules to provide each side with a variety of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; options to further vary play.&#10; Components&#10;&#10;*   One 22 x 28 map&#10;    *   One Rule Book&#10;    *   One Play Book&#10;    *   One Players Aid Card&#10;    *   Eight six-sided dice&#10;    *   Two decks of 55 cards each (one Union, one Confederate)&#10;    *   6 Plastic Stands for Leaders&#10;    *   176 5/8&rdquo; ship counters&#10;    *   various round, hexagonal, rectangular cargo, victory point, leader, control and informational counters&#10;    *   30 small red opaque plastic tokens (to mark pieces which have moved)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In May of 1813, Napoleon began the campaign for Germany with a bang - as was his custom. The Prussian and Russian armies attempt to ambush the French main army strung out in road march. Their approach goes undetected and they are able to close within two miles. In fact, not until the moment of their assault do the French become aware of them. But, instead of the expected weak flank guard, they are met by the strong divisions of Souham and Girard and by mid-afternoon, Napoleon and 100,000 French and their allies have swarmed to their support. The battle raged in ever-mounting fury until night finally brought an end to the slaughter. The first major battle of the 1813 campaign ends with thousands of dead and wounded and with the Russian and Prussian armies in full retreat.&#10;&#10;La Bataille de Lutzen simulates the first major clash of Napoleons 1813 campaign. Lacking adequate cavalry and handicapped by a large number of raw recruits, the French player must rapidly consolidate his scattered forces to counter the sudden Allied attack. As the player commanding the Allied forces, you must deal the French a decisive blow before Napoleon can react and bring reinforcements to bear.&#10;&#10;Lutzen is ideal for multiple players or solitaire study. Each turn represents 20 minutes of real time, and each hex equals 100 meters. The rules are the Lutzen version of the award winning system developed by the Marshall Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic battlefield. Players are faced with the same tactical dilemmas their historical counterparts faced, though play balance depends upon their own skill.&#10;&#10;Content:&#10;Rulebook including historical commentary &#10;1,000 plus die-cut counters &#10;Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; game maps &#10;Organizational displays, Charts &amp; Tables&#10;&#10;scale = 100 m/hex; &#10;time = 20 min/GT; &#10;strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)&#10;&#10;",
