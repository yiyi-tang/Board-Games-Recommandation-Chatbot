    "Description": "Crosshairs is a combinatorial game with a WW1 aerial combat theme. Players each have a squadron of planes and move all of their planes each turn. Movement consists of either &#10;a) a straight pass flight (no altitude change)&#10;b) a climb (increasing the height of the piece by adding an additional ring) or &#10;c) a dive (losing height to make a sequence of moves by removing one ring per descent height). &#10;Pieces are captured when they are in the line of fire of two or more enemy planes. Clouds block line of fire and provide strategic cover during play.&#10;&#10;If a player is reduced to having only one plane, he's shot from the sky (i.e., is eliminated from the game). A player wins when he reduces the only remaining opponent to only one plane. Games are brutal, fast, and fun.&#10;&#10;The base game includes components for a 2-player game. If you wish to add more players you'll need the expansion (one per additional player).&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS (NESTORGAMES edition)&#10;&#10;Base game (2 players): Board (2 pads), 16 foam clouds, 40 altitude rings (laser cut 8mm 'ice' acrylic), 2 small plastic boxes, 5 red biplanes, 5 green biplanes, carrying case.&#10;&#10;Expansion (per extra player): 5 biplanes (orange or yellow), 20 altitude counters, carrying case. Please indicate colour if you purchase one set only. You can see the biplanes in the pictures below.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Orange Swan is a strategic game that recreates the war in the Pacific. Orange Swan may be combined with Black Swan and Orange Swan: Dai T&#197;&#141;-A Sens&#197;&#141; or both!&#10;&#10;The Call of The Orange Swan&#10;&#10;Japan, on the eve of its entry into World War Two, is looking in two different directions. It sees opportunity and it fears defeat. It clamours for modernity and yet it will not, cannot, forsake a history of staid traditions and the rituals of self-slaughter.&#10;&#10;Admiral Yamamoto, at the head of a powerful navy, is being driven towards a decision that is not of his making. Those who truly desire war will relinquish neither their swords nor the ethos with which they are imbued, and so even while the likes of Hideki Tojo make their case for the fulfilment of destiny, for the acquisition of empire and the control of an abundance of natural resources, Yamamoto is painfully aware that their contempt for any and all likely enemies, their belief in the cult of the warrior, their very dreams of battle and conquest, belong to an age that is already dead.&#10;&#10;Yamamoto sees only one chance &ndash; Japan must strike quickly and with overwhelming and decisive force. If the enemy, first and foremost the United States, is given any pause, any form of reprieve, Japan will almost certainly be crushed.&#10;&#10;Chance and mischance play out their themes at Pearl Harbor. Japan wins and loses all in the same instant. The US carriers are not there, and while Japan will conquer for a while, bringing much of the Pacific and SE Asia under its control, it cannot hold what it has gained. The oft-repeated commands to fight to the death are each an admission that they have already lost. It is only a matter of time&hellip;and of blood.&#10;&#10;The culmination is at Hiroshima. What good swords at such a time, against such a vast and blinding and terrible fire? Those who hungered for war have no answer. They have never had an answer. Science and industry do not sit well with emperor worship or with archaic notions of sacrifice.&#10;&#10;Could it have been different? Chance and mischance are the ultimate reality of every course that every war has ever followed. Orange Swan is your means to experience this.&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a block wargame covering WWII in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945.&#10;&#10;As in all other block games, both the Fog of War and Unit strength reduction/increase by rotation, drive the gameplay in ORANGE SWAN, as a player cannot know the identity or the strength of an enemy block until it is revealed in combat.&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a historical game with some fixed starting points, but the outcome is completely unpredictable and, despite the historical result, the Axis Side (Japan) can defeat the Allied Side (China, Commonwealth and US).&#10;&#10;During any Victory Check (two per each Season, one at the end of the Axis Turn and one at the end of the Allied Turn), the game immediately ends with a Total Victory if either the following conditions are met:&#10;&#10;a.    Tokyo is enemy Controlled;&#10;b.    Atomic Bomb Event;&#10;c.    Japan controls 7 Strategic Land Areas or Japan has a Production of 75.&#10;&#10;Additionally, a special Victory Check is made at the end of the each year of the Campaign game, or at the end of a Scenario.&#10;&#10;Game Introduction&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a historical game that covers WWII in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945. Its name reflects that of its older sibling Black Swan, a game that covers WWII&rsquo;s European Theatre, but also that of the United States&rsquo; plan for fighting Japan, developed long before Pearl Harbor, called War Plan Orange.&#10;&#10;Orange Swan uses many of the same game mechanics as Black Swan but with greater focus on the innovative, and mechanically simple, naval systems that were universally praised.&#10;&#10;One revision that entirely changes the feel of the game is the addition of the Seaborne Blitz phase. Similar to Black Swan&rsquo;s land based Blitz double turns that made the Eastern Front so dynamic, Orange Swan translates that idea to a double naval turn. The results are highly satisfying from both a gameplay and historical perspective.&#10;&#10;Similar to other block games, Fog of War is a core element in ORANGE SWAN, as a player cannot know the identity or the strength of an enemy unit until it is revealed in combat.&#10;&#10;While Orange Swan&rsquo;s campaigns and scenarios feature historical starting points, the outcome is completely unpredictable and, despite the historical result, the Axis Side (Japan) can defeat the Allied Side (the United States, the Commonwealth, and China).&#10;&#10;The Allied Side can cooperate, so they can stack together, or trace supply accross either a Sea Zone or a Land Area Controlled by an Allied Nation. (Note: Chinese Communists stack only with themselves).&#10;&#10;Japan, the United States (US), the Commonwealth (CW), and China are Major Nations. The Philippines and Dutch East Indies (DEI) are Minor Nations controlled by the US and CW respectively.&#10;&#10;No Side can enter Land Areas belonging to the Soviet Union or any of the Absolute Neutrals, identified with a white border: Nepal and Butan.&#10;&#10;Each Major Nation has its own units (in a specific color), Force Pool, Economic and Strategic Power.&#10;&#10;The Force Pool of a Nation is made up of all units of that Nation that are not deployed on the mapboard and are available to be built (that is, purchased during the Production Phase).  Note that some units have a colored circled number (2, 3, or 4) in one corner, indicating the year when the unit is added to the respective Force Pool. Thus, in 1943 it is not possible to build a Unit marked with a circled &ldquo;4&quot;, as it will be added to the proper Nation's Force Pool in Winter 1944. Elite Units are designated with a darker color background.&#10;&#10;Nations of the same Side maintain their own Supply Source (their National Capital) but they can trace Supply using any of their Side&rsquo;s Naval Units, Controlled Land Areas, or Controlled Sea Zones. They can freely enter any Land Area of, and be transported by, the Naval Units of their Side. They can stack, move, and attack together, but each Nation keeps its own Force Pool, Economic and Strategic Power.&#10;&#10;China has two kinds of forces: Nationalists and Communists. Both Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists are always supplied and therefore do not need to trace any supply.&#10;&#10;Chinese Communist Units can only stack with other Chinese Communists. They can, obviously, attack any Axis Side Units. Chinese Nationalists can stack (and move/attack) freely with units of the Allied Side.&#10;&#10;All Chinese units are restricted to Continental Asia and Hainan and can never be Sea Transported.&#10;&#10;National Capitals: Nations have the following Capitals, which also act as Supply Sources:&#10;&#10;1.       Japan: Tokyo&#10;2.       US: San Diego&#10;3.       CW: New Delhi and Sidney&#10;4.       Philippines: Manila&#10;5.       Dutch East Indies: Batavia&#10;&#10;Nation&rsquo;s have their own blocks of the following color:&#10;&#10;1.       Japan: orange&#10;2.       US: green&#10;3.       CW: blue&#10;4.       China: purple&#10;5.       Philippines: light green&#10;6.       Dutch East Indies (DEI): light blue&#10;&#10;Minor Nations do not have their own Economic or Strategic Power, nor a dedicated Force Pool. They are controlled by the Major Power they are allied to, which treats them as if they were CW (for the DEI) or US (for the Philippines) units for all game effects. When destroyed, Minor Nations units are eliminated from the game, so they will never go into any Force Pool.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The Battle of Grunwald (15 July 1410) was one of the biggest, and most decisive, engagements of the middle ages. The myth of Teutonic invulnerability - already wobbly after the Battle on the Ice - was shattered by the combined might of Poland, Lithuania, and their allies. Though both sides fielded some infantry, and the Teutonic Order some cannon, cavalry predominated. The sudden withdrawal of the Lithuanian forces left the Poles vulnerable, and their dramatic re-entry onto the battlefield may have been decisive in turning the tide against the Germans. Poland is still immensely proud of their victory over six hundred years later, and the Germans were still feeling sore about it into the twentieth century.&#10;&#10;This first title in the revamped SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series lets two players refight this dynamic and exciting battle. With lots of horsies on both sides, it's a tense contest of maneuver and tempo. The Teutonic Player must protect his camp at all costs, and use every opportunity to slow the enemy's headlong advance. But blocking him here can open a hole over there - knowing where and when to leave a hole is key. His opponent must decide when to remove the Lithuanians from the battlefield, and when to bring them back on - there's a right time and wrong time for both, but in each case it's heavily contextual and dependent on the current game state, on his own strategy, and on his opponent's. The result is an unusually replayable medieval battle game that you, your friends, and your family can revisit again and again.&#10;&#10;The SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series builds on, and improves, the Shields &amp; Swords series of games (We Happy Few, Stamford Bridge, A Hill Near Hastings, and Our Royal Bones), with a greater variety of unit types, revised suppression rules, and a new D8-based CRT.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Copperdale is a print-and-play, half-sheet, flip-and-write game. In this solo game, you use the game board, a pencil, and a standard deck of playing cards to manage and advance the town and inhabitants of Copperdale. After twelve months (turns), you earn medals for the improvements you've made.&#10;&#10;Each month, one card at a time, you reveal and assign three cards from the top of the deck to the 1-ECONOMY, 2-INFRASTRUCTURE, and 3-GROWTH segments of the board, in any order you choose. Then, in the above order, you resolve those cards, filling in spaces based on the cards you assigned to each segment.&#10;&#10;Each card's suit and value matters, and depending on where you assign it, you fill in spaces on the board. Each space you fill hopefully leads to more medals at the end of the game. From learning occupations to expanding the city's borders, everything you do has the potential to unlock medals! However, with the design having slight rogue-like elements and a bit of press your luck, there's no guarantee you'll ever get the card you want &mdash; or that the next card you reveal will be better than the last.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970's&quot; is a simulation on a brigade/division level of a possible attempt by the Warsaw Pact forces to &quot;liberate&quot; Western Europe from the NATO alliance sometime in the 1970's. It postulates that this War in West Germany could occur without a massive strategic nuclear holocaust. Essentially, the game progresses from &quot;M,&quot; the day' the Warsaw Feet decides to launch an offensive, to day &quot;M + 50,&quot; when a decision of some type (even a stalemated war) is assumed to have been reached. The game may be played starting with &quot;M + 1,&quot; with the forces as they actually are in peacetime, or at &quot;M + 31,&quot; after both sides have reached planned strength.&#10;The increment of forces, as NATO transfers its scattered strength and Warsaw Pact sends forth additional member and Russian garrison divisions, is fully charted between the 'two game-versions. NATO depicts the essential elements of modern warfare (even Future warfare) with unusual elements such as Air-transportable units, Airmobile units and the newly proposed US Army Tricap (triple capability) divisions.&#10;&#10;Two basic scenarios (4 if nukes are used in two of them) and three variants (Warsaw Pact Unreliability, NATO Neutrality and Chinese Intervention).&#10;&#10;The map portrays Europe from East Germany to France and from Denmark to Switzerland.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 kilometers&#10;Units: Brigade to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; four color map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 10-page rulebook&#10;One player aid fold-out sheet&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

Voil&agrave;! is a fast-paced dexterity and push-your-luck type of game that will challenge your agility and finger swiftness.&#10;&#10;In Voil&agrave;! each player tries to get as many points as possible by completing various dexterity tasks. In a turn the player pulls out a token from the bag, which defines how many tasks the player has to complete (either none, one or two). However, for a turn player has limited amount of time, which is kept hidden from him by another player.&#10;&#10;After pulling out a token the player draws the corresponding amount of cards and tries to complete the tasks depicted of them. There are many different tasks, for example, throwing the token in the air and catching it, or creating a tower from acrobats and so on. After player has completed the task(s) he can either end the turn and thus get the points, or try to get more points by pulling out a new token and then completing the tasks. However, if the player chooses to continue, he must complete the task before he can end the turn and this is the risk - if the time runs out while he is still performing the task, the turn ends immediately and the player doesn't receive any points this turn (any cards the player completed during this turn are put in the discard pile).&#10;&#10;The game ends after each player has had three turns and the winner is the one with most total points on his cards.&#10;&#10;",

Handy label cards help keep the memory aspect to a bare minimum, but still allow for backstabbing or cooperation.&#10;&#10;You gain a starvation condition for almost every action and can also gain other conditions during gameplay. At the end of your turn must draw and apply a random card from your hand of conditions. This card is applied as damage if it is a bad condition.

Should the tile indicate an animal encounter, draw an animal card and place the corresponding animal token on the tile; if the tile indicates a forest fire or illegal logging, then forests might be destroyed.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ranger Actions: There are five ranger actions that a player can choose from. The main action is to plant forests. Discard the required number of resource card and place the forest meeple on a tile. Planting trees give you victory points and upgrades your ranger skills. Other actions includes rescuing an animal, putting out a fire, swapping resource cards, and sending out rangers to protect your forest.&#10;&#10;&#10;Besides planting trees, players gain points when placing the wildlife in their proper habitats; also, putting out fire will produce victory points. The game ends once a player has planted all the forest meeple on their character boards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you draw a card, place a piece of junk into play from your hand, and then activate one of the abilities on your junk or use your character's ability.&#10;&#10;All junk is worth something. In the Junkpile, there is one card that is the most coveted of items called The Crown. Once a player draws that card, the game is over and everyone adds up the points displayed on the pieces of junk they have found or hoarded. The player with the most points wins the current round. The game only takes about 15 minutes to play, and is designed for multiple rounds of play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Is it possible to escape by boat when a shipwreck occurs? The difference between sinking, swimming, and safely making it to an island may be just a vote away!&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Lifeboats: Plank of Carneades is all about voting, which takes the form of both co-operation and betrayal over the course of play as circumstances change and you find your sailors on the brink of death. During a vote, each player chooses a card from their hand, then everyone reveals their choices at the same time. You have one card of each boat color &mdash; which also correspond to the player colors &mdash; as well as three captain cards. If you're the only person to play a captain card during a vote, you get to decide the result...but if more than one captain card is played, they're ignored. In either case, each captain card can be played only once.&#10;&#10;To set up, take turns placing your officers and sailors in empty spaces on several lifeboats, each of which is heading toward a particular island. The game then proceeds in multiple rounds, with the lead player position rotating each round. Whenever a vote is tied, the lead player breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;First, players vote on which ship springs a leak. Whichever color boat receives the most votes has an empty space filled with a water token &mdash; and if the boat has no empty spaces, the players on this boat vote to determine which occupant will be thrown overboard to the sharks to keep the boat from sinking. In this type of vote, officers are worth two votes, sailors only one. However, if a ship has more leaks than occupants, it sinks and everyone on board turns into shark chum.&#10;&#10;Second, players vote on which ship moves forward one space toward its island. If the ship reaches the island, all of its occupants are safe and will score their player points based on which island was reached.&#10;&#10;Third, players scramble to find better chances for survival. Starting with the lead player, each player removes one of their officers or sailors from their respective boat, placing its token behind the boat. Only one occupant can jump from each ship, so a player late in the round might not have to put someone in the water. Then in reverse order, players move their token to an empty space on a different ship...and if the swimmer can't do this because all seat are full, glub glub glub.&#10;&#10;Keep playing until all officers and sailors are either safe or dead, then determine who saved the most valuable crew.&#10;&#10;Lifeboats: Plank of Carneades differs from Lifeboats in that it allows for up to seven players to fight for seats on ships. In addition, in some circumstances the ships will move faster and more ships will spring a leak, making gameplay move faster. Finally, the captain card is more powerful as players can use it to keep any ship from springing a leak in a round.&#10;&#10;",

Dubbed &ldquo;Case Yellow&rdquo; (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.&#10;&#10;In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.&#10;&#10;Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, &ldquo;Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940?&rdquo; His research yields a resounding, &ldquo;Yes!,&rdquo; and the simulation elements of &#3;No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 3 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is one army: The German forces or the Allied forces (French, British, and Neutrals) Each hex is about 30 kilometers from side to side.

Players are tasked with conservation efforts to repopulate coral as well as redevelop islands to make them conducive to animal life.&#10;&#10;&quot;Coral,&quot; designed by Richard Maass, sees players repopulate a shared coral reef using colourful translucent dice. Players take turns stacking dice on the board aiming to score points by completing structure cards that involve both their own dice and opponents' dice. In addition, players earn tokens representing the fish that live in the reef, which allow them to manipulate their dice or even place two dice on the same turn, generating engaging tactical and strategic tradeoffs between pursuing low-scoring easy-to-complete structure or high-scoring complex structures more likely to get blocked by an opponent, and also between earning points now or focusing on fish tokens to gain flexibility later. Sparking players to think in 3 dimensions, Coral creates a gameplay experience that feels fresh and unique. The player who earns the most points by completing structures before placing all 16 of their dice (12 in a 4-player game) is the winner!&#10;&#10;&quot;Islands,&quot; designed by Rohan Dargad, asks players to move around archipelago islands from sea-level heights to mountainous terrain in a concerted effort to reclaim lost land caused by rising sea levels. Players thus take the roles of conservation charities. The different coloured dice represent different geology of the islands. Each round 3 land cards are dealt which gives the active player the opportunity to move around an archipelago segment. These are overseen by conservation specialists which are asymmetric rule changes when a stack of cards is taken. Players then take and keep one of the cards from the stack to indicate their geological specialism - and move one of the dice on the archipelago a number of times based on the height of the stack of cards. Dice are continually moved around in this way , until the end of the game where players with the highest specialisms claim the most mountainous lands to score prestige points. The player with the highest prestige wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You start each round by drafting your tiles from the sets available in the common pool, then you place your routes in front of you, trying to make as many connections as possible; be careful not to lock yourself in with choices that are too constraining. Each round, you can also place cars, trains, or travelers to populate the tiny little landscape you're creating...as long as you have free space on your tiles. The available actions change from round to round, so you need to prepare in advance!&#10;&#10;The more pieces of the same kind each new placement connects to, the more points you earn. You can also score bonus points at game's end for placing tiles in a large rectangle without gaps and for creating sets of three adjacent city tiles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is known as &quot;The Treasure of Moon Gold&quot;, and a single piece of it would be worth millions. Your role will be to lead the search for the legendary treasure that was thought to be only a legend until a Professor found proof of its existence and a way to find it.&#10;&#10;But you're not the only one who wants to get your hands on the treasure.

The Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter, and the Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-player competitive play or solitaire play, and each set can be played by itself standalone, or combined with other sets to form a larger narrative. Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six Factions.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play For What Remains: skirmishes and campaigns. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Campaigns are a series of skirmishes linked together to form a larger narrative. For What Remains is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually secondary. Players win skirmishes by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.&#10;&#10;The game board is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. The default game board is a destroyed urban setting. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement.&#10;&#10;Each character is represented by a counter and has a corresponding character card and tokens. During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite level. A chit pull system is used for unit activation, and a step-loss system is used for tracking injuries during skirmishes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In each turn, you get a number of island cards and a few blanks, and you place them face-down in the different slots at the strip, either above or below. The blank cards are used so you don't give away which slots you are using. When all players are done, everyone reveals the first card and compares the first value (size), and the player with the highest number wins. In the second slot, the smallest size wins, etc.&#10;After each trick, the winning player sorts cards they won by ocean. At the end of the game, whoever has most cards for a given ocean scores for that ocean, ohter players discard their cards for that ocean. The player who has most cards afterwards, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Baldrick's Tomb is a roguelike board game for 2-4 players. The game takes place in a four-story, underground tomb that is constantly being churned from the inside out by the late sorcerer Baldrick. The locations of everything &ndash; including treasures, traps, monsters, and even the exits &ndash; are completely randomized for every game as a result of Baldrick smashing the crypt to bits. The players are tasked with making their way down to the bottom of this tomb, collecting a precious treasure, then climbing back out.&#10;&#10;But this is really only a means to an end. The real reason for a group of treasure hunters to explore a dangerous tomb is so that they can (hopefully) acquire heaps of treasure. Players will use their wit, push their luck, and call upon powerful scrolls to help themselves and hinder others, all in the pursuit of treasure points. The player who makes it out of the tomb with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Douro Valley is dressed in black and the big companies do not have enough production for such an order.

Due to time dilation and other pseudo-scientific malarkey, the lower you travel in the 'verses, the greater number of actions you have each round &mdash; but some of those lower 'verses are a bit primitive, so the contraptions you build to use all that sweet power on might not work that well!&#10;&#10;During your turn, you spend your actions to build power supplies and contraptions, and you possibly move to a new 'verse to take advantage of some excess power there. At the end of each round, the power generates from the bottom 'verse up, and players can use that power as it travels from 'verse to 'verse to play one-shot abilities, use character abilities, and power-up their contraptions. Player order matters in each 'verse, so hopefully your opponents left you some power to use!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The only ones able to defend the sensory worlds are Gamedecs: hardboiled private detectives specializing in the mysteries of the virtual worlds. Become one of them and investigate cases in sensory worlds, gather clues and equipment, conduct corporate investigations and cross them or cooperate with them. Watch out though - your reputation is your ticket to better jobs.

Players try to solve cases connected to the global hacker attacks. Each player choose one from 10 available game-detectives and, during the course of the game, upgrade his/her character by collecting equipment cards, acquiring skills (which helps solving cases) and improving reputation (which provides more case-cards). The game ends either when one of the characters collects enough clues to stop the hackers, or when the Net is too damaged and need to be shut down (all players lose).&#10;&#10;",

To achieve your goal you must overcome a sinister adversity. As you travel from location to location, you have to face strong orcs, clever goblins, bloodthirsty wolves, ice giants, all migthy gods, cowardly wizards, greedy merchants, bad people, good people ... can they stop you from reaching your goal?&#10;&#10;Storm Weavers is a story driven game for one person. The player reads the situation in the book and chooses his action, which leads him to another section of the story. You roam the world drawing the map and exploring various locations. Sometimes your way will be bloodthirsty enemies. Then a confrontation begins, which is a tactical part of the game and is carried out on the board, with the participation of battle maps, minis, and dice.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics is based on 2 six side dice. Facing difficult situation you will be asked to roll against one of your attributes. The result leads you to appropriate text section, but don't worry - the story gives you a lot of possibilities to increase your stats.&#10;&#10;The combat is most often resolved on the one of nine battle maps. First Thymin moves and attacks. Then each of the enemies moves and attacks.  The greater the difference between the attributes of the attacker and the defender, the greater the chance of hitting and the amount of damage. You can also use special combat actions, weapons, items or take advantage of the terrain.&#10;&#10;Exploring the world you consistently develop your character, which helps you to win the battles, resolve quests and finally reach your goal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #29.&#10;&#10;USN deals with the air, land and sea warfare in the Pacific between 1941 and 1943. Each hex represents over 200 miles. Each turn represents a week's operations. Land unit counters represent divisions or regiments. Air units represent multiples of 10 planes. Virtually the entire Pacific is shown, from east of Hawaii to west of Java. Across this wide expanse, naval units (individual aircraft carriers, groups of everything else) fight in one of the most complex campaigns in history. The air, land and naval forces all operated under different conditions. There are five different Combat Results tables used to accomodate everything from torpedo attacks to bayonet charges. The CRT's represent abstract battle actions. There are three &quot;campaign&quot; games plus three shorter &quot;mini&quot; scenarios.&#10;&#10;Game Equipment: one 22 x 28&quot; map, 400 1/2&quot; counters, rulesheet (folding &quot;roadmap&quot; variety), games charts &amp; tables.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     USN Deluxe&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You were on your way back to earth after a year-long mission when a distress beacon abruptly roused you from hypersleep. The message was mostly static, but it was obvious that something terrible was happening at Mining Colony 415.&#10;&#10;Once you and your crew landed and started looking around, unidentified lifeforms started wreaking havoc. During the chaos, everyone got split up and you don&rsquo;t know if anyone is alive or dead. Even Sprinkles, the ship&rsquo;s cat, is missing.&#10;&#10;You just heard over the colony&rsquo;s announcement system that the self-destruct protocol has been activated, so you&rsquo;ll have to race back to Landing Pad 7 to get aboard your ship and get out of there before everything explodes&hellip; and you&rsquo;ll have to do it while being hunted by the aliens.&#10;&#10;Hunted: Mining Colony 415 is a fast-paced solo game that constantly presents you with tense choices. All the cards are multi-use forcing you to make quick decisions about which ones to discard and which ones to activate. You'll have to balance running, fighting, and hiding if you want to get off the planet alive.&#10;&#10;This game in the Hunted series uses a dexterity mechanic to resolve events and combat.&#10;&#10;The second edition features updated systems for events and taking damage, and it has a non-dexterity option for resolving combat and tests. It also comes in a VHS case!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each other player is dealt a word card with one concept or item to represent. To do so, they can use only the four rubber stamps to draw red circles, blue squares, green triangles, and yellow rectangles, but the number of &quot;stamp strokes&quot; per drawing is limited and gets smaller the longer the game goes on, from five stamps for the first round to&nbsp;only one for the final one!&#10;&#10;The players who draw may use the same stamp multiple times, stamp over a part of another shape, and stamp partially or completely out of the frame, but they cannot use the stamp as a pen to stretch a shape, use another color for a shape, or spell letters. When everyone has finished their drawing, all words and drawings are revealed, then the Captain must find out which word card goes with which drawing.&#10;&#10;If the cumulated mistakes made by the Captains exceeds the number of players, the game is immediately lost &mdash; but if they can complete five rounds without losing, they win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The path connecting the two sides of the board must be continuous along the surfaces of the same colour; however, the path can travel along the exposed top or any exposed side of a tile. This means that blocking your opponent is harder than you think!&#10;&#10;Flink is somehow reminiscent of Stefan K&ouml;gl&rsquo;s Caminos (2010), which in turn resembles Cameron Browne&rsquo;s Druid (2004), on which Flink was inspired. Flink distils the mechanism to use a single piece shape, and introduces the innovation of the connecting path being traced like an insect walking along the tops and sides of the pieces to get to the other side. Of course, all of these games (and numerous others) owe their existence to the original connection game: Hex (AKA CON-TAC-TIX, Piet Hein, 1942).&#10;&#10;",

The game includes several game modes, such as Story Campaign and Exploration.&#10;&#10;Working together as one group, the players adventure inside Castle von Loghan where they will face an array of dangers but also will find several valuable treasures.&#10;&#10;During each turn, players have to decide where to go next, solve the secrets of the room in which they have arrived, battle the enemies protecting it, then prepare for the next encounter.&#10;&#10;The only route to winning the game is through survival &mdash; and to survive, they need to work together.&#10;&#10;Notable mechanisms: Sharing of health and clarity, unique narrative events that require careful listening and decision making, a ten-game-long Story Campaign that is filled with the best RPG elements one could expect, easy-to-understand card-based tactical combat that comes with a variety of outcomes.&#10;&#10;Intro to the story:&#10;&#10;In 1970, inside the Albatross Scientific Institute (LOS ANGELES), a group of scientists make contact with a group of hyper-intelligent beings known as the CeDI (Celestial entities from the Downing Ipsys) who claim that humankind is doomed. They have brought with them some of their advanced technology, instructing the humans to make use of it in order to evacuate the Earth which, according to the aliens, will become uninhabitable in approximately 100 years. Aided by the scientists at the Institute, the aliens unlock G.O.D.O.S., an AI they have brought with them from their galaxy. They claim G.O.D.O.S. will help all of humanity... but the aliens seem to have a personal mission linked to G.O.D.O.S. as well; one which they haven&rsquo;t revealed to anyone else. On the 27th of August, G.O.D.O.S. is activated.&#10;&#10;A council is formed and, with the help of the aliens, they begin work on Project KARR. The goal is to build at least five ships that are not only capable of carrying about 1 billion people each, but can keep them alive for hundreds of years. The KARR also serve as colonization units. The news of the aliens and of Project KARR is shared, bit by bit, with the humans, and by 2067, the ships are ready to launch.&#10;&#10;In 2068, the ships leave earth, leaving behind all those who refuse to go.&#10;&#10;Each ship heads towards a different point in space in the hopes of finding a suitable planet to serve as a new home. They cannot go to the aliens&rsquo; solar system, since humans can not survive such a long journey or the interstellar travel required to get there. After several years in transit, the KARR-5 ship collides with a huge meteorite and is heavily damaged. Hundreds of thousands of humans die, and many of the ship&rsquo;s sectors are damaged beyond repair.&#10;&#10;In his desperation, a certain human decides to take matters into his own hands. Owning the only copy of G.O.D.O.S., a man named Deacon Padjin, the Prime Commander of the KARR-5, uploads G.O.D.O.S. to the KARR-5 ship&rsquo;s operating systems. G.O.D.O.S. takes over the entire ship!&#10;&#10;With the help of G.O.D.O.S., the ship is saved. Humans learn how to resurrect the dead by placing the &ldquo;souls&rdquo; of deceased individuals into androids. The newly-resurrected individuals, known as the Resurrected, remain ignorant of their death and subsequent resurrection. This technology becomes so advanced over the years, that it is almost impossible for someone to tell if they&rsquo;re human or a Resurrected. The KARR-5&rsquo;s population begins growing back to its original size.&#10;&#10;G.O.D.O.S. secretly develops a semi-functional time-machine, but after extensive testing, the results are grim: it can only send people to the past, but it can&rsquo;t bring them back, and it cannot send anyone into the future. G.O.D.O.S.&#10;&#10;A few years pass; the KARR-5 is still stationary. Deacon Padjin, who is still deeply involved with the time-travel project, develops a module that allows time-travel to the future. After managing to remove G.O.D.O.S. from the ship's systems, he uses the time-machine to escape to the past, safely, taking the AI and some other people back with him.&#10;&#10;The remaining leaders of the KARR-5 assess the situation and, after 10 years of testing and many different iterations, manage to partially replicate the time-machine.  Having done so, about ten years later, they send a group of KarrSEC agents after Deacon and G.O.D.O.O.S. armed with a state-of-the-art tracking device, capable of following someone through time.  As there have been no changes to their timeline, it is a widely-believed hypothesis that Deacon succumbed to an untimely death, either during the jump or as a result of it.  However, the KARR-5 Council, and the KarrSEC, want to ensure that G.O.D.O.S. be dismantled so that it can&rsquo;t make any modifications to the timeline, thus changing the course of History forever.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the CeDI engage in secret meetings with some of the scientists from the Institute, informing them that the loss of G.O.D.O.S. will most likely have disastrous consequences. The CeDI finally reveal their true intentions: they need G.O.D.O.S. to break through a time bubble that has been placed around their planet in which an intergalactic battle is being fought. Without G.O.D.O.S., the CeDI will likely lose the battle, which could easily spread to other parts of the galaxy, a threat that none but the CeDI is prepared to face.&#10;&#10;",

Finally in the center of the card is the number of damage as well as the special effects.&#10;&#10;Regarding cards, there are 2 types. Cards for physical damage and cards for mental damage. Finally you will be able to combine certain offensive cards with utility cards to add a boost to your attack.&#10;&#10;For the defense part, when a player attacks you, you get 2 defense dice to block attacks. Throughout the game, you will be able to get up to 6 of them during an attack phase. In order to have more defensive dice, you will have to collect on tiles with &ldquo;anticipation&rdquo;.

Be quick, because the bomb goes off at a random interval somewhere between 10 seconds and 1 minute. If you are holding the bomb when it 'explodes', you have to keep the card. The player with the least number of cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;Educational and great fun for kids.  2 or more players.

This is a solitaire wargame in which the player must accomplish a specific &ldquo;objective&rdquo; to win the game, which will be generated at random at the start of the scenario. The player must manage the various outfittings and functions of the SMS Goeben and its escorting light cruiser, the SMS Breslau. As you fight your way through the Mediterranean, you will encounter various Allied warships, merchantmen for raiding, and unexpected opportunities and objectives. These are represented by &ldquo;Incident&rdquo; chits.&#10;&#10;German ships in the game are shown in detail. Allied ships are shown in a more abstract way because you, the player, are seeing the situation from the standpoint of Admiral Souchon, the fleet commander of the German Mediterranean Division. The possibility of running into enemy warships will be increased via the &ldquo;Alert Level&rdquo;, which represents how much the Royal Navy&rsquo;s Admiralty is concentrating its resources against your task force. The game can be played with two players, one in command of the Goeben, the other in command of the Breslau.&#10; Each game turn represents about one day, and each sea spaces are approximately 100 miles apart. Most warship counters represent one ship each, although some counters represent flotillas, such as destroyer and convoy chits.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #220.&#10;&#10;Group of Soviet Forces Germany features a simulation of a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Germany in the late 1970's. It is a two-player alternative history game intended to examine what could've happened during the first month of fighting had the Soviets opted to invade Germany during the Cold War.  An assumption is made that the invasion would've been executed without lengthy preparation or forewarning.&#10;&#10;This game is an update and revision of SPI's 1973 release, &quot;NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970s&quot;. Its time and space scales have been preserved, but the map has been improved by reflecting a more in depth terrain analysis. The system has been updated and the orders of battle are more fully developed. Air warfare has been added, at least as an abstract, and tactical nukes have been taken away except as possible game enders.&#10;&#10;The orders of battle for both sides are based on open-source documents that have become available since the parent game was first published. The system, though more complex than that of the original game, still comes in toward the lower end of today's complexity scale. Experienced gamers can expect to be blasting away within 90 minutes or so of first opening the box.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are divisions, as are most NATO units, along with a few brigades and regiments. Each full game turn represents two days.&#10;&#10;The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the western portion of Germany and its environs in the late 1970s. There are 280 unit counters in the game, most of which represent combat formations. Others are also provided as informational markers and memory aids.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The card also includes a chart showing the health of the player's spine.  For each successful delivery, the player's spine worsens, and if they overexert themselves, they'll damage it more quickly.

To leave the shelter of the cities is to brave the Ash Wastes &ndash; a massive expanse of polluted and desolate dunes inhabited by outcasts, prospectors, and those who have adapted to life in these harsh environments. Gangs are often employed to protect caravans and convoys when commerce between the hive cities is necessary, and the nomads of the wastes prey on them for both sustenance and sport.&#10;&#10;In Necromunda, you'll take control of a vicious gang, building them up from green recruits to hardened veterans as they claw their way to power through bitterly-fought skirmishes with their rivals. Necromunda: Ash Wastes takes the action out of the claustrophobic and dangerous sprawl of the hive cities, and into the agoraphobic and deadly wastelands. This box provides you with two gangs, including mounted units, a set of modular habs, and a gaming mat to fight over, plus the rules and gaming accessories you&rsquo;ll need to start playing right away.

There is a shortage of bread and on the borders the Austrians and Prussians are ready to invade. The press has become mighty popular, publicly denouncing traitors and calling the populace to arms. There are some that believe that the Revolution has gone far enough, but for others it has yet to begin.

Each of the players belong to a different political faction, each with their own agenda. Although they are rivals, they will have to work together to prevent the armies of Austria, Prussia and Sardinia-Piedmont from reaching Paris, thereby crushing the Revolution and ending the game prematurely!&#10;&#10;With the help of the multi-functional action cards, the players will be able to influence a number of areas in Paris (National Convention, Palais-Egalit&eacute;, the Paris streets&hellip;) or the provinces.

    "Description": "Battlefields of Olympus is a quick turn based strategy game with some hand management. The numerous tactical choices, combined with a limited military force and the unexpected appearance of Ares on the battlefield, give the game its strategic component. The relatively simple game mechanics make it easy to learn and play, even if you aren't a tactical genius.&#10;&#10;Backstory&#10;&quot;In the kingdom of immortals, the restless gods decree that mortal man will fight one another to prove their loyalty. By order of Zeus, The war god Ares leaves his throne to inform man of this noble contest. To the victors go the spoils of war and eternal gratitude from the gods.&#10;&#10;As the general of battle hardened archers, infantry, and other units, you have been commissioned by the high priests to lead your people to victory. When the sisters of fate look favorably upon you, your armies will find strategic advantage on the battlefield. Ambush, flank and surround your opponent's forces in an effort to gain the upper hand.  If the battle looks bleak, call on your mercenary forces to turn the tide.&quot;&#10;&#10;Game Overview&#10;The idea behind Battlefields of Olympus is to secure a number of Land Trophy cards through battle using Warrior cards and Action cards. The one with the most valuable lands by the end of the game is victor. Battlefields of Olympus is a tug of war, where each player must decide when to use his forces to fight and when it is better to retreat and gather strength for later battles.&#10;&#10;There is also an element of press your luck as the appearance of Ares and the order that land turns up during the game is randomly predetermined. On the other hand, when there is a stack of face-up Land Trophy cards, strategic planning is paramount, as players must decide when it is better to concede a battle in favor of a more valuable Land Trophy card farther down in the stack.&#10;&#10;Each player commands a legion of up to 4 Warrior cards, but there is often a reserve pile of Warrior cards to draw from at the end of battle. Players need to decide when it is better to keep more powerful Warriors in hand and when it is better to retire the weaker ones from their reserve pile. The limit of 4 Action cards in hand forces players to manage what actions they need most.&#10;&#10;The optional fortify and sacrifice rules create more tension as players have additional tough decisions to make. Using the Fortify action will protect your land, but at the risk of temporarily weakening the size of your military force in hand. Do you sacrifice a piece of hard-fought land in favor of your opponent's more valuable property, or do you wait until a valuable Land Trophy card turns up on the land pile.&#10;&#10;",

Each racer needs boldness, tactical skills, and some good luck if they want to be the winner at the end of the race.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls up to six dice (one at a time) and advances their racer according to the results. But be careful! If you roll doubles, you must draw a crash card and anything can happen&mdash;depending on the double you may get a boost or be slowed down, letting others catch up. However, you can gain bonus cards for repeated doubles that can make up for lost position, if used correctly.&#10;&#10;Using the unique abilities of the racers and collecting Boost markers, the players can manipulate the outcome of the race to their advantage. On top of all of this, players may have to fight for track position. Whenever two racers share the same space, a duel takes place to decide who will advance by one space and who will stay.&#10;&#10;Finally, crossing the finish line will shuffle the racers&rsquo; positions due to the effects of the goal cards.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An easy to learn set of rules for 18th century Warfare. Tactical, Campaign or Siege sections can be used together or separately. Refight battles from Marlborough to George Washington.&#10;&#10;The tactical rules use simple but in-depth mechanics to portray the fighting styles of the period. They're so easy to remember that many of us haven't consulted the rules in tears, but just get by on the quick reference sheet.&#10;&#10;The elegant campaign system is designed to keep book-keeping chores to a minimum while allowing platers to exercise grand strategy. Smooth transition from map to tabletop eliminates the friction that kills most campaigns.&#10;&#10;Finally, the siege system presents you with the challenges that the great Vauban once put before engineers and generals.&#10;&#10;Warfare in the Age of Reason has:&#10;&ndash; Complete and tactical, campaign and siege rules.&#10;&ndash; Army lists for the Wars of Frederick the Great, the Marlburian Wars, the Great Northern War, the French and Indian War, the Jacobite Rebellions, Clive's Conquest of India, and the American Revolution.&#10;&ndash; 102 tactical maps.&#10;&ndash; A campaigning map of Europe, India, and the American Colonies.&#10;&#10;(source: Emperor's press website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From DecisionGames.com:&#10;&#10;&quot;The Battle of Britain&#10;&#10;The sky over Britain in 1940 was the scene of one of the decisive battles of World War II, when the Royal Air Force defeated the Luftwaffe&rsquo;s bid to gain air superiority and open the way for Operation Sealion. Eagle Day is a two- player wargame covering the most critical period of the Battle of Britain. The Luftwaffe player must move bombers and their escorts to attack targets in Britain, while the RAF player must utilize interceptors to stop them.&#10;&#10;Each player moves units representing historic wings and groups. All the famous aircraft are here, including Spitfires, Hurricanes, Me-109s, Ju-88s, He-111s and many more. Each unit is rated for air superiority, bombing and speed. The game uses a new and unique system that facilitates aerial operations, dispensing with record keeping.&#10;&#10;Eagle Day is part of the Air Wars mini-game series. Each player has a deck of Campaign Cards. They generate a range of events, including Fuehrer Directives, the Empire Rallies, and critical morale checks. Certain cards can be played in combination to gain operational advantage, leading to tense decision making. There are special rules for radar, fog of war, and the infamous Stukas.&#10;&#10;",

In Autokrator, you control one of the major kingdoms/Caliphates of the Medieval Age &ndash; the Franks/Holy Roman Empire, the Moors, the Saracens, the East Roman Empire (Byzantines) &ndash; with each kingdom striving to protect and expand its domination.&#10;&#10;The players use four characters each round &ndash; the King, the General, the Admiral, and the Garrison &ndash; with each character having special abilities. What's more, each player has his own &quot;battlecard&quot; deck of armies and must divide them strategically between his characters at the begining of every new turn. The original combat system is based on the choices that the players have, and the battle is fought between five battlefields: Plain, Hill, Forest, City and Ambush. The game lasts five rounds, and players win or lose victory points based on the winning battles and the territories that they control.&#10;&#10;Make your choices wisely, and take a chance on becoming the next Autokrator!&#10;&#10;",
