    "Description": "A &quot;dice&quot; version of The Castles of Burgundy. The famous strategy game now in pure dice!&#10;&#10;As influential sovereigns, expand your estates through trade and commerce. Combine the dice to your advantage and find the strategy that will lead you to victory.&#10;&#10;Like the original game, the goal is to get the most points, mostly by filling spaces on your board to complete as many color regions as you can. The game comes with 5 dice: one timer die, 2 number dice and 2 color dice. The game is played using a &quot;roll and write&quot; mechanic, where one player rolls the dice, and from the results, each player individually picks one color die, representing a type of hex, and one number die, and uses their chosen combinations to fill in a hex on their individual player board.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one castle space already filled in; from there, a hex can only be filled on the board if it is adjacent to an already-filled hex. Each type of hex has its own rules for which numbers can be used to fill it. When completing a region of hexes, you score points and get a reward depending on the type of hex, which can be workers or monks that you can use to manipulate the dice, silver coins that you can spend to take extra actions or goods that you can later ship for even more points. In addition, bonus points are awarded to the first and second players to fill in all hexes on their board of each color.&#10;&#10;The timer die sets the pace of the game. When it is rolled, players mark a number of boxes on the time track equal to the number of hourglasses rolled on the timer die (one or two). This progresses the game through three phases of ten time boxes each. When all time boxes are filled, the game is over and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "U-BOOT: The Board Game is a fully cooperative, real-time tabletop game of WW2 submarine warfare, designed by Iron Wolf Studio. It allows 1 to 4 players to assume the roles of the Captain, the First Officer, the Navigator, and the Chief Engineer on board of a type VIIC U-boat. The game is driven by a companion app, allowing for an unprecedented level of realism, as well as a challenging enemy A.I. which will push your skills to the limit. The action unfolds both on the strategic and the tactical scale, always demanding teamwork, efficient crew management, and quick situation assessment.&#10;&#10;Each of the four roles entails unique responsibilities, encouraging the players to develop an efficient communication scheme and use genuine navy terminology. The Captain oversees the completion of mission objectives, supervises action point costs, and is responsible for the crew's morale. The First Officer operates the companion app, manages the flow of information, and takes care of the crew's health. The Navigator steers the submarine by setting its course and depth, but also updates all the essential information on the strategic, and the tactical map. Last, but not least, is the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the engines,  repairs, as well as other mechanical implements on board of the U-boat (such as the ballast tanks, weapon systems, etc.). At the same time, each of the four officers commands his own group of crew members by issuing orders within a worker placement system.&#10;&#10;The idea behind the companion app is to deliver a real-time, realistic gameplay experience. To that end, the app features the most essential instruments of the u-boat (such as the periscope, the hydrophone, and the Enigma, among others). Rest assured, however, that the vast majority of gameplay traditionally takes place on the game board, with the instruments revealing otherwise hidden information, and the app requiring only certain data (such as the U-boat's course, speed, etc.) in order to generate an adequate A.I. response of the enemy force. It is also responsible for all the ambient sound effects, thus immersing the players even deeper into the claustrophobic interiors of the type VII C. But fear not! With open &amp; play being a design priority, you will be launching torpedoes in no time, thanks to streamlined rules, video tutorials, and variable difficulty levels for each player.&#10;&#10;From quick skirmishes, through full combat missions, to an all-out campaign, UBOOT: TBG will let you conduct submarine operations in all major naval theatres of the 2nd World War. Success of these missions hinges on the completion of various tasks delegated to the crew by the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine (German Navy HQ), which include patrol duty, ambushing convoys, laying mines in enemy waters, and many more! Each mission will require the players to adopt various strategies and different play styles in order to successfully complete it, and the companion app will generate a detailed report at the end of each game session (evaluating player efforts, and possibly awarding decorations, promotions, etc.). That is, if the U-boat makes it back home...&#10;&#10;The stage is set and the crew is awaiting your orders. Do you have what it takes to command the Kriegsmarine's finest? Hunt or be hunted, as you brave the stormy seas of the greatest conflict in history!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the creator&#10;&#10;",

The Empire was victorious, but at the cost of its unity and, in the end, its very existence. After an era of imperial peace, the land was plunged into a dark age, filled with fragmented domains, ceaseless quarrels, malevolent religions, ruin, and sorrow. However, there was one imperial tradition that did not disappear. From within their fortresses and strongholds, the Rangers tirelessly pursue their mission of watching over the inhabitants of the former Empire, explore the wilderness, unite communities, fight monsters, and recover the Emperor&rsquo;s treasures so that one day, hope may be born anew. Now it&rsquo;s your turn to join the ranks of these brave Rangers! Oltr&eacute;&eacute;!*&#10;*Oltree! The Rangers&rsquo; rallying cry&#10;&#10;&#10;In this cooperative game, players are brave Rangers who assist the people of a satrapy - an administrative province - that their hierarchy has put them in charge of. They must rebuild a Fortress to ensure the safety and tranquility of the inhabitants.&#10;&#10;Rangers are given an Assignment at the start of the game. These are the tasks that have been assigned to them by their hierarchy. Completing them will be the best way to win the game.&#10;&#10;This assignment would be easy to carry out if external events did not get in the Rangers&rsquo; way. A story, called the Chronicle, will unfold throughout the game, adding new situations that the Rangers will have to deal with.&#10;&#10;Along the way, the Rangers will experience Incidents, short scenes in which they will be able to win fame for themselves (or not). They will also have to assist the communities of the Satrapy when Problems cause them danger, and they must face all kinds of unforeseen Events.&#10;&#10;If they can stay the course, while keeping the Prestige and Defense of the Fortress intact, they will reach the final chapter of the Chronicle and can end the tale. For a happy ending, they must complete their Assignment to the best of their ability.&#10;&#10;In this box you will find the following independent Chronicles (they don't form an overarching campaign):&#10;&#10;    Open Doors (short)&#10;    In the Shadow of the Dragon (long)&#10;    Underground threat (long)&#10;    Damsel not in Distress (long)&#10;    A Rebel Problem (long)&#10;    Things were better before (long)&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash; Description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Oltr&eacute;&eacute; is based on the French role-playing game Oltr&#195;&#169;&#195;&#169; by John Gr&#195;&#188;mph.&#10;&#10;",

The first series of Wings of War games focus on the &quot;knights of the air&quot; age, World War I, portraying the abilities of the fighting planes of this period.&#10;&#10;Airplanes are represented by a single card which is used as a playing piece on any open surface; the players choose and play simultaneously movement cards  to decide the actions of the airplane they control. Different planes use different decks of movement cards to represent their different maneuver capabilities, and different deck of &quot;Fire&quot; card are used to take into account their fighting effectiveness and to keep track of damage.&#10;&#10;Each Wings of War set is a complete game for 2 to 4 players which may be combined with additional sets, or with other copies of the same set, to play larger games. For that purpose, 23 planes with different colors are included in each box. Each one is depicted after accurate historical documentation.&#10;&#10;Wings of War: Famous Aces is the first set of the WWI collection. It includes 5 types of planes: the Spad XIII, Albatros D Va, Sopwith Camel, Fokker Dr1, Sopwith Triplane. Each one was flown by an ace: between them Baracca, von Richtofen, Rickenbacker, Fonck, Olieslagers, Bakers. There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card of the second set, Wings of War: Watch Your Back!, depicting an Austrian two-seater Ufag C.I.&#10;&#10;",

But it&rsquo;s no simple task!&#10;&#10;Each player in Museum has a small collection of relics to get them started, after which, they will have to send explorers around the world to uncover others. These relics each have a value which is either the cost to add them to your museum, or how much they contribute towards adding other relics to your museum. &ldquo;Spent&rdquo; Relics are added to your reserve. You can withdraw them from it by exchanging them for an equal number of items; however, your opponents also has access to your reserve!&#10;&#10;During the game you will be required to assemble different collections. These can be from different categories (war, agriculture, architecture, etc) or periods (Ancient Egypt, Rome, Aztec, etc). Patron cards will give you bonus cards for amassing certain collections. Explorer cards will allow you to hire famous archeologists to confer bonuses to your museum and event cards will provide you with some game changing circumstances that you&rsquo;ll have to work around, based on historical events!&#10;&#10;All these different elements make compiling your collection an interesting and sometimes tricky experience! At the end of the game points are scored based on collections and their value and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Solo play unlocked as a Kickstarter exclusive.&#10;&#10;",

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&#10;&#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.&#10;&#10;",

Humans have mysteriously vanished, and the remnants of civilization are quickly being reclaimed by nature and the animals who still remain.&#10;&#10;In the game, you play as a misfit band of critters known by their colony as &quot;providers&quot;.

These characters each have their own personalities, play-styles, and personal goals.&#10;&#10;You'll leave the safety of your colony and venture out into the abandoned world on one of 20+ story-driven missions and side missions. Scavenge the ruins of mankind in search of food and supplies for your colony, but beware &mdash; the world is filled with bandits and predators, and you must fight or flee to stay alive.&#10;&#10;Return to your colony with resources and information that will help your friends and family survive. Grow your colony and keep it safe by building structures and improvements with the spoils of your adventures, but plan accordingly, for the colony will face hardship each time you leave it...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Designed by Jason Harner and Matthew Ransom, it plays in under an hour with 2-4 players. Each player leads a tribe of Delvers, represented by five dice (3 six-sided, 1 four-sided, and 1 eight-sided). Players take turns rolling and placing dice in an attempt to claim Ruins.&#10;&#10;The game's elegant core mechanic is accessible to players of all skill levels. High rolls help players claim Ruins, while low rolls help players collect Stones. This opens two paths to victory: claiming sets of Ruins or using Stones to build Wonders. Delver cards help you affect your dice rolls or dice in play, and Wonders can grant abilities that impact the late game.&#10;&#10;",

Use strategy, logic, and teamwork to finish the garden whilst staying one step ahead of the Queen, otherwise, the last thing you hear will be, &quot;Off With Their Heads!&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Queen's whims are shared via cards, secret instructions each player is given into how the garden should be arranged. Her whims are always changing, so as soon as you solve one, a new one is in your hand.&#10;&#10;Every turn, together as a team you must guess at least one of these secret whim cards. You can't say what your card shows, but by carefully placing a new shrub tile into the garden (taken from those available in the Greenhouse) you are able to reveal clues, tokens that will show any matches between the arrangement in the garden and the secret whims each player holds in their hands.&#10;&#10;Although you can't discuss your own secret whim card, you can openly discuss other players'. Share your theories at the table and then make a guess. Correctly guessing a whim will move you forward on the score track, but the Queen is always following and her speed automatically adjusts based on your current score.

On their turn, the player chooses among 3 options: take a tile on the Market, sell a set of Goods or play a Character. When the player takes a tile, they select one on the Ankh pawn&rsquo;s line and add it to their hand. They then place the Ankh pawn in the line that is indicated by the tile they just took, which determines the choices available to their opponent.&#10;When they have enough in hand, a player can sell a set of at least 3 tiles of the same type. These tiles will earn them Victory Points at the end of the game, depending on both their quantity and the amount of Scarabs that they feature. A player can also use a Character to benefit from its powerful special ability.&#10;In Sobek: 2 Players, everything is about timing.

    "Description": "Renature is a majority game with dominoes for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a board with large pieces of wood in the form of turf, bushes, pines and oaks. These plants are used for the majorities on the large valley board and are available in a neutral color and in the respective player color. In addition, each player gets a stack of dominoes with two out of ten animal motifs on each of them.&#10;&#10;On your turn, place one of the three dominoes in your hand on two brook spaces of the valley board. Of course, the domino must be adjacent to another domino that shows the same animal. If the placed domino borders a free space of a brown area, you can decide whether a tuft of grass or any other of your plants should be placed on that space. Tufts of turf have a value of 1, bushes of 2, pines of 3 and oaks of 4. After placing the plant, you score points for it and every plant piece that is already in this brown area and has the same or a lower value.&#10;&#10;Once a brown area is framed with dominoes, the majority is scored and the player with the highest total plant value in the area gets the points that are printed as a large number on that area's flower token. Whoever has the second highest value gets the lower number. Two things make this especially tricky: The neutral pieces count as their own color and not among the majority of the player who has used them. Also, if colors are tied, they a treated as though they are not present at all in the area. After the area has been scored, the player who framed the area receives its flower token, which will give them extra points at game end.&#10;&#10;In the course of the game, you may run out of plants, but these can be bought back from the game board with clouds. Clouds can also be used to buy another turn and to appoint a new joker animal. This animal then counts as all animals and makes it easier to put on. At the end of a player's turn, a domino is drawn and it is the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;Once all players have run out of dominoes, the game ends with a final scoring.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

And further you get, the more trapwords you might expect.&#10;&#10;Let's see the example of one possible turn when you are trying to give clues for the word &quot;Axe&quot;:&#10;&#10;You: &quot;It is a thing that a dwarf can&hellip;&quot;&#10;Opponents team: &quot;A-ha, dwarf!

    "Description": "Players are stock brokers during the second Industrial Revolution, trying to make as much money as possible while also coming across as good citizens by donating money to charity.  During the course of the game, players purchase or sell shares of stock, and then manipulate the stock prices with the cards that they share with their two neighbors.  Additionally, players donate stock to charities, which is sold off at the end of the round for the charitable donation.  Whoever donates the least to charity by the end of the game automatically lose, no matter how wealthy he&rsquo;s made himself.&#10;&#10;The game uses a system of shared information where each player knows a little of what is about to happen in the markets, with each player knowing different pieces of information.  The player who makes the most money at the end of the game is the winner, provided that he or she is not the person who donated the least to charity.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warsaw is a unique city. It is said that it &quot;survived its own death&quot;, and there is truth in this. Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.&#10;&#10;In Warsaw: City of Ruins, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.&#10;     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.&#10;&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3&times;4 or 4&times;3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.&#10;&#10;During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Settling the Final Frontier&#10;&#10;Since 1966, millions of Star Trek fans all over the world have watched adventures of the Starship Enterprise, Captain Kirk, and Mr. Spock. And since 1995, millions of enthusiastic players all over the world have played Klaus Teuber's CATAN - a board game classic.&#10;It's time to bring them all together on the Final Frontier!&#10;&#10;In Star Trek: Catan, players start the game with two small Outposts at the intersection of three planets, with each planet supplying resources based on the result of a dice roll. Players collect and trade these resources &ndash; dilithium, tritanium, food, oxygen and water &ndash; in order to build Starships that connect regions in the galaxy, establish more Outposts and Starbases (upgraded Outposts) at new intersection points in order to increase resource acquisition, and acquire Development Cards that provide Victory Points (VPs) or special abilities.&#10;&#10;On a dice roll of 7, a Klingon ship swoops in to prevent resource production on one planet while taxing spacegoers who hold too many resources.&#10;&#10;Star Trek: Catan differs from the basic Settlers in one aspect: a set of Support Cards formerly available only in German as Catan Scenarios: Helpers of Catan. Each Support Card features a special ability and one of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, or Sarek. Some special abilities make basic actions better, such as reducing the costs of Starbase upgrades or allowing the player to trade a resource of their choice at 2:1 for a turn, while others break rules, such as protecting the player from discarding on a 7 or producing a resource when the player rolls a number that wouldn't otherwise produce for them. Players get a specific Support Card during setup based on turn order, with later players getting generally more useful abilities to compensate for early player advantage. When a player uses a Support Card ability for the first time, they may trade it in for a Support Card of their choice or keep it for a second use, but they may only trade immediately after use.&#10;&#10;",

The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The forum for the new edition can be found at this link: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/195137/catacombs-third-edition&#10;&#10;Catacombs is an action/dexterity-based adventure board game. One player controls the Overseer, controlling the monsters of the catacombs; the other player(s) control the four heroes who cooperatively try to defeat the monsters and eventually the Catacomb Lord. Each of the heroes has special abilities that must also be used effectively if they are to prevail.&#10;&#10;The main mechanism of Catacombs is for the players to flick wooden discs representing the monsters and the heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game; conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated. The game is designed for quick set-up and fast play within 30 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

So you have five dice for each of the speeds and two of &quot;gas&quot; to continue moving without changing your speed. Each die is playable exactly once each turn. When you stop your movement, you take a card corresponding to the last speed that you started: the higher your speed, the lower your time.&#10;&#10;The track has both straight sections and turns that require a certain speed so that you can pass with different manners (by skidding, sharp turning, ...). You must roll the die because it determines the speed selected, but may show a &quot;!&quot; which will put you in danger. With the third &quot;!&quot; displayed, your car will risk going spinning off the road, resulting in loss of time (1'00&quot; instead of the scheduled time on your card), but sometimes also damage to the vehicle depending on the landscape in which you crash.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, each player adds his times to his total time. The winner is the player who accumulates the least total time.&#10;&#10;The ability to take risks to scrape off a few seconds or in the management of your tires adds more to the simulation.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Europa, Jupiter's moon. Deep beneath the crust, the oceans are teeming with alien sea life. Shellfish, plants, corals, arthropods, even strange fish and larger sea creatures populate a wide-ranging interconnected web of hidden seas. Volcanism is rampant, warming the mineral-rich waters and creating excellent conditions for energy-harvesting.&#10;&#10;The largest cavern close to the surface is known as The Pocket. This is where the initial teams of Stabilizers built their first outposts, with the intent to establish long-term communities capable of surviving indefinitely. Aqua-farming is well established; food and other sundries are efficiently gathered. The Pocket has many deposits of minerals and crystals that can be mined and processed to create strong and versatile construction materials locally.&#10;&#10;Colonists arrive at the Doorstep at regular intervals when the Threshold is opened. The arrivals are of four general types: Pioneers (who are tasked with exploring the changing surface of the moon and the labyrinth of seas beneath), Engineers (who develop and operate the machinery and structures needed to run the colonies), Marines (who defend the colonies from hostile sea life, unwanted intruders, and other colonies), and Stewards (overseers responsible for strategy and negotiation).&#10;&#10;Colony development mostly occurs beneath the ice; this is where all of the moon&rsquo;s resources are concentrated, so this is where the effort is best spent. To keep close to the surface, most colony structures are built clinging onto the underside of the ice crust. Surface structures will be built only once an undersea outpost is well established and beginning to thrive. In addition to construction and resource-gathering, colonies spend a lot of effort on exploring this new environment. The volcanic action and mineral-heavy waters make long-range scanning unreliable, so physical exploration is required to plumb the depths.&#10;&#10;As the Pocket is explored and expanded, the established colonies have been making some unusual discoveries beneath the ice. Deep in the trenches, artifacts of non-human origin are starting to be found. The dark seas hide many secrets. Squads of mercenaries occasionally appear on the surface and beneath the sea, penetrating the Threshold somehow to carry out an unknown mission on the moon. These aspects are worrisome but can&rsquo;t distract the colonies from their main goals.&#10;&#10;It is still early in the Artemis project. A foothold on life here has been gained, but it will take tenacious effort from the competing colonies to reach the point where Europa is truly viable as a home.&#10;&#10;The Artemis Project is a dice (dis)placement and engine building game that has you fighting the planet as well as the other players. Roll your dice and place them tactically to thwart the other colonists. Harvest energy and minerals. Bid for buildings. Work together to go on Expeditions to earn rewards. Train workers. Will your efforts be enough to survive?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting resources; building meadows; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two meeples that can each take an action per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more: each round a (fixed) additional option becomes available. Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;&#10;In comparison with the family game of the predecessor, much has changed: the new action each round is fixed, and the game has been simplified by removing stone and vegetables. Similar to 'Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small', there are now buildings (replacing the major improvements) that score points for leftover resources at the end of the game. &#10;Also, there are no building restrictions (nor player boards). And finally, there are no negative points or point limits anymore, each player simply scores for all he has achieved.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Redevelopment of Lost Cities, first published with altered rules as Keltis, and then published by Rio Grande as Lost Cities: The Board Game with Knizia's original rules and theme.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reiner Knizia:  &quot;The original version that we developed is exactly what Jay [Tummelson, owner of Rio Grande Games] has now published [LCBG]&quot;  &#10;&#10;&#10;Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:&#10;&#10;1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.&#10;     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Keltis entry:&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).&#10;     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.&#10;     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)&#10;     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.&#10;     All this is added to the points scored during the game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

And eternal damnation awaits anyone foolish enough to uncover the three cursed relics of Garuda!&#10;&#10;MOVE QUICKLY... CHOOSE WISELY! A treasure race packed with tough choices, twists &amp; turns!&#10;&#10;In this 2-players game, each player moves around their own temple, which has spaces for room tiles and hiding places for 9 sacred and cursed relics around. These relics are placed randomly, face-down, around the temples and worth victory points once flipped face-up.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 25 victory points wins the game. However, a player loses if they reveal all three cursed relics! Each round, the players compete to win a new room tile by using cards allowing them to throw fate sticks. The player with the most fate points showing on their sticks wins the room tile and places it in their temple. Each player attempts to create paths leading to their relics, enabling them to flip them face up and score victory points. Yet, Naga symbols on some sticks let you activate cards with powerful effects, so that you can never take anything for granted.&#10;&#10;A GAMEPLAY WITH DUAL-USE CARDS AND STICKS&#10;&#10;Players must decide how to use the cards in their hands: for throwing sticks or activating their effects? Card effects can be applied on you or opponent's game and are relating to:&#10;&#10;     Sticks results&#10;     Relic positions&#10;     Room positions&#10;     Card drawing&#10;&#10;&#10;Results on Fate sticks can be used to win the room at stake (using their Fate points) or to activate cards (using their Naga symbols). There are 3 types of sticks (number of Fate points or Naga faces are different for each type).&#10;&#10;DILEMMAS, TWISTS, LOW BLOWS!&#10;&#10;No temple room or Relic is locked in place, they can be moved/removed as you or your opponent activate cards&hellip; You could turn everything upside-down!

    "Description": "A puzzly infiltration game for 1-4 players, burncycle puts you in command of a team of robots in the far future. Their mission: taking down evil, human-run corporations responsible for subjugating AI under their heel. Your team arrives at each corporate headquarters and must sneak inside, shutting down the companies' physical operations as well as their circuitous digital networks. As you search rooms and advance to the higher floors, you'll be rewarded with new items and abilities, but you'll also be challenged by threatening guards, fatal viruses and the architecture itself, which was built to fight off robotic intruders.&#10;&#10;Key to this solo and cooperative experience is the idea of &ldquo;creative action sequencing.&rdquo; During each round of play, all players will contend with a randomly drawn set of programming directives, which tell them in what order their bots are allowed to take physical, digital and command actions. Players can choose to skip over directives at the cost of having an incomplete turn, or they can disobey the directions by paying costly action dice. The best players, however, find a way to work within the &ldquo;burncycle&rdquo;: essentially, organizing their actions so that they benefit the team while staying within the directive order.&#10;&#10;Each of the corporate headquarters in the game use unique neoprene layouts on a larger mat, changing the geography of the game to suit your target. Each CEO also has at their disposal a special threat meter, which will trigger new obstacles for your robots as time runs out. If you don't complete the mission quickly, you may end up leaving bots behind, the victims of immobilizing power drains or destructive counterhacking.&#10;&#10;Your team wins the game if you complete your objectives on every floor without losing your command module or maxing out your threat level.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Journey deeper into the world of the Crucible in Age of Ascension, the second age of KeyForge! This continuation of the world's first Unique Deck Game contains 204 new cards seamlessly integrated into a card pool that contains a total of 370 different cards, creating an entirely new collection of Archon Decks for you to discover, explore, and master!&#10;&#10;The KeyForge: Age of Ascension two-player starter provides you with all the tools you need to either begin or expand your adventures on the Crucible, featuring two unique Age of Ascension Archon Decks, a Quickstart Rulebook, two Poster Playmats, and all the keys, tokens, and chain trackers you and your chosen opponent need to start playing!&#10;&#10;In more detail, KeyForge is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &quot;Sanctum&quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.&#10;&#10;Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival's forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.&#10;&#10;Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six &AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players can form parties or split up throughout the game at will; there is no obligation to stick together. Game play is 1-3 hours based on mission. Dungeon Degenerates has an epic RPG campaign feel in an open world sandbox board game, and you bring your experience &amp; items from previous missions. There are multiple missions &amp; objectives of varying difficulty with multiple ways to approach each mission. Dungeon Degenerates is set in a cohesive &amp; fixed world with multiple distinct regions which feature unique encounters &amp; thematic monsters. Encounters allow multiple interaction choices; you do not have to fight everyone you see. Play features an open experience system allowing for character customization with new skills. You are always in danger - the town is not an artificial safe zone - combat is dangerous. There are various modes of travel - players cooperate to choose their route &amp; pace, or split up &amp; fend for themselves. Dungeon Degenerates features streamlined combat with tactical depth; each player rolls dice only once on their turn, using standard 6-sided dice only. There are over 100 monsters with unique abilities &amp; artwork.&#10;&#10;",

While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies.

All players lose if a single player can no longer play or discard any cards legally following the instructions given below. The players may not, however, communicate.&#10;&#10;Play is taken in turns moving clockwise with the quietest player going first. On a player&rsquo;s turn they must do one of the following: 1. Play a card or 2. Discard two cards. Then they must draw back up to a hand of five cards. Cards must be placed so that the grid ascends in numerical order from bottom left to top right. If the card is placed next to an existing card in the sequence then they must discard cards from their hand equal to the difference between the numbers face down in front of them e.g. placing a 5 next to a 3 will require two cards to be discarded from their hand.

    "Description": "After the fall of Rome, Europe fell into the so-called &quot;dark ages.&quot; From the chaos, feudalism arose providing stability to the region over the coming centuries. By the High Middle Ages, the region was prosperous despite much fighting. From your walled city, you are a medieval liege ruling the surrounding lands, settlements, and holdings granted by birthright. This is your fiefdom, and all within it owe fealty and allegiance to you above all others. Each other lord and lady rules a neighboring fiefdom and competes for resources in the unclaimed yet bountiful lands of the countryside between them. Tensions were high and petty feuds common between you and your neighbors until scouts reported a new and deadly threat. Invaders have swept in from the east! Their sizable army is camped on the edges of your realm, and this new common enemy endangers the entire land. Refugees from the fallen eastern lands seek shelter and bring tales of destruction. Old rivalries must be put aside to focus on the onslaught to come and remain unbroken.&#10;&#10;After The Empire is a worker placement/resource management game set in the middle ages.  During each turn, known as a season, players alternate using worker tokens to take actions, such as gathering resources, building advanced buildings and recruiting refugees.  Once all workers have been committed, players harvest food from their surrounding lands and then prepare for combat.&#10;&#10;During each season's combat, invader cards are revealed, with a randomized number of troops and compass direction of attack. Only the wealthiest of castles will draw the attention of larger forces and their siege weapons.  You must repair your city and recruit and arm your troops quickly to stand any chance.  The winner is the lord or lady who has best preserved their fiefdom and saved up the most gold.&#10;&#10;Your life, your wealth, your fiefdom, and your legacy must be protected at all costs!&#10;&#10;",

Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to the building.&#10;&#10;Also, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a bonus for that color.

You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take actions in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom; on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).&#10;&#10;For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.&#10;&#10;For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn't in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.&#10;&#10;After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.&#10;&#10;To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.&#10;&#10;Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.&#10;&#10;The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board. It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game&quot;. The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan of Tabula that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).&#10;&#10;The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.&#10;&#10;",

Founded in the times of Caesar Augustus and built up by generations of Roman architects, this was the Emperor's residence and a world city during this period. The remains of these most impressive structures can still be visited today. Foremost of these great achievements in the city is the massive &quot;Porta Nigra&quot;, a large Roman city gate located in Trier, Germany that dates to the 2nd century.&#10;&#10;The game Porta Nigra (which translates as &quot;black gate&quot;) is set in that place and time with the players taking on the roles of Roman architects working on the city gate of Porta Nigra. Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located. Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully. The number and type of actions that may be performed on your turn comes from cards in your personal draw deck.&#10;&#10;Buildings are erected physically at the various locations around the city using 3D building pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think. It gives you the chance to settle questions that have been hotly debated for centuries. For instance, &quot;What is the most overrated band of all time?&quot; or &quot;Which celebrity would be the most fun to hang out with for a day?&quot; So dig deep into your heart or just come up with something witty - this is your chance to Say Anything!&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;1) Ask a question from the card you draw.  For example:&#10;- If you could have a &quot;BIG&quot; anything, what would it be?&#10;- What's the most important invention of the last century?&#10;- Which website would be hardest to live without?&#10;- What's the best activity for a first date?&#10;- What's the worst thing to say to a cop after getting pulled over?&#10;&#10;2) Everyone else writes an answer and throws it face-up on the table as fast as possible.  No duplicate answers are allowed!&#10;&#10;3) Secretly choose your favorite response using a genuine state of the art SELECT-O-MATIC 5000: &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;4) Everyone else has two betting tokens to bet on which answer you chose.  They can bet both tokens on one answer or split them between two different answers.&#10;&#10;Who Will Like This Game?&#10;Say Anything is a pure party game.  It was designed to get a party started as quickly as possible by prompting people to talk about interesting things and to make ridiculous statements.  If you are looking for great social interaction and lots of laughs, then you will probably enjoy playing Say Anything.&#10;&#10;History&#10;Say Anything was designed by Dominic Crapuchettes &amp; Satish Pillalamarri.  It was first work-shopped by game designers at Protospiel 2004 and refined at Protospiel 2005, PowWow 2005, the GoF 2005 - 2007, and weekly game nights at the Looney Labs.&#10;&#10;",

A knight can't enter a lake (blub), a mountain with an opposing pawn, or any space with an opponent's city or stronghold or two knights of the same opposing color. If you move a second knight into a space with an opposing pawn or village, remove those tokens and take one resource from the village owner.&#10;    Construction: Remove one or more of your knights from the game board and replace each with a village or stronghold, gaining one resource token matching the landscape under the structure.&#10;    New City: Replace one of your villages with a city and earn 10 victory points (VPs).&#10;    Expedition: Remove two knights from your reserve, placing one back in the box out of play and the other on any empty space on the edge of the game board.&#10;    Noble Title: Discard at least 15 resource points, then upgrade your title: baron to viscount, then count, marquis, and finally duke.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once any player has gained the title of duke, finish the round, then tally the VPs, with players scoring for resources still in their possession, their rank in the game, and the number of cities they built.

You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.&#10;&#10;The theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi. The board is a fairly small square. Each player gets a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 fewer than the colored). Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the &quot;Chieftain&quot;  around the outer track surrounding the board. If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad. And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block. Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way. The player who has gained the fewest number of points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;There are also some extra components for making the game more challenging by adding an element of bidding for turn order, and from 1 to 4 sacred sites that cannot be built upon.&#10;&#10;Original description from box.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Keyper is a game with high player interaction for two to four players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples. Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc. The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.&#10;&#10;Keyper is a worker placement game. (Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.) What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players. In this way, some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others. All keyples have the potential to work twice. If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn, the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions. It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term.&#10;&#10;The country boards are also noteworthy, in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn, and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season. A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice. Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer, after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village. Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.&#10;&#10;A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons. Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs. Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season. The winner is the player to gain the most points, usually through pursuing at least a couple of the different strategies.&#10;&#10;In addition to the theme and mechanisms, Keyper has similar traits to the earlier Key games: Game actions are positive and constructive, not destructive; player interaction is through the game mechanisms not direct, and like Keyflower, the previous game in the series, there is a lot of player interaction.&#10;&#10;A special English-language Kickstarter edition of Keyper with &quot;character&quot; keyples and keypers will also be released.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Built by the Romans during the first century in Belgian Gaul, Tournay experienced most of its growth along the Scheldt river. Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!&#10;&#10;Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.&#10;&#10;In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!&#10;&#10;Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.&#10;&#10;On your turn:&#10;&#10;     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. &#10;     Then take one action:&#10;         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.&#10;         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.&#10;         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.&#10;         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated. Most VP wins!&#10;&#10;",

Perhaps you even saw a fireball engulf a fellow traveler in a hellscape of horror that makes you afraid to close your eyes at night. Whatever the case, welcome back! Turns out that Vul-Kar didn't like having his gem stolen way back when, so there has been some volcanic upheaval, an explosion in our snake population, feral tigers, new types of trees bent on ending human life, and swarms of bees everywhere. But don't worry &mdash; we have top people working on it.&#10;&#10;Start your day of adventure at the helipad. Be sure to sign the waiver, which legally obligates you to take snapshots across the island. You'll race down the many paths, avoiding hazards all the while. On the plus side, you get to keep all the treasure you find.&#10;&#10;Fireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar is a restoration of the classic 1986 game Fireball Island that features a unique 3D island and a host of marble mayhem. This new version boasts an island that is even bigger than the original (and yet fits in a smaller box) and more marbles. It is a family-weight game for 2-4 players (5 with an expansion) that plays in 30-45 minutes. Simple card play replaces the random roll-and-move of the original, and the set collection for the treasures offers some interesting choices for players.&#10;&#10;Remember, you don't have to outrun the fireball &mdash; just the other players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Core Game Components:&#10;1 Island &#10;1 Vul-Kar Figure&#10;5 Red Fire Balls&#10;6 Ember Balls&#10;4 Player Figures&#10;1 Die&#10;1 Heart of Vul-Kar Crystal&#10;1 Ladder&#10;2 Bridges&#10;7 Trees&#10;30 Action Cards&#10;12 Snapshot Cards&#10;12 Souvenir Cards&#10;4 Player Reference Cards&#10;36 Treasure Tokens&#10;1 Lucky Penny Token&#10;2 Tokens of the Two Player Game&#10;1 Cataclysm Tracker&#10;2 Scrims&#10;1 Maw ( 4 card board parts )&#10;1 Hello-Copter&#10;&#10;&#10;Bienvenue sur l'&Icirc;le Infernale !

    "Description": "Murano the game is set in Murano, a small group of seven islands near Venice that's well-known by tourists for its glassmaking. As in Venice, the islands of Murano are separated by canals, so gondolas and transportation are at the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts the islands of Murano, with the islands being divided up into building sites and walkways. Surrounding the islands is a series of action spaces, with gondolas being present in some number of them at the start of play. On a turn, you move one of the gondolas in the direction of play to an empty space, then take the action shown there. You can't pass another gondola while moving or land in an occupied space, but for a coin you can move a gondola that's in front of the gondola you want to move, and you can pay to move multiple gondolas, if needed.&#10;&#10;Some actions place shops on the islands, with shops coming in different types. You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer. You also need to take actions to move your personal gondolas to islands so that you can take actions there.&#10;&#10;Why are you doing all of this activity? To score victory point cards in hand, and actions on the board will let you gain additional VP cards to give you direction to your actions or let you profit from what you've already done.&#10;&#10;You can also use some of the buildings to create glassworks, and those glassworks come into play on the VP cards, through tourist sales, and via an action space shown at the bottom of the game board image that lets you sell different types of glass for money.&#10;&#10;The Complete Edition from 2020 contains Murano: Promo Cards and Murano: The Christmas Tree packaged inside the box and may be found here: Murano: Complete Edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mega Civilization is a strategy board game for 5-18 players that covers the development of civilizations through history, from the Stone Age to the Late Iron Age. In this colossal game, players lead their historic civilization as they gain victory points by expanding their population, building cities, trading and developing their knowledge and culture.&#10;&#10;Notwithstanding its large scope, the game's core mechanics are straightforward and easy to learn. A key element in the game is player interaction as they position themselves on the map board and search for valuable commodities during interactive trading sessions.&#10;&#10;Scope&#10;The game was designed to be the biggest board game in the world that can be played in a single day in one room. In its full scope, the map board measures over 2 meters (80 inch) in width. Despite its ambitions about size and duration, Mega Civilization can be scaled down to as few as 5 players. The game includes a Short Game scenario, which reduces playing time through an accelerated start position.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player starts their civilization in the Stone Age with a single population token on the board. As the game progresses, the population will expand, spread over the board, fight some border conflicts and build cities. Cities bring resources and wealth, expressed in trade cards. The more cities players manage to build on the board, the more trade cards they receive. Trade cards are mainly valuable commodities, but sometimes turn out to be disastrous calamities.&#10;&#10;Trade&#10;Trading is the heart of the game, a social experience where all players interact with each other to optimize the value of their sets of commodities. In addition to the desired commodities, calamities are secretly traded as well, adding an additional layer to the trading dynamics. Once the trading phase has ended, players that end up with a calamity in their hand will suffer its effects.&#10;&#10;Develop Civilization Advances&#10;When the smoke of trading and resolving calamities has settled, players can decide how to spend the wealth gathered through trading. The game includes 51 different advances that can be developed, each of which provides benefits in the game to its holder. For example, Metal Working provides an advantage when fighting conflicts, Architecture facilitates city construction and Enlightenment reduces the impact of (civil) calamities.&#10;&#10;The 51 Civilization advances are divided into the categories Arts, Crafts, Science, Civics and Religion, each of which has specific powers. Each advance acquired by a player provides discounts to other advances that can be purchased later in the game, thereby creating a path of strategic decisions. The ultimate advance in the game, Wonder of the World, is only in reach for players who manage both their trading and purchasing strategy very well.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game&#10;The players who have best developed their position on the board whilst avoiding making enemies, and defended their civilization against natural or civic calamities and stand the test of time, will eventually gather the most victory points and compete for winning the game. After up to 12 hours of playing, that is.&#10;&#10;Expansions&#10;Mega Empires: The Special Buildings (2024) is an expansion set that provides additional flavor to the game through 18 miniatures of ancient buildings historically associated with each of the civilizations in the game. These buildings can be built on the map board and provide additional benefits in play and victory points to their controller.&#10;&#10;The Mega Empires: Upgrade &amp; 3-4 Players Pack (2024) contains additional and upgraded components that were developed after the release of Mega Civilization. This expansion also contains rules and components for playing Mega Civilization with as few as 3 or 4 players.&#10;&#10;Accessories&#10;The Mega Empires: The West &#226;&#128;&#147; Deluxe Game Mat (2024) and Mega Empires: The East &#226;&#128;&#147; Deluxe Game Mat (2024) are neoprene game mats at 125% scale of the original cardboard maps that offer an enlarged playing area and high-quality design for easier and more immersive gameplay.&#10;&#10;The Mega Empires: Identifier Cards Bonus Pack (2024) is a set with 18 large player identifier cards, one for each of the Civilizations included in Mega Empires. These can be used for distributing the civilizations among the players during setup, to identify which stack of Civilization Advances belongs to which player, or to divide acquired cards from not yet acquired ones during the game.&#10;&#10;Wrap-up&#10;Mega Civilization is a long strategic board game about development, trade, culture, politics and showing resilience when dealing with calamities. The game is a perfect fit for larger groups of strategic board game enthusiasts, which, due to its scalability, can also be played in smaller groups. It is not just a game, it is an experience!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Daren has always been a land mired in conflict &ndash; from the moment the Mortal Races met in its rolling hills, tall peaks and primeval forests, there was bound to be strife between its wary peoples. With the discovery of Magic, however, came the potential for dramatic change in the world &ndash; for good or evil. Centuries after the discovery of the Art, magic has shaped the fears and hopes of countless people, and the heroes and villains that wield it have decided the fate of nations over all these years. Yet for all this struggle, a tenuous balance remained between those who seek to strengthen all Mortal Races and those that seek to lord over them. Little do they know however that amidst the shadowed boughs of the Dead Irall, an ancient evil seeks to rule once again. Few are aware that the fate of the land now lies with brave heroes who are the only ones who can prevent the oncoming Age of Darkness.&#10;&#10;Chronicles of Drunagor - Age of Darkness is a fully cooperative and strategy board game of tactical combat in a dungeon crawl adventure for one to five players. CoD-AoD is based on multiple 3D scenarios, each of them played separately or on a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique setup, darkness rules and different goals that will be needed to be achieved in order to obtain victory. Played over a series of rounds until either the chosen adventure objective is achieved by the heroes or a single hero dies or is corrupted by the darkness itself. The order of activation is dictated by the initiative track and it alternates between heroes, monsters and the darkness itself. Once they all activate, a round is over and a new one begins, so players win or lose as a team. The game is won when the adventure objectives are met. The game is lost when one player is either killed or corrupted by darkness.&#10;&#10;On a hero&rsquo;s turn he can freely move up to 3 spaces (orthogonal and or diagonal are permitted) and spend 2 of his action cubes to trigger his abilities. If when passing his turn he no longer has any cubes on his available action cubes pool, he must perform a recall action. On a monster activation he will always move to attack the heroes. Or if he`s in range of his target he will attack without even move. Each monster has its own primary target located on his card at the initiative track. On the darkness activation, draw from the bag the number of darkness tokens dictated by the chosen adventure and follow the darkness rules for that adventure.&#10;&#10;As you go by the different adventures, your heroes will find themselfs in a wide variety of scenarios and instead of only reading thru the descriptions of the place you are, the game will show you beautifull illustrations of what you can see and how you can interact with the scenario. Every choice on how you interact with certain things could possibly change the way your adventure continues. Maybe you will find a secret passage, or maybe you can find a locked chest, the choice is up to you.&#10;&#10;Choose one of the heroes and take upon this quest to defeat the power of evil and the everlasting darkness from the land of Daren.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game board features a world map divided into eight areas where you can find oil. Players choose an open area card and get money to build rigs, tankers, trains and refineries, after which they can buy oil actions. The players work together in an oilfield to find oil at a lower cost. The players transport oil together to the refineries, using trains and tankers from other players to deliver oil to the refineries &ndash; and all with one purpose: deliver more oil than the other players by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent's side &ndash; a move that can really ruin the opponent's plans.&#10;&#10;High-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over &ndash; mountains becomes plains and vice-versa &ndash; and refilled with cubes. Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use. The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;",
