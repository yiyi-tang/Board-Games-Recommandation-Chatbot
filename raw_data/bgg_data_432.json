The gameboard is laminated so that the planet counters, made of shiny flexible plastic, can adhere to the board during play, but are easily peeled off and re-positioned. It has a 70 sci-fi look, and &lsquo;3d&rsquo; energy recording strips which are exchanged when alliances are formed. &#10;Interlocking ships are used to move round the board to colonize planets, gain energy points and split apart for combat. Movement is by dice, though players can elect to slow the ship down by using energy points, to enable them to reach specific target squares. Hyperspace Gates can also be used to perform more complex moves. Combat is resolved by a highest dice wins system. An Asteroid belt finalizes a range of encounters, from combat to entering an occupied square. There are also rules for alliances and planet hopping.&#10;&#10;",

Blacks plain piece is solid black.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture your opponents plain (target) piece.&#10;&#10;The basic premise of the game is that a colored piece is locked into lines of it's own color and the black lines.  Each piece has it's own special rules to follow in addition to this.  Grey pieces can move on any line, and the grey 'dot' pieces are particularly powerful..&#10;&#10;",

Contestants competed in silly obstacle course type games, usually wearing equally silly costumes.  Regional heats culminated in the winners representing their countries in international contests known as &quot;Jeux Sans Fronti&egrave;res&quot; (Games Without Frontiers).  The board game was originally created in Britain in 1974 and became the Australian Toy Association's game of the year in 1986.&#10;&#10;Players move around a playing board until they land on one of the 'games' that include variants on tiddlywinks, target shooting, blow football and bowling. The position that players finish in the sub-games determines the amount of points that they receive.  Each player has a &quot;joker&quot; that can be played before any one game and they get double points for that game.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest number of points wins.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for children, but is enjoyable when played by adults that remember the television program.&#10;&#10;",

The second level provides special rules for fantasy elements (like psionic powers), according to the plot of Mindstalkers and adding unforeseeable features and fun to the skirmishes, but always keeping the fighting realism high.&#10;&#10;",

But why do we call it the movie trivia game that leaves nothing to chance? Because in this game,  the element of chance has been eliminated.  There are no traditional dice to indicate space moves on aboard; there are no exact number requirements to win the game and there are no free rolls of a dice.&#10;&#10;The only playing piece is a color-coded cube corresponding to movie categories.&#10;&#10;Flickers! is scored, and won, solely on your knowledge of the movies.  You score points (or lose them) based on what you know about the movies, from home-grown fare to foreign treats, from the 1930s to the present.&#10;&#10;Flickers! has been created and designed to be fun for the casual once-a-month movie goer as well as challenging enough for the avid movie-a-week film buff.&#10;&#10;Flickers! can be played by any number of adult players, anytime, anywhere.  It can be played by individuals, or in teams. It can be played at the dining-room table,  in the park, or in the back seat  of a car on a road trip.&#10;&#10;And if any of the question and answer cards pique your curiosity, go out and rent the movie. You may have no idea what delights you are missing when you don't explore all the genres from all the decades, and the works of stars past and present.&#10;&#10;Above all, enjoy.....the movies and Flickers!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Inspired by Sid Sackson's classic abstract Focus, Crossfire is a stacking game played on a hexagonal grid.&#10;&#10;Piece stacks have a maximum size dependent on how many neighboring hexes it has. Excess pieces in a stack are removed from the bottom by the stack's controller and either returned to the stack controller's reserve to return to the board later, or else are captured and removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A move consists of a player moving either a stack he controls, or pieces from the top of a stack he controls, and then moves those pieces in a straight line a number of spaces up to the number of pieces being moved. Alternatively, a player may introduce a piece from his reserve onto any space on the board.&#10;&#10;The game is won when he forces his opponent into a position where his opponent cannot make a move.&#10;&#10;",

This is indicated by stacking a second checker of same color on top. In order to promote, a man must end its move on a square of the back rank. If a man, in the course of a capture, visits a cell of the back rank without ending its move on it, it does not promote!&#10;&#10;&#10;Red men get promoted when reaching any of the nine positions indicated '#' at conclusion of red's move.&#10;White men get promoted when reaching any of the nine positions indicated '+' at conclusion of white's move.&#10;&#10;&#10;          +&#10;        +   +&#10;      +   .   +&#10;    +   .   .   +&#10;  +   .   .   .   +&#10; 9  .   .   .   .  i&#10;  .   .   .   .   .&#10; 8  .   .   .   .  h&#10;  .   .   .   .   .&#10; 7  .   .   .   .  g&#10;  .   .   .   .   .&#10; 6  .   .   .   .  f&#10;  #   .   .   .   #&#10; 5  #   .   .   #  e&#10;   4  #   .   #  d&#10;     3  #   #  c&#10;       2  #  b&#10;         1 a&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Thus&#10;         the last rows at the edge of the board for white consists of fields from e9 to i9 followed by i9 to i5, while&#10;         the last rows at the edge of the board for red consists of fields from a5 to a1 followed by a1 to e1.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Capturing&#10;     Men can capture an adjacent opponent's piece (man or king) by jumping over it following a straight line onto the empty field directly behind the opponent's piece.&#10;     Capturing is compulsory, including making chained jumps if available. Thus men's turn may consist in chained jumps. &#10;     If more than one capture move is available in a player's turn then it is obligatory to select the capturing move resulting in capturing the maximum amount of the opponent's pieces (men or kings).&#10;     If optional chained capturing might capture same amount, the player may choose.&#10;     Men are non flying. Thus they can only capture an opponent's piece adjacent to their own position. &#10;     Kings are flying. They may move over any amount of empty fields or capture a piece in any amount of empty fields' distance away as long as the adjacent field behind the captured piece is empty. Anyway if a king captures, it may land on any empty field immediately behind or following empty fields in straight line of the captured piece unless it is required to stop on a specific field in order to continue jumping according to the rule of capturing maximum amount of opponent's pieces.&#10;     Any capture move may be performed by men or kings in any direction - forwards or backwards.&#10;     Each jump is performed in a straight line over any single opponent's piece. The adjacent field behind the pieces captured must be free.&#10;     A possible chained jump can consist of single jumps having a combination of same or even different directions.&#10;     In a chained capture move opponent's pieces are removed only after capturing is complete.&#10;     During a chained capture a piece may not be jumped more than once. But it is allowed to revisit or jump over any empty field multiple times then.&#10;     There is no breezing as a penalty for captures that are not performed.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Subtitled &quot;Viking Age Skirmish Rules,&quot; Strandhogg (translation: &quot;Beach Raid&quot;) is a set of miniature wargame rules for 25/28mm or 15mm games simulating Viking raids and small battles of the era of the Sagas.&#10;&#10;The rules cover Leadership with several categories including Nobles, Jarls, Ealdormen and Lords; Commanders (Huscarls, Thanes and Milites) and troop types including Warriors, Levy, Archers/Slingers/Crossbowmen, Berserkers, and Armed Peasants/Townfolk.&#10;&#10;Warbands are composed of various combinations of these types up to an agreed-upon point value; different categories of soldier have differing values, and accessories such as Spears and Shields add to a type's cost.  A Record Sheet is made out with values for each Leader and Warband involved in a game.&#10;&#10;Initiative is determine by use of cards from a conventional card deck.  Each player is assigned a card number or suit, adding a card for each Warband under a player's control.  Additional cards can be added to reflect additional events or participants in a given scenario, for example, the random appearance of a traveling Lord or Bishop and retinue.&#10;&#10;Dynamics of play involve Morale, Courage, Agility, Terrain, Non-Warband Movement, Shieldwalls and Wedges, the use of ships, and Mounted forces.  Information is provided for Saxons and Normans as well as Vikings, and the system is also adaptable to other peoples with whom the Vikings interacted, including Picts, Arabs or Skraelings (Native Americans) with a little historical research on the gamer's part.&#10;&#10;The game is well suited to multiplayer games, each player handling one or more Warbands of anywhere from six to twenty or more figures on the table.  Game length is dependent upon the scenario design, from swift ship-to-ship fights to extended coastal raids or open-field battles.&#10;&#10;The game is enhanced by the inclusion of a random events card deck which adds variety and surprises to play.&#10;&#10;Unlike many sets of miniatures rules, Strandhogg can be enjoyed by players owning only a few dozen figures; an average Warband might number ten to twelve figures, and three Warbands compose a raiding force under a Noble.  The rulebook is sprinkled with sidebars featuring excerpts from the Norse Sagas for flavor, and also includes optional rules for special attributes or traits to individualize Leaders or leading warriors (for example, a warrior surnamed &quot;the Stout&quot; gains +1 on Defense; &quot;Leg Biter&quot; enjoys a +1 on Offense).&#10;&#10;Players will often find themselves identifying strongly with the fortunes of their warband and even individuals within it; although Strandhogg is not a role-playing game, it deliberately strives to impart a strong flavor of its Viking focus.&#10;&#10;Web address: STRANDHOGG@rochester.rr.com&#10;&#10;",

The spinner is also responsible for determining how the sand dunes are shifting and if there are some Fata Morganas on the horizon.&#10; ( Fata Morganas are caused by hot and cold air which distorts the appearance of objects on the horizon either at sea or in the desert to make them look like, well, castles in the air.)&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are some fixed desert fields on the board, but the main problem is, that when encountering such obstacles you need the use of water canisters. Each player has only 6 canisters and losing all of them means a restart or sometimes an elimination of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game has a 16x16 game board, but the playing pieces move on the 15x15 intersections.&#10;&#10;The second and third row on each side of the board are the player's home sections, the space between is neutral. Each player has 6 &quot;normal&quot; playing pieces (1 tesseract, 1 cylinder, 1 pyramid, 1 rectangle, 2 stars), 2 large slide bars, 5 small slide bars and 2 crosses.&#10;&#10;At the start, each player places the Tesseract, the pyramid, one star and 2 small slide bars in his section. Then the 2 crosses are placed in the neutral zone. These crosses cannot be moved and remain at their position until the end of the game. The remaining pieces: the cylinder, the rectangle, one star and 5 slide bars form the reserves.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players now move their pieces over the board or place a piece from their reserves everywhere on the board. Object of the game is to either capture the opposing tesseract or capture all other &quot;normal&quot; pieces of the opponent.&#10;&#10;The movements of the playing pieces different for every type. Interesting, that slide bars can capture normal pieces, but cannot be captured themselves.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is played within the box itself. The bottom has 30 slots to keep the available shares and 4 trays to save the money of the bank. The top cover can be left open and it indicates the current value and dividends for each title.&#10;&#10;The game includes 5 shares numbered 1-5 in 6 different colors.&#10;&#10;Players throw one 6-sided die and one color-die to determine which of the shares can be bought, pay dividends or maybe give special gratifications. If a 6 is thrown, the share of the thrown color is given a new value by an additional dice throw.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 200.000 for each player and the one who collects  1 million first is the winner&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An interesting economic game, where players try to become the first player, who could buy and purchase 15-18 goods of 6 different types.&#10;&#10;Several taxes and fees must be paid on the way to becoming the winner of the game. A few of them are fixed amounts, which must be paid when a player reaches a certain step on the way up, some must be paid, when a player misses a chance to buy or purchase goods and therefore has to draw 1 of 80 event cards.&#10;&#10;There are six different goods available. A player can purchase 1-3 goods of a chosen type depending on a dice throw. Red goods can only be purchased by throwing a 6, green goods need at least a 5, yellow ones a 4 and so on.&#10;All goods cost 10.000 per piece, but the selling price is higher for the harder goods, from 16.000 - 32.000.&#10;&#10;Before selling, another dice throw is required, which needs matching  the throws while purchasing the goods.&#10; Last but not least, the purchase and sale of goods can be challenged by other players, if their  bid  was either lower or higher than the agreed on transaction.&#10;&#10;",

Challenges include straight question-and-answer trivia, guessing songs from their chorus, and guessing songs which the professor plays on the xylophone.

The board is designed to look like sheet music.  The element of chance is added by a spinner.  One unusual feature in some editions is a colorful six-note xylophone, with which players can make the Monkees theme tune, for which sheet music is included. Another edition includes a &quot;four string&quot; (two rubber band) plastic guitar along with the sheet music insert.&#10;&#10;The box art is an illustration of the Monkees riding in a red GTO hot-rod convertible.&#10;&#10;",

The values of the central cube spaces increase by twos from 2 to Q (12) and progress through all four suits (hearts &amp; spades are represented twice). The edge pieces are always two cards with a numerical difference of two and are always different in color. Similarly, the corner pieces progress in increments of two, half of them clockwise and half counterclockwise, and always two black and one red or two red and one black, with like colors never in matching suits. Rules for playing variants of Texas Hold 'Em, Black Jack, Vegas, Spades, Chicago Hi/Lo and Rummy are provided, but others could probably be adapted.&#10;&#10;",

Each of the holes is one of three shapes and these accommodate the stems of the plastic leaves players must insert in the correct sequence from bottom to top.&#10;&#10;To start the game, all beanstalk leaves are placed inside the hollow beanstalk through a slot situated on each side.  There is a sliding apparatus at the base of the beanstalk which allows each player access to a single leaf on their turn.&#10;&#10;The plastic beanstalk leaves come in 3 colors - green, gold &amp; black.  The green leaves have stems that will only fit into specific beanstalk holes and must be replaced inside the beanstalk if they do not match the next in the sequence.  Gold leaves are universal and fit into any beanstalk hole.  Black leaves are useless and are immediately replaced through a slot.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete the sequence of leaves in order wins the game.  When a leaf is placed in the final hole at the top of the beanstalk, a spring mechanism is triggered which causes the 'sleeping' giant to pop up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was available solely through the magazine &quot;Essen &amp; Trinken&quot; (a magazine for cooking). &#10;You objective is it to get as many menus as possible. The menu always consist of 4 courses. You collect by drawing a card from a course of your choice. The card shows the kind of menu (classic, veg. etc.)and the value of that dish. You move forward as many spots as the value of the cards - depending on the place you finish you might have to answer a question or you can trade cards with other players.&#10;At the end only finished menus are counted (and all menue cards have to be from the same kind).&#10;&#10;All menu-cards contain a real recipe from the magazine, so you can actually use this game as a cook book (if you can understand German)&#10;&#10;",
