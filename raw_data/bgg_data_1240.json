    "Description": " They filled the whole land with castles [...] when the castles were built they filled them with devils and wicked men. [...] When the wretched people had no more to give, they plundered and burnt all the villages [...] the land was ruined by such doings; and men said openly that Christ and His saints slept. -The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle &#10;&#10;In 1120 a fateful shipwreck drowned William &AElig;theling, heir to the throne of England. Over fifteen years, King Henry laid the groundwork for his daughter Matilda&rsquo;s succession. But when the king died in 1135, his nephew Stephen raced to London and seized the crown. Four more years have passed: Stephen has consolidated power while Matilda has built an invasion force in Normandy and fomented rebellion in the southwest. The stage is set for a decade of valiant deeds and dramatic betrayals, a prolonged and capricious struggle for the rule of England.&#10;&#10;In The Anarchy two players revisit the 12th century civil war that plagued the Kingdom of England through a chess motif that models shifting loyalties and strategic circumstances. Players represent the sides of Stephen and Matilda, each supported by a set of knights and bishops. Pawns (English levies and foreign mercenaries) are recruited to raid and battle, and castles pop up all over the map, presenting opportunities to protect key strongholds or tempting an opponent as worthy siege targets. As the years wear on, and leaders are called to court, deployed to fight, and defect through capture or simple exhaustion, each side must strive to meet its own unique objectives to secure their claim to the throne of England.&#10;&#10;",

Forged in war and preserved by the blood of the Imperium&rsquo;s soldiers, it has stood against the privations of the Orks from without and the treachery of the Ruinous Powers from within, but now a new terror has risen that is beyond anything it has faced before.&#10;&#10;From their cold tombs beneath forbidden and dead worlds rise the Necrons of the ancient Maynarkh Dynasty. Tainted by madness and abominable hunger, undying warrior-legions and the fearsome war engines of a lost age strike without warning, seeking to exterminate the humans that now infest their former domains. The Space Marines of the Minotaurs Chapter and the relentless armies of the Death Korps of Krieg stand ready to defend the sector, but can even these forces hold before the nightmare that has come to Orpheus?&#10;&#10;Imperial Armour Volume Twelve: The Fall of Orpheus, written by Alan Bligh, is a mighty 232-page, full colour tome, packed with lavish maps, colour profiles and photographs.

Several of these have been included more than once because the different armies have different options for the same vehicle, and the book needs to show this. We couldn't very well include Space Marine Rhinos, and not the Inquisition version, although the rules are similar they are not exactly the same and neither are the colour schemes. As a definitive guide the book needs to be thorough. Other vehicles, such as the Chimera and Valkyrie, were included in IA: Volume 1, but again these vehicles are available to Inquisition forces, and the book would be incomplete without them..... ...Using this book is as much about using the background material and illustrations as it is the game rules.Hopefully the background should provide ideas for games including the model, and the pictures should help fire the imagination. Try using the formation diagrams as a guide to battlefield tactics, or making a certain type of vehicle central to a scenario.&#10;&#10;",

In each of the four rounds, you sail to up to four islands and take one resource (decided by which port you sail to, by drawing a line onto the map). After each round, you return to your ship and deliver the treasure. &#10;However, the lines you draw may not cross each other, so you will have to plan ahead carefully. Also, ports on each island are numbered I to III, and you cannot go to the same number or to a different port on the same island twice in a row. For each resource you grab you get points. The goal is to score as many points as possible during the four rounds.&#10;&#10;In the multiplayer game, players keep their maps hidden. They take turns being the captain and announcing the number of the port everyone has to sail to.&#10;&#10;Players can use one of the maps included in the game, or draw their own at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The hard-working farmers gradually expand their settlements with the help of old acquaintances such as craftsmen, monks, and scholars, and they have to face only minor skirmishes, which affect their otherwise quiet life a little.

Exactly four players are involved, two of them playing for France, the other two for England.&#10;&#10;But who is who? This secret is revealed only in the course of the game, and often the surprise is big because one had bet on another competitor.

    "Description": "A bare-bones set of tactical miniatures rules for depicting squad- or platoon-level World War II actions, ostensibly in 1944 Europe. The only real tie that the rules have to the setting is a five-page list of game statistics for small arms used by combatants who fought in the European Theater. However, the abbreviated rulebook contains no scenarios, organizational info, or other historical background.&#10;&#10;Each 15 or 25mm figure represents an individual soldier. Each soldier is rated on a characteristics sheet for various abilities: weapon, hand to hand (combat), throwing, recovery (from &quot;shock&quot;), and survival. During character creation these statistics are modified based on a National Characteristics chart which provides various percentage adjustments to weapon, hand to hand, and survival ability die rolls for German, British, American, Italian, and Russian troops.&#10;&#10;&mdash;User summary&#10;&#10;Precis Intermedia brings back this classic set of WWII miniatures rules. Originally published in 1978 by Wee Warriors, Dogtags is designed for action on a squad to platoon level, and may be played with 25mm or 15mm figures. Recreate the most difficult and demanding actions that were daily encounters for the long-faced G.I.'s of WWII. Enact small unit tactics with you as the NCO. Can you take a strong point without excessive loss to your fighting strength? And can you hold off that next German assault? You have to answer questions such as these from game to game as you learn the importance of tactics and a good NCO to carry them out. It's up to you to hold victory in your hands -- or just a collection of dogtags.&#10;&#10;This piece of gaming history is a must for collectors, old school gamers, and those looking for a fast-playing WWII miniatures skirmish game. With the original on the extremely rare list, this classic reprint of Dogtags has been remastered for a clean print, and is readily available at a low cost.&#10;&#10;Requires a set of percentile dice and a six-sided die (a four and eight-sided die are also needed on occasion).&#10;&#10;&mdash;2020 description from the reprint publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Big Time WW2: Europe, the six major types of combat units which fought across the continent are represented by wooden cubes &ndash; infantry, armor, artillery, AAA (anti-aircraft artillery), bombers and fighters. The game is light, playable, dice-driven and features two unique boards &ndash; a resource board and a battle board.&#10;&#10;The resource board confronts the players with a clean, abstract method of obtaining resources, while two ten-sided dice often demand tough, exquisite choices. Do you take the armor unit or the AAA? Do you push your luck to get that bomber or risk losing the three units you have in production? A surprising twist is that some die rolls provide a resource for your opponent!&#10;&#10;The straightforward battle board provides a different set of choices. Do you attack instead of gaining resources? Do you deploy a bomber in its staging area or your home base? A fighter in its bomber escort role or ground support? Combat is a breeze, with equal numbers of ground unit types in a battle removed from play before resolution. Most combat is a single round, avoiding excessive dice rolling.&#10;&#10;The game can end in several ways: destroying your opponent&rsquo;s infrastructure, having more VPs when the cubes run out, or by your opponent&rsquo;s resignation.&#10;&#10;Tension, excitement and fun are high in this inimitable war game!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;60 Unit cubes&#10; 6 Infrastructure tiles&#10; 2 Ten-sided dice&#10; 1 Resource board &#10; 1 Battle board &#10; 1 Cloth bag&#10;12 Unit Type cards &#10; 1 Rules&#10;&#10;",

At&#10;least one of them needs to make it to the ground floor alive and conscious.&#10;The rest of the innocent bystanders are trying to make it to the ground without being rendered unconscious by the toxic farts! To do this, they must successfully bind and gag all the thieves.&#10;Each person playing is given a secret role to play - some with special powers but most only with their wits and guile. This is a game of social deduction where you have to work out who people really are! Can you trust them?&#10;&#10;This is a Mafia style game of social deduction. There is a narrator who controls the flow and action of the game. Players get the opportunity to interact and accuse each other of being a Farting Thief and vote to bind and gag a player (putting them out of the game). After each voting sequence the lift goes dark and the Farting Thieves get to &quot;fart&quot; and render unconscious another player. This continues until either the Farting Thieves escape or all the Farting Thieves are bound and gagged.

A &quot;judge&quot; asks a question from on of their hand cards and then chooses a best response from all the responses that the other players played from cards in their hand.  Players use their &quot;ducking high&quot; mind to think of funny, exaggerated and out of their mind but brilliant brilliant answers to mind bending questions.  The game requires very little set up whose game length can be tailored to the players time constraints with a typical game allowing for each player to be &quot;the judge&quot;.  Game length depends on the number of players but is best with a group of three or more.  An average game length is about 30 minutes, however, it has an addictive random response effect that can be entertaining for hours.  Due to the nature of the game, obscenities and scenarios this game is recommended for adult groups.&#10;&#10;",

There are 4 children's games and 12 other games. The rules are compiled in a small rulebook. Everything is packed in a tube.&#10;In the children's games, the main aim is to pantomime the diced mood. The other games are mainly about role-playing games or games in which stories about thought-out topics are to be presented to match the moods chosen. So they are quite communicative games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Au fil des d&eacute;cennies, le Matricule 22 a v&eacute;cu de nombreuses &eacute;pop&eacute;es fastes mais aussi travers&eacute; des p&eacute;riodes plus d&eacute;licates: Vice-champions nationaux en 1969, finalistes de la Coupe de Belgique en 1978 et 1993, les Z&egrave;bres ont par ailleurs connu les joies des rencontres europ&eacute;ennes en 1994 et 2015. L&rsquo;ann&eacute;e 2012 a marqu&eacute; un tournant dans l&rsquo;histoire r&eacute;cente du club. Un changement de direction allait insuffler une nouvelle dynamique port&eacute;e par un novateur plan strat&eacute;gique 3-6-9 avec, in fine, des ambitions sportives revues &agrave; la hausse concr&eacute;tis&eacute;es par une qualification pour les play-offs 1 ( top 6) mais aussi pour les tours pr&eacute;liminaires de l&rsquo;Europa League. Le Sporting est redevenu respect&eacute; et cr&eacute;dible sur la sc&egrave;ne nationale, capable de se m&ecirc;ler chaque ann&eacute;e &agrave; la lutte pour les premi&egrave;res places du championnat. Ce jeu est d&eacute;di&eacute; &agrave; Jean-No&euml;l Antoine, lui qui avait gard&eacute; son &acirc;me de gamin et qui &eacute;tait si fier de son club!&#10;&#10;",

Manage your time and resources effectively, and gain as much experience behind the Potter's Wheel as you can before the master potter must pick their disciple.&#10;&#10;The Potter's Apprentice is a complex strategic Euro game centered around multi-use cards and a rondel-like board.&#10;&#10;The game plays for 3 rounds, each one a bit shorter than the previous. Each round players will take turns moving their apprentice around the Studio Board to visit various Locations for acquiring new Assignments, Clay,  and other resources - as well as the Potter&rsquo;s Wheel to throw (a ceramics term for shaping a clay vessel on a rotating wheel) their pottery and the Kiln to fire (the process of exposing ceramic pieces to high heat in order to convert them into durable finished pieces) their already-thrown pieces. Each turn the player may also be able to benefit from the bonus of a discarded Apprentice Card, and/or Special Abilities that are unlocked as players earn Experience throughout the game.&#10;&#10;As players move around the studio, they will drop Potter&rsquo;s Clay (of their unique player color) at various Batts (a term that refers to the circular plate on a Potter&rsquo;s Wheel, short for Batterboard) where each round an assortment of Scoring Tiles are placed. Scoring Tiles provide players individual goals for earning additional Victory Points at the end of the game. At the end of each round, which is triggered after all players have passed due to running out of Potter&rsquo;s Clay, players determine the winner of each Scoring Tile based on the player who left the most Potter&rsquo;s Clay next to it. The end of the first 2 rounds also awards some Victory Points for Vessels placed in the Kiln. At the end of the third round players proceed to the Final Scoring phase where they tally up all their Victory Points from personal Scoring Tiles they earned, Vessels they fired, the size of their Supply collection, their least-developed Experience Track, and Public Scoring Tiles. The player with the most Victory Points is declared the winning apprentice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Story driven missions are designed for 1 to 4 players as individual commanders or teams. You&rsquo;ll encounter asteroids, defense stations, powerful automated enemies, and many other surprises. Choose your faction, crew, ships and modules... then embark!&#10;&#10;Through a unique physics based mechanic, players control where their ship will be by manipulating their vector token with a navigation action. Each ship has unique handling characteristics that make this an exciting part of gameplay.&#10;&#10;Depending on the mission and mode (solo, co-op, competitive), each player controls a faction with 1 to 3 ships per faction, for a set number of rounds, or until a particular objective is completed. Within a round, each player will take turns activating ships by placing crew members in navigation, module or specialist crew action slots. After crews have been assigned, the player will move their ship on the tactical board the number of hexes and direction indicated by their vector token on the vector board. Before, during or after movement, players trigger crewed actions by spending energy and then exhausting that crew.&#10;&#10;Your ships will be well equipped to explore, defend or attack with modules including weapons, defense systems, scanners, support and specialist crews. In the core game, each of the 3 ship classes possess unique strengths of their creator factions and are further customized by the player during mission setup. There are 18 modules and 12 specialist crews available to choose from in the core game. Each ship class can hold a limited number of modules and crew. Module and crew selection depends on the mission, and could include drafting, budget, free-for-all or recommended load-outs.&#10;&#10;Whether you enjoy solo, co-op or competitive story driven missions, skirmish or building your own scenarios, Velocity: Vanguard has almost endless replay-ability.&#10;&#10;",

Be that nobody and become a somebody.&#10;&#10;Grim(m) World is a solo open-world card game set in the fairy tale world of the Brothers Grimm. Here you play an ordinary person who sets out to experience adventure. The player is not told how his journey should look like. He is free to decide where he goes and what he wants to do. Maybe he wants to accumulate trade and wealth? Or does he want to make a name for himself as a bounty hunter? Maybe he also wants to save Little Red Riding Hood from the bad wolf or even help the wolf hunting Little Red Riding Hood. The world reacts and changes based on your decisions. Are you ready for this adventure?&#10;&#10;Grim(m) World is based on the OWCS (Open World Card System). The OWCS is a system to simulate an Open World as a card game. An encounter deck with multi-use cards serves as a random encounter, as an object deck, it triggers quests, dice rolls are simulated, it defines prices for trading and it simulates the time in the game world. An additional quest deck simulates the living world in the game. Depending on the time in the game, new missions appear or disappear, events happen or the world changes. Additionally, your own character can be leveled up and becomes stronger and stronger as the game progresses. The battles in the game are fought on a grid field laid out with cards. Your hand cards serve as life points and determine the character's possible actions during a fight. The opponents are controlled by a simple card-based AI.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Westward Ho! Two to six players take the role of powerbrokers building the American west, from 1848 through 1881.&#10;&#10;In each turn players take actions to move pioneers into new territories, build railroads, rake off profits from new industries, and other actions.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s plenty of action, with the US cavalry, Indians, militia, and famous outlaws all involved.&#10;&#10;The map shows the US divided into the historic territories of the era.&#10;&#10;Cards represent famous personalities, critical commercial firms (such as Wells Fargo and the Union Pacific) and historic events.&#10;&#10;The player who accumulates the most wealth by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "To play this entertaining, gaily coloured game, you need six children, but a smaller number is no objection. Each player gets one peg. The first player rolls the coloured dice and follows up by placing his peg in the first section having the same colour as the top of the coloured dice. When it is their turn to play, the other players proceed likewise.&#10;Winner is the player who first reaches the end of the course. To do so, it is necessary for the player that his peg ends up on the last blue section, near the flower garden, or that he throws a colour which would have gotten him past that blue section if the course had been a longer one.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
