    "Description": "&quot;Myth&quot; is an interactive video card game.  There are two levels at which the game may be played - for the Beginner level, players, via battles, must be the first to collect a set of 5 different warriors (Human, Elf, Goblin, Dwarf and Troll) of any number ('1', '2', or '3'), whilst in the Standard level players must battle to collect a set of 5 different warriors of the same number.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved by players simultaneously playing numbered Warrior and Weapon cards and consulting a battle grid (player with the top total score wins the battle).  Depending on the result, Warriors and/or Weapons are then exchanged between the players or the deck.&#10;&#10;The main feature of the game is an accompanying video (played during the game) which features the &quot;Battlemaster&quot; who dictates changes to the gameplay which will 'make certain only the best warriors (players) will prevail'.  This includes penalizing the current leader (by removing a Warrior card from their hand), helping the current loser, swapping/taking cards from another players hand, and other such winner-influencing actions.&#10;&#10;The game was produced in Western Australia by a now apparently defunct games publisher.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Played this is a child, so the game's objective is not remembered. It came with a fold out board a la Twister, though not as large. There were numbered/colored Glunk cards that were placed around the board in designated outlined locations.&#10;&#10;I only remember it being one of those frenetic games, as players raced to grab certain types of cards using the included one foot+ long wands with a suction cup at the end. Many times the suction wasn't strong enough and frustrated players with smash the wand down on the card numerous times until it would adhere. It was a noisy, chaotic affair, and the gimmick wore off quite fast. Made good for some temporary hysterics though..&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Played this is a child, so the game's objective is not remembered.&quot;&#10;&#10;Response: This was kind of a Demolition Derby type of Go Fish. There were two sets of cards. Player Cards and Glunk Cards. The Glunk cards were shuffled and placed face down in the middle of a 4' by 4' heavy vinyl sheet. The Player cards were scattered face down around the Glunk cards. Each player would take turns counting 3-2-1 and tuning up a Glunk card and calling the colour of the Glunk pictured. The card would be placed face up on top of the deck.The person turning the card would have to quickly get out of the way as blows would begin raining down as players would try to stick their suction cup tipped Glunk stick to the back of each card in rapid succession, looking for a colour match. No hands allowed, except to replace the non-matching cards face down on the sheet. When a match was found the player would call it, keep the card and claim the Glunk card to form a pair. The winner was the player with the most pairs at the end of play.&#10;&#10;(Note:*My brother's solution to cards not sticking well, was to LICK the suction cup in between cards. I ended up with many bruises resulting from being bashed while playing. The force of the blows was quite something, seeing as the sticks were made of thick, rigid plastic. Within two years all were broken and the vinyl sheet - white when turned over, became my thrifty mother's picnic table cloth.)&#10;&#10;",

However, due to political stands taken by some countries, players may be limited in their access to nuclear power.

Play the course and avoid the hazards. 18 holes of exciting golf - whatever the weather.&#10;&#10;HAZARD can be played by any number of players in pairs, foursomes, or alone against the course. Players draw five cards representing a 'wood', 'long iron', 'mid iron', 'short iron' and 'pitch, chip or putt'. Each card has a different stroke indicator informing you of distance, hook or slice, and by using the card in any one of four directions allows you unlimited combinations of shots.&#10;&#10;As in real golf, mistakes occur. So when the ball strays from the fairway or into a bunker, 'rough' or 'bunker' cards are drawn to continue play.&#10;&#10;Each hole ends when the player lands in a hole or on the green which indicates the number of putts to finish.&#10;&#10;Hazard can be played against the course par of 72, or 'hole for hole' as in matchplay.

As such, it is a real departure from what you may be used to. It doesn&rsquo;t have a rigid, traditional turn sequence where players alternate moving and firing with perhaps a melee or two at the end. It is much more fluid than that with both players moving figures, firing, and fighting as a result of various reaction tests. Forget perfect plans for few prearranged plans will survive past first contact! Opportunities arise as fortune smiles on one side then the other. The victory will go to the player who learns to exploit these situations.&#10;&#10;Included in the game is an innovative campaign system for the nation states of Talomir.  Both the mass battle system and campaign system are unusually solitaire friendly.&#10;&#10;",

Players assume the role of European statesmen seeking to outclass their geopolitical rivals and attain a position of predominance.&#10;&#10;The game is based upon Allan B. Calhamer's classic Diplomacy. However, its treatment of minor powers is strikingly different as these have their own military units. Players secretly bid influence points in order to obtain the support of these lesser powers.&#10;&#10;The game closely resembles the designer's previous geopolitical game Locarno: Europe 1926, though various changes were made in order to take account of the spectacular rise of the USSR as an industrial power since 1926 and the looming Spanish Civil War - pitting the foreign-backed Nationalist and Republican factions against each other.&#10;&#10;The rules and maps are provided further below.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Locarno: Europe 1926&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Platoon Leader comes in a solid booklet format, complete with all errata for previous Historical SQUADS &amp; LEADERS modules from CH, a newly-designed purchase record table, and all the charts you need for quick reference on a back cover play aid. You'll find the cover of PL 2.5 depicted at the top of the left column of this web page. Overall, it's a very nice package for Campaign Gaming, as everything you need to conduct the campaign is right in the booklet.&#10;&#10;Platoon Leader campaign game rules for Historical SQUADS &amp; LEADERS enthusiasts are now available in version 2.5. As the version number suggests, this is still PL 2 at heart, but with many improvements. More than just a minor upgrade, this is an under-the-hood overhaul that was expressly aimed at making the existing line of modules easier and more fun to play. In fact, our testers report that these rules work great for RB, PB and KGP, too! Head to the bottom of this page for links to the latest version.&#10;&#10;The approach was simple: bring in some of the system's harshest critics and some top talent for a down-to-earth review of the strengths and weaknesses of the system. A round table was conducted by our PL team, with many other folks providing comments and insight. The resulting enhancements, fixes and improvements make PL more user-friendly without introducing any major changes to familiar terms and methods.&#10;&#10;Platoon Leader provides one set of rules to learn before embarking on your personal 'campaigning' to the different 'fronts' CH has and will continue to bring you. (In recent months, North Africa, PTO, France 40, Normandy, Market Garden and more.) And since it's a rulebook aimed at campaigns only, the emphasis is on enhancing that particular gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    The Sunrise Bridge&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board is composed of 25 rooms joined by many doorways.  Some of the doorways are blocked by barrels.  Each turn, a player rolls a die to determine the number of steps to move from room to room.  For each step, the player moves her marker one space, may then reposition one barrel, and then must move the ringmaster one space towards herself following the shortest path.  Players can't move through barrels or into occupied rooms.  The ringmaster can't move through barrels (or reposition them) but may move through other players.  If the ringmaster 'catches' the active player, the game ends and all other players win.&#10;&#10;Stumpy the Cave Boy was originally slated for release as CAG 012 in October 1997.  A last minute decision removed it from the production schedule.  The game was retooled as Escape from Dork Tower and published in John Kovalic's Dork Tower in 1999.  Stumpy the Cave Boy became a celebrated martyr of Cheapass Games, and stock number 012 has been retired.  It was finally published in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two to six family tribes from the planet Laura get bored with their own planet and set off to find a bigger and better home in outer space. Not much later, they all descend on an unspoiled planet which they call Laura-2. The land grab and inter-tribal bickering starts as soon they settle into, and on to, their new home.&#10;&#10;A simple abstract placement game for 2-6 players that is played in two phases. In the first phase players scatter their 18 tribe members and 2 item counters (a throne and a private saucer) on to the circular planet's surface. In the second phase the Lauranians will swap places until one tribe manages to get all family members unified into one single group that includes their own flying saucer and chief's throne.&#10;&#10;In the settling phase, the first player places one counter in the defined central area of the board, and each subsequent player places one more settler as the previous player next to other Lauranians on the board, until all counters have disembarked. In this phase, no tribes may form a family group larger than 4.&#10;&#10;In the relocation phase, in turn, each player will swap two tiles as long as they contain one own family member and the 2 tiles are lying in a straight line on the board. But a family member that is part of the tribe leader's group, including the tribe leader, can only be prized away by swapping it with another tribe leader. When you move your tribe leader more than once, you unnerve the other families, and each other tribe leader will see one of their own people take shelter under the tribe leader's throne, making it much easier for them to keep their family together.&#10;&#10;The flying saucer can be used for one of two special moves that replaces the normal swap-2-tiles turn. One is to lift it up and move it in a straight line to land on an empty space besides a friendly tribe member. The other is to beam a family member in a straight line  on to an empty field besides the saucer.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, no move is allowed that would leave the entire Lauranian split into two groups at the end of a turn.&#10;&#10;Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (2/1984 apr-jun), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Six circular areas, each with a sweeping radar at its core, are surrounding a central area, again with its own radar system. Each radar is surrounded by three rings, marked 1 (=inner) to 3 (=outer), and each radar zone is divided into 6 pie-parts, except for the central radar zone, which has 12 pie-parts. The radars themselves are small dots at the center of each zone. The outer 6 radars each have 2 pie-bits connected to a neighbor. One movable radar beam is placed on each station, covering a sixth of each circular area, and a beam half that size is  placed in the central zone. Each player takes ownership of an equal amount of outer radar posts, and gets a small squadrons in the same color. These are then placed on the starting fields on the outer edge of the board, just outside their own radar post zone.&#10;&#10;Using dice, 2-6 players try to keep their fleet of planes under the radar, and the first one to sneak 3 planes of one color into the center zone is the winning commander.&#10;&#10;In turn, players will first move the radar beam at their own station forwards. The beam speed depends on the activity within the zone. Any planes that get caught by the sweeping beam have to abort their attempt to reach the center, and return to their start location to start another approach.&#10;&#10;After that, the planes move, by rolling 4 dice. Planes are under no obligation to move, but when a die gets allocated to a plane, the entire move has to be made. Planes start on the outer rim and move, avoiding the area covered by the radar beam, clockwise or anti-clockwise, along the ring it is currently occupying. However, in the pie-part that touches its neighbor, planes have an opportunity to &quot;flop&quot; radar stations instead of continuing on their current track. When they do flop, they move their plane to the other station's pie-part, but place the plane one ring closer to that's station's radar than the one they just left.&#10;&#10;When a plane leaves the most central track and flops right on top of a neighboring radar, called the blitz-field, that plane is then immediately moved to the outer ring of the central radar, which is surrounded by 2 rings. Each subsequent plane of that color that manages to make it to the central zone undetected, arrives one ring closer to its center. When the third plane of a color pops up on the most central ring, that player is the winner.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, the central radar also sweeps forwards, the speed again depending on how crowded the central zone is, and detected planes must abort and start their mission again from the beginning. After each round a new turn-order is established.&#10;&#10;This is a fairly abstract race game, using a novel mechanic, that works quite well. It is probably slightly more complex than the average Spielbox game, but simple enough to appeal to a family audience.&#10;&#10;Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (4/1984 oct-dec), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. Its novel movement mechanism made it the winner in Spielbox' &quot;Invent-a-Game&quot; competition. Some assembly required.&#10;&#10;This is not the first &quot;dodging&quot; collaboration between Bernd Brunnhofer and Karl-Heinz Schmiel. A year before the pair had given the start signal for &quot;Hans im Gl&uuml;ck&quot; by self-publishing Dodge City, in partnership with Bernd's wife Margaret.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "3-6 deductive space explorers take a couple of UFO's each, and travel between seven solar systems to meet the neighbors. When a rendezvous takes place, the visiting player needs to guess the local way to say &quot;hi&quot;, which is made through a sequence of gestures and salutations, 4 in all. Depending on how accurate a player's greeting is, that player will receive a gift, which gives a clue to how close the attempt was to the real McCoy. The question is, which mastermind can deduct all the secret alien handshakes?&#10;&#10;The board shows six solar systems arranged in a circle. A seventh solar system is placed at the center of this. Each solar system has 13 planets orbiting a sun, in 3 orbits. Where solar systems touch each other, there are planets facing each other on the outer ring, creating places where UFOs can hop between systems. With the exception of the central system, each solar system has one distinctive home planet. There are unique 24 handshake cards, grouped in 4 sets of 6. Each player gets 5 gift counters.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player picks a home planet and places the two flying saucers on it. All players then get their unique 4 part hand-shake sequence, which gets written down on a private note sheet. Unused cards are exposed, so players can cross them off as possible candidates. Each player then allocates the values 0-4 to their 5 gifts, which is also written down on the sheet and kept hidden from opponents.&#10;&#10;In turn, players can allocate between 1 and 4 movement points to their 2 UFO's, in any way they see fit. UFO's move clockwise from planet to planet, and are allowed to change orbit, and even solar system. Each planet offers room for only 2 UFO's though, and these have to belong to different players too. When 2 UFO's meet on the same planet, a rendezvous takes place.&#10;&#10;The arriving player takes a guess (aloud) at the correct greeting sequence of the other alien. Depending the amount of correctly guessed elements, the alien will return a gift to this player. This gift has the same value as the amount of correct guesses, but what that value is, is another thing that has to be deduced by the other players. When a player has already handed over the gift with that value, the visiting player will be told that no gift can be made. All this information is available to all players.&#10;&#10;Landing on another player's home planet opens up another opportunity to get that player to reveal another clue. When a player gives back a gift previously obtained from that tribe, the owner of the home planet must return a greeting that has the same value as the returned gift, but also one that has not been made before.&#10;&#10;A players cannot establish a rendezvous between the same two spaceships in 2 subsequent turns, and must leave a solar system before another landing on the same home planet may be made.&#10;&#10;When a player greets all other players with the correct salutations, than that player is the winner. You're only allowed one guess though, so don't expect it to be made fast.&#10;&#10;This is a great addition to the deduction genre, sitting comfortably next to Cluedo and Mastermind, despite lower production values. With each additional player, game length increases a bit, and an alternative victory condition, guessing only the handshake of the players on your immediate left and right, is suggested for 5 and 6 player games. Where most of these games use indicators that give players direct clues about the accuracy of a guess (for instance, a red peg is a correct guess but not in its right place), here the added complication is that the true meaning of these pegs (the gifts) must also be established, setting player's quite a puzzling logic challenge.&#10;&#10;Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (1/1985 feb-mar), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. It was the runner up in Spielbox magazine's &quot;Invent-a-Game&quot; competition, losing out to Radar Flop. It clearly shows how designers can produce completely different games, despite starting off with a similar board and setting. Some assembly required.&#10;&#10;",

The game was described as a card game with an increasingly confused set of rules, remotely connected to Poker, intended to allow the Enterprise crew to gain control of the situation. Multiple versions of the full rules have been posted online and the game is played by Trekkers at most Star Trek conventions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tour sets out to recreate the team-based tactics and excitement of pro cycling (without the drugs!) by combining the roll and move styling of Formula De with the need to use your differently skilled team of cyclists (up to five unique cyclists per team) to the best of their abilities.&#10;&#10;Players can compete for green, yellow, U25 and polka dot jerseys over single stages or whole tours, using the draft system to build a team with cyclists rated for power (to help breakaway from the pack), speed (to help sprint at the end of a stage), mountain (to power away up the mountains) and resilience (to survive at the front of a pack).&#10;&#10;Cyclists will need to recycle the lead of breakaways and chasing groups in order to prevent their cyclist tiring, while the ability to slip into other cyclists' slipstreams and elbowing their way through the pack (at the risk of falling!) adds to the realism of the game.&#10;&#10;The original game, self-published by Luke Morris (under the guise of &quot;Games On The Way&quot;) comes with a reversible board featuring two stages, with plans of many new stages that can be bought cheaply to build the cycling world. Real towns and cities from around the world will be raced between in flat stages, mountain stages, time trials, rolling stages, even lap racing!&#10;&#10;Also, chances to play using simple rules, or immerse yourself in a full tour or even season, buying and selling cyclists are being developed.&#10;&#10;",

There are five &quot;power spaces&quot; in the center of the board which the players are trying to occupy.  The remainder are either card spaces (of three different colors), go-again spaces (you get a second move if you land there) or free spaces.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of markers, and a single pawn which they can move around the board.  This is done by rolling a die and moving it that number of contiguous spaces.  When you land on a colored space, you collect a card of that color.  A set of three different colored cards are required to place markers on the power spaces.  Card sets are also used to attack other player's markers and capture them.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one to occupy the five &quot;power spaces&quot; or to eliminate the other players in the game.&#10;&#10;",

They give orders to their troops and population, explore, invade other territory, encourage population growth, etc.  One player is the Realm Controller and sets up the Realm in advance, and gives the players the results from their orders.  The game is structured in a way similar to PBM games in that the players hand in their orders each day for a time period covering 1 week in the game.  There are rules for Population growth and characteristics; resources including livestock, mines, farms, logging, etc; Technology development, and combat.  Combat involves a series of formulas taking in as many factors as possible including number and training of troops, armor, troop types, leaders, weather, terrain, and other factors.  This results in a modified strength of each force.  When these are compared the relative strength determine losses for each side as well as the victor in the battle.&#10;&#10;The rules come in two books - Player's Manual and Realm Controller's Manual.&#10;&#10;See also the roleplaying game listing Realms of the Unknown&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is a combination of chess and checkers. It was originally published in a chess fanzine [which one?]. It is played on a normal checkerboard. The setup is identical to checkers, except for the rear 4 &quot;checkers&quot;. On the back row, in place of the four checkermen each player has two checker kings (moving and capturing as in normal American checkers), one bishop and one cook (Golomb's name for a (3,1)-leaper, more commonly known as a Camel).&#10;&#10;When a checker man gets to the back row, it can be promoted into a bishop, cook or checker king. The bishops move and capture precisely as in chess, viz., capturing by replacement. The cooks move and capture like chess knights, except that they move to the opposite corner of a 4x2 rectangle rather than a 3x2 rectangle. Thus both bishops and cooks are colorbound to the black squares. Unlike a checker piece, bishops and cooks are not allowed to keep capturing after the first capture.&#10;&#10;The object is to capture all the opponent's kings; stalemating the opponent is also a win.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sources&#10;    D.
