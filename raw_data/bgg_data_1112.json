These points can be achieved by military (pitched battles), political points (owning all the faction colors in your camp) and economical points (having three or more cards from the same faction in your camp). There is assault and raids against the adversary camp to slow down their economical engine.&#10;&#10;The game is heavily based in wargame concepts in a very light way, but historically accurate. You will see light and heavy troops, infantry, cavalry, missile troops, terrain bonuses, etc. Cores da Guerra is divided in Campaigns. Each campaign is subdivided into three phases: A preparation phase in which players buy cards in the Market, set down cards in the area called camp, use abilities, assault or raid adversary camp, etc. When all players pass in their turn, the combat phase begins. Finally there is the renovation phase.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;As long as capitalism and socialism exist, we cannot live in peace. In the end, one or the other will triumph&mdash;a funeral dirge will be sung over the Soviet Republic or over world capitalism.&rdquo; &ndash;V.I. Lenin.&#10;&#10;If the &ldquo;balloon had gone up&rdquo; in Cold War Europe during the 1980s, another of the hotter spots of that hell would have been the Hof Gap. NATO&rsquo;s US Seventh Corps and West German forces would be outnumbered by Soviet and East German forces coming from the north, as well as others from the east out of Czechoslovakia. The NATO forces, however, would be defending in terrain that was well suited for defense. A key element for Soviet success would be the quick capture of Nuremburg, where key roads intersected. If the Warsaw Pact and Soviet forces hoped to take West Germany and drive to the Rhine their forces would have to move quickly and ruthlessly through this part of southern West Germany.&#10;&#10;Each copy of Land of Confusion volume 3 is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;Two 11 by 17 hex map sheets&#10;144 un-mounted, double-sided counters&#10;10 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Units represent regiments (Soviet and Warsaw Pact) or brigades (US and West German) and battalions (Spetnatz, Airborne Infantry and Armored Cavalry). Each turn represents 8 hours of time. A hex is about 3.5 miles across.&#10;&#10;Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and resolve some game events.&#10;&#10;Land of Confusion volume 3 also includes variant rules and counters for the 4th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group and a reinforced regiment of the Soviet 106th Desant (Airborne) Division. The formations can be used with any of the three Land of Confusion games (others are volume 1 on Fulda Gap and volume 2 on Luneburg Heath).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Twilight of Divine Right: From Defenestration to Restoration is a version of the Twilight of the Sun King: Birth of the Age of Reason rules targeted at refighting large battles from the period 1618 to 1660. The rules feature scenarios for the battles of Fleurus, 1622 and Cheriton, 1644.&#10;&#10;All measurements in the game are based on a scale choosen by the players, the base width. Movement distances, weapon ranges, etc, are then multiples of whatever base width has been chosen. The base width is half of the frontage of whatever you wish to use as a unit. Therefore any size of figure and also any basing scheme can be used with the rules. Units represent between 1000 and 2000 infantry or 500 to 800 cavalry, depending on the type of unit.&#10; Battles can be fought to a conclusion in a reasonable amount of time, most in around 4 hours. Most battles are suitable for a single player a side if you wish. Using a unit frontage of 80 to 120mm means most battles are played on a table 120 to 180cm wide (4 to 6'). The system is simple and innovative. It concentrates on you being a high level commander and bringing out the characteristics of the various troop types.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Discovery is a card game in which you will retrace the major steps in the evolution of humanity.&#10;&#10;Each card represents an innovation or major breakthrough in our history. Each one builds on previous discoveries, called prerequisites, and paves the way for new discoveries.&#10;&#10;During a game, you will build together the &quot;Discovery Tree&quot; by each placing cards in turns. Discovery allows you, with a same deck of cards, to play several different types of games (from beginner level to expert). Depending on the type of game, the goal can be either to be the first to empty your hand (games with no points), or to collect the maxim number of points (you earn points each time you place a card).&#10;&#10;In all games, each player starts with 5 cards. During your turn, you can place a card in the Discovery Tree if all its prerequisites have already been placed, or if it has no prerequisite (the starting cards). Once placed, a card benefits all players who can then use it as a prerequisite to place their own cards. The game ends as soon as the stack is empty and a player empties his hand.&#10;&#10;Discovery is thus a semi-collaborative game which, like the evolutionary process, combines both collaboration and competition.&#10;&#10;The Antiquity deck can be played as a stand alone game, or as an extension of the Prehistory deck (2019 edition).&#10;&#10;Discovery is a game for adults and kids, from 6 years old, and ideal to play with the whole family. It can be played as a solitary game or with up to 9 players. Game plays range from intense and fast 15 minutes, to long strategic game (~60 minutes), depending on the type of game and the number of players.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "By July 1943, the US Navy, Army, and Marines had worked their way up the Solomons against heavy Japanese resistance. At the height of the battle for control of New Georgia, and more specifically the reduction of the powerful Japanese airbase at Munda, the US Navy established a base for Patrol Torpedo (PT) Boats on Rendova island.  The Japanese, desperately intent on clinging to their position at Munda, were operating a steady line of supplies and troops that staged out of Rabaul.  Using barges, and Destroyers of the Tokyo Express, the Japanese poured troops and supplies down &ldquo;the Slot&rdquo;, first to Vila on Kolombangara, and then on to Munda in New Georgia.  It was the PT Boats at Rendova that were tasked the dangerous mission of patrolling each night in the Blackett Strait, where they tried to disrupt this Japanese supply line. One of the young PT-Boat skippers was 26 year old Lt. John F. Kennedy of PT 109.  This solitaire play game is based on his exploits in the South Pacific during the months of July and August 1943.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As play progresses, spans of the wall fracture and collapse opening the way for troops but also triggering boobytraps.&#10;&#10;The End is nigh! Will humanity endure and prevail or will the hordes of relentless shambling dead plow the defenders into the dirt?&#10;&#10;The Wall is an exciting, unique element to this game. Players will have the opportunity to physically remove portions of the wall during play, causing parts of the opponent's play field to become vulnerable, but also potentially hurting your troops. Reveal enough of your opponent's forces to crush them on your way to victory!&#10;&#10;Beyond The Wall offers a unique experience in tabletop gaming. The game can be tailored to fit your play style and mood. Beyond the Wall can be played at the basic level with no options or,  for those seeking more complexity, additional elements can be added to enhance your experience.

    "Description": "A few months [before June 2021,] we announced that we would be discontinuing both 1968 &amp; 1987.&#10;&#10;These games were designed when I first started the company and frankly, I was in a rush to put out a catalog. Unfortunately I don't think either of these games are up to the quality I want to maintain with CSL so both will no longer be available on our catalog.&#10;&#10;If you purchased 1968 and/or 1987, I will provide you with a 20$ discount toward your next purchase.&#10;&#10;Finally, I apologize that these games ended up being broken.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;1987 is the second Procedural Combat Series game covering a hypothetical low-intensity WW3 based on the original objectives of the 1914 invasion of East Prussia, on the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union. The order of battle for both sides is drawn from records from the 80s and the tactical situation is nuanced given the absence of major NATO ground forces such as the US, France, England etc. 1987 uses the same rules as 1950 with several changes in both scale and mechanics to reflect the tactical situation.&#10;&#10;1987 includes rules for tactical nuclear strikes, refugees, political objectives airmobile units and more. Admittedly, there is little historical basis for this tactical situation given Kaliningrad came under Soviet control after WW2 and the major players in NATO were ready at moments to notice to cooperate as they were during the Balkan wars of the 90s. This situation is only possible if we assume that the major member nations of NATO have isolated themselves and are reluctant to commit.&#10;&#10;Note that this is a completely fictional account that is meant to bear no relation to history other than the forces included in the Order of Battle. It assumes that Hitler was successfully assassinated in 1943 allowing Admiral Canaris of the Abwehr to stage a defensive campaign and negotiate a truce with the western allies. As related in Bodyguard of Lies, Canaris had been working towards a rapprochement with the western allies throughout the war. The assassination of Hitler provided the Wehrmacht to activate Beck&rsquo;s plans to take over the government under Canaris&rsquo; guidance and attempt to enlist the West in a crusade against Bolshevism. While this attempt failed it did result in the immediate removal of any Germans who were in the Nazi Party. Canaris, Beck et al were violent anti-Nazis. Not that they were nice guys but they weren&rsquo;t racist, paranoid criminals.&#10;While England and the United States were happy to end the war on a status quo ante basis and turn their attention to crushing the Japanese, they were less willing to attempt to force such a result on the Germans on the Eastern Front. Stalin, facing the likelihood of the full weight of the German war machine (with the SS units rationalized, raising the quality of the entire army), sought and obtained an armistice on the lines established by the Nazi-Soviet pact.&#10;Under pressure from the United States and the Commonwealth, Canaris permitted an independent Poland which slid into the Soviet orbit due to lingering distrust over the German invasion of 1939 (Katyn&rsquo;s grisly harvest would not be discovered in this timeline.) and the return of the eastern provinces absorbed by the Soviets as a result of the Pact.&#10;An early end to the war resulted in a slowing of war technology and the development of nuclear weapons in smaller packages, suitable for tactical (artillery fired) weaponry first. Rocketry remains rudimentary, jets do dominate the skies but the equipment remained 15-20 years behind what developed in our 1987. As a result while there is a possibility of true strategic level nuclear war, the delivery of such weapons is by large jet bombers and not by ICBMs.&#10;The years leading up to 1987 had been bleak for the west. NATO had been developed as a potential counterbalance to an eastern European defensive alliance with the Soviets resulting from the fear of economic vassalage to the western powers. With the Soviets relatively impoverished due to World War II and the despair of having fought so hard with only an armistice to end things. The lack of a significant threat from the Soviet/Eastern European bloc caused the NATO powers to reconsider their commitment to the alliance, with many seeking to make their joint security pledges contingent on their own interests. This came to a head in early 1987 as Article 5 pledges were made voluntary and many parties to the alliance indicated that their choice to respond would be made on a case by case basis. The active components of NATO who would clearly respond to the call of the victim or aggression were reduced to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, aspects of US airpower and Canada.&#10;Meanwhile in the Soviet Union significant unrest grew as frustration over a permanent state of war with Germany caused continued economic sanctions (remember, no peace was signed, merely an armistice). Army morale sagged, citizens demonstrated and it seemed that the Soviet Union would come undone from internal centripetal forces. Something had to be done and the Politburo grabbed at the straw that always seemed to bring Russia together &ndash; a war. After all, they were already at war and the unwillingness of the Germans to end it was strangling the Soviet Union. The Poles would help as they wanted revenge.&#10;The goal was simple. Cause NATO a loss. Show that the Eastern bloc retained its vitality while NATO was losing its. No one wanted a full-fledged war, just enough of a spat to move from armistice to peace&hellip;&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 7/10&#10;SOLITAIRE: 9/10&#10;PLAYERS: 1-2&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, the player rolls dice to scavenge resources; these resources can then be used to construct various airships parts. The parts are selected from a menu, all have different sizes and resource requirements, and must be connected in order to function, by being drawn by the player in a grid. Players must manage their resources and fuel to create a versatile airship, as adventures have specific lift and speed requirements in order to be successfully completed.&#10;&#10;Once the last hourglass is filled in on the time track, the session is over and scores are calculated. Players can compete with others or themselves to earn the highest score, indicating airship virtuosity!&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the October 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rate of Fire is a set of platoon level WWII skirmish rules. One figure represents one man and after a couple of games a player should easily be able to command 30-40 figures on the tabletop and complete a game within a few hours. Modifiers and special rules have been kept to a minimum and the emphasis of the game is on the turn order, troop quality, morale and leadership.&#10;&#10;The rulebook covers infantry actions and the weapons and equipment associated with that. There are no vehicle rules included in this first book but they are being worked on as the first supplement.&#10;&#10;Troops will have various training levels from Green to Regular to Veteran and also variable morale, these affect what an element is able to achieve when it is activated. You`ll find that well trained and well lead troops with good morale are more than a match for poorly commanded new recruits and the rules were specifically designed with this in mind.&#10;&#10;Leaders have the ability to use their Leadership Bonus to allow subordinate units to increase their chance of passing morale and rally tests. This will allow your inspirational commanders to encourage and motivate troops, again giving a well led force a distinct advantage over one that is poorly commanded.&#10;&#10;As well as the basic rules covering everything you would expect from a WWII skirmish game there are advanced rules that cover smoke, night, weather, engineering, mines, artillery, forward observers, spotting, snipers, hidden deployment and much more.&#10;&#10;Rate of Fire includes a points system and victory objectives for those games when players simply want to be able to turn up with their troops and fight an opponent with a fairly even match up. Obviously you may also play specific scenarios that are based on historical actions, though these are unlikely to be balanced games they can provide far more variety and challenge.&#10;&#10;",

Players start the game with seven cards in hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws a card from the deck, then places cards down in sets of at least three &mdash; with a set consisting of cards with the same number, the same color, or the same pattern &mdash; or adds cards to an existing set of theirs. (For the first play, a player must lay down a set of exactly three cards with no jokers. After this, the player is free to play single cards and other sets, using jokers in sets as well.)&#10;&#10;You can replace an existing non-joker card in another player's set with one of your cards in hand as long as you use the exchanged card immediately. At the end of your turn, if you have fewer than five cards in hand, you can pick up the top card of the discard pile, then fill your hand to five from the deck.&#10;&#10;If a player has a set of five cards, which can contain at most one joker, the player calls &quot;Go5&quot;, and the round ends, with everyone scoring points for the cards in front of them and losing points for cards still in hand. If you can use the top card of the discard pile for a &quot;Go5&quot;, you can grab the card even if it's not your turn, and the round ends.&#10;&#10;Players play a number of rounds until someone passes a predetermined point threshold.&#10;&#10;",

Black cards can change the color of the top card, force players to pass all their cards in hand to the right, or do other things.&#10;&#10;When you have only one card left in hand, you must say &quot;One!&quot; and if you don't and someone else catches you, you must draw two cards.

    "Description": "Kingsfall is a true 4X campaign style board game with a heavy focus on expansion, resource management, and strategic gameplay. The game was designed for players of all skill and play types as it aims to be streamlined and straight forward. There are no excess mechanics and rules that other 4X style games seem to have, and this allows players to focus on having fun rather than reading rulebooks.&#10;&#10;Players each take control of a Guild, and must make their Guild the dominant Guild in the region by whichever means the player chooses. Each Guild has minor perks that may aid a specific play style, but all of the Guilds are on a level playing field. No one Guild is stronger than any others, so choosing your Guild can be a simple as picking your favorite color or name.&#10;&#10;Players take turns each moving their pieces around the board, building structures and collecting resources along the way. Heavily dependant on resource management, resources can be used to build more structures and units to increase a player's presence on the map and expand their borders even further. Players must be sure not to grow too quickly however, as in traditional 4X style, everything must be  taken care of. People must be fed and paid, and cities must be maintained. Grow too quickly and you won't be able to sustain your empire, grow too slowly and other players will surely beat you to the finish.&#10;&#10;With no guidelines restricting player interaction, each of the players is highly encouraged to interact with one another through diplomatic talks. Alliances, war, declaration of friendships, trade, treaties, shunning, the list goes on. Players must bear in mind however the repercussions of their choices and how they may affect other players. With multiple paths to victory, Kingsfall caters to many different play styles. It is entirely possible to win without ever going to war, and it is also possible to win by only going to war. Ultimately the path to victory is up to the player.&#10;&#10;Read the back story here&#10;&#10;",
