But they are only interested to a person who bring their favorite stuff and number (yeah because it's a game of math of course). As a cat lover, you can attract their attention with different kind of lures that you have. Just be cautious that you are not the only one who interested in adopting these cats! So, are you ready to adopt these adorable creatures...with math?&#10;&#10;The gameplay is simple. You, as a cat lover, want to adopt a cat by giving them a lure card that has a number on it. When the lure card(s) in play can be calculated equal to the number on the cat card, you deserve to adopt that adorable cat. The game ends when no lure card or no cat card can be acquired. The player who has collected the most cats wins.&#10;&#10;There's also a speed mode in which your speed of counting is tested among your peers...but be careful, you must maintain your manner if you don't want those adorable cats run off from you.&#10;&#10;",

With a short play time, tons of player options, built-in moderator, and unique role-playing mechanics, Countdown: Action Edition delivers a totally new hidden role experience.&#10;&#10;One reckless Action Hero.&#10;An out of control hostage situation.&#10;Who will you trust?&#10;&#10;In Countdown: Action Edition players become characters within a 1980&rsquo;s action flick. Villains have taken hostages and rigged the whole place to blow, but they didn&rsquo;t count on the timely arrival of the Action Hero. Thinking fast they&rsquo;ve hidden themselves among the hostages waiting to be released. There&rsquo;s not enough time to save everyone. Get the innocent hostages out while leaving the bad guys behind to fall victim to their own plots. Unfortunately for our Hero, many of the hostages also have their own plans to use this situation to their advantage.&#10;&#10;The new Countdown Deck system creates exciting tension by randomly triggering the end of the game. Since no one knows which card will be the bomb every decision is critical, and games stay fast and fun.&#10;&#10;A moderator is built directly into gamplay through the Action Hero. Making sure that everyone gets in on the fun while still keeping the game organized and flowing.&#10;&#10;Action Scene Cards make sure that every player gets an opportunity to take center stage and can redirect the movie scene with unexpected plot twists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10; Role Playing is a core part of gameplay making each game a hilarious and different experience. Watch your friends drop epic one liners and do their best 80&rsquo;s movie impressions. The amazing art from Andrew Thompson is designed to help everyone, from new role players to experienced actors, get into character.&#10;&#10;Jam packed with nostalgia and humor, Countdown: Action Edition offers many new twists on the beloved hidden role genre.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These structures have a health system that is easy to keep track of with a counting system built in.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to destroy your opponent's base while protecting your own. Any time you defeat enemy Heroes you earn specialty cards that can assist you to victory. These cards include damage boosters for single attacks, respawn delays to assign to your opponent's hero, and much more.&#10;&#10;Battling structures is simple, choose your Hero, flip upside down and spin the spinner. Reference your Hero Cards to add a value or action to your spin's outcome. If it's an attack, subtract that amount to the structure's health. Deplete all health on a tower and it is removed from play giving you a clear path to the base. When attacking an enemy Hero, flip both Heroes over and spin. Higher number wins without elemental influence.&#10;&#10;Strategically maneuver your way into your opponent's base area and destroy their base. Upon doing so, claim the title of the ATK! Champion.

You are the only thing stopping a predator from an all you can eat baby buffet.&#10;Most games require a high score to win - not this game.  In PreyCare, you reduce your score by matching up cards in the same column.  The lower your score, the less blood you&rsquo;ll have on your hands.  Be careful though, matching up cards activate special abilities that may not be what you were hoping for!&#10;&#10;The game is simple.  You have to match cards in the same column.  Failure to match up the cards means you have screwed up and your baby creature gets mauled.  Most games require you to have the highest score in order to win.  Not this game though.  Each point above zero is blood on your hands.  The player with the lowest score by the end of the game is the &ldquo;winner&rdquo;.  Reducing your score is simple: whenever you match two cards in the same column, their numbers cancel each other out and their value becomes zero.  If you don&rsquo;t match a column up, well we have bad news for you.  You gotta add the numbers together &ndash; it&rsquo;s basically a kill count, you failure.  Add up all columns together, and the player with the least amount of carcasses is as close to a winner as they come &ndash; considering the fact that you&rsquo;re dealing with adorably dead animals.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You play as ghosts possessing a group of kids in a cabin in the woods, trying to figure out how you died by piecing together your fragmented memories.&#10;&#10;Play is started by shuffling the 26 double-sided word fragment cards (Fewer cards can be used for a faster game). Each player is dealt one card (they can flip the card to the other side at any time). One card is placed in the middle of the table. Any player may start play. The first player places the card from their hand onto the tableau so that it forms a word using one or more letters from the card already in the tableau. The player may put the card on top of the card already on the table, or slide the card underneath, as long as the card on the table is not shuffled around. When the first player has formed a word, they draw a word fragment card from the pile and point to another player. The player pointed to must start to tell the story of the death of the ghosts from the ghosts&rsquo; point of view, incorporating the word that was just made. For example, if the first player formed the word &ldquo;angst,&rdquo; the player they pointed to could say: &ldquo;The last thing I remember is a feeling of angst as I slumped through the halls.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Any player may go next by adding their card to the growing tableau to make a new word and pointing to a player to continue the story (as long as a player does not make a word twice in a row). Play continues until all the cards in the deck and players' hands are gone. The last person to make a word points to the player who will bring the story to a satisfactory close in which &quot;Everyone dies!&quot;&#10;&#10;The inspiration behind the game is &quot;anyone can be a storyteller!&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Voter Beware&quot; (Subrog&#196;&#129;tor Cave, in Latin) is a political dice  rolling game about Food Truck politics. Bernie Salad, Hilaire, Gervais Juanson, and  Donny Sausage all wish to become President of the Food Truck Association, the political position which controls all of the menus on local food trucks. In this game, one to four players will take turns rolling four dice and assigning them to each candidate, who in turn will utilize the die assigned them based on its value.&#10;&#10;Possible actions include buying influence, buying votes, enhancing your influence with a funding PAC, or delivering a nasty Dirty Trick to an opponent's campaign, lowering their stature with PACs and potentially hurting their ability to compete. At the end of each turn, a Scandal may erupt which damages a candidate's reputation with the voting blocs that they buy votes from.&#10;&#10;This is a unique, one to four-player political game that takes between 20-40 minutes  to play, and with simple-to-understand rules but truly difficult decisions each turn, it's perfect for a coffee shop or lunch hour either by yourself or with friends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stau-Mau Mau is a family game from the 'Haba Reisspeile' collection.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Uno.  You get to a number of different car tokens in different colors.  On the central gameboard you need to put down your tokens and get rid of all of them.  You can put a vehicle after a vehicle of the same color or the same shape.  As you lay out your pieces you create a big traffic jam across the board.  Some cars have no special function others make the next player to skip a turn, give the player an extra turn or makes the next player take more tokens.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get rid of all your tokens, when you have one token left, you need to shout something or you need to take a new token from the reserve.&#10;&#10;The game is played totally on magnetic surfaces which is nice.  The players get their magnetic tokens on parking lot cards in their hands to keep them secret.  The board is laid out in the tin lid thus making it magnetic itself.  This makes it perfect to play everywhere.&#10;&#10;There are 32 car tokens, 3 parking lots and one main board in the box.&#10;&#10;",

He comes into the game fully build.&#10;&#10;Players using their normal action can send maximum of 1 hoplite from any region (this rules will be different for 2 players) under Atlas. They stay there until all 6 slots will be covered (building monuments have no effect on them). Once 6 slots are fully covered, all players sacrifice hoplites to Atlas and in return he steals Golden Apples from Garden of the Hesperides.&#10;&#10;Each player will get as many Golden apple tokens as many hoplites he had under monument.&#10;&#10;Golden apples can be &quot;consumed&quot; at any time of the game and will have various effects: From healing hero wounds, saving hoplite's, adding strength to battle to more powerful effects if you will choose to consume more then one apple. &#10;Reminder - Atlas Overload rules&#10;&#10;This expansion will negate winning condition, that the game ends once any monuments gets fully build.&#10;&#10;You will place Atlas miniature next to a Board with Atlas Overload board and place &quot;weight&quot; token on 0 on the track. Whenever a new temple / part of monument or monster will appear on the Board - you will be adding weight on Atlas shoulder.&#10;&#10;Once weight token will reach 12, Atlas systems shut-down and his crisis procedures are starting. From now on at the end of every players turn, you will decrease the weight value by 1. Once it will reach 0 - Atlas systems shut down completely and world falls apart. All players loose the game.&#10;&#10;But you can help Atlas carry his weight! You will put &quot;Aid to Atlas&quot; quest token in one of the regions. Players can delegate their heroes to help atlas - if they will, they are removing their hero out of the board for the rest of the game, but increase the weight track by the value of their strength (so &quot;add turns&quot;).&#10;&#10;This expansion will change a little bit dynamics of the game and create a ticking &quot;clock&quot; that will count the time before the inevitable end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played on a Chess board, with a set of dice instead of pawns, and a poppel for the King. A player may move one of their dice pieces according to the number showing on the top face of the die. As the player moves the die, it is rotated in the direction moved - move one space left, the die rotates leftward - move one space forward, the die turns one side forward. In this way, the number showing is changed when the die ends its movement, and this new number dictates where it might move to next.&#10;&#10;Dice pieces are captured by being landed upon. The first player to either take their opponent&rsquo;s King or have their own King move to the top corner wins the game.&#10;&#10;Once you get familiar with the game, you can add extra rules, such as &ldquo;a player can only remove an opponent&rsquo;s die if both dice have matching numbers&quot;.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#183;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#160;&#173;&#232;&#132;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#187;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#133;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#191;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#136;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A new set for the classic trick-taking game Wizard, now playable by only two players. This deck includes 36 cards and some new rules.&#10;&#10;3 cards are set aside at the beginning, and one of them is turned up to establish the current trump. The remaining cards are divided in 3 groups of 11 cards; each player takes one, and the remaining one forms the dummy deck. Three cards are turned face up from the dummy deck.&#10;&#10;Players bid on how many tricks they think they will take in the coming hand. Next the first player plays a card from their hand, then a card from the dummy's hand, and then the second player plays a card. The trick goes to the first player who played a Wizard, or by the player who played the highest trump, or to the player who played the highest lead card. Jesters always lose. The dummy player may win a trick, and in fact its role is to help the first player winn or lose a trick as needed.  The player who won the round becomes the first player and starts the next round.&#10;&#10;When players run out of cards, they check their bids and score. You score for making your bid exactly, and lose points if you did not make your bid.&#10;This version also has a special card that cancels the trick in which it is played - no one scores that trick.&#10;&#10;First player to score 100 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Julia, Paul, and their friends have hidden bones in the garden for seven little naughty dogs to play and find them. Will you be able to remember where they are and recover as many bones as you can?&#10;&#10;The goal in Naughty Dogs is to explore the garden and gather the most bones buried in it. But watch out, because sometimes you will find trash buried in the garden a long time ago. Bones score Victory Points... but the trash takes away Victory points!&#10;&#10;In turns, each player must Explore or Dig. When you explore, you choose an unoccupied Garden tile and look at its hidden side, making sure no one else can see it. If you want, you can take one of the dogs and place it on the tile so it goes sniffing around that part of the garden.&#10;&#10;If you choose to dig, you take a tile with a sniffing dog from the centre of the table and place them in front of you. That tile is now yours and the rest of the players can't place dogs on it,&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has 5 Garden tiles. Then, everyone turns over their tiles and score a victory point for every bone, but takes away a point for every tile with trash. The player with most Victory points is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simplified P-n-P board game with small play tiles with a design of play for younger players to help with matching four types of birds in a garden, counting colours (flower beds), counting scores along a score track, taking turns and taking tiles from a cup or bag.  The game can also be played by older players as well, as there are Advanced Optional Rules included &ndash; the game can actually get quite tactical for older players. The game is designed for 2 players but can be played with 4 in pairs.&#10;&#10;The correct placing of the bird types and the 'wild tile' fish pond tiles scores points which are recorded on the included score track and the winner has the highest score at the end of the game.  There is also some final end-game scoring of only the coloured background tiles of the birds that have been placed within each players own columns of garden squares.  Bonus points can also be scored by correctly placing the 'wild tile' fish ponds in a player's garden column.&#10;&#10;This P-n-P home-made test version includes the game-board (that represents a garden of squares and a score track), a counter-mix and a set of game rules for use by families with younger (and older) gamers at BGG to try out.  It should only take about 15-30 mins to play a game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rome is going to hell. Redneck barbarians are raiding the borders, the economy is in freefall, and the sewer workers are on strike...again. To top it all, mercenaries and slaves have delusions of grandeur (they want to be paid, for Jupiter's sake!), while those petty pencil pushers at the Senate indulge in never-ending rhetoric displays. As a wealthy patrician, you're pretty sure it is expected that you lend your help to Rome in this dire time of need, but then again will your &quot;friends&quot; do the same? The Ides of March are around the corner...'&#10;&#10;Vae Victis is a semi-competitive game of decline and treachery for 1 to 6 Roman patricians. The phrase &quot;Vae Victis&quot; &mdash; Latin for &quot;woe to the vanquished&quot; or &quot;woe to the conquered&quot; &mdash; suggests that those defeated in battle are entirely at the mercy of their conquerors and should neither expect nor request leniency. Keep that spirit in mind when playing this game. Players take turns alternatively, and on their turn, they must go through three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Doom phase: The player rolls the three doom dice, eliminates one of them, then applies the result of the remaining two dice.&#10;     Support phase: The player can take up to two actions in any combination in the action spots LIMITES, AERARIUM, or DOMUS PALATINA, possibly pushing their luck!&#10;     Influence phase: The player can take up to two actions in any combination in the action spots THERMAE, FORUM, or CURIA.&#10;&#10;&#10;After this, play passes to the next player. Play continues until a winning condition is met, with the conditions being as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    All players lose if one of the wars is lost or one of the tracks reaches the final space. No player can decide to lose a war or make a track reach its final space if they can avoid it &mdash; unless they are the traitor (see below).&#10;    A player loses at the end of any turn if they've run out of coins.&#10;    A player wins at the end of their turn if they simultaneously fulfill the requirement of their goal card &quot;SENATE&quot; and their goal card &quot;WAR&quot;.&#10;    A player wins at the end of any turn if all other players have lost.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note that any player can be a traitor to Rome, and they win if a condition is met that results in all players losing the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Early Years of the Jihad&#10;&#10;November 3067 saw the culmination of work two centuries in the making, work begun by Primus Conrad Toyama of ComStar, successor to Jerome Blake and the man responsible for single-handedly turning ComStar into a pseudo-religious organization with a vision: to lead mankind to the light...by any means necessary.&#10;When the Star League self-destructs, a shadowy power behind the fanatical Word of Blake pulls the strings taut in righteous anger, launching a war to bring humanity to its knees. Confusion reigns, and each faction finds itself isolated amid its own turmoil. Yet as a new decade dawns, glimpses of the greater whole begin to appear through the dark clouds. The true battle has only just begun.&#10;&#10;Blake Ascending: A Jihad Compilation is an omnibus reprint of Dawn of the Jihad and Jihad Hot Spots: 3070; the first two sourcebooks in the seminal Jihad plot line. The Blake Ascending sourcebook shakes the Classic BattleTech universe to its foundation, documenting the opening years from 3067 to 3070. The series of events presented in this book unfold in a rolling format, allowing readers to immerse themselves more directly into the action than ever before. Players of both Classic BattleTech and Classic BattleTech RPG will find framework rules to run any type of campaign in regions through out the Inner Sphere during this chaotic time.&#10;&#10;Notes:&#10;&#10;Blake Ascending is a reprint of Dawn of the Jihad and Jihad Hot Spots: 3070, in one volume. Except for errata, no changes have been made to the contents.&#10;Editors: whenever you cite Blake Ascending in an article, please also cite the relevant pages from the other two books. In Blake Ascending, the first 160 pages match those of Dawn of the Jihad exactly (ex: BA p. 137 is the same as DotJ p. 137). All pages after p. 160 correspond with Jihad Hot Spots: 3070, when 160 is subtracted from the BA page number (ex: BA p. 200 is the same as JH:3070 p. 40). The reprinted JH:3070 table of contents is on pp. 162-163 in BA.&#10;&#10;",

Within the all-consuming darkness of the sea, each player begins life as a single-celled organism and must go through evolutionary progressions to become the most complex life form. Evolve is a competitive game that involves aspects of hand management, tactical decision making and a take-that style of sabotage.&#10;&#10;In the game, players need to establish evolutionary links to their current life form, before being able to progress to the subsequent level of organism. Many organisms and evolutionary links have additional bonuses or dual uses, so players are often required to make decisions about when to play cards, or when to keep them in hand. Additionally, &lsquo;adaptation&rsquo; cards can also be used to increase the development of your organism, or to hinder players.&#10;&#10;During each turn, players perform 6 moves, where they can choose to pick-up, discard or play cards (each action costs 1 move). Evolve gameplay is intuitive yet simple (this is a family-friendly game), while also allowing for various strategies and play styles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Then the 2nd player places one into any slit he likes and so on. If there is a square with 3 walls the player whose turn it is to play, must shut it by placing the 4th wall. If the square which he has shut, has no number, the next player continues to play. Otherwise the same player has another turn. In shutting one square the respective player puts one of his rings into it. The squares without number count 1, those with a number count as many points as are indicated by the number.&#10;&#10;When all squares are shut, the points are counted and the player who has the most, is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Grab your favorite DC set and instead of using the Super Heroes and Super-Villains from that set, use the ones from this pack instead!&#10;&#10;DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Crossover Pack 7 &ndash; New Gods features a full set of new playable characters: Orion, Mister Miracle, Big Barda, Kalibak, Granny Goodness, and Darkseid. Instead of the usual Super-Villain stack, you use two stacks of Homeworld cards. Each Homeworld has a special ability that all players can take advantage of, as many of the New Gods have spent time on both sides of the conflict between New Genesis and Apokolips. If you are Darkseid, you seek to conquer New Genesis...but so do your fellow super-villain players. The superheroes, conversely, compete to conquer Apokolips. When either Level 3 Homeworld is conquered, that ends the game and the player with the most VPs wins!&#10;&#10;All of the hero and villain cards in this set feature a new keyword: Protector. By simply revealing a Protector from your hand, you may be able to thwart an invasion of your Homeworld.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Corner rooms have a slightly different mechanic, and the end game is a sort-of Choose-you-own-adventure storyline. You win by visiting all Corner Rooms and then returning to the center of the map.

The game is played on two maps of Petrograd showing historically precise locations of stationed regiments, officer schools, bridges, important buildings and the Winter Palace itself. The player will take control of soldiers, Baltic Fleet sailors and Red Guards attempting to overcome the government forces consisting of Junkers, cossacks and Shock infantry.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, the player prepares the coup organizing Red Guards, agitates garrisoned regiments, gathers revolutionary forces to prevent the government from bringing more troops into Petrograd and arresting the player. The revolutionary patrols seize crucial points in Petrograd, like train stations, communication centres and power plants, facing opposition from the government that tries to uphold the control of the city. The conflict escalates with the revolutionary forces encircling the Winter Palace and finally assaulting and seizing it during the dark October night. &#10;The game includes 58 historical events, played in variable chronology, and with 60 minutes of playtime offers excellent replayability. Will the Provisional Government be able to retain the control of Petrograd or will the shot from Aurora usher in a new era in the history of Russia?&#10;&#10;",

Dare you enter?&#10;&#10;Based on the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, Knossus is set in the ancient time, where 7 youths have been sent by the City of Athens, to be sacrificed to the minotaur in the labyrinth of King Minos.&#10;&#10;It is designed to be a gateway game suitable for a family to play or as light relief between more heavyweight games. Gameplay style varies with the group - from fast and furious, action packed charging around the labyrinth, to tactical chess-like experience where strategic players face off in a game played several moves ahead.&#10;&#10;The game plays by drawing 4 cards - you must choose two to control your hero, and two to control the Minotaur. They may be played in any order, and augmented by receiving the blessing of the gods from various shrines found in the labyrinth. There are also items to help you in your quest but you may only carry one at a time.&#10;&#10;Balancing luck with strategy, Knossus is designed to engage the group for the whole 30 minutes - even eliminated players are still able to control the minotaur for that last sweet act of revenge. And there's nothing so satisfying as sending the monster charging into your rivals, slaying them, only to end his run on the point of your sword, winning you the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One joker should be marked 'high' and the other joker 'low'.&#10;&#10;In the first round, one card is dealt to each of the four players. In the next round, two cards are dealt to each player, then three, four, etc. all the way up to 13 cards. Then 13 cards are dealt again and you make your way back down to 1.&#10;&#10;In each round, remaining cards are set to the side and the topmost card is turned over to reveal the trump suit. After the trump is set, players look at their hand and bid on how many tricks they think they can take. Bidding continues around the table in a clockwise direction until all players have bid. If a player thinks they can take all the tricks, they can board which is worth 13 points. The next player can double-board if they wish, which would be worth 24 points.&#10;&#10;Player with the highest bid leads the first trick. All other players must follow suit if possible, or play a trump if unable to follow suit. The highest card, or highest trump cards, wins the trick. The player who won the trick leads the next card and play continues around the table until all players are out of cards.&#10;&#10;If you meet your bid, you score three points for each trick bid and taken, plus one point for tricks greater than the bid. If the bid isn't met, it's minus one point for each trick missed. If a player boards and makes it, they score 13 points. If they board and don't get all the tricks, they get -13 points.&#10;&#10;At the end of 26 hands, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Gal&aacute;pagos is a board game in which players take on the role of ecological activists whose mission is to rescue animals whose lives are threatened by irresponsible human activity. In order to rescue animals at risk, players must make the best possible use of their resources, which are represented by action dice and helper tokens.&#10;&#10;The game lasts exactly twelve rounds, each of which is divided into five phases in this order:&#10;&#10;Phase A) Threat&#10;Phase B) Throwing the dice&#10;Phase C) Player actions&#10;Phase D) Resolving actions&#10;Phase E) Preparing the next round&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player can perform all the actions that their action dice and helper tokens allow. Through the use of both kinds of actions, players attempt to rescue animals at risk and to fight against environmental threats. At the end of the game, whoever has collected the highest number of rescue points will be declared chief rescuer and win.&#10;&#10;The future of the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands is in our hands: To work, rescuers!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Barkolana is the official game of the Barcolana, the most populous sailing regatta in the world.&#10;The winner is the first one to arrive, sailing in his boat a course full of unexpected marine trial, which,if passed, will make him gain money (called &quot;bori&quot;, from the name of the wind of the city &quot;bora&quot;). At the end of his turn, the player can use the money to buy in the &quot;bottega velica&quot; (a sailor's shop) some items to make his boat stronger, like new sails, gps, bottle of wine to stop other players, and even cannons to shoot them or forbidden fan or engine (he must pay attention to the sea police).&#10;Also, in each turn the wind will change, affecting the speed of the sailing boats.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Il gioco &egrave; molto semplice: chi arriva per primo alla casella finale del tabellone, vince la Barkolana. L&rsquo;avanzamento delle pedine &egrave; regolato dal lancio di dado e, a seconda della casella in cui si capita, bisogner&agrave; eseguire un compito specifico, tenendo conto del vento a favore stabilito all&rsquo;inizio del turno e valido per tutti i giocatori. Il giocatore che &egrave; di mano dovr&agrave; prendere un boro (moneta triestina), utile per acquistare gli strafanici (optional di potenziamento della barca) presso la Bottega velica.&#10;L&rsquo;aspetto divertente &egrave; che per raggiungere il traguardo i velisti avranno a disposizione mezzi non sempre regolamentari: il ventilatore, un motore o i cannoni ad esempio; se avrete la sfortuna di incappare nella Guardia Costiera, dovrete pagarne il prezzo subendo le relative penalit&agrave;.&#10;Inoltre in mare dovrete sapervi destreggiare di fronte a mille difficolt&agrave;: saper recitare una filastrocca in apnea ad esempio, scommettere o mantenere il silenzio radio.&#10;Un&rsquo;ottima occasione per cimentarsi con un gioco dell&rsquo;oca molto originale ed imparare qualcosa di nuovo sulle regate veliche, da provare!&#10;&#10;Nerdando.com&#10;&#10;",
