All the while, you must keep up your food and army numbers as you try and control as many towns/strongholds as you can, depending on the difficulty you choose.&#10;&#10;As you draw cards, you encounter enemies or towns and have to roll a die to determine your attack power.  As you push on with attacks, your army dwindles, but do not despair.  You gain more recruits through the towns and strongholds you conquer.&#10;&#10;As you draw cards to move across the countryside, your army uses up your precious food, which you gain back through hunting or conquering towns to supply your army.&#10;&#10;It's a long and hard journey to capture all seven towns and strongholds, but with some perseverance your Viking army can come out on top.&#10;&#10;",

The once pisturesque ancient village on the Adriatic coast has been reduce to rubble. Canadian and German troops clash daily, in bitter, house-to-house fighting.

Players do this by taking turns drawing cards and collecting weapons, defensive cards, action cards, or encounters which allow player to form groups. Groups can be done for mutual benefit or to attack and remove players. Actions will allow players to escape groups and/or attack. Game play is very fast as players start with no cards and take turns drawing one card from the deck. The game is suitable for 2 players, but gets better with 4 or more.&#10;&#10;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/the-experiment&#10;&#10;",

One at a time each player passes a single card to his or her right.  The player receiving the card immediately checks to determine if the new card creates a pair with any cards currently held in their hand.  If a pair has made, the pair is laid out on the playing surface, face up, for all the other players to see.  The player who received the card, whether or not they successfully made and laid a pair, chooses a card from his or her hand and passes it to the player to the right. The receiving player, e.g., the player to the right, follows the same procedure for either making or failing to make a pair, and then play continues, again to the right.  The first player to have reduced their hand to zero cards, e.g., a nil hand, by playing out their final two cards in a successful pair is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Developed by two physician/gamers, Francis Kong and Arun Mathews, The Healing Blade plunges the player into a world of sorcery and creatures, where real world knowledge of infectious diseases and therapeutics play a pivotal role in the winning strategy.&#10;&#10;Choose one of two sides: &#10;&#10;     The Apothecaries, Champions of the Healing Blade whose namesakes hearken from real world antibiotics&#10;     The Lords of Pestilence, Creatures of Disease and manifestations of actual bacterial agents.&#10;&#10;&#10;As you and your opponent seek domination through corruption and conquest, you must vie not only with brute force, but also with planning, strategy, and most importantly, an astute understanding of microbiology and medical therapeutics. Healing Blade gives you the unparalleled opportunity to enter a fantasy realm where the rules of combat deeply and accurately reflect the real world's battles against infectious disease.

The new game uses the same characters but the gameplay is now asymmetrical, attackers can gain resistance or unlock powerful mutants, and in general the game plays very differently.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Old King Cole done by both McLoughlin Bros in 1888 and Parker Brothers in 1890. This is a card game in which the cards are divided into 2 suits by means of the number in the corner, those with red numbers forming 1 suit and those with blue numbers forming the second suit. After being shuffled 5 cards are dealt to each player. The reminder of the deck is left face down in the middle of the table. Each player plays a card in turn, the one playing the highest card of the suit lead takes the trick. Each player then takes a card from the deck and adds it to the cards already in his/her hand. The winner of the trick leads the next card. Play continues this way with players taking additional cards after every trick played. After all cards from the deck have been taken play continues with all of the remaing cards until they are all played.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get sets of cards, such as 3 or 4 Old King Cole Cards of the same suit. Anytime a player has in his hand any of the sets he announces it and can then count it toward his final score. The scoring groups are Any 4 cards consisting of the 4 different cards grouped with (an Old King Cole card, a King Cole Pipe Card, King Cole Bowl Card and Fiddler Card), any 4 OLD KING COLE cards, any 3 OLD KING COLE cards of the same suit. Each grouping of cards score differing amounts of points. Highest total points at the end of the game wins. Info from AGCA Archives.&#10;&#10;",

Matchplay was inspired by a centuries old Scottish golf competition that paired players in a challenge match where each hole contested was worth up to one point. In keeping with the time honored Scottish tradition Matchplay is designed to recreate that competitive format by offering non-stop strategic decision making opportunities.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a traditional tabletop card game or as an online game. The online option allows players to choose from three different opponent options.&#10;&#10;MatchPlay is simply about winning more holes than your opponent. Players compete for the lowest score on each hole. If a player records a lower hole-score than their opponent they receive a one point advantage. If both players record the same score, they tie the hole and neither player receives a point. Players use any scorecard for an 18-Holes match, contest 3- Holes per deal, and try to outpoint their opponent.&#10;&#10;",

Playing time is from 45 minutes up to 2 hours depending on the number of players and playing experience.&#10;&#10;Evolution Earth is a dynamic board game of strategy, tactics and probability. It is a game of area control, card and resource management.&#10;&#10;The game is very dynamic and always full of surprises and no two games are alike. You will need your tactical skills and learn what to play and when to play and where to play. You will also mastermind deeper strategic plans in order to dominate a superiority in many aspects of Animal Kingdom or just simply trying to conquer continents for your species.&#10;&#10;You, as the player of your precious species, will try to profit from forces of nature for the benefit for your species and try to protect your species from natural disasters. Create the best possible life strategy for your species as they compete against other players&acute; species. Use your species&acute; cooperative skills and choose the best competitive strategy against your opponents species that try to survive as well. Conquer the land and conquer the seas. Control your natural resources and rule the elements. Harness the primeval forces of nature for your victory. The prosperity of your species rests on your hands.&#10;&#10;Evolution Earth&acute;s rules: The laws of nature are an uncompromising and absolute and merciless as Mother Nature is. Only the most adaptive, cooperative, competitive and most fit can survive in a world of a persistent struggle for reproduction, nutrition and living space. For those species that can not adapt and survive must die out and become extinct and give way to a new species that are more adapted to new conditions in an ever changing Earth and try to survive and thrive and speciate and expand to conquer new territories in a land and sea.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, a 1 000 000 000 years ago, the Earth is more or less still an ocean planet. Ice Age has ended long time ago and snowball Earth has melted into a great planet of temperate ocean. Only a few protocontinents or cratons have become to exist over the endless surface of the vast ocean as a predicting sign for the upcoming continents, that will one day thrive with a different kind of life forms. Primordial plant life has already radiated, expanded from oceans into protocontinents and animal kingdom will soon expand their living space into a protocontinents niche too.&#10;&#10;The animal kingdom still consists only a single-celled organisms that will soon burst into a multitude of populations of many kinds of multicellular first animals expanding their living space from the depths of ocean floor into all over the vast seas and harboring protocontinents: The Cambrian critters. These numerous types of animals will also victoriously, as a reward and prize for surviving and succeeding, evolve in time into the very first fishes, insects, reptiles, dinosaurs, mammals and birds.&#10;&#10;The face of the Earth will change numerous times during millions of years. Protocontinents rise into a great full continents from the depths of the ocean. These large masses of land move and drift apart and reunite again. Volcanic eruptions, pandemic diseases spreading from populations to populations, climate changes, ice ages and asteroid impacts will afflict all life from time to time. Will your species survive and dominate the Earth or will they will they die out and become extinct fossils?&#10;&#10;The great contest of survival is beginning. Are you ready to conquer the Earth?&#10;&#10;This description is an edit from the rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Midgard is a two player abstract strategy game of area enclosure and dominance. Players take on the role of Odin and his brothers in creating Midgard, the homeland of humanity from the remains of the vanquished ice giant Ymir. One player-god creates the seas and other the land masses.&#10;&#10;The board is composed of 124 equilateral triangles; a 10 x 10 regular grid with 24 additional triangles attached to the middle eight cells along each of its edges.&#10;&#10;Player turns alternate starting with the sea player. Each turn, players must place one of their tiles on an empty ice cell which may not share an edge with any other occupied cell and it may not be the center cell. The newly occupied cell is terraformed into a sea or land cell and influences the transformation of its adjacent cells. These adjacent cells are referred to as blizzard cells because what they will become is unclear. Later, sea and land tiles are also placed when regions of blizzard cells are completely enclosed. The blizzard cells are assigned to and terraformed by the player who exerts the most influence on the enclosed regions. A player&rsquo;s influence is determined by counting owned edges around the enclosed region. In the case of a tie, half the cells are filled with sea tiles and the other half by land tiles. The gods have decreed that this will always be possible when a tie occurs!&#10;&#10;When the board is completely terraformed or a player has no more tiles in hand, the player with the most tiles on the board wins the game.  If the players tie for most tiles, the player occupying the most perimeter cells wins.&#10;&#10;Detailed rules, a Flash MX implementation and a print-and-play sheet can be found in the File section.&#10;&#10;Have fun.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A two-player themed 'abstract' in which players race to get as much food off the table as possible.  The ants with the most valuable food win!&#10;&#10;Wherever there is food, there are bugs!  Help a pair of ants race to get food off the picnic table before the wind, the rain, a psycho kid with a magnifying glass and other bugs (among other events) destroy the food.&#10;&#10;Quick overview of rules:&#10;Each player takes a turn to roll two eight sided dice.  The resulting values are used to move a pair of ants orthogonally across an 8 x 8 board representing a picnic table cloth.  If a player rolls and 8 and a 5 he/she may move one ant up to 8 spaces and the other up to 5.  If the ants land on matching food tokens, these tokens are removed from the board and placed in front of the player.  The value of the tokens depends on which coloured squares they are removed from:&#10;Pink + white or red = 1 point per token&#10;Pink + pink = 2 points per token&#10;White + red = 2 points per token&#10;White + white = 3 points per token&#10;Red + red = 3 points per token&#10;&#10;However, there are restrictions to movement.  A pop can or an ant blocks passage and cutlery, paper towels and gum slow down movement across the board.&#10;Event cards are drawn at specified points in the game.  These event cards can further hinder movement, destroy food, or reduce its value.&#10;The number of event cards used determines the length of the game.&#10;There are three versions of the game:&#10;1) The regular game&#10;2) A kids version&#10;3) An advanced version&#10;The ants who have collected the highest valued food at the end of the game are the winners!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User Summary:&#10;&#10;A fan-made version of the Japanese card game &quot;Neu&quot;, a fast and simple multiplayer card-game with quite some similarities to Uno.&#10;&#10;In Cirno's Math Game (&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160; &#239;&#189;&#158;&#229;&#164;&#143;&#228;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#191;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#239;&#189;&#158;), players have a hand of three cards numbered from 1 to 9. They play these cards in turn, refilling their hand as they play. Each card adds to the total sum. The player who plays a card that makes the sum exceed 12 (Cirno can't count to more than twelve) loses and gets a loss point. The game ends when someone has three loss points.&#10;&#10;Apart from the numbered cards, there are the &quot;divide by 2&quot; card, the &quot;multiply by 2&quot; card, and then there are the special cards &quot;Turn&quot; (reverse play order), &quot;Pass&quot; (play passes to the next player), &quot;Shot&quot; (choose a player, it's now his turn) and &quot;Double&quot; (next player has to play two cards). The special cards you draw when you lose a round can also be used as special cards. Also, the card with a 9 in a circle makes the total a nine - always. Whenever a 9 is involved, Cirno will full of self-confidence reply &quot;nine&quot;.&#10;&#10;This game is based on the flash animation &quot;Cirno's Perfect Math Classroom&quot; in which the character Cirno tries to learn math by adding and subtracting. The flash animation is in turn based on an internet meme regarding one of the boss characters from the video game &quot;Embodiment of Scarlet Devil&quot;, a home made shooting game for Windows. A note in the manual caused the fan base to declare Cirno being a total dimwit, closely associated with the number 9, mostly depicted in a circle.&#10;&#10;Translated box back:&#10;Cirno's Math Game ~ let's study with your friends&#10;is a game where Cirno studies math (mostly addition) with her friends because she one day thought that&#10;I'm not stupid! I know! Math is clever!&#10;&#10;The rules are simple. Each turn, play a card, draw a card. The card's number is added to the sum total, and the player who plays a card which causes the total to exceed Cirno's comprehension span (12), is out. The lesson is redone many times, and the most competent player becomes THE PERFECT CIRNO.&#10;&#10;When you are out, you get a &quot;friend&quot; card. The friend cards can be used to change hands, make Cirno be able to count to 20 and so on. Perhaps they can help you turn the tables?&#10;&#10;With simple rules and a quick tempo, this is a card game with the power enough to improve your brain somewhat, playable for all people, from those already married to Cirno, to those who barely know what project Shrine Maiden is.&#10;&#10;For 2-6 players&#10;Playtime: 5-15 minutes&#10;Recommended age: Older than a fairy&#10;&#10;",

The idea is, at the end of your turn, to have your pawns standing next to a set of three numbers of the board that make up either 10 or 12, depending on which ones you still need. You can then mark off one of the five sums on your scoring track on the board. It of course makes sense to first calculate which pawn to move before choosing one or, in case of none of them achieving a required result, which one would at least put you in the best position for the next turn.&#10;&#10;First player to achieve all five results wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the Fantasy Flight Games event center, they held an event titled &quot;The Realms of Terrinoth Event&quot; which was a collection of gaming events for Descent, Runebound, and Runewars.&#10; As a promo item handed out to attendees, they received this 24-page booklet which is a Scenario Guide promo for Descent and Runewars.&#10;&#10;Inside are three scenarios for Descent and one for Runewars.&#10;&#10;Descent Scenarios :&#10;&#10;&#10;    1 : Snitty State of the Invincible Overlords&#10;&#10;&#10;This quest pits one overlord against another -- Red versus Blue -- in a low stakes battle of dungeon mastery. Requires only the base game of Descent Journeys in the Dark to play.&#10;&#10;This is a double-overlord race game between two players, or two teams of players. Each side takes a turn being overlord over the opposing side, trying to do their best to make sure their heroes reach the inner guildhall sanctum first.&#10;&#10;&#10;    2 : The Dark Grove&#10;&#10;&#10;This is a standard scenario, like all others. This quest uses the outdoor map tiles, therefore the base game of Descent Journeys in the Dark and Road to Legend are required.&#10;&#10;&#10;    3 : A Knight's Tale&#10;&#10;&#10;This quest involves two teams of heroes attempting to outdo one another by taking the most gold and treasure from the Ice Wyrm's lair. This quest requires both Descent Journeys in the Dark and Tomb of Ice to play.&#10;&#10;Two teams of two players each, form up as a Knight and a Squire. The Overlord can kill the squire of each team multiple times, but if ever the Knight goes down, it's game over. It's a race to stay alive and bank more treasure than your opposing team.&#10;&#10;Runewars Scenario :&#10;&#10;&#10;    1 : Battle of the Ru Steppes&#10;&#10;&#10;This is a preset Runewars map for 4 players following normal play rules involving Dragon Rune conquest.&#10;&#10;",

The influence line represents exactly that: the degree of confidence that the Emperor has in his subject. Therefore, the player who makes the best use of the changing order of Influence action cards and Districts cards, and the special privileges granted Roles action cards will have the greatest success and win the game.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to finish the game, but always when all players have played the eighth inning, there is a final tally of points. The winner is the player with the most victory points at the end of the game. Victory points are calculated by adding the costs of the districts he put into play more guilders of his treasure.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the designer website:&#10;&quot;Tee Skoori&quot; is a basketball simulation that lasts about 30 minutes. For playing you use two dice for deciding an attack. Throwing one dice you decide if you go below the basket, or the player may run after one pass into the fast attack. Also you have many chances to get the long distance throw. For very lucky shots you can earn extra free throws as well. Using these two dice you decide the success of the free throws and fast attacks. Attack cards can be used to avoid ball loss and the get more chances to get a score.&#10;&#10;For the game play changing the players have attack and defense cards. Defense cards help to defend against opponent attacks and force the ball lost. Attack cards can be used to avid ball loss and the get more changes to get a score.&#10;&#10;Like in real life, when one teams dominates over another, it can happen here as well. You can get the rush after the right moment and can gain a lot of points in a short while. So you should always play until the end of the game, because things may change fast.&#10;&#10;",

The twist in this game is the &quot;alley&quot; itself, contained within a frame with four legs of different lengths. As a result, the alley tilts so that gravity carries the top towards the pins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "TactDecks - A portable, expandable, easy to learn tactical combat game combining the best elements of card games and miniature-based wargames.&#10;&#10;Build a heroic, customized fantasy party out of the included 10 Character cards, or feed your creativity by supplementing with the Series 1 TactDecks Boosters. All Characters have different sets of statistics and powers - find your own unique combination and lay waste to your opponent!&#10;&#10;TactDecks is a two-player competitive game where the objective is to eliminate your opponent through a tactical combination of spells, troop movement, and light board manipulation. All components of the game - board, troops, terrain, mechanics - are represented by pocket-sized cards, making TactDecks highly portable and affordable.&#10;&#10;Like many traditional miniature based wargames, TactDecks troops are selected based on a total army point value agreed upon prior to the start of the game. In addition to selecting troops, terrain is also chosen from this common point pool. Initial troop selection and terrain placement is considered a tactical component of the game, since some troops may not be fielded by both players.&#10;&#10;Combat mechanics are based on Near (adjacent) and Far (ranged) attacks, modified by individual troop prowess. Degrees of attack success are determined by an &quot;event deck.&quot;&#10;&#10;In addition to physical attacks, TactDecks also features varying spell mechanics, trap placement (with expansion booster cards), and a light melee dueling system incorporating a feature called &quot;Reserves,&quot; which also help determine initiative.&#10;&#10;TactDecks is easy to learn and scales in complexity based on whatever additional booster sets the players bring to the table.&#10;&#10;A single TactDecks Basic Set may be used as a competitive starter deck or split and used by two players with the included optional rules.&#10;&#10;",
