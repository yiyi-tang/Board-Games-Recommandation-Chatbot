The 758th Tank Battalion remained a light tank outfit, attached to the African-American 92nd Infantry Division in Italy. The 92nd did not have a very good war, thanks in large part to its spectacularly incompetent commander, Edward &ldquo;Sic &rsquo;em Ned&rdquo; Almond. They often fought against die-hard Italian Fascists, who of course aren&rsquo;t included in Elsenborn Ridge (and have yet to appear at all in the Panzer Grenadier series), and in terrain very different from the wooded hills of the Ardennes. But the 761st and 784th provided plenty of action.&#10;&#10;The nature of those battles is that of grinding, close-quarters combat, emphasizing combined arms cooperation.&#10;&#10;",

And the night which is inevitably approaching will be your doom if it catches up with you before you have found refuge on dry land, on the other side of the bridge. Despite all these dangers, you set off and begin the crossing.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will program a few actions from their board (with action tokens) and resolve them. This will often involve moving forward along the bridge, revealing and resolving bridge cards and potentially weather cards. The game ends when the bridge is crossed or the night has caught up to the character or too much cargo has been lost along the way.&#10;&#10;",

You accomplish this through savvy acquisitions from the market row and tactical completion of commoner, merchant, and royal commissions.&#10;&#10;The heart of the Tabriz card game is the commission grid, an irregularly shaped series of resource requirement cards that form commissions in columns and rows. Complete a commission by dedicating the necessary resources for an entire column or row, removing those requirements from the grid and changing all connections commissions at the same time.&#10;&#10;Commissions are defined by their length:&#10;&#10;&#10;     3 cards is a common commission &#10;     4 cards is a merchant commission&#10;     5 cards is a royal commission&#10;&#10;&#10;Complete commissions with more cards for better rewards, including more coins and higher prestige. Merchant and royal commissions also earn you permanent abilities that contribute to your game engine.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take two actions. Actions include buying a Material card from the market row, trading a Material card you have for one in the market row, purging the market row, or taking 5 coins from the supply. At the end of each turn, if you have the necessary materials, you may complete 1 commission on the grid. You claim these Commission cards, changing the grid for future turns.&#10;&#10;Earn the most prestige by the time the Commission deck runs out and you become the master weaver of Tabriz!&#10;&#10;",

The playing cards contain supplementary auxiliary information: the trump strengths and order, color coding and order of the missing cards, the value of the cards when counting them, and hints about the possibility of winning special victory points. And the nice thing: You can still play Doppelkopf according to the normal Doppelkopf rules. Our game is tested by the German Doppelkopf Association e.V. (DDV). You can add additional rules to the game, such as the &quot;pig&quot;, by using the included additional cards.&#10;&#10;For the pictures of the playing cards we have come up with something very special: As a graphical basis for the playing cards, we were able to get reproduction prints of two card decks from the 1930s from the German Playing Card Museum in Leinfelden: German Doppelkopf Card Game VASS Altenburg 1931 and a matching Dondorf's standard ladies' deck from the 1930s. We have taken the pictures from the historical playing cards, graphically enhanced them and put them together to a new beautiful set of playing cards.&#10;&#10;",

With a fantastic system for Focus generation on the Kamae Tree and a Focus-gaining special ability on the Core Card, the Assassin specialises on doing as much as he can quickly and then escaping to safety.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Tombola was a British SAS-led mission to carry out a series of harrassing raids behind enemy lines in the Reggio Emilia region, at the top of the Italian &quot;boot&quot;. The operation was put together by Major Roy Farrar, who was not allowed to go on the actual mission, although he was allowed to accompany the SAS on the aircraft as they were airdropped. During the airdrop, he &quot;accidentally&quot; fell out of the aircraft, although he happened to have a parachute on, and was able to lead his troops in the field.&#10;&#10;The attacks included an assault on the German Gebirgs (mountain corps) headquarters in an attempt to decapitate their regional high command. Notably, a Scottish piper was part of the assaulting force, so that the friendlies could identify which side they were fighting on, as well as to confuse the Germans into thinking that a main Allied force was attacking rather than a raiding party.&#10;&#10;This battlepack adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Mediterranean game, including new Airborne SAS Soldiers, German Alpine Hostiles, Missions, Objectives, Location, Landing Zone, and Enemy Lines cards.

There is a Tombola Location card &quot;Villa Calvi&quot; in the set, which is a requisite for one of the Objective cards &quot;Villa Rossi&quot;, and can be omitted for the other Tombola Objectives. &#10;&#10;If you are playing the &quot;Villa Rossi&quot; Objective, add the &quot;Villa Calvi&quot; card into the Location card deck and draw Locations as normal. Although the Tombola Location card back is a giveaway, treat this as the effect that the squad has a pathway to the Villa Calvi, as a prelude to attacking the Villa Rossi.&#10;&#10;",

Initial fighting from the defenders was so fierce that the German offensive briefly faltered, before Allied hesitation allowed the Germans to rally and regain the initiative, forcing the Allies to retreat and eventually capitulate. The success of the airborne operation demonstrated the mobility and capabilities of airborne assault forces.&#10;&#10;This battlepack adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Mediterranean game, including new German Airborne Soldiers, British Hostiles, Missions, Objectives, Location, Landing Zone, and Enemy Lines cards.

    "Description": "The raid on the French Atlantic coastal town of Saint-Nazaire, Operation Chariot, is one of the most audacious operations in the history of warfare. The obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown was disguised to resemble a German vessel and rammed the Normandie dry dock gates, blowing it up and putting it out of service until after the war.  At the same time, a force of Royal Marines Commandos landed in the town to attack the harbour facilities and other infrastructure, whilst sowing havoc and reaping chaos amongst the enemy garrison. As most of the transports for extraction were destroyed or immobilized, many of the raiding Commando force were killed or captured when their ammunition ran out.&#10;&#10;This set adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Europe game, including new Royal Marines Commandos Soldiers, Embedded German Hostiles, Missions, Objectives, Locations, Gear and Skills cards.

    "Description": "After a year-and-a-half of being &ldquo;in country&rdquo;, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and many in the Pentagon were becoming increasingly concerned that the war in South Vietnam was not going according to plan. Despite increasingly optimistic reports and news conferences from the head of MACV, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, the Viet Cong insurgency against the South Vietnamese government, although bloodied and beaten in several major engagements, was still dangerous and growing thanks to increasing aid from Communist North Vietnam.&#10;&#10;General Westmoreland put forward in the Fall of 1966 a bold plan to invade the southern &ldquo;pan handle&rdquo; of North Vietnam as well as neighboring areas of Laos through which the Communist&rsquo;s supply line (dubbed the &ldquo;Ho Chi Minh Trail&rdquo;) ran. The plan was to take and hold these areas to interdict the Communist&rsquo;s support to the South, as well as compel the NVA (North Vietnamese Army) to do battle in the open against the US and ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam) to take back their occupied homeland and supply lines. General Westmoreland reasoned this was a fight the enemy could not avoid, and one we could not lose. The cost to conduct the planned invasion was for another 206,000 men (six additional divisions plus support personnel) to be deployed to the region. This would dangerously deplete the US military&rsquo;s strategic reserve, as well as escalating the conflict to the point of risking global war with China and the Soviet Union. Would this plan have worked in bringing about a military solution to the Vietnam War, or would it have just &ldquo;widened the stage&rdquo; of this tragic quagmire for the US?&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts? Learn and enjoy!&#10;&#10;Players will need a standard deck of playing cards including both Joker cards, a D6, and one D10 to play the game. A custom card set, that replaces the standard deck of playing cards is available from the publisher.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents 3 or 4 days of time. A hex is about ten miles across. Combat units are either battalions (II) or companies (I). Kind of a Drag is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Ilya Kudriashov.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts the game at the Toyama Bay location on the west coast, and they start each turn by drawing enough cards to have a four Goshintai-card hand.  The collecting of Takaramono - and the amount each player possesses - will affect this total later in the game.&#10;&#10;In order to move around the board, the player must use the movement choices listed on the Goshintai cards to travel in the direction of the choice.  The action that the player takes after moving is determined by the color of the space they land on.&#10;&#10;When you encounter a Yokai, they will either fight you, curse you, or help you, depending on the symbol in the upper-left corner:  combat-oriented Yokai feature a black symbol, and effect-oriented Yokai feature a red symbol. When you reach a Jinja, you have the option of trading in the combat-oriented Yokai that you defeated for the Takaramono at that temple.&#10;&#10;Once you have collected all seven Takaramono, you must return to the initial starting location at Toyama Bay.  The first player to reach Toyama Bay with all seven Takaramono is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cuinze is a shedding game of luck, memory, skill and strategy. It is a competitive game: be the first to play all of your tiles and you WIN! At game's end, players are ordered from first place to last place. As long as you are in the top half of all players, you are still a winner! It is fast-paced: there is little waiting between turns, and a game normally ends within 10 minutes. Rules are straightforward and easy to learn. The game teaches young children how to track and sequence numbers, recognize patterns, assess probabilities, and develop strategies: the game avoids use of face cards that impede learning of numbers. It is family friendly (ages 8 and up) - adults will not dominate! It is great for groups: an unlimited number of players (with more boxes) can easily play together in one giant game. Freestanding tiles provide a satisfying tactile experience; no racks are needed and no more fumbling to hide cards.&#10;&#10;",

You not only control the forces on the field but also play the role of the bard, embellishing the story as you play. Maybe a fog bank rolls in, keeping your rogue&rsquo;s flanking attack concealed. What if that common soldier steps up to lead your forces after his commander is consumed by a wall of flame? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if a sudden downpour wet the strings of an elven ranger&rsquo;s bow just before she was about to fire a shot? With these narrative elements, no battle will ever be the same.&#10;&#10;Anthems of War is a fantasy miniatures skirmish game designed to be played head to head by two players with options for more. Prototyped using 15mm and 28mm miniatures players move their characters on the battlefield, roll dice and try to get the upper hand against their opponents using a variety of different scenarios and goals.&#10;&#10;Scenarios can be used to represent single conflicts or they can be linked together in an overarching campaign. With a system that introduces narrative elements to the gameplay and the ability to create any characters you can dream up no two scenarios ever play quite the same.&#10;&#10;",
