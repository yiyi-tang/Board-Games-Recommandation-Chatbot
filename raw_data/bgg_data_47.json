    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;DC Comics Dice Masters: World's Finest is a collectible dice-building tabletop game designed by Quarriors! creators Michael Elliott and Eric M. Lang.&#10;&#10;In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero &mdash; Batman, Superman, Power Girl, and more &mdash; being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards are available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;DC Comics Dice Masters: World's Finest will introduce new game mechanics: the &ldquo;Allies&rdquo; keyword as well as the &ldquo;Iron Will&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vengeance&rdquo; abilities.  Over 30 heroes and villains make up the new card and dice for this expansion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Ruin has come to our family.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In this adaptation of Red Hook&rsquo;s acclaimed Darkest Dungeon video game, you strive to cleanse a manor and its surroundings of all manner of evil: hordes of the undead, foul beasts and eldritch abominations... And, finally, either at death&rsquo;s door or at your wit&rsquo;s end, you will have to uproot evil itself from the darkest dungeon.&#10;&#10;Darkest Dungeon is a fully cooperative dungeon crawl game in which players take on the role of adventurers. Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!&#10;&#10;The game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough and face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.&#10;&#10;For each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you&rsquo;ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What was old is new again. I am excited to have this opportunity to bring back into print and enhanced version of my original Peloponnesian War design that was originally published by Victory Games. This military game of ancient warfare lets YOU chart the destiny of the war. Peloponnesian War uses a still-unique solitaire system that was a pioneer in this genre, yet was never copied.&#10;&#10;Most current solitaire systems on the market today have the player take one side for the entire game. This pits the player against a random 'Bot system, even the best of which have some difficulty giving you the same challenge as playing against a human opponent. In Peloponnesian War, you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best that YOU can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory. In this manner the player competes against himself in the classic tradition of the Greek tragedy. - Mark&#10;&#10;From the opening of the Archadameian War in 431BC to the Fall of Athens in 404, The Peloponessian War allows YOU to compete against the man in the mirror, as you live through the suicide of Greece. Maneuver your generals, hoplites, and navies to fight battles and attempt to bring the war to an end on your terms. Take heed, however. As you weaken your foe, you create a greater game challenge for yourself. For as you improve in strength, so does your opponent.&#10;&#10;In terms of physical components, Mark's enhanced version is getting the full GMT treatment: mounted map and strategy boards, high-quality thick counters, redesigned rules and playbook, all with new art throughout. This will be a product that you'll want to own and play for a long time! We hope you enjoy this enhanced GMT version of Mark Herman's classic solitaire game design.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stellar Horizons is a &quot;build your own space program&quot; game in which you lead one of seven Earth factions to explore and develop our solar system. Designed by a real-life space engineer with a PhD in long-duration spaceflight from MIT, Stellar Horizons is intended to be a plausible representation of the first steps of humanity towards the stars between 2030 and 2169, with each turn representing a year of time. You control your faction's space program, outposts, and fleets spanning across the solar system, although you also have some influence over your faction's politics back home on Earth as space development becomes more important.&#10;&#10;Movement is based on real physics. You move from orbit to orbit, or conduct long range transfers to move between planetary systems like Earth, Mars, or Jupiter. As you send out robotic explorers and crewed vehicles to explore the solar system, they bring back valuable data to further your scientific research. Technologies are intended to represent plausible extrapolations of existing development during the next 150 years: there are no transporters or warp drive, but you will be able to develop rockets powered by fusion and even anti-matter. In the engineering and biology domains, you'll eventually be able to construct space elevators and put your crews into safe hibernation for long journeys.&#10;&#10;You'll have access to a wide variety of robot explorers and crewed ships. These range from tiny probes intended to merely take photographs as you fly past Jupiter, to giant destroyers, cruisers, and battleships which ply the space lanes with peaceful or hostile intentions. New ship types become available as you gain access to better technology over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;You'll be given a budget to spend on Earth and can also build bases to harvest minerals, organics, and fuel to expands your economy. You can also forge diplomatic relationships with players and non-player factions alike, and trade resources at their bases to earn extra cash. Each of the seven factions has different strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and available ships based on their unique geopolitical situation. Military conflict is certainly possible but not always encouraged. Stellar Horizons features more diplomatic, technological, and economic competition than outright combat, although neglecting warships entirely leaves you vulnerable to pirates, trade embargoes, and sneak attacks by rogue players and factions.&#10;&#10;Stellar Horizons includes short co-operative and competitive scenarios lasting an hour or more, and campaigns lasting a day up to about a full weekend for experienced players. Up to seven players can play at a time and the game is most fun with at least two, but there are also one-player scenarios, and the campaigns are highly suited for solo play. There are three ways to win the campaign: be the first to develop an Interstellar Colonizer, terraform a world, or achieve dominance in space over your rivals.&#10;&#10;",

What sets the game apart from other games of this design is that almost everything in the race zone can move position, so the players need to plan with that in mind.&#10;&#10;So each round begins with the rolling of three dice; red, white and blue. These relate to coloured asteroids of the matching colour and each rock has a set of numbers from 1-6 printed on them. This gives every pilot the information they need to know where each object will most likely move to (the value rolled for each dice determines which direction the object moves in) using the hex based board.&#10;&#10;The trick is that some objects move a differing number of spaces and objects react differently when collisions occur, thus a player's best laid plans may not pan out due to mistakes.&#10;&#10;Mistakes introduces the other unique aspect of Asteroyds. The players only get a given amount of time to work out their best flight path and then plan their moves on their planning board. A minute is recommended and 30 seconds for experts. This real-time tension in the planning is tense and helps the game to stick to a good play length.&#10;&#10;Asteroyds also offers advanced rules such as shooting, special pilot powers and also varied play modes such as; Shooting, Targets and drones. Some of these allow for team play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Granada &ndash; many artisans, traders and entire families have settled at the foot of the Sierra Nevada because the Palace of Alhambra promises all people work, contracts and above all prosperity.&#10;(From the publisher&#039;s blurb.)&#10;&#10;Granada is new member of the Game: Alhambra family with a more challenging character: in this standalone game the players develop the city of Granada next to Sierra Nevada, where the famous Alhambra stands, by buying building tiles to construct the city which will earn the most victory points. Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types for which the value is set during the game.&#10;&#10;Link to Trailer http://www.queen-games.de/index.php?id=2537----2&#10;&#10;Play Differences from Alhambra&#10;Alhambra advanced. Play is the same: buy a building tile, take money or remodel. If you buy a tile for the exact amount, you can take another action, same as in Alhambra. The differences: new building types, building values are dynamic, two-sided tiles, and moats instead of walls.&#10;&#10;There are 9 building types in Granada. Unlike Alhambra, the buildings do not have a set value. Instead, building value is determined by the count of that type of building in all players' cities times a multiplier. As in Alhambra, there are 3 scoring rounds during which each building type is examined and points awarded for the player with the majority of that type of building. In the first scoring round, A, only the player with the most tiles of a particular building type scores for that building type (1 times the total count). In the second scoring round, B, the top 2 players score (2 times the total count and 1 times the total count respectively), and in the final round, the top 3 score (3x, 2x, and 1x the total count of that building type). Scoring for a &quot;Beginners Game&quot; is a little different.&#10;&#10;There are no ties in Granada: points are never divided like in Alhambra. In the case of two players having the same number of tiles of a particular type in their cities, the player with the highest valued tile of that type wins, and the other player takes next place. So, in Granada, it pays to buy the more expensive buildings.&#10;&#10;For example: When the A round-scoring card is turned up, Cindy has 2 Schools, Diana has 2, Tim has 1, Tina and Bailey each have 0, for a total of 5 Schools currently in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Diana's is a 7. So, in round A, Cindy would score 1 x 5 = 5 points.&#10;&#10;When the B round-scoring card is turned up, the count for Schools is: Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina and Bailey 0 each for a total of 6 Schools. So, Diana scores 2 x 6 = 12 points and Cindy scores 1 x 6 = 6 points.&#10;&#10;In the final round, the School count is Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina 2, Bailey 0 for a total of 8 Schools in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Tina's is a 4. So, Diana scores 3 x 8 = 24 points, Cindy score 2 x 8 = 16 points and Tina score 1 x 8 = 8 points.&#10;&#10;Another difference in Granada is that the tiles are two-sided: on one side an even-numbered building of some type, on the other a different, odd-numbered building valued exactly one higher. The configuration of the buildings on both sides is identical in terms of moat placement or lack thereof on each side. When purchasing a building, a player can immediately place the building, as is, into her city or may flip it to the other side and place it in her supply for later placement during a remodel action.&#10;&#10;The Building Market is initially filled with tiles even-side up. The next time the market is filled, the odd side will be placed up, then even, then odd, etc. A handy toggle feature is provided on the board near the Building Market to facilitate this.&#10;&#10;The last difference between Alhambra and Granada, moats instead of walls, is really just a difference in artwork. As in Alhambra, during each scoring round, each player scores points for her longest continuous moat, instead of wall, surrounding her city. The rules are the same regarding tile placement: must be able to trace an unbroken path back to the city's center, moat can touch moat, etc. In games I've played, players have often commented that it seems to be harder to build with the moat tiles of Granada than with the wall tiles of Alhambra. Just one more way to make Granada an advanced version of Alhambra?&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But simply reaching the boat does not mean they have escaped as re-capture is always possible, perhaps, even likely. They will not be really safe until they reach their Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.&#10;Each player leads a group of pirates to Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.The path leads the pirates through wild jungle and across the waters of open ocean to the island of Tortuga. In addition to the innate perils of the trip are the other pirates, as each group wants to be the first to arrive at Pirate's Nest and will do what they can to slow the others' progress. As soon as one player has all his pirates in Pirate's Nest, he can raise the Jolly Roger and win the game.&#10;&#10;The game is a sequel to Cartagena with the pirates trying to figure out what to do now that they have escaped from the prison.&#10;&#10;Inside the box:&#10;&#10;    5 game board pieces with 7 symbols: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass&#10;    3 Game board parts: boat, Pirate's Nest and Jolly Roger flag&#10;    105 cards - 15 cards of each symbol: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass plus 1 of each symbol with gold border&#10;    30 pirate figures 6 each of five colors&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player receives seven cards. A turn consists of taking at least one and up to three of the following actions:&#10;1) Play a card and move a pirate forward to the next unoccupied matching symbol.&#10;2) Move an opponent&rsquo;s pirate forward to the next space with one or two pirates on it (you may not skip over pirates), then draw one card for each pirate already there (max. 3 pirates on any one space at the same time).&#10;3) Sail the boat between the islands.&#10;&#10;To sail the boat to the second island, you must have at least one pirate in the boat. If, at the start of your turn, your pirates outnumber the pirates of your opponent/s, you may sail the boat as a free action. You can only move the boat back to the first island if you still have at least one pirate on the first island.&#10;&#10;There is no hand limit, but if a player plays a card with a yellow border, all players must discard down to 7 cards.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to move all his pirates into the Pirate's Nest and raise the flag.&#10;&#10;",

Players have to be careful to borrow only as much as they need to bid for turn order, lay track, and move goods. At the end of each turn dividends (interest) on the bonds come due. Those who can't pay lose some of their hard-earn cash.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sheepland is set on the beautiful island of the same name, where for centuries the population has taken care of sheep. While inexplicably working in the same field, two to four shepherds try to move sheep into the right areas to score points. During a turn, you must take three actions, chosen from these possibilities:&#10;- Move your shepherd&#10;- Move one sheep&#10;- Buy one terrain tile&#10;&#10;You must move your shepherd at least once during your turn, and you can't take the same action twice in a row without moving the shepherd in between the two actions.&#10;&#10;Six different terrain types are available, with five tiles of each type and increasing costs (from 0 to 4 dinars). When you buy a tile, you're not claiming land on the game board, but rather investing in that type of landscape as that's where you expect the sheep to end up grazing. At the end of the game, you score 1 point per tile of a terrain type for each sheep in a region of this type; you also score for coins still in hand.&#10;&#10;The map on the game board shows regions separated by roads: three regions of each terrain type for a total of 18 regions. Numbered &quot;rest stops&quot; lie along the roads, with each rest stop between exactly two regions. Shepherds move from one rest stop to another, with the first movement being free and all the others on the same turn costing 1 coin. When you buy a terrain, you can purchase the top tile of either of the two terrain types next to your shepherd. When you move a sheep, you move one sheep from a region adjacent to your shepherd to the other region adjacent to that piece, i.e., you lead the sheep across the road to a greener pasture &ndash; well, greener for you, if all goes well.&#10;&#10;Each time you move the shepherd, you place a fence in the rest stop from which it started moving, making that location off-limits for the rest of the game. During the game some regions become inaccessible and, if they are full of sheep, a rush for the tiles takes place. The only black sheep in the game, which is worth two points, serves as a semi-random element, possibly moving to an adjacent region each turn while still being movable by shepherds as long as it's not fenced in.&#10;&#10;After twenty fences have been placed, you end the round so that all players have the same number of turns, then you count up the points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this card game based in H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, you play an investigator (represented by a double sized card that has your stats, special abilities and keeps your story organized) who must complete stories without going insane.  From a deck of at least 52 cards you draw 13 and take turns playing one at a time so it moves at a brisk pace.  You stock your deck with at least 20 points of stories (usually 3 or 4) and try to get the required cards into play.  As an example The card 'A Day in the Life of a M. U. Student' requires you to visit 3 Different Miskatonic University Locations, cast a spell, summon a monster, go to a country site and play an ally of the opposite sex.  When you have fulfilled the conditions you score the card and gain sanity.  In this card's case you score 8 points and gain 2 sanity.&#10;&#10;The types of cards you have are locations (you almost always occupy one), allies, monsters, events, tomes, spells, artifacts and adventures.  A round lasts until there are two passes, at which time all monsters played fight each other then go after the investigators to disable their allies or reduce their sanity.  You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.  Because of this you blow through your deck very quickly and you will go through it a couple of times in most games.&#10;&#10;There are also some very nasty phobias and events to play on your opponents to interfere with their strategies.  There is a lot of interaction and the Lovecraftian atmosphere is keenly felt.&#10;&#10;",

However, the changes are only as permanent as long as history remembers them, which makes the game endlessly replayable, and even playing the same adventure book repeatedly will have a completely different feeling because the world itself has changed. Heroes, following a path of destiny, will even become historical fixtures as they become kings, guildmasters, or even gods!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "King Solomon presided over a golden age of peace and prosperity in ancient Israel. During this time Solomon instituted an unprecedented building program. As one of Solomon's chief governors, you must procure materials and oversee construction of buildings and roads across the land for the glory of Solomon. You will also help to construct the Temple, one of the wonders of the ancient world.&#10;&#10;Kingdom of Solomon is a worker-placement game with a few new twists and turns. Do you claim a resource space, an action space or throw in all your remaining pawns to grab a powerful Bonus Space? Will you spend your resources to extend Solomon's kingdom, take some points in the Market or add to the Temple? These and many other choices await you in this highly interactive game.&#10;&#10;You play Kingdom of Solomon in rounds of four phases.  You start the round placing your pawns to get resources, take actions or get a bonus.  In this placement phase players take turns, each placing one pawn at a time.  After all pawns have been placed, players resolve what they get from placing their pawns.  This is called the resolution phase, and each player, in turn, resolves the placement of all their pawns before the next player.  Next the players can go to the Market to sell or buy resources.  In this market phase, like the placement phase, players alternate taking turns, except that players take turns in reverse order.  The last shall be first, and the first shall be last.  Finally, you build in the building phase.  Players, one at a time, can build a building, roads and add blocks to the Temple.&#10;  &#10;When you place pawns to take actions, you can get an additional resource for a resource space, trade one resource for another, steal a resource from an opponent, get victory points or draw Fortune cards.  You can play Fortune cards at any time.  Fortune cards provide resources, victory points or special actions.  Bonuses your pawns can gain for you include one of every resource, three Fortune cards or victory points with a rearrangement of turn order so you become the new first player.&#10;&#10;You use resources to build things.  Each thing costs a specific set of resources.  The buildings you build give you victory points and additional spots to place pawns for resources or actions.  Roads link resource spaces into resource regions so you can get more resources per pawn placed in the resource region.  Building Temple blocks give you either victory points or temple tokens that help you gain or keep the High Priest.  The High Priest lets you take advantage of another player&rsquo;s resource region and gives you victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end the round when a player places all his building tokens on building sites, there is a building token on each of the building sites, or the Temple is complete.  The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Mercs can then rest and repair or heal themselves, but each turn resting will move the time counter forward to the next counter-attack from the enemy or a new event, that will change the conditions of battle and/or add extra side missions to solve. Players have to manage the different threats and missions while advancing their main goal on the map, which changes with each scenario.&#10;&#10;Mercs take their gear, allies and experience with them through the campaign, continually improving their mercs.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;Players can gear up and improve mercs, free sectors from occupying forces to receive cash and better gear, save grateful civilians to man your militia or stumble into roaming bloodcats as you try to fight Deirdranna's nefarious commanders and their plots, which will escalate the more sectors you liberate.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;The game uses elements from combat games such as Dark Souls, Imperial Assault or Conan and adds more tactical player decisions and influence such as terrain and cover and  different, evolving enemies as well as new merc skills and tons of gears and weapons and a meta gameplay managing your militia and defending your hard won sectors.&#10;&#10;Also: Bloodcats!&#10;&#10;Based on the Jagged Alliance Video game series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ragnar&ouml;k is coming. The fate of all existence is at stake. Is destruction inevitable, or are there ways to avoid ultimate cataclysm? The Norns, mystical beings of great power, have decided they will not go quietly into oblivion and have turned their attention to the well of Fate, Ur&eth;r, in order to find any possible way to stop Ragnar&ouml;k. Looking deep into the swirling waters, they can foresee which potential combination of heroes, villains, battles, victories, and defeats might stop the end of all that is known &mdash; but will they find the right combination in time? Is there any true path to salvation at all? They must hurry and seek the true way through, before all is lost.&#10;&#10;In God of War: The Card Game, players take on the role of the Norns as they try different combinations of heroes and events in order to stop Ragnar&ouml;k. Each game is a new attempt to find the right key to saving Midgard from destruction. Players must work together, embodying mighty heroes such as Kratos, Mimir, Atreus, Brok and Sindri, and Freya. They will fight enemies and bosses from the popular God of War video game, but combined and remixed in exciting new ways, creating unique &quot;What if...?&quot; scenarios each time they play. If they succeed, the way forward has been secured and Ragnar&ouml;k can be halted. Failure means the Norns will have to try again as only death and destruction lay along that particular path.&#10;&#10;Each quest in God of War: The Card Game is made up of a mosaic of cards that recreate monsters and locations from the video game. Each quest's mosaic is different, and each card is double-sided, depending on whether a section has been destroyed or not, and each has special rules that go into effect when it is face up on the tabletop. Learning how each quest is won, as well as what strategy to employ, is key to victory.&#10;&#10;As players progress, earlier quests have an effect on what comes after them. At certain points along their path, players must choose which quest they will complete. Completing one might grant a bonus, but quests left untouched result in dire permanent consequences as the players move forward. These choices and challenges lead to new strategies, making it so no two games of God of War: The Card Game are alike.&#10;&#10;Heroes in the game have several elements that make them unique. Each comes with their own dashboard that explains their special abilities and health totals, in addition to tracking the number of cards a player can keep in their hand from round to round. Tokens are used to keep everything clear as heroes gain and lose health and build up their power so they can unleash a mighty special attack. Heroes begin the game with a unique starting deck of cards that will be augmented from additional decks as the game progresses. Players can construct their deck to focus on their strengths or look for ways to generalize their approach, preparing for future quests that lie ahead. Each hero also has a unique standee that indicates which portion of the mosaic they are facing. With multiple heroes from which to choose, numerous ways to build their deck, and various different quests to attempt, each game of God of War: The Card Game will be a new experience that will echo throughout eternity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A corrupt city, subject to vice and avarice, is under the control of vile characters. The seat of power is vacant and waiting for you to take it &mdash; unless someone else takes it first.&#10;&#10;In Complots, as in the original game Coup, you control two characters and start with two coins, and through trickery, manipulation and bluffing, you want to eliminate all other players who stand in your way, possibly by having them eliminate one another along the way.&#10;&#10;The 24-card deck includes four copies of six different characters, each with a unique set of powers:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.&#10;     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.&#10;     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.&#10;     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10;     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10;     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters, or force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice). If you wish, you may then force them to draw a new card from the deck. They then shuffle the old card into the deck. Block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10;&#10;&#10;(Either the Ambassador or the Inquisitor can be used in a game, not both.)&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.&#10;     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.&#10;     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an character. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)&#10;&#10;&#10;When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses a character of their own, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&#10;&#10;The last player to still have a face-down character wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Last Kingdom Board Game is game of war and politics for 2-5 players by renowned designer John D Clair that's based on the Netflix series The Last Kingdom.&#10;&#10;In this world, the kingdoms of Britain are at war. Many have already fallen to the invading Danes, leaving the great kingdom of Wessex standing alone and defiant under the command of King Alfred. You are one of the great commanders and politicians in this war-torn land known today as England. Both Saxon and Dane armies openly battle for dominance, and it is up to you to title the scales of power. To claim these lands, you will need to tread a dangerous path between both sides of the conflict. Will you betray your allies for power? What part will you play in the birth of a new nation, and will you ultimately rule it all?&#10;&#10;The Last Kingdom Board Game plays over the course of two rounds during which players will perform actions to command armies to shape the course of the war. Your allegiance to the Saxons or the Danes can be firm or fickle, and your score will reflect not just your prowess in battle, but your political skill in maneuvering the competing forces of Britain.&#10;&#10;Each of the ten leaders offers unique benefits to your strategy and provides special cards to start your hand. At the start of each round, players complete their hand by drafting cards from a deck specific to that round, then the war begins in one of the five regions. Players take turns playing cards to command Saxon or Dane armies, gaining affinity with the different factions, or positioning their heroes and leaders to shift the tides of war. Players also have access to a rotating market of actions that are available to everyone.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, players may choose to not act on their turn and instead pass to see what moves their opponents make.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed consecutively, the war in the current region will be decided by the strengths of the Saxon and Dane armies battling there. Players gain victory points if they are aligned with the winning faction and based on their level of affinity. The focus of the war then moves to the next region, and the battle continues.&#10;&#10;After the fate of each of the five regions has been decided, the round ends. After two rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The dice in the game represent the customers, with hex tiles representing the rides in your park. Employing a unique &ldquo;Dice-cascade&rdquo; mechanic once a customer has enjoyed a ride, their dice value is reduced, but they can still continue to enjoy more rides in the theme park until their value drops to 0 where they exit. This means the more efficiently you can move your dice around to activate the most rewarding rides, the more points and money you receive!&#10;&#10;Dice Theme Park also features a card based turn initiative mechanic, decided by your special action role cards (with values 1-6), with players selecting two cards each turn. The lowest total will gain first choice of the customer dice draft and ride tiles that round. At the end of the round those cards will then be passed to the player on your left.&#10;&#10;Dice Theme Park is more interactive and slightly more complex than Dice Hospital, so it&rsquo;s perfect for those looking for a more challenging experience with more ways to score and play, whilst still keeping that same engaging and satisfying feel every time it is played.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

While striving for power, happiness and wealth, they leave their own village and travel towards the City of Rome. The road to Rome is long and there are many ways to reach your life purpose. As a hardworking farmer you can work the land and grow large quantities of grain and wine. A clever farmer irrigates the land to improve the yield of his harvest. Trading your harvested goods for the best price may bring you the means to move up the ladder of the Roman hierarchy. When will you decide to move on and buy yourself an army of Centurions? Or will you choose the sacred way of Religion and serve the ruthless Roman Gods? Along the way, you will have the opportunity to find happiness and wealth in marriage. Will you take this chance to become happy or not? If you contribute well to the Roman Empire, you will grow in the favor of the Emperor and move further to Rome. Will the citizens of Rome welcome you jubilantly?&#10;&#10;Coming nearer to Rome and the Emperor's Palace the tension in the game becomes higher. Which of the players has contributed most to the Empire? And which of the players has saved the city in times of crisis? Just when water and food supplies become exhausted or Centurions are needed to protect Rome against a hostile invasion, only the most prestigious Romans show their courage and value. The Emperor will reward this Roman with golden Fortuna coins, and the deeper the crisis, the richer the reward. When a player has reached the centre of Rome, only the player who has done most for the Emperor and the People of Rome will become Victorious.&#10;&#10;Make sure to be in the City of Rome so you are able to take that triumphal march to Victory!&#10;&#10;How to win the game?&#10;The player with the highest number of Victory Points at the end of the game wins. The game ends when one player gets to the Center of Rome (the Palace of the Emperor), then this final round is completed. Scoring in the game is partly based on the number of steps you have made towards Rome = each step is one VP. The other Victory Points are scored by collecting the right combination of privilege cards and resources. The VP scored with the privately held privilege cards stays a secret till the end of the game when the total scoring is revealed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The S.S. Nvrsnks is going down, and who is always first off a sinking ship? The rats!&#10;&#10;Abandon Ship is a game in which you play to move your group of rats off the ship before the rising water drowns them. The Nvrsnks is also loaded with valuable points-earning cheese, but don&rsquo;t let desire for that lovely food send your rats to the watery depths. Your opponents may also share some of the rats in your group; they may want to move the rats in a different manner from you.&#10;&#10;Before play, each player gets secretly assigned three colors - these are their rats. &#10;Players roll colored dice (there is one for each rat and one neutral die) and the active player chooses one of them to move the corresponding rat forward (or backwards in case the die shows an anchor). Encircled numbers and symbols can be used for a rat of any color. The next player rolls the remaining dice (in case there was an x next to the number, the previously used die remains in the pool) and does the same. When there is only one die left, the ship sinks a number of fields according to a token drawn. If the water level reaches a rat, the rat and the corresponding die is taken out of the game. When a rat reaches a cheese token, the player who moved the rat gets the token. &#10;The first rat to reach the top deck gets nothing; the second rat scores 5 points, the third one 3 points and the fourth one 2 points. Most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.&#10;&#10;If, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare &quot;Zero!&quot; and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warmaster is a set of fantasy miniatures wargame rules developed by the same company as produced Warhammer, Warhammer 40,000 and Lord of the Rings miniatures rules. This is not a complete game; players are required to independantly purchase miniatures and construct a playing surface (wargames terrain). The game is scaled for 10mm miniatures (1:144, N Scale), and is designed to represent combat at the regiment and brigade level set in a fantasy/renaissance techology world.&#10;&#10;In Warmaster, combat and casualty calculations occur at the stand level. That is, for every stand in a unit, a number of dice are rolled in combat. As whole stands are removed by sustaining casualties, the number of dice similalry decreases.&#10;&#10;The command mechanism in Warmaster is simple but evocative. Each leader model has a Command factor. To issue a command, such as 'move forward' to a unit, two dice must be rolled against that target command factor. For every subsequent order attempted the target number becomes more difficult to achieve. As a consequence, despite being on the surface a move-counter move system, the turns are variable length and each player may not have the full opportunity to achieve everything they may want to. This simple mechanism introduces enjoyable tension into what is otherwise a largely conventional set of wargame rules.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Warmaster Annual 2002&#10;    Warmaster Annual 2003&#10;    Warmaster Armies&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Warmaster Ancients&#10;    The Battle of Five Armies&#10;&#10;&#10;Supported by the Warmaster magazine.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Nuggets (2003), players try to surround the &quot;gold mines&quot; (numbered cylinders) on an 8x5 grid board. On a turn, a player either places a numbered tile face down or places two fence sections on the board; these fences determine the borders of each claim, and each claim must be at least four spaces large. At the end of the game, all tiles are revealed, and each gold mine is awarded to the player whose tiles in that claim have the largest sum, with ties resulting in an equal division of points. Whoever collects the most mine points wins.&#10;&#10;Armad&ouml;ra (2013) uses the same gameplay as Nuggets for the base game, albeit with the players themed as orcs, elves, mages, and goblins on the hunt for dwarven gold. Armod&ouml;ra also adds advanced rules to the game, with each player receiving one reinforcement token and 1-2 special power tokens. Instead of placing a warrior or erecting palisades (fences), a player can place a reinforcement token on one of their warriors in a territory that's already filled, boosting the strength of that warrior by one. A player can use their special power before taking one of the three normal actions, with the elf shooting an opposing warrior in an unfilled territory (lowering his strength by one), the orc placing an additional palisade that turn, the goblin placing a second warrior (with this one being face-up), and the mage looking at the value of an already placed opponent's warrior.&#10;&#10;Pearlad&ouml;ra (2022) moves the gameplay to the water, with players now placing two pontoons or one diver on a turn in order to fence off parts of the sea, then use the strength of your divers to claim pearls. This version of the design includes the advanced rules, with slight tweaks to the previous powers from Armad&ouml;ra.&#10;&#10;",

While the secular world of empires and politics plays out around you, your missionaries spread the Christian faith and convert areas of the map to your new religion. Each turn covers decades, and the flow of play will teach players about the expansion and doctrinal battles of early Christianity while you build institutions to educate, heal, and inspire the societies you touch.&#10;&#10;Apostles and brilliant theologians will help you evangelize, but you will come to rely on the Roman/Byzantine state and Christian kingdoms to establish and defend the faith. Heresies and schisms in the Church will try to thwart your plans. Pressing against you are barbarian hordes, some of which you may convert; but the armies of Islam will emerge as the game changes from one of missionary outreach to one of self-preservation, as Christian communities hunker down for survival during the long Dark Ages. At the end, you will rise up in a blaze of glory as the Christian world finally fights back using Crusaders and the Spanish Reconquista to recover lost provinces!&#10;&#10;Beginners and experienced gamers will find this an intriguing and very different sort of game. It&rsquo;s a war of ideas, but it&rsquo;s still a wargame, where managing scarce resources (including holy relics!) and making shrewd strategic decisions are the keys to victory. Can you build a strong, united and prosperous Christendom?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

With 4 or 6, it's usually played in partnerships.&#10;&#10;Two or three players use a 33 card deck with all 2-6's removed plus a Joker added. Four players use a 43 card deck: remove 2s, 3s, and black fours (leaving the 4 of Hearts, 4 of Diamonds) and a Joker added. Five players use a 53 card deck with only a Joker added.&#10;&#10;Six players need a special deck of 63 cards with 11's, and 12's in each suit and a 13 of Diamonds, a 13 of Hearts, and a Joker.&#10;&#10;The variant most popular in French Canada is four players (in partnerships) with a 46-card deck (removing all 2s and 3s, and adding two Jokers, a black-and-white one and a coloured one). Decreasing card strength is white joker, colour joker, first and second &quot;edges&quot; (the trump jack and the matching colour jack), ace, king, queen, 10 down to 4. Decreasing bidding strength is hearts-diamonds-clubs-spades. A special hand is &quot;nulot&quot;, in which a player tries not to take any tricks; his partner sits out the hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It isn't easy being a zoo animal. The enclosures are far too small for your needs, the daily routine is boring, and the visitors to the zoo are too obnoxious. You have decided: You need to break out of the zoo, ideally within the next seven days.&#10;&#10;There are multiple ways to escape in KuZOOkA, but you need to work together with the other animals &mdash; in secret &mdash; to pool the trash left behind by zoo visitors and develop an escape plan that makes use of these items. Each player has one of the ten animal cards with a unique power, and you play on a game board that features a path comprised of spaces in six colors, with each space having a number in it.&#10;&#10;In each round, a number of item cards is dealt out to players, with 20-22 cards being dealt in the first round. Cards show a colored item, e.g., a red ice cream spoon or a purple scarf. On a turn, you place one of your animal tokens on the path farther than any other animal token, say, in the 1 red space or the 2 purple space, to give some indication of what you have in hand. (The first player is limited to one of the first five spaces.) The next player places one of their tokens farther down the path, and so on, with each placement giving players a chance to suggest what cards they hold in hand. A player can use their animal power once during a round.&#10;&#10;At some point a player will decide that instead of placing an animal token, it's time to attempt an escape. At that point, all players reveal all cards of the color matching the location of the animal token furthest down the path. If you have more cards, you gain experience stars equal to the number depicted on that space &mdash; and with experience stars, you can purchase a higher starting experience level, which means you'll have more cards in play, including face-up cards visible to all. If you have exactly as many cards as the number depicted, you gain experience stars as well as a universal tool card that counts as a joker. If you have fewer cards, you fail.&#10;&#10;Shuffle all cards, then deal out the current number of cards and start a new round. If during a round you manage to reach one of the six final spaces on the track and you have at least that many cards of the designated color, you escape and win the game. If you fail to do this by the end of the seventh round, you lose.&#10;&#10;You can increase the difficulty of KuZOOkA by requiring more stars to advance in experience level or by playing on the opposite side of the game board, which requires you to win universal tools in order to succeed in the final six spaces.&#10;&#10;",

Lots of possibilities make the game entertaining and always exciting.&#10;&#10;Mhing is a beautiful, elegant game -- a classical game. So simple that one can play it after few minutes; in addition, so varied and exciting that it can be enjoyed for years on end.&#10;&#10;Mhing has a deck of 150 cards: 108 suit cards, 28 Honour cards, 8 Flower Cards and 6 Wild Cards. It is designed for 2-6 players ages 10 and up.&#10;&#10;Unlike Mah Jong, Mhing scales well from 2 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of a round, cards are turned face up until all six colors are showing or seven cards are face up. All players secretly decide which color cards they hope to win at the end of the round. On their turn, players bid by placing a stone on the table. If a player passes, he picks up all the stones currently on the table and places his token on top of the token pile. The last player remaining grabs all the cards of the color he had chosen earlier in the round. The second to last player, whose token now sits at the top of the token pile, then picks up all the cards of his chosen color if any cards of that color are left. The same process is repeated for each player when their token is at the top of the token pile. The game ends when all the cards of the deck have been claimed. Players then earn points for each animal for which they have majority.&#10;&#10;Components: 54 cards, 50 stones, 30 markers, rules.&#10;&#10;Released: Essen 2007.&#10;&#10;",

Build a zoo that focuses on marquee animals like Lions, Gorillas, or Elephants to attract and thrill guests. Or develop partnerships with National Parks on conservation and re-introduce endangered species back into the wild. Strategically place food booths and gift shops to satiate guests, while generating revenue to help keep your zoo growing and thriving. The more money you generate, the more options you have at your disposal to create the zoo of your dreams!&#10;&#10;With 35 different species (most of them represented by 230 animal meeples), you have an abundance of options from which to select your favorite animals. But selecting animals is only the beginning! Just like in real life, each amazing animal will require unique care to meet their individual needs. Carefully balance group and enclosure sizes, social composition, and guest proximity, to try and achieve the right balance between animal and guest happiness. Happiness will play a particularly important role in animal reproduction, and new animal options for addition to your zoo. Play your cards right, and you may find your animals having offspring! This is important for conservation projects but also a great source of popularity. However, it must not be forgotten that a place must be available once they get older. With our &ldquo;zoo in a box&rdquo; &ndash; watch the zoo of your dreams come true, right in front of you!&#10;&#10;In Zoo Tycoon the board game, players compete to build the most successful zoo. In this strategic and thematic board game, each player has the freedom to develop their own zoo with 35 species, food booths, zoo shops, etc. Each animal has its own care requirements focused on 3 key areas - popularity for visitors, educational value, and nature conservation. Thanks to a novel game mechanism, the animal market with supply and demand changes continuously. In addition, small events will shape the gameplay in every round.&#10;&#10;As with zoos in real life, players must find the right balance between popularity and conservation over the course of the game. In the end, the lower value between those two measurements will count as your final score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Procyon is a star 11 light-years from Earth, visible in our skies as the brightest star in the Canis Minor constellation. Since the system contains the remains of a collapsed star it was bound to be rich in heavy elements, ripe for industrialization. It was thus no surprise, that in 2104 this was one of the first extrasolar systems to be colonized. The surprise came 3 years later, when an ancient artefact belonging to a clearly alien civilization was discovered under the settlement. The observatories picked up the unmistakable tachyon radiation of a fleet slowing down from faster-than-light approaching the system - preparing for the worst case scenario, the UN dispatched its entire Armada to relieve the minimal defenses the settlement holds, while their scientists worked hard to decipher the alien communications, and understand their newfound enemy whose name was revealed to be the Aethyn.&#10;&#10;Defence of Procyon III is a highly asymmetric game of four players in two teams: one player takes charge of the Alien space navy, one the Alien ground force, while the other team of the Human space navy admiral and the ground forces' commander stands in their way. The space board uses a hex board, while the ground board is a point-to-point network of locations. The game is played over 12 turns, using card driven, low luck mechanisms that quickly unfold into a fast paced game of combat strategy - presented with countless high quality miniatures in a rich, thematic world. The two commanders of a side will have to work together closely to make sure there are no weaknesses for the enemy to exploit, yet their different mechanisms and different theaters will ensure each player is comfortably occupied with their own responsibilities - avoiding the alpha player issue common in team games.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with an automated opponent that takes charge of one of the side. One or two players can play cooperatively against the opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The world struggles in the Cold War, and many see the sky as the next battlefield. The era of Space Race has just begun. Do you have what it takes to lead a daring space agency into a new age of human achievement?&#10;&#10;Space Race takes place during the first seven decades of the space conquest, and players become directors of newly established Space Agencies. Their goal is to expand them and to achieve astonishing breakthroughs. During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.&#10;&#10;Space Race is a card game based on finding synergies and constructing powerful combinations out of different abilities. There is no guaranteed winning strategy: players have to respond to an ever changing environment in order to identify the best course of development while competing with their opponents for the most interesting discoveries.&#10;&#10;The game is played in seven rounds. In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.&#10;&#10;Space Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe. As there are only 3 Control Cards of each of the 4 types and no Control Card can be used more than once, players have to combine different types of cards and abilities to be successful during the 7 rounds of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The scenarios highlight the key elements that made these battles so fascinating: the defensive power of the longbow, especially when used in coordination with dismounted, or even mounted, men-at-arms. Given the right deployments and forces, the inability to take advantage of the marvelous abilities of the vaunted knights, the finest mounted force in Europe, became something of a surprise to many &quot;experts.&quot;&#10;&#10;Men of Iron is designed for quick learning and easy play.

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In the game of Eschaton, players seek to lead the most favored cult in the final days before Armageddon. As the world crumbles, the Dark One will favor only a single unholy mass to be his Chosen in the vastness of eternity following the cataclysm. All others will be obliterated by his depraved will. Through bloodshed on the field of battle, divination of the unholiest arcana, and initiation of powerful cultists, you will build your cult and earn your rightful place.&#10;&#10;Eschaton is a strategy game driven by a deck-building mechanic. All players begin with the same basic cult (deck) and an equal presence on the realm map. As the game progresses, each player utilizes the evil Influence of their existing Cultist cards to initiate new Cultists into their deck as they seek to earn the most Points of Favor from the Dark One. These Cultists carry different specialties: some are masters at arms, others strong wielders of arcane magics, and others provide even greater Influence to recruit stronger members.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "My First Castle Panic, like its predecessor Castle Panic, is a co-operative game in which players work together to defend their castle, but this game removes the reading requirement of the earlier one and fosters the development of educational skills, such as identifying colors and shapes, problem solving, and turn taking.&#10;&#10;In the game, monsters follow a single path toward a single, large, eye-catching castle, which is protected by one wall. Each step toward the castle is identified by a color and a shape. Players hold cards in their hands with cute defenders who also have a color and shape. When a card is played that matches the location of the monster, that monster is captured and thrown in the dungeon. Tension builds as more monsters are placed and move along the path toward the castle. If the castle is destroyed, the players lose; if it still stands when all the monsters are in the dungeon, the players win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's just another day, get up, wash, go to work. What's different is that today the Earth has been invaded by aliens &ndash; it's just that nobody knows it yet. Deep underground mad scientists are raising monsters from the planet Moongha. Once fully formed they will emerge to spread terror and destruction. Cities will be laid waste to, and the human race will be hunted to extinction.&#10;&#10;Through the sewers oozes the Bloob, quietly growing in size. The Drakoor, alien vampires, stalk the night, feeding off the unwary. Meanwhile, the strongest of the Moongha invaders, Mechoor, sucks in energy from the earth. Once sated it will rise to destroy whole cities with its heat ray. These are just a few of the monsters that will terrorise the people of Earth.&#10;&#10;It can only be hoped that just as in the movies there's a hero around who can thwart their evil plans; otherwise there will be no more &quot;just another day&quot;s for anybody! But who's behind those evil plans? You! You are one of those sadistic, power-thirsty, psycho nerds, eager for revenge after a whole life of study, disregarded by everyone. All of you have received a visit from a mysterious flying saucer, carrying strange alien machinery &ndash; an engine that finally brought you POWER! And now you are ready to fight your insane struggle to be the first in destroying the human race. This time no &quot;Klaatu barada nikto!&quot; will stop you...&#10;&#10;Moongha Invaders: Mad Scientists and Atomic Monsters Attack the Earth! is for three to four players and should take about ninety minutes to play. You have control of a number of different types of Moongha monsters. When you sit down to play, the side of the board closest to you is your monster display. There you will see the seven different types of monster. You will place your monster counters in these boxes. Note that some monster types have more than one counter.&#10;&#10;The game lasts either eight or nine turns, depending on the number of players, although it may end before then if a player manages to get down all twenty of their damage cubes.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn a random number of actions are made available. Three of these actions relate to the monsters and allow you to create, attack, and move them. These actions are represented by orange, white, and purple tokens. There are three human action boxes, one that allows you to place a hero, the other two allow you to place military counters.&#10;&#10;To create a monster you have to place a certain number of orange tokens in the monster box. Once the monster has been created you place it in one of the twelve cities on the board. When you do so, you place the monster on its hidden side. The monster is alive but as yet the world does not know of its presence. While hidden a monster is safe from attack and can build up its strength so that when it does attack it will cause carnage. Another player may attempt to reveal your monster by placing a hero counter in the same city.&#10;&#10;Military units will try to destroy monsters. When you place a military unit or a hero, you can then attack with all military counters in that city. When a monster attacks a city, armor units will attack it first, then after that attack has been completed, any surviving infantry units will attack. All combat involves rolling dice and in all cases a roll of four or more is successful.&#10;&#10;Each monster type has its own special abilities. Only three monsters are powerful enough to destroy entire cities; these are the Bloob, Mechoor, and Moogre. When you attack a city, you mark the damage you do with your colored cubes. At the end of the game, players score victory points depending on how many damage cubes they have in each city. Players also score points for the cities that were randomly assigned to them at the beginning of the game, depending on how much damage they have suffered. Points can also be scored for having vampires on the board and for killing other monsters with your Moogre monster.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In June 1520, at Balinghem, there met the young and glorious Kings of England and of France in a grand and splendid celebration of their mutual friendship and admiration. There were great feasts and opulent amusements, conspicuous expressions of deepest and sincerest piety, and fierce tournaments. Each King outshone the other in turn, so that the world might be astounded at the wealth and power of each kingdom. So many tents and raiments were made of precious cloth of gold, that the field is so named.&#10;&#10;This game was created to commemorate the five hundredth anniversary of the world&rsquo;s most famous three-week  party, in which King Henry VIII of England, and Francis I of France, spent ridiculous amounts of money and resources to peacock at each other. Through smiles made of gritted teeth, the game&rsquo;s two players will express friendship: each action they take will give their opponent a tile that they might use to score. Scoring usually entails removing the tile from the game, so each player must take care to maximize their scoring opportunities while either denying them to their rival, or forcing their rival to score before they&rsquo;re ready. Once the game is underway, players are generally given only two options, and both of those options are usually painful - even and sometimes especially when they score you points.&#10;&#10;A sort of subversion of the point salad paradigm, The Field of the Cloth of Gold harkens back to the feel of the classic German games of the 1990s: simple, elegant, austere, and politely vicious.&#10;&#10;The second edition of the game, dubbed the &quot;503rd anniversary edition&quot;, includes a new jewel tile type.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dungeoneer: Vault of the Fiends is a non-collectable dungeon-crawl card game for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;It is meant as an expansion to the Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord also published by Atlas Games, but Tomb of the Lich Lord is not necessary to play this set, as Vault of the Fiends is also a stand-alone set.&#10;&#10;Players play the part of one of six heroes.  Each hero has variable melee, magic and speed scores, as well as a unique ability. Your second role in the game is as the malevolent &ldquo;Dungeonlord&rdquo;, trying to exterminate the other heroes.&#10;&#10;You win the game when as a hero you complete 3 Quests such as destroying an evil laboratory or rescuing a princess. An alternate win goal is as the Dungeonlord if all the other heroes are defeated except yours.&#10;&#10;Vault of the Fiends features a variety of new heroes.  Elf Assassin, Human Beastmaster, Drakan Sentinal, Ork Shaman, Dwarf Runecaster, and Gnome Illusionist.&#10;&#10;Each turn you may:&#10;&#10;     Play monsters, traps and other bad events on opponents&#10;     Build a dungeon&#10;     Move around the dungeon with your hero (collect Glory and Peril resources)&#10;     Play abilities and treasures for yourself&#10;     Complete a Quest&#10;     Discard an unwanted card&#10;     Fill your hand to 5 cards&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Wiz-War where you race in a dungeon to complete your objectives.  This dungeon is created by the laying down of Map cards. You collect Glory and Peril as you move through the dungeon.  Glory buys cards that help your hero such as abilities and treasures, but your opponent spends your Peril against you to play monsters, traps and other unpleasant stuff.&#10;&#10;Combat is similar to Talisman. Roll a six-sided die and add the score you are combating with, either Melee or Magic, to beat your opponent&rsquo;s roll.&#10;&#10;The way the cards interact will be familiar to CCG players, in that you have &ldquo;Permanents&rdquo; and &ldquo;Instants&rdquo; that you can use strategically, or in combinations, but this game is not really a strategy game.  Most of the fun comes from the theme, and surprising combination of events that occur.  Dungeoneer is likely to appeal to those who enjoy a classic dungeon crawl and RPG like action.&#10;&#10;Vault of the Fiends features a few new mechanics that should serve to enhance the game play which players of Tomb of the Lich Lord will be familiar with.  Some monsters, and attack cards are &ldquo;pumpable&rdquo; that means you may spend extra Glory or Peril to boost the effectiveness of the card.  Also conditions on the map change such as effects being deactivated when a certain Quest is completed or throwing a switch in a room to extend a bridge across the Fiery Chasm.  One of the more unexpected new mechanics are &ldquo;artifact&rdquo; Quests, such as the Armor Golem&rsquo;s Glove which makes your hero more powerful or the Sunken Treasure which makes your hero faster.  These do not confer a level, but are rotated 180 degrees so you can read the bonus they provide.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dungeoneer Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Clubs is a card game about taking calculated risks. The goal is very simple: win as many club cards as possible - that's the only suit that scores points. The lower the club card you take, the more points you could win. But there's a catch: The last player to go out for the round does not score ANY points. So players who get too greedy might pick up a pile of clubs, but end up with 0 points for the round!&#10;&#10;First there was Hearts, then there was Spades, and now North Star Games is bringing you Clubs. The suit of clubs finally gets some respect!&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;Clubs is a climbing game similar to Tichu, Haggis, Big Two and The Great Dalmuti. It can be played with 2 - 6 players in less 30 minutes.  There are two ways to earn points in Clubs:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play all your cards as quickly as possible each round.&#10;    Win tricks with clubs in them.&#10;&#10;&#10;To play a round, deal out 10 cards to each player. Players may call Double or Nothing anytime before playing their first card.  The player to the left of the dealer leads with a Trick-Type.  Legal Trick-Types include any singleton, pair, 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind, or any run of 2 or more cards. Players can either pass or follow with a similar hand of higher rank.  When all of the players have passed consecutively, the pile is taken by the person who played last. That player leads with a Trick-Type of their choice.&#10;&#10;Players score bonus points for playing all of their cards each round.  A 6-player game has all of the following Bonus Cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;    12 bonus points + points for clubs&#10;    10 bonus points + points for clubs&#10;    8 bonus points + points for clubs&#10;    5 bonus points + points for clubs&#10;    2 bonus points + points for clubs&#10;    0 bonus points.  Do not score points for clubs&#10;&#10;&#10;The last player out for the round does not get bonus points and does not receive points for any clubs he may have taken. The points for clubs varies from 5 points (for the 1 of clubs) to 1 point (for the 10-15 of clubs). The first player to 50 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "China experienced the greatest economic expansion in its history during the Ming dynasty (1368&ndash;1644). The silver trade between the Americas and Europe and onward to China had a profound effect on the world economy &ndash; it may be considered the beginning of a global economy.&#10;&#10;In China, social mobility led to the growing of cities, especially in the lower Yangtze area, which was at that time responsible for the main production of wheat for the whole country. In addition to wheat and rice, other crops like tea, fruits, and sugarcane were grown on a large scale. Immigrating peasants changed their profession to become merchants and artisans. Many people from the countryside were employed in private or state run factories, producing commodities like paper, porcelain, refined sugar, or silk textiles.&#10;&#10;Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy and was aided by the construction of canals, roads, and bridges by the Ming government. Ming China saw the rise of several merchant clans, who owned large amounts of wealth.&#10;&#10;In Yinzi &mdash; &quot;y&iacute;nzi&quot; meaning &quot;silver&quot; &mdash; the players represent merchant clans developing parts of China in the late Ming period in the early 17th century along the last 200 km of the Yangtze river before it reaches the China Sea.&#10;&#10;The players plant crops, sell goods to the rural or urban markets, develop raw materials, build and upgrade factories, and sell their goods to ships already waiting in the port. In order to reach the port, the players need to improve their river transport capabilities along the Yangtze.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Winter 453: The Huns reign supreme over half of the known world. The great Khan, king of the Huns, is suffering, and there are many who dream of taking his place. The Khan must appoint his successor. He will choose the bravest and most glorious of his generals, and you intend for that to be you! But you are not the only contender, and you will have to prove your worth.&#10;&#10;Each turn in Huns you must choose between raiding for resources or picking a card that will grant you a special ability. In more detail, the game includes five decks of cards in five colors that feature equipment, raids, mercenaries, curses, and treasure, as well as goods cubes in the same five colors. Each player starts the game with two wagons that require specific colored goods to fill them.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, the active player rolls five d3 dice in the five colors, then chooses one of the dice and takes either cubes or cards in this color. If you take cards, they draw 1-3 cards (based on the die roll), keep one of them, then place the others face down under this deck. Equipment gives you an in-game bonus, raids have a one-time effect, treasure earns you points at game's end if you meet the condition listed, mercenaries give you a reusable effect once you give them goods, and curses are played on opponents, who must apply goods to them to dispel their effect. If you take cubes, you can place them on a single mercenary card, a single curse card, or any number of your wagons in the appropriate spaces. If you fill a wagon, you draw a new one from those on display. Each player takes one die in turn, choosing cards or goods, until all the dice have been chosen. The first player marker then moves clockwise, and the new active player rolls all five dice again.&#10;&#10;When one of the cube colors or one of the decks is empty at the end of a round, the game ends. Players score points for raids undertaken, treasure achieved, mercenaries paid off, and wagons delivered, and whoever has the most points wins! Card combos, drafting strategies, and resource management is what Huns is about, set in the universe of the mighty warriors of Huns.&#10;&#10;",
