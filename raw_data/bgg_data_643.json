    "Description": "A boardgame inspired by the fantastic PC game Sins of a Solar Empire.&#10;&#10;The game is more or less in the same respect as the PC game. You build ships, research technology, and expand your empire through vast star systems, of which several may be used at once.&#10;&#10;Players will build massive fleets of varying ships and fight for control of the planets they need to yield resources, and spread their culture across one or more star systems. All while attempting to destroy another players Home World. Once a Home World has fallen, the game ends, and scores are totaled using a score card. &#10;Scoring is the most detailed and elaborate part of the game. Players can earn points in all four different categories, including Military, Culture, Technology and Economy. There are also bonuses for players who scored the highest in any one of these areas.&#10;&#10;            Sadly, the one who looses their Home World REALLY looses in points. Trying to work this problem out so they don't feel like they loose so badly, while keeping book keeping down to a bare minimum. Any suggestions on how to do this would be greatly appreciated. This is one of the main things I have yet to really work out.&#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;&#10;-- 3 unique races, each with special abilities, research trees, and &quot;Home World advantages&quot;.&#10;-- 3 different resources to manage, along with a black market, on which you can sell or buy these resources if you cannot acquire them through &quot;legal&quot; means.&#10;-- All planet types you can expect to find: Terran, Desert, Volcanic, Ice, Asteroids, Worm Holes... &#10;-- Several ship classes, including Frigates, Cruisers and Capital Ships.&#10;-- Bucket of Dice combat system makes the battles fast and easy, while still having the epic space battles that the PC game delivers.&#10;-- Semi-Modular game boards. The star-system boards are set up with blank spaces linked by phase lines to place planets. Set up a random map, or design your own. Each map also has 2 different colored Phase Lines for smaller or larger games.&#10;-- Pirates occupy each undiscovered planet, with the player opposite of you rolling for the Pirates. This allows for a bit more interaction in the beginning of the game.&#10;-- Cheap. Besides the dice, you only need to print out a few items. The only thing you really need to print with quality is the Star System board, and two 4x6 sheets of game counters.&#10;&#10;Designer Note: I do not own any of the rights to the PC game, nor do I intend on making any sort of profit from it in the slightest.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn a letter of the alphabet is chosen using the spinner provided. Players race to find a part of their picture which begins with that letter. The first player to do so and call out their answer places a piece of their puzzle over the identified picture element. The game balances nicely as players have less to look at than others if they are closer to winning. The 4 different pictures on the playing boards are very appealing to children with a whimsical light-hearted artwork. They contain a lot of detail which keeps the game from becoming too repetitive.&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives four pieces (pigs), and a spinner is used to move them individually along the main (broad) path. Landing on a blue space requires you to turn a pig off on to the relevant dotted (narrow) path; conversely, landing on a red dot on a dotted path forces the pig to move on to a second dotted path. Therefore it is quite easy to get your pigs in disarray!&#10;&#10;No captures are utilized in the game, and one strategy is to try and group several of your pigs on one space and move them as a unit.

But be careful: If you vie too much for the Tenno&rsquo;s favor you might easily lose control of your armies...&#10;&#10;This expansion increases the strategical depth of the basic game by allowing players to visit the imperial court. Players can convert their armies (either from the tower tray or their provinces) to court officials and send them to the imperial court to acquire favors from the Emperor.&#10;&#10;It also includes the Samurai mini-expansion, which can be used with the base game in combination with Tenno's Court or on its own. With this mini-expansion, each player receives a stack of cards showing progressively better bonuses.

The movement of the pieces is based on Wladyslaw Glinski's Hexagonal Chess.&#10;&#10;As with all Shogi variants, the objective is to checkmate your opponent's king. Unlike chess, Shogi pieces are flat, all the same color, and pentagonal. Ownership of a piece is indicated by the direction it is pointing. When you capture a piece, you may on a later turn place that piece on the board and use it as your own.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has five pieces, which appear from left-to-right in the following order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tokin, which moves like a Gold General (Lance)&#10;     Silver General (Bishop)&#10;     King&#10;     Gold General (Knight)&#10;     Pawn (Rook)&#10;&#10;&#10;The name in parenthesis is the piece's promoted value; when a piece promotes. it is flipped to its promoted side. However, the unusual feature that this game shares with Kyoto Shogi is that a piece must promote (and demote) every time it is moved.&#10;&#10;Because of the geometry of the hexagonal board, some pieces have more, and less, mobility than its counterparts on a square board. For example, the King in Shogi may move in one of eight directions, while in this game, it has a choice of twelve.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Premise:&#10;&#10;You are a group of nerds and/or geeks who have discovered a secret tomb of a long-gone fanatic of geek/nerddom.  Inside you discover a spiraling tower of RPG, video game, and movie stereotypes of every sort on each floor, and must collect treasures and artifacts  from each of them in order to challenge the Master Ghost and claim the title of Master Geek for yourself.&#10;&#10;But meanwhile, a deranged, shadowy psychopathic killer stalks your strongest party member, believing that he would get your champion's powers if he kills him/her.  He's slow, but insanely powerful, and to meet him would mean almost certain doom.&#10;&#10;Once someone challenges and defeats the Master Geek, the dungeon starts crumbling, but the psycho-killer still stalks you (unless you killed him before).&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal is to get the most prestige upon exiting the tower, getting prestige points for each treasure item collected, each artifact acquired, along with bonus points for the person who defeats the Master Geek and/or the psycho-killer.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The players start outside of the tower, and walk inside to a lobby and a staircase leading upwards, where they may or may not encounter enemies.  These are all represented by cards.  The stairways/lobbies and tower corridors/rooms are represented by wider and larger cards, and each detail a special conditional effect that takes place with everyone who stays in the corridor/room/stairway/lobby, even if the conditional effect is &quot;this is just a normal room.&quot;  Some examples include rooms where battles are tougher in some way, rooms where each player's gender is changed, rooms where there's treasure lying everywhere, and a room where all the enemies are flying and thus are more difficult to fight.&#10;&#10;The tower begins unexplored.  As players explore the tower, going up stairs and walking through the floors, a room/stairway/floor effect card is drawn and placed onto any unexplored space they walk into.  If a room is empty (void of monsters) upon entry, a new battle is triggered.&#10;&#10;Battles are fought with a bit of luck combined with overall strength.  Each floor has a certain &quot;battle size&quot; (with certain rooms having increased battle sizes), which determine the number of monsters that can fight in any single battle.  Upon entering the previously mentioned empty room, players draw a number of encounter cards (which are smaller than the room cards) equal to the battle size of the floor/room they are on.  The encounter cards can include everything from the monsters themselves, to traps and curses that affect a character negatively, to positive boons, and any number of special training (which allows the characters to have a class analogous to the genre they are currently fighting in, or a DNA transformation that allows them to do something very similar with their &quot;race&quot; (includes standard fantasy races in floors 1-2, &quot;horror&quot; races like vampires and werewolves in floor 3, and so on...).  If a character draws the number of encounter cards required and ends up not having to fight a battle equal to the battle size of the room/floor, other players can add additional monsters to increase the battle up to the battle size.  Other players can also play cards to strengthen either side.  Multiple monsters add to each other's strengths, and special other cards allow players to add monsters beyond the maximum battle size.  Players can also negotiate another player's help if the other player is on the same floor.  Battles are fought by rolling a d12, and adding the result to each side's total strength.&#10;&#10;If a monster is defeated, the player who is playing his turn may find a special floor artifact (each of which adds to a character's strength) if the monster was sufficiently powerful enough.  In order to enter the top floor, the players need a certain amount of artifacts from each floor below.  Monsters also drop loot, and players can pick up a certain amount of loot each turn.  Other players can also swerve in to raid a large loot pile.  Loot can include anything that could be considered treasure: equipment that add to character strength, free artifacts, temporary power-ups (like grenades and pixie dust), protection items, and items that are otherwise worthless but are value at high currency (totaled for points in the end).  If a player doesn't fight a battle in a room he's entered, he can draw additional encounter cards for future (or immediate) use.&#10;&#10;Once a player has acquired a certain number of artifacts from each floor, he can enter the top floor, where the Master Geek resides.  Battles there are tougher than any other floor, and draw from the monsters that the players might have encountered previously on every other floor.  The players might also encounter the Master Geek himself, who's obviously a lot stronger than those tougher battles.  If a player manages to defeat him, the tower starts crumbling (one room/stairway is removed at the end of each player's turn), and the players' goal is to then escape the falling tower).&#10;&#10;A twist is that there's an insanely powerful psycho-killer who's always stalking the strongest player (changing targets if that position is taken by another player).  He only moves 2 rooms per turn cycle (each player can always move 3), but if he catches you, it's very bad news.  It's very likely he'll kill the character [i]and[/i] drain him of several artifacts (other monsters can kill you as well, but he's the one that'll probably have the easiest time doing it).  He's still stalking you once the tower starts crumbling, and very likely, he'll be standing between your characters and the exit.  If a player dies, they respawn at the entrance, but leave all their equipment and items as loot in the last room they were in (free for other players to raid, or to get lost in the crumbling of the tower at the end).&#10;&#10;When all characters have exited the tower successfully after the defeat of the Master Geek, points are calculated, factoring in: 1) the amount of treasure/equipment a player has retained, 2) how many other players the player beat to the exit, 3) how many artifacts the player has acquired, 4) whether or not the player was the one to defeat the Master Geek, and 5) if the player defeated the Psycho.  Whoever is found to have the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

When a player reaches a city you can decide in which of the four quarter finals to place him, provided the tournament isn't already full.&#10;&#10;When all players have arrived at the location the tournament begins. The winner of each match is determined through the best of 5 sets. A set is won when a players manages to roll a 6 (professional players have two on their dice, amateurs only one). The winners of a match advance to the next stage which is resolved in the same manner.&#10;&#10;After the final match, the four best players receive prize money according to the prize table and can also collect one marketing contract each. Those can be cashed in after a tournament to obtain additional money, either individually or in matching sets while sets are much more valuable.&#10;&#10;",

Players take three actions per round, which can include moving one space, move a minion one space, initiate an attack by minions on other players' minions, moving a minion from base to a device card (represents researching and devoting resources to developing the device) producing a minion in the current space, drawing a card, or playing a card. Alternatively, a traveler may spend all three actions to travel forward or backward in time to the same site in that era.&#10;&#10;Cards include various attack and defense and minion production bonuses, devices to research and produce including bombs that destroy chunks of SpaceTime, with most of the damage propagating down the timeline, Isolator belts that allow you to convert minions into new travelers (giving you more pieces and actions to work with),  and various instant travel and event cards.&#10;&#10;",

Each player rolls 1 die and moves around the board landing on (spotting) various animals that you might find in the English countryside. Once spotted the player gets a card depicting the animal, which they collect and at the end add up to give a final score. There is a 100 point bonus for the 1st person to finish. There are also red arrows that if landed on give either a penalty ranging from -5 to -15 or a bonus of +5 to +15. The player picks one of these card from the stack and they may contain bonus plants &amp; animals or a penalty for littering, leaving gates open or other contraventions of the 'countryside code'.&#10;&#10;This game came with no printed box - just a plain white card sleeve. Inside is a plastic tray, 1 board, set of rules, x1 6 sided die, 4 player counters (coloured tidily winks), x30 penalty and bonus cards for landing on red arrows, 24 animal cards, 1 100 point wining bonus card, and black card tiles to cover animals that have been spotted by players on the board.&#10;&#10;History - I believe it was bought from the RSPB shop (The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) UK, which is based a few miles from where I lived when I was younger. It seem it may have been a short test run of games - or only sold direct by the RSPB -&#10;&#10;The game has stayed at my parents and is played a lot by grandchildren and adults when we get together. The game works well, with a slight imbalance in the second half of the board, or if you use the bonus points card - that lead people to race round the board.&#10;&#10;",

In contrast to Assault of the Dead: Tactics has a character building system (that includes Perks, Weapons, and Survival kits) as well as support for solo play.&#10;&#10;Assault of the Dead: Tactics is set in a fictional zombie-infested city called Cloverdale. The game's story follows through scenarios, unfolding part of the city map allowing the players to explore new and dangerous areas. As the story progresses, you and your allies discover a sinister effect behind the zombie outbreak.&#10;&#10;The game-play of Assault of the Dead: Tactics differs in several key areas;  Characters move on a battlefield composed of circular tiles; movement and actions are determined by the character's Perks, Weapons, and Survival Kits he carries. Battles are low luck; a character can use any number of actions to attack, with attacks always hitting. During battle, whenever an attack is made, dice rolls determine the number of damage points the character can 'spend' on hits and weapon crits. Deal enough hits, and the Zombie is defeated leaving behind a Survival token -- used to buy actions or resupply your character.&#10;&#10;Like the original Assault of the Dead: Tactics adjusts the level of reaction from the Zombie side based on how well the characters are doing. Do well and the game spawns more zombies, makes them aggressive, and more powerful. Do poorly, the game will end your misery soon enough.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll and move along the game board, triggering various events that include having to quickly look up answers in a book named Mega Express. Along the way they pick up votes to be used in the end game, which takes place after an arbitrary agreed-upon period of time (the rules suggest half an hour or an hour). Each player now casts their accumulated votes either for or against joining the EU, and the totals are added up to show the outcome; the rules envision several concurrent games, the votes from each session being added up to a grand total. It should be noted that the book required for proper use of the game was not packaged with it, may not accompany copies found in thrift shops, and may be difficult to obtain.&#10;&#10;",

There are three different categories:&#10;&#10;Extreme! : All players vote which one of two contrary characteristics on a Extreme!card fits most to the character of the active player. The two characteristics are either both negative or both positive, so everybody is forced to give a honest vote for the more fitting characteristic.&#10;&#10;Hey, that&acute;s You!: All players point at each other simultaneously, voting who at the game table fits most to a given attribute.&#10;&#10;Top or Flop: A situation is described on a card. The active player has to describe how he/she would solve it. The other players vote (by showing thumb up/down simultaneously) if they think his answer is honest and fits to his character.&#10;&#10;As a very important aspect of the game, players act a lot with their hands while playing: swinging the fists, counting aloud, pointing fingers on other player, showing thumbs up/down and declaring counting-out rhymes together. So there is always action at the game table.&#10;&#10;Gef&auml;hrlich Ehrlich is not just a fun game but also a kind of tool to find out more about how other people look at you and what kind of character they think you are.&#10;&#10;",

Plan Red, the strategy for war with Britain, included sub-plans for conflict with British Dominions. War with Australia, code-named Plan Scarlet, would be a purely naval affair.&#10;&#10;U.S. Navy Plan Scarlet is a 64-page book supplement to the Great War at Sea series, focusing on the battles that could have taken place in the Central Pacific.&#10;&#10;There are 25 scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that could have taken place under various nations' war plans: Australian raiders threatening American supply lines, Japanese moves against Australian-held ports, a Japanese forward strategy, and much more. And of course the thorough background articles you've come to expect from our supplements.&#10;&#10;This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Pacific Crossroads, Jutland, Cruiser Warfare, Black Waters  and Sea of Troubles or U.S. Navy Plan Red to play most of the scenarios, and U.S. Navy Plan Gold and 1898 or Remember the Maine to enjoy them all.&#10;&#10;",

After the performance the audience will be cross examined on what they have observed and will be asked to solve the mystery.&quot;&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;Detecto-Plays contains 6 short plays that are intended to be fleshed out by a small cast.  At the end the audience will be asked by the director ten questions.  Each question that is answered correctly is worth 10 points.  Wrong or incomplete answers are worth nothing.  Some of them are single scenes plays, some have as many as six scenes.&#10;&#10;This appears to be a very early version of modern murder-mystery party games. It's unusual in that the scenarios and dialogs were written by two playwrights that were producing work for New York theatres at the time.&#10;&#10;One of the scenarios also includes a game within the game as the actors play a game called &quot;murder&quot; which appears to be a popular  party game at the time, similar to &quot;Are you a werewolf?&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The first release contains a story booklet describing exciting super hero action and adventure on the faraway planet of Cetus. You&rsquo;ll meet legends like Star Warrior and Thantos and evil villains like Krakan and Ghengis Khan!&#10;&#10;Included with the story booklet are playing cards representing the heroes and villains of COTG in a super hero motif. You receive 6 cards, plus blank templates to create your own characters.&#10;&#10;Part 2 of this Champions of the Galaxy story is scheduled for release in December and Part 3 (final part) in July 2011.&#10;&#10;Cetus has been attacked by the military forces of General Krakan. How will the top military brass on Cetus respond? Players can use the provided story or develop their own plots as you set up battles of good and evil. Each character is represented by a card with different attacks and defensive moves. Similar to the original Champions of the Galaxy card game, you roll on one of three offensive levels trying to wear down your opponent. The opponent won't go down without a fight, so if they happen to roll a comeback defensive move, they take over on offense. The fight goes back and forth until one fighter is defeated. New to COTG is the idea of fighting more epic battles with multiple opponents. You can have Star Warrior take on a group of Sentry Bots where he must defeat all the enemies to win. If he loses, will Supernova take over to conquer evil. Its up you in Battle for Cetus since its your story.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;&#207;&#140;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;&#225;&#191;&#150;&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.&#10;&#10;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements of the city of Thessalonica in Greece.&#10;&#10;",

The game generates the scenario by way of considering player&rsquo;s enthusiasm for being the attacker and his leanings in events. The basic unit is the infantry battalion. All mechanisms use standard 6 sided dice. Usually along the lines of  'three bases shooting, therefore roll 3 dice'. No paper record keeping. Casualties, disorder etc is shown by adding markers to the unit. Game usually last about 6 turns.  Played on a 5 x 3 foot table. Measurements in inches.  Musket range 10&quot;. Units are motivated and then use action points. Victory is based upon objectives, destructions and ground.  WA only covers AWI. Peculiar to this set are off table flankers, riflemen, Indians and a lot of scenery. A typical army might consist of 9 foot units, 1 cavalry unit, 1 field gun and 4 mounted commanders.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to defeat enemy companies by moving miniatures around on a gaming area that represents a battlefield (a table is enough). Fighters&rsquo; actions (moving, attacking, and so on) are simulated with the use of a deck of cards. Victory is gained through a subtle mix of chance and cunning. Imagination and strategy are key here!&#10;&#10;Aarklash Warpack is a game meant for two or more players ages twelve and over.&#10;A game lasts roughly 30 minutes (rules reading included).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the wake of the Great War, a new arms race loomed. The United States and Japan each trusted in a strong navy to achieve future security and retain political influence. Within three years of the Treaty of Versailles, no less than twenty-five new battleships and battlecruisers had been ordered by the two powers, exactly equal to the number already in commission at the end of the War.&#10;&#10;The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 was meant, among other things, to put an end to increased militarization in the Pacific; but by feeding into Japanese resentment and heightening American fears, it could achieve no more than to delay the inevitable conflict. Had things gone differently, it might not have even done that much...&#10;&#10;Emphasizing simple game mechanics and fast gameplay without sacrificing historical accuracy, each entry in the Grand Admiral line stands alone. However, the core game mechanics remain constant, allowing players to combine ships from different products to create new scenarios and explore any number of &quot;what-if&quot; situations.&#10;&#10;Although designed as a hex-n-counter board game, Grand Admiral can be easily adapted to tabletop play using any scale of naval miniatures. So, raise the battle ensign, sound general quarters, and damn the torpedoes -- your destiny awaits!&#10;&#10;Grand Admiral: Flashpoint Orange includes the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Grand Admiral rulebook&#10;     150 full-color counters* representing nearly all American and Japanese forces as of 1922&#10;     Data sheets listing 150 individually-named ships, representing over 50 different classes, from destroyers to super-dreadnoughts&#10;     17 by 22 game board &#10;&#10;&#10;* Requires some assembly.&#10;&#10;(Publisher blurb)&#10;&#10;",
