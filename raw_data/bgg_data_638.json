    "Description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;&#207;&#140;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;&#225;&#191;&#150;&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.&#10;&#10;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;This is a re-themed version of Monopoly sporting St Louis Landmarks.&#10;&#10;",

Along the way the players must answer questions and can save for a bigger ship or a permit. &#10;  &#10;But that's not without a struggle. Players can encounter, severe turbulence, a license check by the water police, vehicle breakdown or they have to wait for an open bridge.

This game tries to teach some of those rules.&#10;&#10;",

Wars are fought by mechs, giant robots, remotely controlled from far-away bases, with the riders of these giant mechs completely out of harms way.&#10;&#10;Nonetheless, your commanding officers have a job for you. A job putting you in the line of real danger. Intel suggests that the enemy has amassed a large force, and put them ashore outside your capital in the midst of night. Their mission? To launch nuclear missiles at your nations leader, and every monument in your capital.&#10;&#10;Our engineers have sent out a signal that interrupts the mech's connection with their home base, causing them to wander meanlessly around.&#10;&#10;Now, you must sneak out to destroy each of the enemies' mechs, before they are powered up and ready to launch.But be careful.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sneak Attack is a free, print-to-play game designed for the &quot;sneaky sci-fi game contest&quot;.&#10;During play, you will move around a hexagonal board depicting a battlefield.

    "Description": "A efficiency engine/resource management collectible card game that is so similar to Magic: the Gathering that rather then providing a description of the game on it's own merits the pubslisher just lists how it's  different from other CCGs (i.e. Magic):&#10;&#10;How is Conquest Different From Other CCGs?&#10;&#10;1. Faster pace. With 2 resources acquired per term (most every other CCG is 1) plus the ability to barter 1 resource and acquire a third resource each term, every term is exciting and brings new twists into the fray. Never suffer through another, &quot;Draw a land. My turn is over&quot; term again.&#10;&#10;2. Multi-region system. With 4 location regions per commander and a central battlefield region, you have far more options and therefore strategy is kicker. Like in a game of chess, in Conquest you need to think about positioning for your units. In most card games, it's simply your army vs. your opponent's army, 2 regions, and whether to attack or defend is a very simple matter of arithmetic.&#10;&#10;3. Various strategies to pursue. Because locations and upgrades, commanders' sources of income, are vulnerable to attack and destruction, commanders have more options for how to seek a victory--a straight out offensive on the enemy domain to flat-out win or a more subtle wearing down of the opponent's income. Also, with 2 types of income (gold and mana), you can try to isolate one of these sources to cripple the opponent's army.&#10;&#10;",

Cards may also be played to weaken or devolve the opponent monsters.&#10;The monster ending the battle with the highest rating wins.&#10;&#10;Each starter contains 34 cards and one gold embossed card and one special &quot;hologram&quot; card. Rules and battlemat are combined in a single mapfold sheet.&#10;&#10;The Upper Deck release of the Digimon game in 2000 appears to use slightly modified cards as this with similar rules.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most stock of a particular company in his possession acts as the president of this company and is responsible for track laying, the placement of railheads (which are necessary for train runs), route selection and train acquisition. Running trains earns money and this money is either divided by the shareholders or kept in the company's treasure for further investments (like buying better trains or constructing track). This decision influences the value of the company's shares - and not the player with the most stock or the most beautiful constructed track wins the game, but the player with the most riches in terms of cash and shares.&#10;&#10;The subtitle on the box is &quot;Quickies for 1830 players&quot;. It uses mostly elements from 1830 and 1835, but introduces two new features: There is a &lsquo;purple phase&rsquo; after the &lsquo;grey phase&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;grey phase&rsquo; introduces city tiles with only one token space (tokens from the replaced brown tiles are all returned to their respective owning companies for future use).&#10;&#10;All maps are playable in 2 to 4 hours, and most of them are especially tested for a 2-player game (in case of a 2-player game, the usual 60% holding limit in a company is lifted, if you buy additional shares from the bank pool).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From publisher's website:&#10;&#10;First Contact is a supplement to 5150, the original set of sci-fi rules from Two Hour Wargames. First Contact revolves around a rebellion on a small planet where the colonists have decided to break away from their home world. It documents the war between Earth and her first colony, Mars. &#10;But what starts out as a local conflict erupts into something larger as the rebels, known as the Sahadeen, receive help from an unexpected source, the ever-expanding empire of Gaea Prime.&#10;&#10;First Contact incorporates the Earth Force and Sahadeen into 5150. We've documented the three stages of the conflict and have provided six linked scenarios into a mini-campaign. First Contact can be played solo against the game mechanics (or against the machine as we like to call it), cooperatively where all players are on the same side against the machine or competitively against your friends. And it can be played from either side.&#10;Ideal for use with the 15mm range of Sci Fi figures from Rebel Minis, First Contact can be used with any figures you may already have.&#10;&#10;5150: First Contact is not a stand alone game. You must have 5150 to play.&#10;&#10;",

On one plane we have a typical chessboard; on the other plane (Dimension X) we have a board inhabited by strange trans-dimensional chess pieces in the form of snakes, spiders and crabs.  These creatures can leave Dimension X, and also return&#10;to it...&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules of the game are simple. The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king. You start with 2 chess boards next to each other. On one board, you play a normal chess game, making 1 move per turn. On the other board each player has 3 short range pieces - creatures with strange powers - that may only move in Dimension X and only attack in our dimension. Each player, during his or her turn, also either moves one of the Dimension X creatures on the second board, crosses between dimensions, or attacks with a creature in our dimension.&#10;&#10;This is a most unusual 3D chess variant that quite literally adds a whole other level of tactics and strategy to chess, with a twist.&#10;&#10;",

The dealer takes a new card and discards any unwanted card from his hand to the player to his or her left. That player then discards to the left and play continues (the dealer continuing to pick up and discard) with the last player forming a discard pile in front of them. When a player collects a set of four, that player grabs a pizza box from the center of the table. There is always one fewer pizza boxes than there are players, so each round eliminates one player. Last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;",

Within its fifty square miles the US suffered more casualties than anywhere else. The H&uuml;rtgen Forest was a densely packed hell of tree-bursting artillery and machinegun fire. It was a trap where the infantrymen of the Allied First Army fool heartedly walked into. Virtually unsupported by armor and artillery, the numerically superior American forces would dash themselves against the hardened defenses of Hitler&rsquo;s West Wall.&#10;&#10;The Big Hurt is a supplement for NUTS! - 2nd Edition. Although intended to be played from the American side, The Big Hurt play's just as well from the German side. The Big Hurt can be played solo, cooperatively with all players on the same side or head-to-head.&#10;Packed with 21 linked scenarios, this book covers a variety of small-unit and medium sized actions through the four months of the H&uuml;rtgen meat grinder.&#10;Track down German infiltrators.

    "Description": "Gackerei ums H&uuml;hnerei is a easy fun game for children. Players are sitting on  5 &quot;egg&quot; cards, which are placed top down on their chair. A dice is rolled and shows if a red, yellow or blue biddy should be hatched. Simutaniously all players uncover their eggs to find the right biddy and place it in the nest. &#10;The fastest player gets his egg as a VP and takes abother egg to place on it his chair.&#10;But there can also be a fox around. So be aware...&#10;&#10;Die Spieler legen jeweils f&uuml;nf Eier-Karten verdeckt auf ihren Stuhl, setzen sich drauf und br&uuml;ten! Der W&uuml;rfel zeigt an, ob ein rotes, gelbes oder blaues K&uuml;ken ausgebr&uuml;tet werden soll. Jetzt ist Reaktion gefragt! Die Kinder schauen schnell nacheinander unter ihre Eier, ob sich ein solches K&uuml;ken dort verbirgt. Hat ein Spieler ein passendes K&uuml;ken gefunden, legt er es rasch ins Nest auf den Tisch, h&auml;lt seine Hand dar&uuml;ber und gackert laut. Aber aufgepasst! Deckt ein Spieler einen Fuchs auf und legt ihn ins Nest, dann ruft er laut: Vorsicht, Fuchs! Alle Spieler m&uuml;ssen m&ouml;glichst schnell ihre Hand auf das Nest legen. Wer am langsamsten ist, muss ein Ei abgeben.&#10; [www.kosmos.de]&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introduction&#10;&#10;You drew the short straw on Space Ranger duty today - your Federation of Planets scout ship was assigned to Sneakius IV, the most dangerous planet in the entire universe.  And in keeping with your luck, your ship encountered a mysterious space storm and crashed!&#10;&#10;Sneakius IV is crammed full of every kind of lethal predator and deadly parasite that you could imagine... and you'll have to use your imagination because no survey team has ever survived the onslaught of ravenous beasties to file a report.  Your only hope is to try to make it across unknown terrain past horrible monsters to an escape shuttle at the abandoned ecology survey station.  But if you're caught on the way, you'll end up as lunch.  So, tread carefully Space Ranger... and pray you don't taste too delicious.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Abstract&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of characters moving from a crash site location to an abandoned ecology station using point to point movement.  The first player to reach the ecology station is the winner.  As players move their pawns through locations, they must roll a die to avoid detection by alien monsters represented by tokens.  If detected, they must fight.  Individual players use characters with individual strengths and weaknesses and player powers, helping them avoid or defeat monsters.  Each round, events on cards cause more monsters to spawn and regulate monster movement around the game board.&#10;&#10;Additional Information&#10;&#10;This game is an entry to the contest Sneaky Sci Fi Game Design Contest.&#10;&#10;",

Most of the time you will be better off relying on your engines to maneuver you out of sight of the enemy subs.&#10;&#10;",

There are 63 spaces, which depict kings and emperors of France from the year 420 to 1859, and eagles. In the middle is a larger picture of the 'Famille Imp&eacute;riale' (Emperor Napoleon III, emperor from 1852-1870, with wife and son). Title and Rules of the Game are in Dutch, the text with the pictures is in French. In the four corners there are pictures of acts of war with the subscripts 'En Afrique'; 'En Crim&eacute;e'; 'En Italie'; 'En Chine.&#10;&#10;Rule of the game&#10;&#10;This game is played with two dice and goes from 1 to 63. Everyone throws [the dice] in turn, and puts something on the place that his number of pips indicates, with the second throw you move the number of spaces indicated by the number of pips in the throw, etc.&#10;&#10;Whoever lands on number 63, the imperial family, wins the game and gets the pot. Before the start of the game, everyone agrees on an amount to put in the pot, and what the fines will be that have to be payed at every 'hinderpaal' (obstacle) or 'ontmoeting' (encounter) that either hinders progress or makes you change places, for example, if you throw 6, you pay a fine and go to 12.&#10;If you land on 19, you are resting in the hotel, you pay the fine that was predetermined and you have to pass for 1 turn.&#10;If you land on 31, where St.Louis is taken prisoner of war, you pay the fine and have to stay in the space until someone else is taken in your place.&#10;If you land on 42, you are in the imperial garden, you pay the fine and go back to 39 (it may say 30, I can't tell).&#10;If you land on 52, where the iron mask is in prison, you have to pay [the fine] and stay there until you are released again.&#10;If you land on 58, Napoleon II at Solferino, you have to pay [the fine] and start from the beginning (written is '= 24 june 1859').&#10;Whoever is passed by another player, has to pay and go to that players number.&#10;Whoever throws a 6 and 3 at the start of the game, goes to 26 the trophee, and whoever throws 5 and 4, goes to 53, the crown (not sure if I see the numbers right).&#10;&#10;If you land on an eagle, you go forward again the number of pips you threw on the dice (this will happen again if you land on another eagle). If you would pass 63 this way, you count back so many spaces as you have movement left over.&#10;&#10;",

The difference between the hand scores is the total net yardage gained or lost by the offensive player. The football peg is then moved the appropriate distance on the field.

You fly around the game board in your company jet, carrying a well-stuffed moneybag - but the money isn&rsquo;t yours.. yet. &#10;As a serious and highly paid &quot;CEO&quot; you have a lot of chores; hiring a new secretary, whose business qualifications spring from her weeklong experience as a Hooters waitress, convincing the SEC that a couple of late night phone calls do not qualify as insider trading, but are simply a question of friendly talk between collegues, and maintaining your expensive friendship with the local politicians. Of course you also have to be on top of the latest news from the various business' you are involved in, which means chatting up other &quot;CEO's&quot; on luxury cruises. On your way, you encounter the chance to do alittle trading, spend the Company's money on luxury items and maybe have a run-in with the IRS or the SEC. So before you get to fly to Cayman, your moneybag may have inflated or deflated &ndash; or you may even be forced to exchange your moneybag with another &quot;CEO&quot;.&#10;&#10;You are ready to retire (have won the game) when you have put away 150 Million on your private Cayman Islands account.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Defenders of the Realm: The Dragon Expansion provides the means to ramp up, ease up, expand and customize your Defenders of the Realm gaming experience in a variety of ways. The three new Dragon Generals (Onyx - black, Hemlock - green, Brimstone - red) can be used with Sapphire, the original blue Dragon, in a struggle that will severely test the mettle of the Heroes of the Realm. The new General card for Sapphire gives her an additional hit point for each other Dragon in play.&#10;&#10;You can also mix and match the new Generals with the existing Generals. The new Generals minions' each have their own special abilities:&#10;&#10;     Onyx's (black) Zealots go berserk when fighting - the survivors together dealing one point of damage after each combat action. You'll still take a wound from each if you remain in the same area with them at the end of your turn.&#10;     Hemlock's (green) Imps propagate quickly (whenever you place an Imp, another one pops up in every adjacent space) and steal a random card from you if you remain in the same space with them at the end of your turn.&#10;     Brimstone's (red) Fire Elementals spontaneously combust whenever three of them get together, setting the area on fire. Areas on fire require 2 Actions to move into, taint whenever three minions are present, instead of 4 and deal wounds to Heroes remaining in the area at the end of their turns.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Generals each have their own special nastiness as well. For example, Brimstone, instead of moving along the usual red-General path, moves every time her card comes up when Darkness Spreads, flitting here and there and setting the world on fire. Players can lose cards when attacking Hemlock.&#10;&#10;Any of the new dragons can also be used as an Agent of the Dark Lord when playing with at least one of the original Generals (Varkolak, Gorgut, or Balazarg). You can add up to 5 of the 10 Global Effects Cards (5 Good, 5 Bad) to the Darkness Spreads deck to adjust the toughness of your campaign. Likewise, a number of Royal Blessing Tokens (4 max) can also be added to the game. Royal Blessings allow players to either ignore a Darkness Spreads card, remove a taint crystal or prevent a General from moving.&#10;&#10;For a more Campaign-style game, players can utilize the King's Champion Scoring Variant which allows players to track their feats, major and minor. Feat examples include: taking on 3 minions at once, killing two with one blow, attempting to complete a quest, successfully completing a quest, healing the land, putting out a fire, dealing wounds or the killing blow to a General... The player with the most fame at the end of the game becomes the King's Champion. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th most famous Heroes also receive titles and awards. The titles and awards each provide a special ability to that character that can be utilized the next time it is played by the same player.&#10;&#10;Scheduled to debut at Spiel 2010 is the Dragon Expansion (formerly the Black Dragon expansion), which consists of the following:&#10;&#10;3 General Miniatures (3 Dragons) &#10;3 New General Cards&#10;1 New Sapphire (Blue Dragon) General Card&#10;4 Wound Tokens 1 for each General &#10;3 Agents of the Dark Lord Cards&#10;10 Fire Tokens &#10;4 Royal Blessing Tokens&#10;1 Royal Blessing Card &#10;12 New Quest Cards&#10;10 Global Effects Cards &#10;1 Fame Card&#10;6 New Special Cards &#10;New Darkness Spreads Deck&#10;New Hero Cards Deck &#10;King&rsquo;s Champion Variant Scoring Tokens &#10;7 Kings Champion Reward Cards&#10;Rulebook and A Story from the Realm&#10;&#10;",

The cards or objects are then turned face down and scrambled.  The challenge is then to pick out where one of the objects is now positioned.  It's flipped over and the guess is either correct or not.&#10;&#10;Variations of this &quot;honest&quot; version are now commonly shown on the big screens of sporting events.&#10;&#10;The &quot;confidence&quot; version of Three-Card Monte actually uses 4 cards.  The dealer uses a palming technique to make a card switch, so that the player can't find the correct card.  This method is a rigged game, which often involves the use of a shill to create the illusion the game can be won.&#10;&#10;",

The basic mechanics and gameplay of the original game are unchanged, as players build track and deliver goods to increase their income and earn points, but the expansion also includes new pieces and rules. These extras may optionally be used with this expansion as well as with the base game and all other expansions.&#10;&#10;This expansion is also compatible with Railroad Tycoon.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fantasy Chess is a blend of Traditional Chess and miniatures or role-playing game mechanics where you can co-occupy squares and use dice to determine capture outcomes.&#10;&#10;Develop new strategies and alter old ones as you experience familiar chess from a whole new angle.&#10;&#10;Traditional King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn pieces that move and check the same as traditional chess, but may move through their own ranks, carry pieces, fight for squares (with dice and statistic sheet) and MORE!&#10;&#10;Start off with the basic game that teaches how to co-occupy squares (you can have up to three of your own pieces in square) and how to fight for the square (attack the enemy piece using two six sided die against your own dexterity.  If you inflict damage, it lowers the enemy piece's life points.)  If several pieces are in a combat square, they all get an attack.  If it doesn't resolve in one swing each, then combat is continued in the next person's turn.  This means that you can send in re-inforcements.  Each piece class has different dexterity and hit points and some have armor.  All of this is listed on an easy to read stat sheet with bubbles to fill in for damage.&#10;&#10;Check is handled in traditional style of check and checkmate.  But there are times when you can actually go head to head with the king in his square and check mate him.&#10;&#10;The advanced game includes 4 more rules:&#10;&#10;    Withdrawal (escaping from a combat square)&#10;    Healing (Bishops and Queens can heal damaged pieces)&#10;    Forced Retreat (Queens can kick other pieces out of her square)&#10;    Carrying (Knights can carry a pawn or a bishop and Rooks can carry anything except another rook or the king)&#10;&#10;&#10;In Advanced Tournament Games, winning pieces are declared veteran and they go up a rank either getting more hit points, do more damage or improve dexterity.&#10;&#10;Fantasy Chess has the capacity for 4 player games.&#10;Bump two Fantasy Chess boards next to each other and play ally with your partner with full use of both boards as you try to checkmate your opponents.&#10;&#10;This can even be expanded into a 5+ player game by either bumping more boards together or having a Game Master who can run some home rule creature pieces as interference or aid to the two main players.  Try putting two rows of squares as a forest between the two boards.&#10;&#10;A Chess game where your Knights can charge from Castles, Bishops can heal the injured, Six piece battles can be fought in a square, and you can bludgeon a King to death!&#10;&#10;You can obtain Fantasy Chess&reg; from the official website:  www.shadowhex.com or at [www.kickstarter.com/projects/869058411/fantasy-chess-a-fight-for-the-square-chess-variant] until 7 Nov 2011.&#10;&#10;",
