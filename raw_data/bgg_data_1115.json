The German plan was to launch a two-pronged attack to secure a defensive zone for the Lake Balaton oilfields in northern Hungary. The offensive failed in the face of Soviet resistance, and the ensuing Red Army offensive swept into Vienna. While historically, the situation was dismal for the Third Reich, the objective is for players to do better than their historical counterparts. Each side is divided into two sub-commands. For the Axis, this includes the Nord Armee Kommando and Sud Armee Kommando, for the Soviets, the Third Ukrainian and parts of Second Ukrainian Fronts, as well as a Bulgarian army and a Yugoslav corps. The scenario starts on 6 March 1945 (the opening of Spring Awakening) and carries through to 16 April (following the Soviet capture of Vienna). Each game turn represents one week of operations. Each hex is 18 kilometers across. Most ground units are corps, representing two to five divisions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tin is the most precious commodity in this age of trains. It has become so valuable and scarce that obtaining a monopoly of the resource will cause the other companies to close their doors leaving no one as your competition.&#10;&#10;Players move their trains across the map (randomly placed every game) to complete deliveries which brings them closer to victory. But there are lots of obstacles in your way. The land can be harsh and slow you down, or even cause your train to break down, setting you back while others take the lead. Can you plan your moves with the contracts you get to be the most efficient at obtaining tin? If you can complete 10 deliveries then you own the monopoly on tin, and win the game.&#10;&#10;Tin Rails was a part of the 2018 Mint Tin Design Contest. It took first place in Best Rule Book and made top 10 in all other categories.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each dice are related to things like: type of photo, action, attitude, and what to upload to Instagram. The combination will dictate the challenge. There is fifth dice dice (video dice) that is rolled in some particular results.&#10;&#10;Once the dice result is settled, you have 1 minute to complete the challenge using your smartphone camera app. The faster you are, the better.

The objective is to be the first to reach 100 points, which players earn by depositing Payload Tokens at &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; (in fact, the real planets, dwarf planets, moons, moonlets, asteroids, and comets of our Solar System) hidden randomly underneath the 150 circular tiles which form the playing surface. In addition to these worlds are also &ldquo;empty space&rdquo; tiles featuring images from the Hubble Space Telescope and &ldquo;hazard&rdquo; tiles which pose danger to passing spacecraft.&#10;&#10;Each round players receive an income of 2 telescope tokens plus 4 tokens in a combination of their choice: telescopes, fuel, or payload. Telescope tokens allow players to sneak a peek at the identities of tiles before anyone else. Fuel tokens enable spacecraft to launch, move around the playing surface, and land. Payload tokens allow players to earn points, and can be used to displace other players from their spots on worlds.&#10;&#10;By managing income efficiently and making wise choices about where to deploy their fleet, players accumulate points and move their score markers along a track. The first to reach 100 points wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Moreover, each day, the chairman of the chamber reveals a situation card, based on current affairs in Hong Kong, such as a typhoon, which affects different players' abilities to vote.&#10;&#10;The artwork features caricatures of contemporary figures in the Hong Kong government and legislature.&#10;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#165;&#189;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#230;&#149;&#184;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#229;&#152;&#133;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#229;&#174;&#181;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#228;&#187;&#138;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#229;&#149;&#166;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#136;&#145;&#229;&#147;&#139;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#233;&#187;&#168;&#228;&#187;&#138;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#230;&#137;&#147;&#229;&#152;&#133;&#231;&#148;&#162;&#229;&#147;&#129;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#228;&#191;&#130;&#229;&#145;&#162;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#172;&#190;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#232;&#173;&#176;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#229;&#187;&#179;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#136;&#145;&#229;&#147;&#139;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#232;&#167;&#146;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#229;&#140;&#133;&#232;&#163;&#157;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#231;&#148;&#177;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#233;&#183;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#144;&#188;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#232;&#172;&#130;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#229;&#189;&#162;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#165;&#184;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#177;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#156;&#190;&#232;&#173;&#176;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#232;&#183;&#175;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#232;&#186;&#171;&#230;&#157;&#145;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#229;&#143;&#138;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#230;&#174;&#138;&#232;&#167;&#146;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#144;&#152;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#231;&#157;&#135;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#230;&#176;&#180;&#230;&#153;&#182;&#231;&#144;&#131;&#229;&#152;&#133;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#232;&#150;&#175;&#231;&#137;&#135;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#136;&#134;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#229;&#152;&#133;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#141;&#160;&#229;&#149;&#164;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#128;&#151;&#232;&#153;&#159;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#229;&#152;&#133;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#233;&#132;&#186;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#141;&hellip;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#230;&#173;&#164;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#145;&#229;&#147;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#166;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#233;&#166;&#153;&#230;&#184;&#175;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#230;&#148;&#190;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#232;&#163;&#161;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#229;&#142;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#128;&#159;&#229;&#176;&#191;&#233;&#129;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#171;&#232;&#153;&#159;&#233;&#162;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#131;&#230;&#176;&#180;&#230;&#181;&#184;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#233;&#153;&#144;&#229;&#136;&#182;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#152;&#133;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#229;&#128;&#153;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#230;&#156;&#131;&#230;&#156;&#131;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#229;&#190;&#174;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#233;&#130;&#170;&#229;&#176;&#141;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#163;&#129;&#229;&#163;&#152;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#147;&#231;&#160;&#180;&#231;&#140;&#156;&#229;&#191;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#228;&#186;&#146;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#141;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#176;&#141;&#230;&#138;&#151;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

But some big guns are on his tail, including Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp.&#10;&#10;In an era where there's a fine line between an outlaw and a lawman, you have to know who your real friends are and who has your back.

Once the Kid is revealed, the game explodes into a wild west chase and shootout!&#10;&#10;In the first part of the game, players pick through a deck of cards to build a good hand and to investigate the other players. When they play a card, they can ask a question or look at someone's hand or do other actions to try and determine who is who at the table. After the characters are revealed, you play special cards to try and arrest the outlaw. But it won't be easy to arrest the Kid as he has special escape cards, pistols and a little TNT!&#10;&#10;If Billy the Kid (or any Outlaw) is alive at the end of 7 rounds and has at least one Gold card, he wins the game. If the Kid eliminates the Lawmen, he wins the game. If the Lawmen eliminate the Kid (or all Outlaws), they win the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Get Billy the Kid! is the second in the 'Get!' series. Get Adler! Deduction Card Game was the first. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Game play revolves attack and production cards. Attack cards cause an opponent to have their eggs, chicks or hens supply diminished. They can also send predators to attack them using the Special Ops cards. Egg laying and Upgrades allow you to expand your side's supplies and personnel.&#10;&#10;Between both coops lies the Tufts. The Tufts are the area where the eggs roll from the coop and sit there till somebody is brave enough to send a chick down to retrieve them. Players send chicks down to guard the tufts and wait till they are &quot;filled&quot; and return them back to their egg supply.&#10;&#10;A solo variant is included with the game. The In-famous Coop War of Gutterman's Gulch was an entry in the 2018 Mint Tin Contest.&#10;&#10;",

These giants of earth and stone built the land, made it lush or barren, for reasons unknown to the smaller folk.&#10;&#10;Titans of Dsyx is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write game that takes place in the Legends of Dsyx fantasy setting. Players take on the role of Dsyx's legendary Titans, pre-historic and semi-legendary giants who terraformed the land and created the world as we know it.&#10;&#10;Starting from any spot on the board, players roll dice to create different features of terrain and civilization, setting down hills, rivers, and towns on an empty map. But far from a sterile, lifeless environment, these features all react to each other, synergizing to create larger and larger terrain features, catalyzing each others' growth or destruction, or even calling down fiery meteors from the sky. Each completed feature is worth points, positive or negative, and oftentimes based on the proximity or presence of other features.&#10;&#10;But the Age of the Titans is at its twilight, and the dawn of the age of the other races is fast approaching. The titans have only a precious few moment left -- as shown on a time track -- to create a lush world that will live in legend, or else an inhospitable wasteland that will cause later races to curse the titans for ages to come.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the December 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

Players will expand their minds by analyzing some realistic and  some not so realistic situations where one is forced to make a moral choice. Some choices may be easy while others may be much more difficult.  Players who engage honestly with an open mind may learn some things about their opponents as well as themselves as they challenge each other in a battle of strategic persuasion.&#10;&#10;For each round, one person plays the role of the hero while the others play as the tricksters. The hero is faced with a dilemma and must make a moral decision. The tricksters must make use of their cards and their creative mindset to attempt to alter the dilemma in such a way that will cause the hero to change their mind. Those tricksters who can change the hero&rsquo;s mind score a point for the round. The winner of Principle Dilemma is the one who scores the most points in a predetermined number of rounds, or is the first to score a predetermined number of points.&#10;&#10;This party game for thinkers can be played seriously or just for fun. Either way, it shatters the ice in a meaningful way by providing a stage for authentic and exciting conversation between friends and strangers alike. When the stakes are lifted and the variations eccentric, there is freedom to explore outside the box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There are 47 scenarios based on these battles, organized into six &ldquo;battle games&rdquo; that allow you to play the scenarios in sequence toward your army&rsquo;s operational goals. Scenario design is by Philippe L&eacute;onard, who designed our Panzer Grenadier: 1940 The Fall of France game.&#10;&#10; Road to Dunkirk includes 517 die-cut and silky-smooth playing pieces. There are eight heavy cardstock maps with artwork by Guy Riessen so they match up nicely with those from 1940: The Fall of France.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If the new tile is a shelf (could be already open from a previous turn) he can decide, if he wants to end his turn or continue. If he decides to end his turn, he gets all glases he has found in this turn.&#10;If the new tile is Harry. Harry brakes all glasses, which means that all glasses tiles are flipped back.&#10;It's also possible that the player cannot move because the number on the die does not match. Also in this case his turn is finished and all glasses are flipped back.&#10;Game ends after 10 shelves are open and the actual player wants to end or if all 12 shelves are open.&#10;&#10;",

A group of unsuspecting teens are throwing a party at an abandoned summer camp, not realizing they're not alone.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a killer vs. teens fashion. The campgrounds are made of multiple 3D locations, which act as objective zones. The killer player sets up objective tokens for the teens, hiding in one of the locations. Teens must complete objectives after movement rolls to gather resistance tokens, items and parts of a victory plan while avoiding the killer. The killer uses their own deck to lure and scare the teens to gain an edge on them. During an encounter, the killer and the teens resolve fights with a dice roll and in case of an attack victory, the killer uses a kill deck card to eliminate the teens.&#10;&#10;Teen player(s) are trying to complete parts of a victory plan to escape or defeat the killer, while the killer player aims to keep the teenagers from escaping and kill all of them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Since the Paths' Time Rifts powered up for the first time on the Day of Reminiscence, masses of people across New Earth have been seeing visions of a fifth Time Rift hovering over the eerie Ground Zero of the impact, waiting to be discovered. These visions also invoked an increasing sense of empathy and fellowship between these people &mdash; a bond much stronger than their Path affiliation. A mass exodus from the Path capitals took place over the course of the first Era, and the first pioneers discovered that the Time Rift in their visions not only exists, but it holds the foundations of a new civilization, one that may eventually set all people of New Earth down a new path - the Path of Unity.&#10;&#10;Explorers from the Path of Unity soon discovered a secluded mountain valley where the enigmatic flora not only survived the impact, but it mutated and evolved by the asteroid&rsquo;s toxic Neutronium dust. The resulting flower-like crystal formations synthesize a substance called Flux, which is collected and studied by the Harvesters, the valley&rsquo;s mysterious inhabitants. The Harvesters are willing to share the secrets of the Flux technology with the Paths, but remain silent about its side effects, which only they are immune to...&#10;&#10;In the alternate storyline of Fractures of Time, Anachrony&rsquo;s first major expansion, the four original Paths and the newly formed, sanguine Path of Unity have gained access to a powerful new technology called Flux. Flux Cores can be acquired in the Amethynia Valley, the expansion&rsquo;s new main zone. By using the Flux Cores to power up their Fracture device, players may move (&ldquo;Blink&rdquo;) one of their already placed Exosuits to a new action space instead of placing a new one, or immediately retrieve some of their Workers or Free Action markers. This can result in never-before-seen action efficiency, but just like the Time Rifts, the Flux technology is a double-edged sword. Without a sufficiently advanced Fracture device, overusing it can cause Temporal Glitches; hectic negative effects such as shutting down the Exosuit bay slots, temporarily disabling buildings, or making players more prone to Anomalies.&#10;&#10;The Valley holds other secrets as well. The Operators&rsquo; advanced technology allows players to remove the Temporal Glitches, upgrade their classic Path tech with new quirks, and even enlist the Harvesters themselves as a powerful new class of Workers, who are immune to the Flux&rsquo;s side effects.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Part of a series of electronic board games released by EDC in the late sixties and early seventies. Although titled Computer Vegas, the large wooden game board only depicts a Craps table. Protruding through the center of board are fourteen light bulbs that serve to display the pips for a computer-generated roll of a pair of standard six-sided dice. The dice are rolled by pressing a button. All other gameplay is handled manually by the players. The game includes small plastic chips and paper money for use in betting and collecting payouts.&#10;&#10;As Computer Vegas was simply a die-roll simulator at heart, it could also be used to play Backgammon. The EDC overlay for Computer Backgammon turned the Craps table into a Backgammon board. A cut-out in the center of the overlay allowed the virtual die roll to be displayed.&#10;&#10;Unlike most other EDC games, Computer Vegas ran off an AC adapter rather than batteries.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Origin  &#10;WordGhost is the card game that turned a childhood car game into a game night favorite. The game combines vocabulary with competition to create a perfect source of entertainment for any occasion. Turning the car game into a card game made it possible to add more features that add to the excitement. With new cards such as the &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; card and the &ldquo;anagram&rdquo; card, the game has twists and turns you won&rsquo;t see coming!  We are passionate about words and are super excited to introduce Word Ghost!&#10;&#10;Objective / Rules&#10;The game can be played by any number of people at any age. The objective of the game is to use your letters to continually create a word without ever finishing that word. Each player will begin with &ldquo;letter cards&rdquo; in their hand and one by one will place a letter down in order to spell a word they have in their head. The word must be four letters long to be considered a knockout word. This means 1-3 letter words are fine to play.  If a player is caught completing a word, he or she is out. The game gets interesting when introducing the &ldquo;special cards.&rdquo; These cards are incorporated into the card game because it changes the dynamic of the game and the word(s) being played.&#10;&#10;Special Cards&#10;The &ldquo;special cards&rdquo; consist of wild cards, skip cards, reverse cards, &ldquo;remove 1&rdquo; cards, &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; cards, and anagram cards. The wild card allows the player to play any letter of your choosing, the skip card allows a player to skip their own turn, and the reverse card allows the player to reverse the order of the game. The &ldquo;remove 1&rdquo; card allows the player to remove one letter from the word and the &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; card allows the player to remove two letters from the word. When using the removal cards, the player must pull all the letters together without reordering. The anagram card allows the player to rearrange all the letters to create a part of a new word. The letters still cannot form a word, or that player is out. Another competitive aspect of the game is the &ldquo;challenge.&rdquo; The challenge is used when a player thinks their opponent that plays directly before them is spelling a fake word. In this situation, the player can say: &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; to their opponent and that player must say the word he or she was spelling. If the word is valid, the player that called the challenge is out and if the word is not valid, the challenged player is out.&#10;&#10;Rule Variations &#10;There are technical infinite rule variations to the game which you can come up with.  Here are two that we like:  &#10;&#10;     The &ldquo;strike play&rdquo; method allows the players to use a strike system instead of an instant elimination.  Think of it like playing &ldquo;HORSE&rdquo; on a basketball court. When a player spells a word, he or she will get a strike and when that player collects three strikes, then he or she is out. &#10;     The &ldquo;timed play&rdquo; method calls for a timer that will only give the players a certain amount of time to play their letter or they automatically lose.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game will challenge your vocabulary and your ability to stay one step ahead of your opponents. It is the perfect game for a quiet night in or to be the center of game night.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Comes complete with 4 new double sided map tiles as well as 4 new Encounters and a fifth Epic Encounter, fought across 4 Acts.&#10;&#10;Madra stared at Kakhard&rsquo;s slack face, checking she was fully immobilized. Casting spells on other Witches was always tricky, it was best to be sure. Stepping back, she began the incantation to flay Kakhard alive. As her tough hide was peeled back, the monstrous energies sealed and twisted the bleeding flesh, making sure that Kakhard would live. Keeping her around as a pet would be a fitting reminder of the awesome power Madra controlled.&#10;&#10;It was done! Now she had five Witches&rsquo; skins in her possession. Plenty enough to impress Voskor and make him deify her. If not, with this power coursing through her body, she would do the same to him as she did to the five Witches and simply steal her Demonhood.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the time to ascend had come. Yes, better to summon Voskor here and now, and let him see Kakhard doting on her, as she adjusted to the agony of her skinless form. Madra arranged herself on her palanquin and tried to look both relaxed and commanding. Best to get it over with. More muttered words of power and she summoned the Demon to her lair, straining her powers to the limit to drag such a powerful entity through the aether.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Voskor! See what I have stolen for you!&rdquo; she shouted, as she tossed the skins on the floor at the Demon&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;You can feast on their hides. I have their power. But first give me what I want! Raise me to Demonhood!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Voskor stared at her, no expression possible on his bone face. He gestured with one hand as he scratched at the skins with the other. Consumed by her lust for power and the energy flowing through the room, Madra failed to see her imminent danger and gave herself to the rapture of Voskor&rsquo;s transformation. Instead, Voskor was teaching her a lesson for her presumption. Her body devolved to a feeble worm-like form.&#10;&#10;As she finally realized the trick that had been played on her, she reached for her power to attack. But looking at Voskor, all she could see was the Conjunction transporting her away.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Discovery is a card game in which you will retrace the major steps in the evolution of humanity.&#10;&#10;Each card represents an innovation or major breakthrough in our history. Each one builds on previous discoveries, called prerequisites, and paves the way for new discoveries.&#10;&#10;During a game, players will build together the Discovery &quot;&quot;Tech Tree&quot;&quot; by each placing cards in turns. Discovery allows you, with a same deck of cards, to play several different types of games (from beginner level to expert). Depending on the type of game, the goal can be either to be the first to empty your hand (games with no points), or to collect the maxim number of points (you earn points each time you place a card).&#10;&#10;In all games, each player starts with 5 cards. During your turn, you can place a card in the discovery tree if all its prerequisites have already been placed, or if it has no prerequisite (starting cards). Once placed, a card benefits all players who can then use it as a prerequisite to place their own cards. The game ends as soon as the stack is empty and a player empties his hand.&#10;&#10;Discovery is a semi-collaborative game which, like the evolutionary process, combines both collaboration and competition.&#10;&#10;The Prehistory deck can be played as a stand alone game, or as an extension of the Antiquity deck (2019 edition).&#10;&#10;Discovery is a game for kids (6 years +) and adults, and ideal to play with the whole family. It can be played as a solitary game or with up to 9 players. A game can vary from 15 to 60 minutes depending on the type of game and the number of players.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A brokenhearted god.&#10;A woman carrying the collective hate of mankind.&#10;How many times will you sacrifice yourself before giving up hope?&#10;&#10;Sankokushin: Five Sacrifices is a fully cooperative campaign game set in a fictional version of medieval Japan.&#10;&#10;Take control of several heroes arriving to assist the city-state of Yamashiro, a land destroyed by the quest for the Unseen, and help the city survive its grim destiny.&#10;&#10;Experience an adventure in which you&rsquo;re free to decide what activities the heroes pursue, where they explore, who they meet and how they interact with their opponents; all of which organically generates a unique storyline inside of the main plot that moves the destiny of Yamashiro.&#10;&#10;Fight monsters and human foes in psycologically-intense encounters where personality and tactical manuevering are paramount. Intimidate or provoke your enemies to scare them or force them to attack carelessly. Use your diplomatic abilities to calm dangerous, psychopathic entities until you are able to backstab them or plead on the behalf of honorable opponents. Manage the stress of battle, seek to understand your opponents&rsquo; perverse intelligence and use that knowledge to destroy them or to find a way to save them from destroying themselves and everyone you hold dear.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Yamashiro.&#10;&#10;Campaign&#10;&#10;The city of Yamashiro is an immense micro-universe where the lives of the citizens, heroes and enemies are tightly intertwined. Experience a unique adventure that unfolds over the course of 12 months during which you decide what activities the heroes pursue, where they explore and who they meet. Craft equipment, revel in festivals, expand the city, take advantage of the amenities of its many facilities, and explore personal relationships with the town&rsquo;s inhabitants as well as its assailants. Sankokushin does not require a heavy, multi-player commitment to reach the end of a campaign and it will not abruptly end if things go poorly. However, only those who travel across time and memory will gain the knowledge necessary to free Yamashiro from the burden of its tragic fate.&#10;&#10;Procedural Narrative&#10;&#10;No walls of text. No &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo; choices. Sankokushin instead wraps you in its unique story as you experience Yamashiro without confining you to a guided plotline. Instead of presenting you with only narrative choices, the storyline is organically generated by the heroes&rsquo; actions during both the combat encounters and the city phase. The assailants of Yamashiro and its inhabitants are all intimately connected by a dark fate and only the actions of the heroes can alter the course of their destiny. These interrelationships have profound consequences in game and they are the heart of Sankokushin&rsquo;s narrative and it is impossible to experience them all in a single playthrough as they are a reflection of your unique playstyle so different gaming groups will have different experiences.&#10;&#10;Intelligent Enemies&#10;&#10;Each of the 10 bosses included in Sankokushin has a unique personality and story arc that is closely linked with the overall narrative. The way you deal with each of them will reverberate throughout the course of the campaign. You will learn to love and hate their twisted personalities and will see that the methods used to fight them will deeply influence their future behavior. They learn from your strategies and change their attitude towards you (and the way they fight!) according to the way you psychologically approach them thanks to the unique communication system. Sankokushin is designed by a small team whose knowledge in the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis have made possible bosses with realistic, uncanny, and perverse personalities that will show you the darkest sides of human nature.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is based on a Quartett type card game but extended by a quiz.&#10;&#10;Each player draws 4 cards from the stack.&#10;The youngest player starts the game (active player) and asks any other player if he holds a card needed to complete a set of four. The enquiring player must always have at least one of the set in their hand before asking.&#10;&#10;Unlike a normal Quartett game, the player asked does not automatically surrender the card in question he might hold, but has to ask one of the questions noted on the card. Only if the active player supplies the correct answer to the quiz question the card is surrendered. The player who was successful may continue to ask the one who has surrendered a card for a further card. The moment that player cannot supply the wanted card or any of his quiz questions isn't answered correctly, he becomes the one to ask any player for a card. Whenever a quiz question is answered wrong the asked player draws a card.&#10;&#10;If a completed Four is obtained, the successful player should lay it on the table and that set is now safe. This continues round the table until all the sets are laid down and the player has tabled the largest number of four, wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Expansion Module #6 is already included in Kingsburg (Second Edition). This expansion is intended to offer owners of the first edition the chance to purchase the expansion separately.&#10;&#10;At the start of each productive season, a new advisor reward is revealed and placed on top of its spot on the board, replacing the reward players have grown familiar with. Eventually, each advisor will feature a brand-new effect, allowing players access to the advisor&rsquo;s new reward while removing its existing reward for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;For example, the General originally focuses on battle, recruiting 2 soldiers and secretly looking at the top card of the enemy deck. The new reward tile replaces that effect with the reward to gain 2 gold or 2 wood or 2 stone. The Wizard normally rewards players with 4 gold, but with the new advisor tile placed on his space, he will now reward players with 5 victory points.&#10;&#10;Contents: 16 Advisor Tiles&#10;&#10;",
