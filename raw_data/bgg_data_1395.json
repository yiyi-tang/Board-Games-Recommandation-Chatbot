Of course, players gain points if other players used their cards, and so on.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own deck that consists of the same number and types of cards, with the exception that each deck has a unique back representing the given player's faction.&#10;&#10;When the game starts, each players will lay three cards from the top of their decks to the player board's farm area. Then the game really begins. There are no turns, the game is being played in real time. Players will reveal new cards, one by one, from their decks and try to pair them with cards they have laid down on the three farm spaces or any of the cards from the middle of the table where the common market is. Remember: using a card from another faction will win that faction extra points at the end of the game, so pay attention who discarded what card!&#10;&#10;Players will try to match cards: One Hatchet paired with a Apple Garden will generate one Apple Basket token. One Scythe paired with a Grain Field will generate a Flour token. And finally, one Food Basket paired with a Pig Farm will generate one Pig token. Of course, there are variations of these cards in your deck. Once a player has enough tokens to resolve a Contract Card, they can do so and score it. Once a player has solved all their ten contracts, the game will end, and the exciting and nail-biting scoring will begin; you gain points from scored Contract Cards and one points from each of your cards the other players used.&#10;&#10;That game is a true draw and pair bonanza!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Throughout the course you will stop at 3 Arenas! These arenas are the proving grounds where your team will relay race against the clock! Each team member will perform a different task while their teammates guess correct answers. You will need to get all of the tasks done in a row before the three-minute timer goes off in order to keep advancing down the board. Once you have made it to and completed the 3rd Arena you have reached the finish line and are the winners of Relay Rivals!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introduction&#10;You and your fellows have reached the city of Memoria, this mythical territory where snatches of memories come back to the mind of those who come in. Unfortunately, only one of you will be allowed to leave the city with his/her &laquo; new &raquo; memories. To be the chosen one, you&rsquo;ll have to tell a memory or a lie while messing up with your companions&rsquo; minds.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to tell a memory based on random pictures. If you don&rsquo;t remember any memory with these pictures, you can still bluff creating a false memory, but try to be convincing! Indeed, to score points when you are the Speaker, you have to mislead the other players (in other words you must make them believe your memory is false when in fact it is true, or true when it is actually false).&#10;&#10;ROUND 1&#10;IN THE HEART OF THE CITY&#10;You penetrate the heart of Memoria city. Snatches are springing up everywhere. Choose carefully the ones you&rsquo;ll associate to tell or reinvente your story.&#10;1) Everybody has 90 seconds to remember or to imagine a memory with the six visible cards (you can use your phone timer or leave it up to players to decide when they are ready to tell a memory). You don&rsquo;t have to include the whole six cards to your memory. It is possible to tell a memory using only one card out of the six ones you picked.&#10;&#10;2) Once everybody&rsquo;s ready, the older player is designated as the Speaker. Then, he places in front of him and face down his &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card if he&rsquo;s going to lie or his &laquo; Memoria &raquo; card, if he&rsquo;s going to tell the truth. Then, he declares the number of pictures he&rsquo;ll use in his memory and then tells it.&#10;&#10;3) Once his memory has been told, each player (beginning with the player who is placed on his left) can ask a question to the Speaker if he wants to, in order to gather more information, or to unsettle him to see how he&rsquo;ll react (If the Speaker&rsquo;s memory is true, he has to answer the questions honestly. If his memory is false, he can tell what he wants).&#10;&#10;4) Then, each player has to decide if the Speaker&rsquo;s memory was true or false, placing his Memoria or Bluff card in front of him (His Memoria card if he thinks it was true, his Bluff card, if he thinks it was a lie).&#10;&#10;5) Then, beginning with the player placed on the Speaker&rsquo;s left, each player reveals his card, explaining if he wants to, why he believed or not in the Speaker&rsquo;s memory. Then, the Speaker shows his own &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card et gives some details about his story if he wants to.&#10;&#10;6) Then, you have to count the points (see the following paragraph &laquo; How to count points &raquo;).&#10;&#10;7) Then, the player who was sitting on the Speaker&rsquo;s left becomes the Speaker, and so on and so forth until everybody&rsquo;s been Speaker once.&#10;&#10;8) Once the round is over, the 6 used &laquo; Snatch &raquo; cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;ROUND 2&#10;ON YOUR WAY BACK&#10;It&rsquo;s time to go back. You and your adventure fellows are about to leave the city of Memoria. Some snatches are still springing but soon, everything will turn back to the way it was before entering the city... However, one of you will have the privilege to keep in mind his new memories. But who ?&#10;&#10;1) The Speaker draws the first &laquo; Snatch &raquo; card from the deck and has 45 seconds to remember or imagine a memory linked to this card.&#10;&#10;2) He puts his &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card in front of him and tells his memory.&#10;&#10;3) The other players use their &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card to decide if the Speaker&rsquo;s memory was true or false. Contrary to the first round, they can&rsquo;t ask him any questions.&#10;&#10;4) The Speaker scores 3 points for each player who was wrong about his memory. The other players scores 3 points if they were right about the Speaker&rsquo;s memory.&#10;&#10;5) The drawn &laquo; Snatch &raquo; card is discarded and replaced with another one. Then, the player who was sitting on the Speaker&rsquo;s left becomes the Speaker, and so on and so forth until everybody&rsquo;s been Speaker twice during this round.&#10;&#10;6) The game is over ! It&rsquo;s time for you and your fellows to leave Memoria city. The one who has the highest score keeps his new memories with him. In case of a tie, don&rsquo;t hesitate to go back to the city to decide who is the worthiest time traveller.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Early in 1862 a little-known general named U.S. Grant led the Union's offensive into West Tennessee. After capturing two river forts and the largest bag of prisoners ever captured by an American army to that time, Grant made a daring advance up the Tennessee River, while supporting armies advanced down the Mississippi and overland through Tennessee. But the Confederate army under A.S. Johnston hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.&#10;&#10;GRANT: The Western Campaign of 1862 puts you in charge of the entire Tennessee campaign. As the Union player, you must coordinate three armies, using both naval and land forces to advance along the major rivers, take the important objectives of Nashville and Corinth, and seize the fortress of Island Number Ten to open the Mississippi River. As the Confederate player you are trying to block the Union offensives, choose your moment to counterattack, and if possible, take the war into Kentucky. Movement and combat by river is just as important as land, giving this campaign a unique feel in Civil War history. A chit-based sequence of play makes the game highly variable and models the abilities of Grant and Johnston.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Cards of &#208;&#161;onflict raises a wide variety of topics, often going far beyond the generally accepted norms of decency and etiquette. But if your company prefers black humor, banter over everything, and undisguised sarcasm, then this game is just what you need.

In the first round, 1 player is selected - &quot;Card Bro&quot; of this round. &quot;Card bro&quot; takes 1 black card from the deck (black cards lie in one deck with the inscription down) and read out the text loudly. Each of the participants (except for &quot;Card bro&quot;) chooses one of his white cards that seems to him the most suitable.&#10;&#10;White cards are transferred to Card Bro, which in turn reads each option separately. We recommend that you reread the black card completely before reading out a new white card. &quot;Card bro&quot; is chosen by the winner, in his opinion, the option. The player whose white card wins this round receives a black card as a &ldquo;ball.&quot;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player draws a new white card from the deck, so that at the beginning of the next round everyone has 10 white cards. White cards used in this round can be put down the white deck so that after a while they will return to them again. In each subsequent round, a new Card Bro is selected so that each player receives this role in turn. You yourself can choose the principle of changing &ldquo;bro&rdquo;: clockwise / counterclockwise, by height, age, leg size, or another sign that is understandable to all participants.&#10;&#10;There are black cards in the deck, labeled &ldquo;take 2&rdquo;. In this case, each player must choose 2 white cards to form a winning combination. It is important to read the white cards in the correct order. Therefore, the card, the text of which you want to read first, you always need to put under the second card and so transmit &quot;bro.&quot;&#10;&#10;If you wish, you can modify the rules, for example, play without a &ldquo;Card Bro&rdquo;. In this case, each player votes for the option that he liked and gets the most votes with the score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quintus is a light-hearted yet tactical partnership trick-taking card game for five players, which is comparable in game mechanics to the Dutch game of Klaverjas (and its better known siblings Belote and Jass).&#10;&#10;The game is played with a standard French deck, without twos, threes, fours and jokers -- 40 cards in total. The cards rank as usual, from 5 (low) to ace (high) in all suits.&#10;&#10;The title stems from Latin and means `fifth'. This refers to the fifth player who plays alone, against the rest who play in two teams of two. The objective for all players is to take card points in tricks; the two teams combine their points while the quintus receives a card point bonus and the privilege to choose the trump suit. Jacks, queens and kings earn points while pip cards cost points. Additional points (&quot;premiums&quot;) may be scored by winning combinations of cards in tricks.&#10;&#10;As an alternative to a standard hand, the quintus may elect to play a nil hand in which he seeks to avoid taking any court card or ace.&#10;&#10;Team mates may signal information about their cards through specific hand gestures.&#10;&#10;As a variant to the base game, the quintus may be chosen through a bidding round in which the bid for the highest amount of combined card, nil and premium points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cards of &#208;&#161;onflict (Epidemic) is a &quot;post-quarantine&quot; independent addition to the board game about creating the funniest pairs of questions and answers. The authors collected all the most popular memes, phrases from quarantine tik-toks, Instagram tips, mistakes and human fears that were born during the worldwide Covid epidemic, and created a new version of the Conflict Maps so that you can laugh at what you experienced.&#10;&#10;Table of Contents Cards Board Game Content:&#10;&#10;     30 cards with questions&#10;     150 cards with answers&#10;     rules of the game&#10;&#10;&#10;The game begins with the fact that each player receives 10 white cards. In the first round, 1 player is selected - &quot;Card Bro&quot; of this round. &quot;Card bro&quot; takes 1 black card from the deck (black cards lie in one deck with the inscription down) and read out the text loudly. Each of the participants (except for &quot;Card bro&quot;) chooses one of his white cards that seems to him the most suitable.&#10;&#10;White cards are transferred to Card Bro, which in turn reads each option separately. We recommend that you reread the black card completely before reading out a new white card. &quot;Card bro&quot; is chosen by the winner, in his opinion, the option. The player whose white card wins this round receives a black card as a &ldquo;ball.&quot;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player draws a new white card from the deck, so that at the beginning of the next round everyone has 10 white cards. White cards used in this round can be put down the white deck so that after a while they will return to them again. In each subsequent round, a new Card Bro is selected so that each player receives this role in turn. You yourself can choose the principle of changing &ldquo;bro&rdquo;: clockwise / counterclockwise, by height, age, leg size, or another sign that is understandable to all participants.&#10;&#10;There are black cards in the deck, labeled &ldquo;take 2&rdquo;. In this case, each player must choose 2 white cards to form a winning combination. It is important to read the white cards in the correct order. Therefore, the card, the text of which you want to read first, you always need to put under the second card and so transmit &quot;bro.&quot;&#10;&#10;If you wish, you can modify the rules, for example, play without a &ldquo;Card Bro&rdquo;. In this case, each player votes for the option that he liked and gets the most votes with the score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Many, playing this game, died of laughter, and those who survived not only learned to spew toilet and black jokes for any reason at any time of the day, but also began to come up with ideas for new cards themselves. The result of these efforts and collective insanity was a new addition to the game &quot;Cards of Conflict&quot;, which the publishers affectionately called &quot;The Collection of Your Stupid Ideas.&quot; Each card is not only very dumb, but also unique! The addon came out, as they say, unrealistically cool and does not repeat any of the games in the series. It can be played on its own or with other games in the series. In the set you will find 30 cards with questions and 150 with answers.&#10;&#10;JOKES FOR THREE HUNDRED OR LEARN TO PLAY A TRACTOR OPERATOR&#10;&#10;If you joked so that you forgot how to play, then we will remind you. If this does not help, please see a doctor as soon as possible. So, each participant receives 10 white as snow or what you can joke about in this game, cards with answers. A deck of black (no, we are not racists!) cards with questions is laid out in the center of the table. The first player, known in a friendly way as &quot;card bro&quot; or worse in some companies, takes the top card of the black deck and reads the question aloud. The rest of the players must choose the most ridiculous, as they think, answer and lay out one of their cards. Bro repeats the question one more time, and then reads out the answers of the participants.&#10;&#10;The author of the funniest answer gets a victory point. Players take one white card into their hand and the next player draws a question. The carousel of select toilet humor begins to rotate with renewed vigor. The winner is the one who scores the maximum number of points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Iron Brain: The Siege of Beirut, June-August, 1982.&#10;&#10;For over a year the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) had bombarded Israel&rsquo;s northern province of Galilee with artillery and rocket fire. On June 6, 1982 the Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon in an operation dubbed &ldquo;Peace for Galilee&rdquo;. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) quickly defeated the PLO&rsquo;s armed forces and drove north. Although the declared aim of the Israeli offensive was to clear a 40 kilometer &ldquo;buffer zone&rdquo; along the Lebanese/Israeli border, Israeli Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon, was determined to eradicate the PLO once and for all, and hopefully kill its leader, Yassir Arafat. With new orders the IDF crossed the Litani River and drove on Beirut where the remnants of the PLO&rsquo;s forces were retreating, and where most of their refugee camps were located. What ensued was an escalating conflict that threatened to engulf the entire mid-east once more in conflict and bring Lebanon to the brink of abyss of genocidal civil war.&#10;&#10;Each copy of Operation Iron Brain is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets&#10;&bull;    One sheet of 140 double-sided, unmounted counters&#10;&bull;    One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet&#10;&bull;    8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Armor and Infantry (Militia, Regular, Heavy Weapons) units are all Battalions. Airborne and militia units are companies. A hex on the map is about a half mile across. Each turn represents two weeks of time.

The transition from handmade items to large-scale factories with industrial machinery made it possible to produce products at an epic scale. It also turned a handful of already industrious men into even more; it turned them into American moguls. Will you be one of them?&#10;&#10;In American Mogul, players are captains of industry throughout the length of the industrial revolution in the United States, with each attempting to corner markets in the emerging states. Done through a brutally tight action-selection mechanism in which no action can be chosen twice in a round, the game is palpably tense as players struggle to get the right contracts, the best companies, and the edge in every market.&#10;&#10;American Mogul is a follow up to 2013's Global Mogul, using the same core systems and adding more to it. Players now have captain cards that give each player a unique starting position and a special ability. Event cards make every play unique and interesting, but rather than random events, each player chooses an event during initial set-up. Players also choose a unique endgame scoring condition for each game, adding even more to the variability. Finally, a new action allows players to donate money to their own private foundations, then watch that money grow as the public matches donations and the interest accrues from round to round. The more players grow their foundations, the more special abilities they unlock. In a game that's brutally tight on money, how much will you give away? Will you be a philanthropist or a robber baron?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Warchief Collector Edition is a Kickstarter Exclusive containing the base game of Northgard: Uncharted Lands including the Wilderness expansion, Warchiefs expansion, module of special environmental tiles.&#10;&#10;All the content is put into one big box and filled by custom inserts to ease the setup and game play.&#10;&#10;&#10;Based on the universe of the Northgard video game, Northgard: Uncharted Lands is a game of conquest and exploration set in the age of vikings. Each player controls a Viking clan, looking to achieve victory by reaping glory in various ways or controlling the most prized territories of this new continent.&#10;&#10;The game focus is on streamlined rules and mechanisms, allowing for a fast-paced and smooth rhythm of play. Each turn, players alternate their actions to adapt their strategies to their opponents' moves and the expansion of the board. Fame (i.e., points) can be earned by exploring, fighting, and controlling and developing territories. The various corresponding actions are played through the cards that the players have in hand. At the end of each turn, they have to choose a new card to improve their personal deck as their clans develop new tactics and technologies.&#10;&#10;The conquest of Northgard also requires clever management of resources to build new buildings, improve your warriors' effectiveness, better your hand of cards, and upgrade your clan's specificities. The winter phase makes this management more difficult as you have to feed your units to keep them healthy and happy.&#10;&#10;The pace of the game is set by the players as the game ends after seven turns, but can also be cut short at any time if one of them is in control of three closed territories hosting certain types of buildings.&#10;&#10;'--description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Sniping was his second nature, the cutting barb was his forte, and he even took to stealing their diaries to scrawl snarky comments in the margins. He was eventually disowned. But he had learned swordsmanship to at least a competent degree, and a Guild membership was easy enough for someone of his connections. Ironically, he welcomed the invasion, but was cast out when he was found scrawling derisive comments beneath graffiti the orcs would leave on each other&rsquo;s&rsquo; walls.

The game is an entertaining and educational journey into the world of maritime history of the Mediterranean and Black Sea during the long nineteenth century, namely from the French Revolution to the World War I as defined by the historian Eric Hobsbawm.&#10;&#10;In the game players take on the role of shipowners and must develop their business, upgrade their ships, and adapt their strategies to the changing circumstances caused by external factors. While playing the game, players will explore the universe of maritime trade, they will get a feel for its mechanisms and its historical evolution and they will learn more about:&#10;&#10;     The main types of sailing ships and steam ships used in maritime trade.&#10;     The important ports of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea in the nineteenth century.&#10;     The important commodities traded during this period.&#10;     The navigation rules that dictated the way ships sailed back in time. &#10;     The mechanisms of shipping industry like demand, freight rates, insurance, ship repairing etc.&#10;     The external factors that affected shipping industry like wars, epidemics, strikes etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players acting like shipowners seek to overcome their opponents financially. Due to the long number of rounds (120) which coincides with each year from 1790 to 1910, players may choose to start the game at any year and they also may decide to finish it after any number of rounds. An average number of 30 to 40 rounds coincides with approximately two and a half to three hours of play. Thus, the game offers indirectly different scenarios corresponding at different periods (age of sail, 1790-1830, age of early steamships 1840 to 1860 and so on). The winner is determined by the player who possesses more value after counting money, value of ships and value of cargo, minus any loans he/she might owe to the bank.&#10;&#10;The players move in the map through the navigation cards, which determine the speed of the ships/pawns, and various events that occur (gales, pirates, shipwrecks, fire). Players seek to sell the carrying cargo, to buy bigger and technologically more advanced vessels and to capture most of the Mediterranean market. In the age of sail period, 1790-1830, they also can buy one or more privateers to capture and convert other players' ships. They have to roll the dice only when they have to determine the demand (high or low) of the ten commodities of the game every five rounds, and when they have to face pirates or privateers.&#10;&#10;",

Rooms will benefit your mine, and hallways and ladders let you reach other areas of your mountain.&#10;&#10;After drawing, you will make two dice rolls - a treasure roll, and a combat roll. These rolls determine what treasure you find, and what creatures you may encounter in the mountain - after all, mining is dangerous business!&#10;&#10;Each mine made has a story, and every story has a beginning, middle, and sadly, an end.

    "Description": "Imperamus is an all-encompassing, strategic Euro-Ameri experience which transports players to the early days of the Roman Republic, at the very beginning of their conquest of the Italian peninsula. Players take on the role of noble Roman families who must balance competition with cooperation to expand the borders of Rome and create a civilization that can stand the test of time for centuries to come. This narrative game promotes constant player interaction across all four branches of command - military, legislature, diplomacy, and economy.&#10;At its core, Imperamus is a card-driven, deck-building system supported by traditional worker placement, resource management, and engine building. Players must balance crucial decisions as military leaders and statesmen to build their own local influence while supporting the formation of the Legions for the expansion of Rome as a whole. Along with the ability to customize their decks with recruits from Rome and surrounding societies, each family has a unique power to guide their strategy. Additionally, players will vote on both in-game laws and out-of-game scoring conditions, creating a new mechanical framework for each campaign!&#10;While the group has a common goal to gain the support of the people and ultimately give rise to the longest lasting empire in history, only one family will leave a legacy for the ages. The player with the most glory at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

You and the other players take on the role of competing scientists from parallel realities. The only way to ensure your survival, is to make sure that most of the burger&rsquo;s ingredients stay in your reality.&#10;&#10;Heisenburger is a competitive card game for 2 - 4 players. Each player is dealt a hand of nine, numbered ingredient cards in their chosen color. On their turn, players can add ingredients to the burger by playing one of their cards, face-down. Players can challenge each other by playing a card and guessing if their card is higher or lower than an opponent&rsquo;s card. If guessed correctly, the challenger replaces their opponent&rsquo;s ingredient card with their own.&#10;&#10;Some ingredient cards score bonus points, based on where they are placed in the burger. Others have special powers that are triggered when they are revealed.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players score one point for each ingredient card of their color in the finished burger. Plus any bonus points awarded by card powers. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

King William&rsquo;s war 1689-1697 would be the first in what would become known as the French and Indian wars, and is seen by some as the first truly global war as it was fought between rival European powers from Flanders to the Caribbean and beyond; vicious and combining both western and frontier styles of fighting, King William&rsquo;s war would start a cycle of violence that would continue until the French cession of Canada to the British in 1763.&#10;&#10;This expansion will require the No Peace Beyond the Line Expansion Book.&#10;&#10;Softcover, 78 pages&#10;&#10;",

There is the sado-masochism of the Blood Cult, the conversion from flesh to machine within the Cult of Metamorphosis, the body ravaging poisons f the Toxic Cult, and now the animated death and nuclear powers of the newly risen Cult of Decay.

Each trick also has up to three stages.  In the first stage, players are following the &quot;outer suit&quot; of the lead card.  However, if someone is able to following unconventionally, the trick proceeds to the next stage and players are now trying to follow the lead suit, but with the middle suit on their card.  In the last stage of a trick, players follow the outer suit of the initial lead card with the inner suit of their card.&#10;&#10;Once the card play is completed, each stage of a trick will have a winner and that winner will notate having mastered the art corresponding to the lead suit.  During the game, points are awarded for mastering the different arts in the different stages.&#10;&#10;Once the players have collectively fully mastered two arts, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Failure to encircle Soviet forces west of Stalingrad ensures that an urban brawl for the city will ensue. Both sides are challenged to meet different objectives.&#10;&#10;The Germans must utilize their Sixth Army to destroy the three Soviet armies in the land bridge between the Don and the Volga before they can fall back into Stalingrad. Historically, this attack was coordinated with operations by the Fourth Panzer Army that attacked from the southwest and which was to form the southern arm of a gigantic pincer. Supporting the attack are aircraft of the Fourth Air Fleet which ruled the air.&#10;&#10;The Soviet player must not only ensure sufficient forces escape the intended German encirclement, but maintain constant pressure on the overextended Sixth Army with a series of counterattacks from north of Stalingrad to relieve pressure on the defenders of the city. The Soviets are also tasked to retain bridgeheads on the Don which will be their key for future operations.&#10;&#10;Designed by Mark Stille, this game includes 1 and &frac12; maps with 420 counters. Units are at the division/brigade level for the Soviets while German and Axis Allied forces are depicted from battalion to division. Each turn is two days.&#10;&#10;The game system is based on his earlier Wintergewitter design and emphasizes the effect of air power and a command and control system which makes players plan ahead to conduct operations and carefully weigh where their offensive efforts will be expended.&#10;&#10;Maps - One and 1/2 full color 22&quot;x34&quot; hex mapsheets&#10;Counters - 420 standard 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces&#10;Rules length - 14 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Playing time - Up to 4 hours&#10;How challenging is it solitaire? - Average&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You can play with a traditional deck of playing cards, with the cards ordered A23... up to ...JQKA23... so that they loop. Each player starts a round with seven cards in hand and one card face up to start a discard pile.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player must draw the top card of the deck or the discard pile, but they can draw the latter only if that card will be part of a new meld. After drawing, they can meld a set or sequence of three cards. If this player has a meld in front of them, whether from this turn or an earlier one, they can add to melds already on the table, adding a fourth 6 to a set of three or adding a 2 to a QKA sequence. Additionally, you can meld a 7 on its own to the table.&#10;&#10;To end your turn, if you still have cards in hand, discard a card. If you now have no cards in hand, the round ends. Players are then ranked by their points still in hand, with an unplayed 7 being worth 14 points, and players give points to the winner based on their ranking. The worse your rank, the more you pay. Additional penalties might double what you pay depending on what you have in hand.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, if you have melded no cards, you can end the game with a blast by having a point total that is small or large enough based on all seven cards in hand. Also alternatively, if you have at most 10 points in hand at the start of your turn, you can call for the end of the round. If you have the smallest total, you're ranked first, but if anyone has fewer points than you, you're automatically ranked last.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There are things in the dark places of the world that are best left unseen by the prying eyes of man. Some horrors that cannot be fathomed. These are the nightmares from beyond, that haunt the deepest shadows, and feed on the fragile minds of those foolish enough to  seek them out.&#10;&#10;This 15 card Challenge Supplement adds an all new deck of Ruinous Nightmares to Shadows of Brimstone, allowing players to increase the difficulty of the Adventures. Choose from Nightmare Level 1, 2, or 3 to give your Heroes a serious run for their money. There are some extra rewards for exploring the more dangerous parts of this world though, and Heroes may find that if they can overcome the challenge, glory and riches await. But be warned, Ruinous Nightmares are not for the faint of heart. You have been warned.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Though the night is dark and full of terrors, there are some brave enough to stand against the Darkness; Heroic Defenders that won't sit idly by and watch their world fall to ruin. When the stakes are highest and the chips are down, these Heroes find a way to dig a little deeper and press on through the horrors arrayed before them.&#10;&#10;This 15-card supplement adds an all-new deck of Heroic Effort cards to help give Heroes a fighting chance for survival when the odds are stacked against them. Ideal for low-level Heroes, Hero Parties of only 1-2 Heroes, or to help out new Heroes joining an existing party, Heroic Efforts are one-use special ability cards that give Heroes a boost with a fun story moment when they need it most. With two ways to integrate these cards into your adventures, using Up Against the World or Struggle for Survival, Heroic Efforts give Heroes a fighting chance (especially when paired with the dangerous Ruinous Nightmare cards in the Nightmares From Beyond Supplement).&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",
