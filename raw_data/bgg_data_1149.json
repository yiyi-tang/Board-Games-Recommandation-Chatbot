    "Description": "Heroes of Hedra is a quick dice game that uses a standard set of polyhedral dice (RPG dice) to pit players against each other in a free-for-all battle of luck and skill. The base rules are freely available, and the game was conceived to be played before or during a tabletop role playing session, while everyone has their dice out.&#10;&#10;Using their dice, which represent six heroes with unique abilities and one mighty dragon, players attempt to defeat their opponents' heroes to control battlefields and score points. Dice have varying levels of power, that, combined with their abilities, encourage strategic play and positioning as well as carefully thought-out risk taking.&#10;&#10;All-in-all, Heroes of Hedra is a quick, fun game that can be played many times in a sitting, or as single quick game to pass the time, but has more strategy than one might expect.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each phase of the Moon corresponds to a slot on the summoning circle, and you have Ritual Objects such as Herbs, Minerals and Potions to place on these 8 slots.&#10;If the right combination of Ritual Objects resonates with the Moons, you pass one of the 3 steps required to summon your demon.&#10;&#10;The first witch to complete the summoning ritual wins the game.&#10;&#10;Play quickly to leave no respite to your opponents, carefully manipulate the course of this adventure and above all do not let victory escape you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Their goal was to show there was no loss in morale among the insurgents since Osama bin Laden's death. They attacked Afghanistan forces with RPG's and suicide bombers, with a high focus on government buildings. Their increased numbers were due to a prison escape 2 weeks earlier from Sarposa Prison, from which they gained skilled fighters and bombs experts. Fighting commenced over several days, ending when Afghan police forced a little over two dozen Taliban militants back into a hotel, where Afghan police opened fire from rooftops, showing the Insurgents that they will not allow the Taliban to rise back to power in Kandahar.&#10;&#10;Warfighter Modern Expansion - #50 Kandahar  includes Afghanistan Soldiers, Weapons, Missions, Objectives, and Locations specific to this Battle as well as Elite RPG Teams, and Suicide Bombers. This expansion offers 56 cards including:&#10;&#10;&#10;     3 Player Soldiers    &#10;     3 Non-Player Soldiers&#10;     2 Squad Soldiers &#10;     5 Weapons &#10;     4 Skills&#10;     5 Missions&#10;     5 Objectives&#10;     12 Locations&#10;     17 Hostiles&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player flips the ball token forward by pressing a stick onto it (player MUST only touch/play the ball once at their turn)&#10;&#10;Defending:&#10;&#10;To defend, players place their playing stick in front of their own post to stop other players shot from entering the post. However, this can only be done when the ball is in their own &lsquo;Threat zone&rsquo; (This is marked by a box). If the ball is not in the threat zone, players cannot block their post.&#10;&#10;Beginning a round:&#10;&#10;1.    Once the game has begun, when a ball goes out of play/pitch, the player whose side it is that the ball went out of the pitch begins the round. &#10;2.    Any player who is scored begins the next round.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;&#10;Players score by shooting the ball into any player&rsquo;s goal post.&#10;&#10;Counting Scores:&#10;Each players has 5 score point to reach in other to win the game.

    "Description": "&quot;Okinawa!&quot; is a two-player wargame recreating the land, sea, and air struggle for the possession of the Japanese island of Okinawa, from April to June 1945. Seen as the last steppingstone for the final jump toward Japan, the battle was important for both sides. The US had to prove it could overcome enemy resistance, securing airfields, and, after the bloodbath on Iwo Jima, keeping their casualties low. The Japanese had the chance to test their new air tactics relying on simultaneous strikes from multiple groups of Kamikaze and conventional strike aircraft escorted by fighters. They also had a full Army on the island backed, with one of the highest concentrations of Japanese artillery even seen during the Pacific War. They had to hold part of the island or inflict a level of casualties on US forces to cast enough doubts on their ability to later sustain a larger operation on Kyushu and then Honshu.  Stakes were high on both sides.&#10;&#10;The game covers the land battle for possession of Okinawa (focusing on the more military relevant southern part), and the concomitant air and naval struggle around it. On land you have Marine and Army regiments, tanks and amphibious tanks, Japanese forces that run the gamut between highly experienced machine gun battalions to raw conscripts.  At sea Carriers, battleships, Navy and Marine air groups, Japanese Kamikazes, and even Yamato&rsquo;s last sorties. Even the Commonwealth makes an appearance with Task Force 57, the British Pacific Fleet.&#10;&#10;In addition to the campaign, shorter scenarios are included as introductions to the game system, as well as highlighting critical moments of the epic struggle. We've also included designer's notes an a nice example of play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The usual No Retreat! Card and combat system is used, but the rule booklet is shorter than those of the NR Front series, as less special rules will be needed due to the smaller scope of each title. Each game will have its own set of event cards and Combat Tables. With usually not much than 50-60 square counters per game, with very low stacking, it&rsquo;s a series of quick-playing yet realistic affairs that favours the offensive-minded player.&#10;&#10;Each game turn will be full of on-board challenges, plus the surprise of Events cards as players vie to win in one of two different ways.  In a skilfully blended collation of classic hex-based wargaming and card-driven simulations, No Retreat! Battles stays truly story-centric, providing the proper feel of the challenges and limitations of WW2 Army or Corps commanders, while keeping the action fast and furious, keeping play downtime to a minimum for both gamers as the &ldquo;non-phasing&rdquo; player has ways to react to his opponent moves and attacks, putting some well-deserved sand in his well-oiled war machine.&#10; As in the latest No Retreat! Front series, Leader Cards are included in most battles, these cards will give each player special abilities inspired from the Qualities (or failings!) of the Commander-in-chiefs present at the Battle covered.&#10;&#10;1942 Game - Battle Listings &ndash; Five Battles&#10;&#10;Battle for Velikiye Luki: This Battle simulates the Soviet Offensive that  was executed against the Wehrmacht's 3rd Panzer Army during the Winter Campaign of 1942-43; with the objective of liberating that city as part of Operation Mars. Called &laquo; The Little Stalingrad of the North &raquo;  it saw a German Garrison desperately trying to break out of the embattled northern fortess. After a bloody see-saw battle, only a hundred defenders were able to escape. The variety of units fighting is quite bewildering : Ski troops, German Paratroopers, Panzers, Soviet Guard Divisions, rocket brigades, Estonian troops, Fortifications etc&hellip;&#10;&#10;Battle for Stalingrad (Solitaire/Two-player): This Battle showcases the famous cityfight, one of the turning points of the war. The game will focus on the urban battle in and around Stalingrad. The Player will take command of the Axis forces assaulting the city; the game AI will control the Soviet defenders. Time is of the essence to achieve complete control of the city before winter! A hidden unit system will be used to simulate the low level of local battle intelligence and difficult terrain the attackers encountered battling through the blasted ruins of the city. The game can also be played two-player.&#10;&#10;Battle for Gazala: This Battle covers the dramatic Afrika Korps counter-attack, lead by Rommel, against the prepared positions and minefields of the British 8th Army in North Africa, culminating in the capture of the Fortress of Tobruk and dramatic advance towards Egypt. Open desert terrain and quick movement abilities will make this a wild and woolly contest of will between the well-rained German Panzers plus their Italian Allies, and the British coalition troops of a dozen different nationalities. Special &ldquo;Tactical&rdquo; Event cards are used to put more detail into the battle strategies used by both sides&rsquo; units.&#10;&#10;Battle for Guadalcanal: This Battle was the first major Allied offensive against the Forces of Imperial Japan. Surprised by the attack, the Japanese made three major attempts in 1942 to retake the position conquered by the US Marines around Henderson Field. A linked scenario will cover each attempt; Event card play can also influence the outcome of the seven major naval battles, but at a cost of precious resources and Victory Points. This is the first No Retreat! Game to cover the WW2 Pacific war, and effectively three games in one.&#10;&#10;Battle for Dieppe (Solitaire): This small, quick-playing bonus Battle will put the player, controlling Canadian forces, against the insurmountable odds of gaining a foothold in the well-defended French town of Dieppe during one of the first Amphibious landing attempted by the Allies in Europe. The game AI will take gradual control of more and more German forces as time passes, so speed of execution of the mission is key. As with the Stalingrad game, the Enemy forces will be hidden at start, to be uncovered as the game advances.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Great Spring Offensive&#10;Vietnam, 1975. The Provisional Revolutionary Government was ready. After internal debate, the Communists had issued Resolution 21&mdash;the war to unify the country would continue. The Paris Peace would serve as merely one more tool in the armed struggle. In Saigon, President Thieu had known from the beginning that the ceasefire was an empty promise, but he had to accept his US ally&rsquo;s hollow accords with the North. Nonetheless, he now fielded one of the world&rsquo;s best equipped armies, and the victories of 1972 proved to him that it could withstand even an all-out assault from the North. While President Nixon had pledged peace with honor, his determination to enforce South Vietnam&rsquo;s independence had floundered amidst the worst US presidential scandal in history. What now from Ford? From Hanoi, Le Duc Tho&mdash;the negotiator who had squared off against Kissinger in Paris&mdash;was to trek south to oversee the final push to Saigon on behalf of the Politburo. His orders: &ldquo;Do not come home until victory is won.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Mark Herman and Volko Ruhnke&rsquo;s award-winning Fire in the Lake revealed the factional clashes of the US insurgency in Vietnam, from the first entry of US combat troops under Westmoreland to the &rsquo;72 Christmas bombings that teed up their negotiated withdrawal. Now, Fall of Saigon expands Fire in the Lake to finish the story. Three Fall of Saigon scenarios enable 1-4 players to extend play beyond Paris, beginning before 1968&rsquo;s Tet, on the eve of the 1972 Easter Offensive, or from 1964 all the way to the end of the war. A standalone 2&#226;&#128;&#145;player Black April scenario focuses tightly on the post-Paris sparring between NVA and ARVN, including the final massive battles, advances, and retreats.&#10;&#10;To show the transition from insurgency and counterinsurgency to mobile mechanized warfare, Fall of Saigon introduces an array of new features, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Paris Peace Talks that may result in either US or NVA Retreat&mdash;or both.&#10;     A building US Anti-War Movement and Northern War Weariness penalizing the continued campaigns.&#10;     US Posture that players influence to allow anything from full-bore US economic and financial backing of ARVN&rsquo;s defense and even a return of US heavy bombers over the North to utter abandonment of South Vietnam.&#10;     Hard-hitting NVA and ARVN Armor units capable of lightning Spearhead actions and of capturing the enemy&rsquo;s vehicles to turn around for their own use in the next attack.&#10;     Head-to-head action, NVA versus ARVN, using the acclaimed 2-player Initiative system from COIN Series Volume VII, Colonial Twilight, by Brian Train.&#10;     72 new Event cards for 1973-1975 and four new Pivotal Events to portray the political struggles in Washington, Hanoi, and Saigon; the building conventional military capabilities of the combatants; NVA probes and ARVN counterthrusts; threatened US enforcement of the Accords by air; and the chaos of the final collapse.&#10;     For solitaire players, Fall of Saigon introduces the popular new card-based Non-player system from Bruce Mansfield, designer of COIN Series Volume IX, Gandhi.&#10;&#10;&#10;Fall of Saigon will include 79 Event, Pivotal Event, and Coup cards; about 30 Non-player cards; one sheet of counters and track tiles; about 20 added wooden pieces; new and updated player aid charts; and expansion rule and play booklets. Fire in the Lake veterans will find the war beyond Paris easy to rev up but a whole new experience.&#10;&#10;A copy of Fire in the Lake will be necessary to play the Fall of Saigon expansion.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;    79 playing cards (Fall of Saigon Events, Coups, Pivotals - S1 to S79).&#10;    25 tarot-sized playing cards (FoS solitaire system).&#10;    24 wooden pieces (9 Red, 15 yellow)&#10;    4 identical double-sided color 11x17&rdquo; cards (FoS Faction sheets).&#10;    2 identical double-sided color 8&frac12;x11&rdquo; cards (FoS Coup Round and Paris Peace sheets).&#10;    2 different double-sided color 11x17&rdquo; cards (FoS Non-Player Coup Round).&#10;    2 different double-sided color 8&frac12;x11&rdquo; cards (FoS Non-Player Aid).&#10;    1 Countersheet (US Policy tile, Initiative track tile, 39 Fall of Saigon counters).&#10;    Expansion Rules booklet&#10;    Playbook booklet&#10;    Solitaire (Tay Son) Rules and Reference booklet&#10;    Game Box&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Errata components also included for Fire in the Lake:&#10;&#10;    2 counters&#10;    1 Playing card (solitaire system - US card B)&#10;&#10;&#10;(from GMT website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gemblo Trio is an abstract strategy game with translucent, colored pieces, each of which is made up of one to five hexagons. Each player has an identical set of pieces in a unique color. The goal is to get rid of all of your pieces by placing them on the hexagonal game board. Each piece that you place after the first cannot touch previously-placed pieces of the same color; instead each piece must be a distance of &quot;1&quot; from another piece of the same color, where 1 is the length of a side of one of the small hexagons. Another restriction is that the distance being measured can't directly cross another player's piece, but it can lie at the junction of two pieces. Once all players have placed as many pieces as they can, they count the number of hexagonal units in the pieces they couldn't place, and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The purpose of this game is to quickly simulate scores and standings for baseball leagues.  You can use the game as a companion to a play-by-play baseball game, or as a stand-alone game in which you play out the season and watch the pennant races unfold.&#10; Each team is accurately rated for their hitting, pitching and defense as well as how they perform when playing at home and how they handle pressure situations.  The combination of these ratings gives you a very accurate picture of each team.  In addition to the team ratings, we also provide you with a quick and simple method for normalizing teams across eras.  So, you can effortlessly determine the best team of all time if you choose, without worrying about any biases.&#10;&#10;As the name implies, the games play out Ultra Quick! Now you can finally complete that full baseball season on your tabletop with Ultra Quick Baseball.&#10;&#10;You'll need an Ultra Quick Season Year Book to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

Build 12 Offices, a Legendary Building and the Airport), Events are the cards that you will draw at the end of each round, Challenges, finally, will be cards drawn every 4 rounds after the creation of the second District, a sort of Event Cards but more cruel (E.g. Some criminals stormed up a cargo ship. Remove a ship if you don't have a Task Force card to cancel this Challenge)!&#10;The single-player version it&rsquo;s a pleasant pastime, moreover, you can become familiar with the game mechanics, road construction (curves, intersections, straights) and with the placement of buildings in the most strategic and useful way (where will we put the Police Station? And the Hospital? And if their range doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the whole districts?). &#10;In fact, you could find yourself in some unpleasant situations, where, a faulty District might preclude you some possibilities! Or, even worse, making lose you the goals!&#10;In multi player mode, imagine a situation where 3 mayors join forces against one, literally making it out to the sound of Challenge cards, or excluding him from trade routes or even blow a Legendary Building out of his nose during the auction, (perhaps useful for completing a goal)! &#10;It will also be possible to play in teams, 2vs2, and see which of the two teams manages to make 1 of their mayors stand out before the opponents. And... What if someone betrays his coalition? You decide how to play, the rules leaves you carte blanche!&#10;There&rsquo;s another way called Fair Play Mode, where players decides to play without &quot;throw a monkey wrench in the works&quot;. Who, first, completes the goal revealed by the card drawn at the start of the game, eliminating the auction for Legendary Buildings, will win the game.&#10;Building Cities has very high replayability, where every game will be different from the previous one!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Will you be the first of your peers to bring your monstrous creation to life?  Dig up body parts from the village graveyard, buy items from the workshop, and gather the resources you need to finish your work and become the greatest scientific mind of the age.  With your faithful henchman at your side, anything is possible.  But beware!  The villagers are becoming restless.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they form an angry mob and head for your castle&mdash;and that&rsquo;s sure to send your monster into an angry rampage through the village.&#10;&#10;Dr. Frankenstein: Rise of the Monster is a hierarchical worker placement game.  Through strategic placement of your pawns, sometimes blocking other players or bumping them to adjacent locations, you collect the resources and body parts needed to bring your monster to life.  Once alive, your monster is an additional worker which you may place to gain resources or sacrifice on a rampage through the village to score additional victory points.  Players must take care to manage the anger of the villagers by controlling the mob meter, or else the villagers might riot.  The burgomeister pawn adds a unique element of placement control and timing, though his loyalty often shifts from player to player.  Items purchased at the village workshop boost the players&rsquo; abilities to gather resources, score victory points, rampage, or control areas of the board.  Each scientist has his own special abilities which augment game play for that particular player and offer numerous pathways to victory.  The first player to 25 victory points wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kampen om Stavanger is a card game where players are politicians trying to get political issues approved. First player to gain issues worth 10 swords is the winner. Each player starts with four political issue cards and one support card.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 48 political issues cards worth 1-3 swords, and 21 support cards. The political issues come in four colors; red (collective issues), blue (market issues), green (environmental isues) and yellow (value issues). Each issue card comes with a price market at the top; in trying to get a political issue approved, the player has to sacrifice a number of red, blue, green and/or yellow cards from her hand.&#10;&#10;In addition, the support cards represent different organisations who can give your proposal a supporting boost; media, taxi drivers, environmentalists, pub owners, the bishop etc. Support cards has a support value and a blocking value. Support cards can substitute a number of sacrificed issue cards.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, the player takes two actions, and chooses from&#10;&#10;i) Draw three issue cards &#10;ii) Look at opponent's hand and steal one issue &#10;iii) Discard two issue cards and draw one support card &#10;iv) Propose an issue and sacrifice the right number of cards (possibly with support).&#10;&#10;In order to stop one player's proposal/issue, the other players can block it by&#10;&#10;- collectively sacrificing the same number of issue cards sacrified by the proposer (support can replace issues, using the blocking value) AND &#10;- using at least the same number of support cards.&#10;&#10;Stavanger is the fourth largest city in Norway, and three vertical viking swords standing in stone is a commonly used city symbol. The first edition was printed in a total of 100 copies, as part of mayor candidate Eirik Faret Sakariassens (SV) campaign for municipal office in 2019.&#10;&#10;The game can be purchased at thegamecrafter.com (Norwegian language only).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

These modules are playable on their own, but they are also compatible with each other and most past and future Anachrony modules and expansions.&#10;&#10;Neutronide Buildings offers a set of 4 new buildings that become increasingly effective the more Power Plants you have.&#10;&#10;The Hypersync module allows you to perform a Capital action without actually placing an Exosuit, then in the future use the new Hypersync Action to make your placement affect the past. This puts serious strain on the space-time continuum, increasing the risk of Paradoxes, but often the risk is worth the reward and the flexibility. This module is supported for 1-4 players (Fractures of Time expansion required for solo play.)&#10;&#10;With the Quantum Loops module, you are no longer limited to warping from your own timeline: the module opens up parallel universes where resources are more plentiful, the locals are eager to join your cause, or their technology allows you to shortcut your own travels through time... The possibilities multiply through a new Warp tile that grants access to the powerful Quantum Effect cards, but beware - to close a loop to a parallel universe, you will need a real Breakthrough... This module is supported for 1-4 players (Fractures of Time expansion required for solo play.)&#10;&#10;The Intrigues of the Council module simulates the World Council's political machinations, bringing two new aspects to the game: another layer of player interaction and customizable endgame scoring objectives, influenced by the players. By sending Exosuits to the right place at the right time, players can receive bonus resources and compete to build a tableau of Agenda tiles, which replaces the base game's Endgame Condition scoring. This module is recommended for 3 or 4 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These include the old standbys of losing a turn or moving a number of spaces forward or back, but also instructions to pay coins (which presumably have been distributed before the game) to a pot.&#10;&#10;There is a reference to dividing this pot after finishing the game, but the actual specifications are missing. (In the German game first place gets half, second place gets a third, third place gets the remainder.)
