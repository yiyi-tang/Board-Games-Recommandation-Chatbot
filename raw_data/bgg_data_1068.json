On your turn you draw one card at random from the player to your right and then play as many sheep cards as you want, telling a story to connect them as you go along. Then the other players vote on whether the story made sense or not; if at least half say yes, you can just discard the cards, otherwise you have to draw to replace them.&#10;&#10;The goal is to get rid of all your cards. However, the game continues until one team wins. The only catch is, nobody knows what team they're on until they run out of cards! Cards that tell you what team you're on are dealt at the start of the game but are kept face-down and unchecked until you run out of cards. This keeps voting honest even as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;While the rules are in Japanese, the cards have no text, so the game can be played in any language.&#10;&#10;-- user summary&#10;&#10;",

The further you get into the deck the more desperate the race becomes because the clock is always ticking on a full bladder.&#10;&#10;To win, you simply have to be the first one to get to a portable toilet without having any accidents along the way.  Nature could call at any moment and no one may make it to the front of the line, so use all the tricks up your sleeves to cheat your way to the front.&#10;&#10;A player's turn consists of 3 easy steps:&#10;1. Roll a dice and move that line up &#10;2. Draw a card and hope nature doesn&rsquo;t strike&#10;3. Take an action (play a card, move to the back of a line or just discard a card)&#10;&#10;Player cards allow you to do things like:&#10;&bull; Move a player to the end of a line&#10;&bull; Force a player out of line&#10;&bull; Let a foodie cut into the front of the line&#10;&bull; Add people to the end of a line&#10;&bull; Temporarily close down a portable toilet&#10;&bull; Stop another player from playing a card&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, players play either scandal cards or cover-up cards. A player then chooses which scandal to reveal, hoping the next, bigger scandal is just around the corner to occupy the press. If they can't play a same level (number) of scandal or higher, they have to pick up all the revealed scandals.  If you play the same level (i.e. same number) of scandal as your opponent, they can stack and give you special bonus actions.&#10;&#10;Eventually, once you've eliminated of all your hidden scandals, you can finally get to putting those nagging open scandals behind you, knowing you will not be the last one left in the press.&#10;&#10;There are no winners in this game of politics, with only the last one left holding onto scandals being indicted and losing.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ukai is a historic form of fishing at night on rivers in Japan, using cormorants to dive for fish. The fish caught are usually ayu (sweetfish). A rope on the bird's throat stops them from swallowing the fish they catch. Once they have caught enough fish for the fishers, the birds are fed.&#10;&#10;The most famous location for Ukai in Japan is on the Nagara River (Nagaragawa) in Gifu province. The fishing people go out in long wooden boats, with a large wood fire raised up on the boat to light the way.&#10;&#10;In this game, players move up the river, a tableau of cards laid face down. As the fishers move up river, the diving birds reveal cards. Some have sweetfish (1 to 5 points), others have hazards, such as the bird striking a rock. Some cards have special effects too. The game ends when all the 'bonfires' in the game are exhausted, meaning time is out. The player with the highest score in fish is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is published in a tiny matchbox box (no striker), with a deck of small cards and includes matches. It was recently shown on Twitter as the smallest doujin game in Japan.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the card-based party game for adults where you create bizarre and hilarious &quot;IF/THEN&quot; statements, which we call Toxic Logic. The game is easy to learn, portable, and tons of fun for 4 or more adults.&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s how it works:&#10;&#10;Everyone is dealt 5 magenta &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; cards. The Dealer flips over a green &ldquo;IF&rdquo; card with the beginning of a conditional statement, like &ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up your butt &hellip;&rdquo; The other players each play one &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; card face down to the Dealer. The Dealer shuffles the &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; cards and then reads each &ldquo;IF/THEN&rdquo; combination:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &hellip;&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;THEN we're in for a big, sloppy surprise&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &hellip;&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;THEN these blueprints are all wrong&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &hellip;&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;THEN my new nickname is 'Sharty McFly'&rdquo;&#10;The Dealer picks a favorite &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; card and reads the winning IF/THEN combination out loud:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &hellip;&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;THEN my new nickname is 'Sharty McFly'&rdquo;&#10;The player of the winning &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; card gets a point. Everyone draws back up to 5 &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; cards, and the player to the left of the Dealer becomes the Dealer for the next round. You can keep your winning &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; cards to keep track of your own score. The first person to reach 5 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Toxic Logic is great for parties with 4 or more adults. You and your friends will have hours of laughs putting together &ldquo;IF/THEN&rdquo; statements which are absurd and so funny. Remember, &ldquo;Toxic Logic&rdquo; is not for kids! Some of the cards are filthy, and some of them are bizarre. While there is plenty of adult language and potty humor, rest assured that there is no racist or hate-based content. We want it to be fun for all adults! Put it all together, and you've got almost endless hilarity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

With the Secondary Campaign included, your heroes can compete against the Barbarians, this famous warrior folk that can easily compete with the Orcs. Along with Humans, Elves and Dwarves, the Barbarians are one of the major nations to have always been at war with the Orcs... or is it the other way around? Nevertheless, it remains a major problem: a rumor of alliance with the Kingdom of Istarra in the conquest of the Bloody Woods begins to cause trouble among greenskins. Our heroes have thus decided to go to settle their account as they know how best to do it: with brutality.&#10;&#10;At first, the heroes will have to return home and repel the Barbarian troops, thrown in the vicinity of the Bloody Woods. Barbarian camps are set up everywhere and our heroes will have to attack and destroy them as quickly as possible, before their enemies gather. The Alert track will be used to generate waves of increasingly powerful enemies.&#10;&#10;Through a series of unfortunate events, the heroes find themselves facing Ragnar, the Barbarian King, and will have to entertain him in a battle arena. If they emerge champions in the events, they can challenge the warring regent and compete against him. Be careful, because his strength is legendary. Moreover, as he plays at home, his subjects will not stand by idly. In this situation, the Alert track will serve to measure the enthusiasm of the Barbarian King. The more combos the heroes make, the higher the cursor on the track goes. When the cursor has passed the last level, Ragnar the Barbarian King will finally be eager to descend into the arena.&#10;&#10;",

Spells are organized into seven different schools of magic, such as Transfiguration, Charms, Divination, etc. There are over a thousand possible combinations to create your deck with!&#10;&#10;You have two resources to manage, stamina which represents your health, and power which is the magical energy that allows you to cast spells. Each spell has a range of power that you can use to cast it, such that it has a greater effect the more power you use.&#10;&#10;You will also have access to the two special action cards; Focus and Counterspell. Focus will bring you back to full power, while counterspell will prevent your opponent&rsquo;s spell from have an effect, causing them to waste the power they used to cast it. Counterspell costs a bit of your own stamina however, and that cost increases the more you use it! Knowing when to focus, and when to counterspell is the key to victory!&#10;&#10;The game is played with a simultaneous action mechanic. Each round, both players secretly choose a card from their hand to play, and secretly set a special dial to show how much power they are using with their card. Both players reveal their cards and dials at the same time. Spells that use less power will go before spells that use more.&#10;&#10;You will play best two out of three matches. As the game progresses, you will learn more about the cards in your opponent&rsquo;s hand, and be able to better guess when to counterspell and stop them! No matter how many powerful spells you bring a wizard duel, the key to victory is understanding your opponent!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player places a bone on the playing surface to form a square base, then each player in turn places a new bone on the pile. The player who places the bone that collapses the pile scores one point for each bone in the pile. If a player plays the last bone without collapsing the pile that player reduces their score by 10 points. The player with the least points after an agreed number of rounds is the winner. Alternatively the players may play on individual piles of bones. In this case, there is no bonus for playing the last bone.&#10;&#10;The game is packaged in a plastic barrel similar to Barrel of Monkeys.&#10;&#10;",

This band of hardened wanderers in Wildlands: The Adventuring Party can replace one of the existing factions, with their unique healing ability keeping them in the fight even when hope seems lost, or they can take to the battlefield using the &quot;Encounter&quot; rules to steal crystal shards and attack anyone who gets in their way.&#10;&#10;In more detail, when using the adventuring party as a faction, the player controlling them does not assign map cards to their individual characters. Instead, they choose five cards to pass to the player on their right and keep the other five face down. When revealing a character, the player can choose any location they have a map card for, discarding that card. They also bring a new action to the game: heal. Exclusively available to Thom the Cleric, this action allows the player to remove one damage token from a character in the same or an adjacent space.&#10;&#10;When used as an encounter, the adventuring party is set up on the board at the start of the game, then at the end of each player's turn the top card of the adventuring party deck is revealed, with the character whose artwork is displayed taking an action. Which action is taken depends on the character and the relative board state. As the game progresses, the troublesome band makes their way around the board, attacking your characters, stealing your loot, and generally causing chaos.&#10;&#10;",

This game is a lighter version of the Death Ride series and a good introductory game for the series.&#10;&#10;The battle is an interesting situation where the British got the drop on Rommel when the Germans were only considering victory and were too confident of success.  This is where Hitler began to get nervous about the ever extending flank of the German armored spearheads.  Luckily for the Germans the British had poor coordination and poor tanks involved in the attack.  While they made the Germans nervous and gave a few units some real problems they didn't have much of a chance of cutting off the German spearheads.&#10;&#10;This two day battle is one of the high points of the French campaign for the Allies.  Players will each find a tense situation at the beginning.  The British must try to push hard as far as they can in order to effect a breakthrough.  The Germans must stave off the breakthrough and hold on until help arrives.  Rommel sent the 25th Panzer Regiment forward and left the softer elements of the division behind.  It's these softer elements that come under attack.  The 25th Panzer Regiment is the help and they had to turn around and go back in order to stop the British attack.&#10;&#10;Game Scales are:&#10;- Game Turns are 15 minutes; a change from most other Death Ride series games&#10;- Hex Scale is 330m per Hex&#10;- Most units are platoons, British infantry are companies&#10;&#10;Contents - comes with (in Full Color):&#10;(4) Map Sections of the Arras France Area of Operations&#10;(3) Counter Sheets with over 600 Units and Markers&#10;(2) Scenario Cards&#10;(2) d10 and (1) d6&#10;58 Pg.

The object of the game is the same as for traditional chess--checkmate the opponent's King.&#10;&#10;The board (24&quot;x24&quot;, double-sided, quad-fold, custom designed) has 96 spaces and divided into 2 castles of 24 spaces each and a battlefield of 4 rows with 12 spaces each. Numerous initial board setups are possible. Up to 4 additional or new power pieces can be used. The game comes with 2 new optional pieces--Archer and Catapult--which compliment the Knight, Bishop, and Rook.&#10;&#10;All the traditional chess pieces move as they do in traditional chess. See the game rules for how the Archer and Catapult move. Castling works like it does in traditional chess only if the standard chess setup for the power pieces is used.&#10;&#10;The board has 4 triangular spaces. When a Queen or Bishop moves into a triangle across a corner, it can exit across either of the other 2 corners. When a Queen or Rook moves into a triangle across a side, it can exit across either of the other 2 sides. Thus, the pieces gain an extra path (a 5th path) of coverage when they are aligned with a triangular space, which is often a great advantage, especially in the middle and end games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publiser&#10;&#10;This entry is 'level 2' of the games contained in Castle Strife Games.

The good news is that if an agent's identity can be kept hidden, that agent can do the work of two normal agents. However, we believe the enemy may have sent an infiltrator who will try to sabotage our plan.&#10;&#10;Team Zodiac may be played using standard playing cards or with the zodiac&#226;&#128;&#144;themed deck found in the files section. Players take turns playing an agent card either face up or face down. Face down cards count double. Some cards may also be used to accuse another player of being the infiltrator. The players win either by playing enough agent cards or by correctly accusing the infiltrator. The infiltrator, if there is one, wins by foiling the playing of agent cards without being detected.&#10;&#10;This is an updated version of a game created for the April 2017 24 Hour Contest.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Get Organized is a mafia-based card and dice game.  The goal is to accumulate 100 or more points by collecting &ldquo;Industry Cards.&rdquo;  Each player begins with 1 of each industry card in play (Strip Clubs, Drug Trafficking, Waste Management, Money Laundering, Gambling Ring and Law Enforcement).  Each turn begins with a &ldquo;Collect&rdquo; phase, where the player takes $200 from the &ldquo;stash.&rdquo;  Then there is a &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; phase, where they player may choose to purchase more industry cards (kept in their hand for now, but not in play) or bullets to attack with.  Next is the &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; phase, where the player can choose to roll dice to &ldquo;shoot the bullets&rdquo; at another player&rsquo;s industry cards.  If a 4+ is rolled, the player takes that card and adds it to his/her industry cards in play.  Finally, there is the &ldquo;Build&rdquo; phase, which is when a player may play one industry card that was purchased earlier.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate 3 of any one industry card in play, &ldquo;owns&rdquo; that industry and gains the benefits of it (for example, the person who owns the Gambling Ring gets to roll a die during his/her collect phase and collects $100 X the number they roll, in addition to the $200 they already collect).  Every time an industry is taken over, the player who now owns it gets to pull a &ldquo;Good Earner&rdquo; card, which can be saved and used at any time (for example, there is a bullet proof vest, which makes bullets only hit on 5&rsquo;s and 6&rsquo;s for one attack phase).&#10;&#10;After each round, the player with the most industry cards in play (not counting the ones purchased but not played yet) is the &ldquo;Rat.&rdquo;  They must pull a rat card, which almost always has a negative action that must be taken.  The Rat goes first in the next round, which isn&rsquo;t always a good thing.&#10;&#10;Each industry card in play is worth 5 points, but once the player owns the industry, all the cards within that industry are worth 10 points for that player.  The game ends when there are one or more players over 100 points at the end of the round (the one with the most points wins).  If someone gets over 100 points in the middle of a round, others can attack that player to reduce their points to less than 100.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fighter In Sight is an aerial-based game for two players or more, which recounts the WW2 battles.&#10;&#10;Minimum length: 45 minutes (Playing can take longer, depending on scenario size and number of players) At the controls of your fighter planes, will you dare you to fight the fearsome Messerschmitt 109E over England, or the famous Japanese Zeros over the Pacific Ocean ? Will you succeed this battle ? Or will you have to escape the flaming wreck ? Fighter In Sight, with its historical scenarios, will allow you to relive this all over again. The game proposes a fresh approach of aerial combat. It will allow you to make mass struggle by involving many squadrons. Fighter In Sight was created with rules that will become more difficult as you play more scenarios. For example, when playing the first scenario you will learn how to use the speedometer. When playing the second one, you will also learn about the fuel management, and so on. The progressive rules have been prepared to address families as well as experienced players. It offers a simple, fast, realistic and easy to assimilate gameplay. It is possible to increase the realism and the difficulty level with additional parameters. Documenting and researching about historical background and technical facts has been an important part of the creation of Fighter in Sight so that the game would respect as much as possible the spirit of air combat, and still remain easy to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Archers, chariots, javelin throwers, infantry, initiative, and the Mount of Megiddo itself all play their part. This is a two player non-card driven war game. The Egyptians have to get 1/3rd of their forces, within a time limit, off the opposite map board edge. The Judeans either have to delay them, or inflict sufficient losses on them. Historically, the Egyptian forces were on their way to help their allies the Assyrians against the Babylonians. To do so, they had to pass through Judean territory. We do not know why Josiah went to war against Egypt. The Assyrian capital, Ninevah, had already fallen to the Babylonians and Medes in 612 (read Nahum). The remaining Assyrian forces had regrouped at Haran, but in 609 they were forced west of the Euphrates. It appears to be at this time that the Egyptians under Necho II were coming to the Assyrian&rsquo; aid. King Josiah marched out to meet them in battle. Perhaps Josiah opposed the passage of Necho&rsquo;s forces through the pass at Megiddo (See 2 Chron.35:20-24) because he feared that the growth of either Egyptian or Assyrian power would have adverse results for the continued independence of Judah. (TKB 2 Kings 23:29). Pharaoh Necho II sent word to Josiah that God had told him to immediately attack Babylon &ldquo;so stop opposing God who is with me, or He will destroy you.&rdquo; (35:21) Yet, Josiah refused to accept the word of the Lord from Pharaoh Necho II and went to fight against him on the plain of Megiddo. &ldquo;Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Pharaoh Necho II has said at God&rsquo;s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.&rdquo; (35:22) Josiah was wounded by an archer in battle and died in Jerusalem and was buried in the tombs of his fathers (35:23-24). There was great mourning in Judea and Jerusalem. This is 2nd Megiddo, King Josiah vs Pharaoh Necho II. Can you change history?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each of your three dice represents a scatterbrained wizard with a short attention span.

You roll your dice and choose which order to play them in. Each time you use a die, you count down the list of tower segments, starting at the last segment built.&#10;&#10;There is also a market speculation aspect, all Elements begin at a value of -2. As the game progresses, you will roll dice to see how values grow and fall. To make the best of this, you can build high value rooms, destroy negatively valued rooms, cap towers to score them early, and gain rerolls to adjust the outcomes of the market.&#10;&#10;All you need to play is the PDF, three standard dice and a pencil.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the January 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Grimmsdorf is a 2-4 player co&ouml;perative town-building game of lore, exploration, and survival set in a dark fairytale forest sometime in Europe's distant past. In this world of struggle and ignorance, wearied villagers are never sure where reality ends and fantasy begins. Fairies, famines, wolves, and witches seem to lurk around every bend. Real history and oral mythologies are blended together in one world of mystery, fear, and adventure.&#10;&#10;Players have to work together to avoid starvation, overcome magickal curses, build up their town, and explore the vast wilderness beyond their small world if they want a chance to survive. The themes and mechanics are tightly woven together, to create a rich and compelling experience for players.&#10;&#10;If they don't meet a trickster dwarf or a pack of hungry wolves first, 40 unique fairytale characters - both familiar and obscure - can strike out on their adventures based on their original fairytales. They'll have to balance their thirst for glory with the need to work the land, and construct helpful buildings such as apothecaries, scriptoriums, and hunting lodges. But if they succeed, their stories will live on and they can become the stuff of legend.&#10;&#10;Games run between 90-150 minutes and involve a mix of autonomous actions and team strategizing. Players work to feed the town while also playing through their characters' stories (which ultimately garners point and satisfies the win condition). When certain terrain tiles are discovered via exploration, they can farm or harvest resources to build new buildings, which in turn multiply the yield from these resource tiles. Buildings also boost characters' stat points (Charm, Fortitude and Wit; tracked on a household ledger) which helps them satisfy the requirements to start on their stories (for example, Snow White needs a certain amount of charm to be the fairest of them all and start on her story). When a new terrain tile is uncovered, players also have a chance for an event card, bring additional narrative elements to the game - and in this way players can explore and adventure independently of their story and of other players' actions. The risks and rewards increase the farther from town a character strays.&#10;&#10;",

The players seek the idols that hold the power of the ancients- if awoken, balance can be restored to the island. The player who has gathered the most power by invoking the ancients will win.&#10;The players start with a basic deck of spell cards - these cards are used to accumulate more powerful spell cards or to win the favor of an idol. Each idol has a requirement for how much spirit the player must have in their hand - spirit comes in 6 different types - and each spell card could contain a variety as well. In addition to invoking the idols, the spells a player accumulates through drafting can be used to negatively effect their opponent, or positivity effect themselves. Once a player has obtained the favor of three idols the game ends - and players total their power; each idol has an associated power value. The player with the most power wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lore:&#10;In an alternate 19th century world created by artist Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, machines have been built to serve as soldiers. Fires burn in their heads, keeping their engines running and they survive a hail of bullets. Princess Feodora has taken control of London, which has now been turned into Clockwork City.&#10;&#10;Machines were given more and more autonomy and control - punchcards passed between soldiers and seers. Now, the machines seem to have developed some sort of consciousness and no-one has heard from Feodora in years.&#10;&#10;In Edinburgh, re-engineering has gone awry and a new set of machines has arisen, wanting nothing less than the decimation of every potential problem in the land - including humans!&#10;&#10;Clockwork City is being invaded, this is the moment for the human captives of Clockwork City to escape.&#10;&#10;Welded Iron allows players to either play as the Imperial machines defending their tyranny over Clockwork City, or as human heroes who strive to escape.&#10;&#10;The Imperials want to keep the humans as slaves and keep their infrastructure intact. The humans want to avoid casualties and use the chaos to evacuate the city. In the end, everyone might survive but this is just the start of the war.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Welded Iron is a tower defense yet competitive game of an uneasy asymmetric alliance between one player: the imperial machine overlords and the other human factions. The imperial machines will use iron and steel resources to build and maintain infrastructure, while also ensuring area control over regions where humans work and live. Each player will have asymmetric powers to reflect the differences in strengths and objectives. For instance, The imperials will have powers which help to quickly build up defense infrastructure from the invading machines of the North, while also utilizing passive human &quot;resources&quot; to help in those goals. The human factions will have formed an alliance with one another after the grueling human wars in a bid to overthrow their imperial overlords. Their objectives are at odds with the imperials, as they must extract and rescue as many humans in clockwork city, and beyond to win, yet also defending the city from invasion.&#10;&#10;The game utilities randomly allocated hex tiles with positions in which towers are built for defense and attack, with regions to place electricity to power these up. The hex tiles also contain unknown bonus resources, with higher more valuable resources closer to the invading camps of the north. The imperial and human factions must work together to defeat an AI controlled invasion force or face annihilation, while also working towards their own objectives to win.&#10;&#10;Designed by acclaimed medium-heavy weight designer David Turczi, Welded Iron will please those looking for a new fresh take on tower defense games, with many miniatures available.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Persuade your friends to buy absurd products in this hilarious NSFW party game.&#10;&#10;We believe great party games should encourage you to express your own sense of humor, not just rely on each card to be a pre-written punchline. That's why we created Dumpster Dealers.&#10;&#10;Dumpster Dealers is a hilarious game of creative persuasion.&#10;Here's how it works:&#10;1. Choose a Customer&#10;One person draws a Dumpster Dollar and chooses a role to adopt from either side of the card. They will be determining the winner of the round&#10;&#10;2. Create Products&#10;Everyone else quickly combines two of their Dumpster Cards into something the Customer might want.&#10;&#10;3. Pitch Your Products&#10;Each player attempts to persuade the Customer why their ridiculous card combination is best. Hilarity ensues.&#10;&#10;4. The customer awards the Dumpster Dollar to their favorite product, ending the round. The winnner gets to be the customer for the next round.&#10;&#10;That's the main sequence of gameplay, not including the addition of bonus rounds, extra house rules, or drinking game rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The court gave the government two years to revise the law, or same-sex couples would automatically be Allowed to have their marriages registered by the local authorities.&quot;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Love has won over hate, and equality has won over discrimination,&rdquo; Annie Huang, acting director of Amnesty International Taiwan, said in a statement. &ldquo;This is a moment to cherish and celebrate,

In this game, you are a Map Maker, exploring the depths of the area&rsquo;s most dangerous dungeons in the pursuit of documenting every creature and dungeon boss you meet, and hopefully defeat, along the way. Then, when you are safe and sound back at your humble abode, you will fill in the details on the included Wild Map for future adventurers to reference. Be careful out there! This is not an easy task.&#10;&#10;Map Maker is divided into two phases; dungeon delving and boss fighting. In the dungeon delving phase, you will choose and resolve a variety of Encounters according to your Hero's stats for each level you descend, as you venture deeper into the dungeons, until you meet the boss. During the boss fighting phase, you will fight the dungeon boss following special instructions on each boss sheet. Each boss has unique features, skills and actions that you have to use different strategies to overcome, if you want to prevail.&#10;&#10;Object of the game:&#10;Map Maker is for you and up to three of your friends to become the Heroes of the story, and to delve deep into a dungeon until you discover the final boss. You win the game if you defeat the boss. Then you get to fill out the Wild Map and record the various information about the dungeon; how many levels there were and who/what the final boss was. Each map marks six dungeons with Roman numerals. Once you have defeated all six dungeons and recorded all the details on the Wild Map, your quest is complete. And remember, the brave Hero who delivers the final blow to the dungeon boss gets to put their name on the Wild Map to be remembered for all eternity. So, fight hard, intrepid adventurers!&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;This game has three versions. They are the physical version, a full color PDF version, and printer friendly PDF version. The physical version is a full-color, laminated, high quality print based on the full color PDF version of the game, it could be purchased from ebay. For PDF version, you can find it at DriveThruRPG.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll receive the components listed below for all three versions.&#10;1 Wild Map with Map Details&#10;1 Dungeon sheet&#10;1 Event sheet&#10;8 Heroes &#10;(Fighter, Thief, Mage, Cleric, Barbarian, Hunter, Warlock, Paladin)&#10;12 Bosses &#10;(Skeleton King, Black Dragon, Spider Queen, Goblin Joker, Orc Chief, Hero Hunter, Necromancer, Succubus, Blade Sister, Lrod of Choas, Soul Harvester, Dungeon Master)&#10;1 Quick guild&#10;1 Rule book (download from web)&#10;&#10;Additional writing tools and 8 or more (+1 for per player) six-sided dice need be supplied by the players.&#10;&#10;",

To do so, you must position your wizards so that they are on a tile showing a Crystal of Power at the start of your turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn is comprised of 4 phases: Gather, Magic, Discovery and Draw.

    "Description": "Get Elected is a card game for 3 to 8 players (ages 16 and up) where you have your presidential candidate attend funny campaign events, hold silly fundraisers to earn money and popularity, make outrageous promises, play scandals on your opponents (because it's always fun to trip up the other candidates), avoid the scandals yourself by spinning the news, participate in some debates, and win states.  Once your candidate has earned the electoral points (states) needed to win, then you win.&#10;&#10;It's easy to learn, hilarious to play, fast-paced, more fun than the actual elections, and without long-term consequences!&#10;&#10;Here's how you actually play the game:&#10;After rolling the dice to see who goes first, in turn order everyone selects a Candidate.  Each Candidate comes with its own unique special ability.  Everyone gets starting money, 3 Event cards, and 3 Situation cards.  Players (in turn order) draw a State Card to see which they will be competing for that turn.&#10;Your Candidate will collect a campaign salary for the turn.&#10;You will then draw an Event card and a Situation card from the decks.  Now you can play as many Event and Situation cards from your hand as you want:  some are useful playing on yourself, others are fun to use to mess with the other Candidates.  Your goal here is to earn money and popularity points.  The more you have, the better the chance to win the State at the end of your turn.  After all of the card play, everyone competes for the State.  To win the State (and its electoral points), you roll the die, add in your popularity tokens to the roll, and subtract any negative points from Scandal cards that other players may have dropped on you.  The player with the highest net total wins that State.  Game play proceeds like this until one Candidate has enough electoral points to win the game.  (The number of points needed to win is determined by how many players are in the game.)&#10;&#10;It's straightforward and easy to play - a typical game of 4-5 players taking about an hour.  This game never bogs down, doesn't require political knowledge, does not take any political stances, and is not designed as an educational game about politics. This is a fun little game about winning by accumulating points and messing with your opponents to prevent them from doing the same!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A board game with overtones of real life, but a lot more fun than the real thing!  You can play 3 to 8 players (ages 16 and up), starting off with a decision of whether to get to work or go get educated (sound familiar?).  But from there this game diverges from humdrum life, as you move your token along the board you can get to do and experience things that maybe you only wish you could do, or in some cases - wish that you could avoid!&#10;&#10;How the game plays:  &#10;Once everyone has their starting money and figured out who goes first, each player will decide whether you want to obtain an Occupation that requires a degree or one that does not.  Both sets are unique.  You will start your turn by drawing a Redefine card.  Then you will use your Occupation Special ability (if applicable) if you want. The Occupation abilities are funny and unique to each job.  You'll roll the die to see how many spaces to move your token on the game board.  (Yes, this game does feature that old-school notion of rolling dice for movement.)   &#10;Then you and other players can start using Redefine cards on yourself or on each other.  These &quot;wild cards&quot; can have a fun and unexpected effect on the game - either helping yourself, helping others, hindering others, or downright messing with the other players in funny ways.  You will move your token forward on the game board, following the instructions on the space you land on.  Usually this means you draw a card from a specific deck and follow its instructions.  Then there can be another round where you and other players can use Redefine cards again.  &#10;And that&rsquo;s about it &ndash; this is where your turn will normally end, and on it goes until you reach the Get Done space, cash out, and wait to see who has the most money (cash, properties, other assets).  If you have kids, you can cash them in for money at the end - because children can have value!&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most money at the end, wins!&#10;&#10;The typical game of 5-6 players will take about 2 hours to complete.  But it will be a very hilarious two hours!  This game is a kick to play, fun for most age groups, and will definitely satisfy the need to experience life the way you always wished it could be!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

But now they scatter all over the cards in completely unexpected directions &ndash; try to count them all at once!&#10;Hedgehogs, birds and frogs can be all together on the same card.&#10;Rules cards are even more interesting, offering more challenging inequations and double conditions.&#10;The chameleon, the game&rsquo;s new character, disguises himself as other animals, and you have to be extra attentive to spot him!&#10;HurriCount Mathitude card set is divided into three difficulty levels to help your child gradually master mathematical concepts. You can add these cards to the HurriCount set gradually or you can use it as a standalone set.&#10;&#10;",

The other players then attempt to guess the movie (with the active player giving up to three hints listed on the card). If someone correctly identifies the movie, then the active player discards it and draws a replacement movie from the deck. If the players are stumped, the movie is discarded without being replaced. Play continues until someone runs out of cards and wins.&#10;&#10;The rules also suggest other play variations, but the core mechanics are similar.
