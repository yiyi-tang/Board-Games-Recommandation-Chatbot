    "Description": "Europe of the Dark Ages was a treacherous landscape of shifting alliances, warfare, and betrayal. Among the most feared peoples of this time were the Northmen, who came from the lands of Scandinavia to pillage and conquer, without warning and without mercy. In time, the Northmen established their own kingdoms across Europe, and came to dominate many more, gathering enormous wealth and establishing lucrative trade routes.&#10;&#10;In Saga of the Northmen, you control a clan of mighty Northmen. Each round, you will use your influence cards to try to gain control of the seven major kingdoms of Europe. You will then maneuver the armies and fleets of the kingdoms that have fallen under your sway. Use your forces wisely, and the riches of Europe are yours for the taking. But beware, there are other clans who also seek plunder and coin. Only the richest and most notorious clan will prevail!&#10;&#10;",

But other players can challenge and stop an agent from moving if they have paid more than you &mdash; and for the right price they can even assassinate another agent.&#10;&#10;In addition to a slick new look, this restored edition offers two new twists on the original gameplay. First, each agent has a unique ability that lets them move an agent or the briefcase for free. Second, an alternate win condition eliminates stalling and potential stalemates. If no one wins within a certain number of turns, Dr. Solomon can end the game immediately, and whoever has paid off the most to him wins the game. However, if you pay off too much to Dr. Solomon early in the game, that can leave you with little control over the other agents, forcing you to strike a tricky balance between immediate and long-term goals.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The cards also adjust which lighthouses are lit, and the boats may move only if the lighthouse they are approaching is lit. At the end of each round, the storm move closer to the boats on the board.

    "Description": "Roads to Moscow: Battles of Mozhaysk and Mtsensk, 1941 is a two-player game depicting battles in the Soviet Union during the drive on Moscow in October 1941. The two separate battles shown in this game are named for the main objective city on each map, Mozhaysk to the west of Moscow, and Mtsensk to the south. Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.&#10;&#10;Historically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.&#10; Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad: Battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russa, 1941 game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations. Both players quickly learn how to use their motorized units effectively for overruns, combined arms, and movement of reserves. The game includes special rules for Soviet rocket artillery, NKVD, and self-propelled gun units, and fuel supply shortages, and much more, all without overwhelming play of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 12 hours&#10;Hex: 1.4km (Mozhaysk ), 1.2km (Mtsensk)&#10;Unit: Company to Battalion for most combat units, with Brigade &amp; Division HQs&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;    Three counter sheets (528 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; Mapsheet (front &amp; back printed)&#10;    4 Player Aid set-up cards&#10;    1 Charts &amp; Tables card&#10;    Rule book&#10;    Play book&#10;    1 ten-sided die&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Vance von Borries&#10;DEVELOPER: Mark Guttag&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The Chinese &ldquo;Boxers&rdquo; (Society of the Harmonious Fists), with the Imperial Manchu forces of the Qing Army, are angry and determined to expel these foreigners from China.&#10;&#10;At the Legation Compound siege, you must coordinate the various foreign detachments that have joined to defend their position until a Relief Column arrives. You also command the Relief Column, battling their way from the port of Taku, inland through hostile territory, to break the siege at Peking.&#10;&#10;Note that this game can also be enjoyed in teams working together (just as the Eight Nations had to), deciding how best to defend the Legation Compound and get the Relief Column to Peking in time!&#10;&#10;A set of five standards-based lesson plans are also available for classroom teachers should they wish to use this game as a teaching tool.&#10;&#10;The game is a race against time as the Chinese forces besieging the Legation Compound are attacking relentlessly while the Relief Column battles its way to the rescue. With limited time and relentless attacks on the Compound, will you manage to Keep Up The Fire?&#10;&#10;Complexity: 2.5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit represents one Chinese or Legation unit, or 1 International Gun.&#10;&#10;",

The player adds cubes to the bag by choosing to fund different public institutions, borrow even more money or raise taxes, meaning that the player decides how the nation's money is spent, but doesn't directly choose the effects that spending has on the country.&#10;&#10;",

In the midst of this turmoil, one man uses courage and cunning to fight the brutality: The Scarlet Pimpernel. Along with his League of followers, The Scarlet Pimpernel rescues the innocent from under the very noses of the Committee, leaving behind only a card showing a small pimpernel flower. The man behind the rescues, Englishman Sir Percy Blakeney, must keep his identity a secret from all but his closest associates.&#10;&#10;In The Scarlet Pimpernel, you play as members of the league helping the Scarlet Pimpernel accomplish seven missions, rescuing the innocent from the guillotine. No mission will be as important as the last, for you save the young Dauphin, heir to the French throne, by whisking him away to Vienna. As a member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, you help carry out missions by securing the route and location, obtaining the required number of supporters and resources (horses, carts, papers, and disguises), and filling the five mission spaces. This task is done by placing your cubes in various locations on the board to score points. Although players work together to accomplish missions, only the player with the highest score at the end of the game will become the Scarlet Pimpernel&rsquo;s most trusted advisor.&#10;&#10;Gameplay starts with the player who has the first player marker and proceeds clockwise. On your turn, you must either TAKE AN ACTION or PASS. You may additionally USE A REST CUBE after your initial action. The round ends when each of the five mission spaces has a cube on it, OR all players have passed in succession. You then move on to completing the mission.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must take an action or pass. Actions available to you on your turn include the basic action on your player tile OR actions listed on any ONE Special Favor tile you have collected. The basic action on your player tile allows a choice between two actions: Move Your Pawn or Place a Cube. Special favor tiles give you two actions denoted by the &ldquo;+&rdquo; symbol.&#10;&#10;Play continues until each of the five mission spaces has a cube on it OR all players have passed in succession. When this happens you immediately complete the current mission. After the seventh mission is completed, the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Included in the game is a Variable Orders-of-Battle Chart that offers variations in forces to demonstrate how history might have been different.&#10;&#10;The game spans the entire 20-month campaign, allowing players to recreate the famous battles of the period between the British-led Commonwealth forces and the Axis forces of Germany and Italy, to include Rommel's Panzer Army Africa. Set at an operational level, players must manage their military forces and precious supplies better than their opponent to achieve victory.  The Axis aims at capturing Alexandria, the key to the Suez Canal.  The British player has to prevent all this.&#10;&#10;When originally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #40 (Sep/Oct 1973), it was meant to be a very different treatment of a subject made familiar to wargamers in Afrika Korps (1964) by  The Avalon Hill Game Co . Different it indeed was, introducing a number of novel twists to what seemed to otherwise be a very traditional-style hex-and-counter wargame.  It became a classic in its own right alongside Afrika Korps.&#10;&#10;The game is a very tense, very suspenseful contest of sweeping maneuver, lunging attacks, desperate retrogrades, filled with threat, counter-threat, surprises, and more.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 month&#10;Hex: 12 miles / 19 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (SPI/Strategy &amp; Tactics version):&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; color mapsheet&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 10-page multi-fold rules booklet&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Avalon Hill version):&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; five color multi-hinged mounted mapboard&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2&quot; counters - 60 are blank)&#10;One 8-page PanzerArmee Afrika rules booklet&#10;One side-printed errata TEC card&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Complexity: Low-Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 8-10 Hours&#10;&#10;",

Ideally, you will be able to play this with 3+ players.&#10;&#10;The story:&#10;&#10;Long ago, when the realm was fledgling, the five Great Houses of the Valeria were constantly bickering, stealing, conspiring, and even assassinating each other &mdash; all for the chance to become the wealthiest and most powerful House in the Kingdom! Thrones of Valeria evolved from those power struggles and has thrived among the common people looking to taste the tug-of-war of the nobles. Today, it is the sort of game travelers play in taverns for fun and money.&#10;&#10;The game itself:&#10;&#10;Thrones of Valeria is a trick-taking game where winning is based on the coins gained and not on the amount of tricks won. Each card has a special power that affects how game rounds unfold; causing the Great Houses (suits) to swing from the prestigious to the reviled &mdash; from winning a small treasure to losing a small fortune. Thrones of Valeria features a standings board that tracks Great House prestige, chunky &quot;&quot;mahjong-style&quot;&quot; tiles to reflect the relative power of each House, a custom draw bag, coin tokens, and cards designed by The Mico.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "June 6, 1944 - 7:09 am&#10;&#10;A commanding voice shouts &ldquo;Crowbar!&rdquo; from the carefully monitored radios of Ranger Flotilla headquarters aboard the LSI command ship St. James. With that signal, the 225 men of Dog, Easy and Fox Companies of Force &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the 2nd Ranger Battalion launched one of the most incredible and seemingly impossible assaults of military history.&#10;&#10;Tasked with landing on the beaches of Normandy, France and scaling the towering 100-foot cliffs at Pointe Du Hoc in the face of determined German defenders, the Rangers were the only force that could possibly meet this challenge. Despite initially heading in the wrong direction and landing in jumbled order, the elite Rangers were eager to begin their ascent. Their mission was to find and destroy the six huge 150mm artillery pieces that were deployed in the area. These guns had to be neutralized lest they rain down a massive barrage on the American forces landing at nearby Omaha Beach. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the Rangers were also ordered to set up roadblocks on the Vierville-Grandcamp highway to delay and harass any Wehrmacht reinforcements from reaching and counterattacking the D-Day landings.&#10;&#10;The Ranger battalion climbed the massive heights against stiff resistance and advanced inland, suffering severe casualties in the process. They took many of the German positions, but no guns were to be found. The Rangers then fought off vicious counterattacks, launched by the German 726th and 914th Grenadier Regiments, and were nearly pushed back into the sea. But under the inspired leadership of Lt. Col. James Earl Rudder, the Rangers held on and eventually found and destroyed the concealed guns and established the needed roadblocks. Bravery and perseverance won the day for the Rangers as they completed another successful chapter in their glorious history.&#10;&#10;Crowbar!: The Rangers at Pointe Du Hoc is a solitaire wargame (with two-player and cooperative variants) which abstractly simulates the ebb, flow and risk of the Pointe du Hoc assault, with you playing the attacking Rangers. The game system traces its parentage to the popular &quot;In Magnificent Style&quot; game and mirrors its speed of play, tough decision-making and heart-pounding push-your-luck excitement. But Crowbar! has been updated to allow for an even smoother gameplay experience. For example, instead of the old &ldquo;dice matrix&rdquo; system to determine unit movement results, the game now utilizes four custom Movement Dice. Each die is made up of different results, escalating the possible risk/reward ratio. Dice are thrown one at a time and can be read instantly to determine what happens to the unit. The system also challenges you with even more events, including constant German counterattacks, ammunition shortages, artillery bombardments, booby traps and other surprises. Your goal is to meet your various objectives as quickly as possible, before the German defenders can dig in even deeper and before they can organize effective counterattacks. Ultimate success or failure in the game is measured by how well you do as compared to the actual heroic accomplishments of the Rangers on that historic day. Are you up to the challenge?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

WARIGIN is a combination of tabletop and card game that allows for a quick match &mdash; each round is 15-30min once you know the cards &mdash; extended play sessions thanks to the cross-match leaderboard.&#10;&#10;In WARIGIN, the inevitable 2 vs 1 conflict between the three factions is a desired driving force in the asymmetrical game design:&nbsp;As a player, you want to become the challenger via the initial bidding sequence and to lead your units against the combined enemy armies as often as possible. This is your way to exclusive perks, superior card effects and to lead the eternal ranking. It might be a tiny victory point at the end of the evening that makes all the difference.&#10;&#10;While in a three-player match the challenger is up against the two other players and their combined forces, the two-player set-up is another, very tough duel situation for both sides. When the second player gains control over two factions and gets more power via additional action cards every turn, the challenger not only fights against a superior force but also against time.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;WARIGIN ist ein schnelles, PVP fokussiertes Brettspiel f&uuml;r 2-3 Taktiker.&#10;&#10;Befehlige Himmel, H&ouml;lle und das Nichts in schnellen 2v1 Fraktionskriegen (auch bei 2 Spielern), w&auml;hrend du deine Freunde und Feinde herausforderst, in der Hitze des Gefechts k&auml;mpfst und die Ewigkeit dominierst:&#10;Als Brettspiel mit zus&auml;tzlichen Kartenspielelementen ist WARIGIN sowohl als schnelles Spiel f&uuml;r zwischendurch als auch f&uuml;r lange Spieleabende dank des spiel&uuml;bergreifenden Wertungssystems geeignet.&#10;&#10;In WARIGIN ist der unausweichliche 2-gegen-1-Konflikt zwischen den drei Fraktionen ein gew&uuml;nschtes Element im asymetrischen Spieldesign:&nbsp;&#10;Als Spieler willst du so oft es geht aus der initialen Bietsequenz als Herausforderer hervorgehen und deine Einheiten gegen die vereinten feindlichen Armeen f&uuml;hren - es ist dein Weg zu einzigartigen Optionen, m&auml;chtigen Karteneffekten sowie deinem Sieg bei der Endwertung.&nbsp;&#10;Es mag ein einziger Siegpunkt am Ende des Abends sein, der den ganzen Unterschied macht.&#10;&#10;W&auml;hrend in Drei-Spieler-Runden der Herausforderer gegen die beiden anderen Spieler und ihre Streitkr&auml;fte antritt, handelt es sich beim 2-Spieler-Setup um ein hartes Duell f&uuml;r beide Seiten:&nbsp;&#10;Der zweite Spieler &uuml;bernimmt die Kontrolle &uuml;ber die vereinten Allianzarmeen und erh&auml;lt zus&auml;tzliche Aktionskarten in jeder Runde, so dass der Herausforderer nicht nur gegen eine &Uuml;bermacht, sondern auch gegen die Zeit antritt.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Guerilla is a multi-player simulation card-wargame. Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power. As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This &quot;fog of war&quot; is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his &quot;side&quot; doesn't win the hand.&#10;&#10;Consequently, players are always torn between scoring for their &quot;side&quot;, or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.&#10;&#10;Players score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace. If atrocities are committed, the U.N. may intervene and attempt to stop the open warfare. Then the battle is fought by secret police who ferret out traitors while propaganda battles are waged for the hearts and minds of the populace.

    "Description": "No Question of Surrender: The Battle for Bir Hacheim&#10;&#10;The Grand Tactical Series moves to North Africa! Taking the acclaimed system used in The Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron, this game gives players the chance to explore the struggle of the free French forces, including two Foreign Legion battalions, as they attempt to hold out against the might of Rommel&rsquo;s Panzerarmee Afrika at the southern tip of the Gazala line in an abandoned Turkish fort.&#10;&#10;Three times the French were asked to surrender, each time they refused, with General Koenig stating that there was &ldquo;no question of surrender&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;No Question of Surrender is the first game in the Grand Tactical Series of company-level games offered by Multi-Man Publishing to examine the North African campaign. The game will also introduce new terrain types to the system and new special rules to cover events from the battle.&#10;&#10;The Free French, composed of &ldquo;Gaullists, swashbucklers and criminals of twenty different nations&rdquo; according to Rommel&rsquo;s aide Alfred Berndt, have to hold out against the Germans and Italians as Rommel adds more and more strength to try and crack the Gro&szlig;st&uuml;zpunkt (major strong point).&#10;&#10;Scenarios will include:&#10;&#10;     The historical attack by the Italian Ariete Division on the morning of May 27, 1942&#10;     An attack by the full Ariete Division on May 27 (to allow players to explore if the Italians could have captured Bir Hacheim)&#10;     The fight over point 186 where the Germans briefly capture the pivotal observation point, only the be repulsed by the Free French&#10;     And finally, the full siege starting on June 2 as the Free French try to hold out against ever increasing Italian and German forces.&#10;&#10;&#10;Taking the same level of care and detail that was observed in The Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron, No Question of Surrender continues the excellence in gaming expected from the Grand Tactical Series.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 2 hours&#10;Hex: 364 yards / 333 meters &#10;Units: Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;Three countersheets (528 5/8&quot; dual-sided counters)&#10;One 36 page Grand Tactical Series rulebook&#10;One 20 page game rulebook&#10;One 8 page series rules summary booklet&#10;Four Division Tracking Player Aid Cards (1 sided)&#10;Two Player Aid Cards (1 sided)&#10;Four 10 sided dice&#10;&#10;No Question of Surrender Credits:&#10;&#10;     Designer: Nick Richardson&#10;     Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;     Graphics: Niko Eskubi&#10;&#10;&#10;",

No one speaks of it, or even acknowledges its existence, but when it comes to taking out the garbage, it's all about the art of the dodge. In the pursuit of avoidance, each dexterously stacked banana peel represents a small victory. That candy wrapper hidden in the deep recesses of your room is a silent success. But the greenish milk carton you secretly stashed under your roommate's bed, that was a stroke of genius! That is, until you get caught making a mess while everyone else pretends they would never be so childish &mdash; as to get caught. Be careful and be cunning because only the champion can gloat in a hammock while everyone else lugs out the trash on garbage day.&#10;&#10;In Garbage Day, players take turns stacking garbage cards one at a time onto the overflowing garbage can, or stashing garbage cards in their rooms. But once a player's room gets too full, they must clean it by stacking all the cards from that room on top of the garbage can, very carefully, one by one. If garbage cards fall off the garbage can during your turn, place them in your overflow pile. If your overflow pile gets too big, you're eliminated from the game. If all other players have been eliminated, you win!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The campaign in Egypt and Libya 1940-43&#10;&#10;In September 1940, Marshal Graziani's Italian 10th Army crossed the frontier from Libya into Egypt with the strategic Nile Delta and the Suez Canal as its objective. The offensive soon faltered. In December, General O'Connor led the outnumbered Allies in a counter-attack that crushed the 10th Army and threw the remnants out of Cyrenaica. So began two years of fluid, seesaw operations waged by Axis and Allies at the edge of the desert on the rim of Africa.&#10;&#10;Western Desert, Europa VI, simulates the campaigns in Egypt and Libya from December 1940 until January 1943, as well as the peripheral operations on Malta and Cyprus, and in Syria and Lebanon. &#10;Two 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps display the battlegrounds from Tripoli to the Levant, along with Cyprus, Crete, Malta, and part of Sicily. Over a dozen types of terrain are charted. More than 400 die cut cardboard counters represent the military units that took part in the campaign. The Italian 10th Army and 5th Army, Rommel's Afrika Korps, and the British 9th Army and 8th Army (containing troops of many na-tionalities) are deployed as individual battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions &mdash; each with its historical strengths and capabilities. Aircraft units are groups of approximately 40-50 planes organized by type (such as fighter or dive-bomber) and model (from obsolete CR.42 biplanes to Me109's and Spitfires). The rules utilize basic Europa game mechanics as a framework, with specialized rules covering the historical situation in more detail.&#10;&#10;Western Desert is designed to be played by itself as a separate game and also to mate readily with The Europa Series games.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    two 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps&#10;    480 die cut counters&#10;    complete set of rules&#10;    chart set&#10;    two dices&#10;&#10;&#10;Playing Time: 6+ hours&#10;Number of Players: 2 players&#10;Complexity: Master&#10;&#10;Design: John M.

These railways operate in numerical order, build track on the map, erect stations, run their trains and always pay out their earnings 50:50 &ndash; half to their owners and half into their own treasury.&#10;&#10;Beside those operating railroads, seven other companies offering various services for the railroads are included in the game. Examples of these services are building an extra tile, allowance to run freely over small stations, reduce costs when building bridges and tunnels, and most importantly, offer new trains. Whenever a railroad uses the services of one or more of these companies, they pay their fee into their treasury. In stock rounds, players acquire shares of those companies and after operation rounds, they distribute their earnings among the share holders. These companies also have station markers (or in this case: factories) which can be placed on city tiles (instead of railway stations) by the president of the company, thus denying other companies passage through that city.&#10;&#10;Contrary to other 18xx games, all trains are available from the beginning. Because of the pricing, they usually come in the accustomed order, but not necessarily! However, trains do not rust  or go obsolete, but they may be scrapped voluntarily to make space for bigger trains. When at least one of each type of train has been sold, one more set of operation rounds is played and then the game ends. As usual in 18xx games, the wealthiest player is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

To win, the Samurai must instead exorcise the spirit for good by finding out what type of object the Gory&#197;&#141; is bound to, or by catching the spirit&rsquo;s essence three times.&#10;&#10;Each round, both players alternate in asymmetrical turns:&#10;the Gory&#197;&#141; plans the route to break a new object and mislead her opponent, placing movement cubes on a secret dry-erase board. Then the Samurai use their available actions to chase the Gory&#197;&#141; along her path, moving the Samurai pawns on the map and using a special board to organize the catch.&#10;&#10;However exorcising a spirit isn&rsquo;t a simple task at all...&#10;&#10;",

Players invest in railway companies, which build routes and run trains, with the aim of ending the richest player.&#10;&#10;18GB combines elements of 1825 and 1860 on the one hand with features of 1830 and its descendants on the other hand.  When setting up the game, the railway companies are randomly grouped into two tiers, so each play will see the map develop differently.  Players may buy up to 100% of ten-share companies and may sell any number of shares into the open market, even including the directors' certificate.  Each share sold depresses the stock price of that company, but the stock price will recover several places if the company's income is double, triple, or four times its stock price.&#10;&#10;The number of railway companies scales with the number of players.  The two 2-player scenarios play quickly, while the game becomes longer and more complex with more players.&#10;&#10;18GB has an unusual mix of city tiles and associated rules for upgrading them, which makes the engineering side of the game more challenging than many in the 18xx family.&#10;&#10;",

The cards are the paint colors, and the palette is the table.

Both variants use the same mechanisms for playing tricks, but have different bidding and score rules. Thus, once you wrap your head around the basics of the game, you can play two wildly different games with those core rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;    In Impressionism, players collectively determine the value of different colors (suits) by discarding cards from their hands before the round begins. Points are bad, analogous to Hearts.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In Pointillism, players bid with colored chips to indicate the colors they expect to win, but over-bidding risks losing all your points for the round. Points are good, analogous to Spades.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "HOCKEY BLAST is an &quot;old-school&quot; card-chart-and-dice simulation of pro hockey. Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.  It was introduced by PLAAY Games in April of 2010.&#10;&#10;The game differs significantly from similarly-themed hockey games in a number of ways.&#10;&#10;First, it re-creates hockey action totally differently than existing games like APBA and Strat-O-Matic.  Rather than re-creating a hockey game pass-by-pass and shot-by-shot, HOCKEY BLAST re-creates the action minute-by-minute.  The game charts crystallize each minute's action, and a unique &quot;lull&quot; mechanism allows the gamer to fast-forward past uneventful minutes.  The result is a hockey game that plays quickly, yet captures all the nuances and excitement of real hockey.&#10;&#10;Second, HOCKEY BLAST realistically incorporates momentum and fights into the game play. In HOCKEY BLAST, a team plays better when it has momentum.  It can gain momentum in a number of ways--by landing a big hit, scoring a goal, making a spectacular save, or having one of its players win a fight. In other hockey games, fights can occur, but have no real effect on the game other than to send participants to the penalty box.  In HOCKEY BLAST, the classic hockey &quot;enforcer&quot; persona has a real role, just as in real hockey.&#10;&#10;Another way HOCKEY BLAST is different is that it provides fans with instructions on how to rate their own players and teams.  The company encourages this, and even posts user-created card sets for free download on its website, www.plaay.com.&#10;&#10;The game comes in a two-piece labeled box with a game book that contains all the necessary charts, a hockey rink game board, a set of strategy cards, dice, markers for momentum and penalties, an instructions booklet, scoresheets, and two sample teams.  Full player card sets based on historical pro hockey seasons are available, along with a fictional player card series that is updated annually.&#10;&#10;",

Those who manage to dominate time and destroy the opponent's Totem gain the right to access the source and thus ensure the lineage of the Lords of Time.&#10;&#10;Time Arena is a confrontation game for two players or two teams. You control four fighters, and your aim is to destroy your opponents' Totem &mdash; but time is running out, and you have only five minutes&hellip; When the timer shows &laquo; 0 &raquo;, you lose the game!&#10;&#10;In more detail, players take turns performing their team's actions, after which the other player's (or team's) turn begins. Each player has five minutes, which they can use as they wish all along the game. At the beginning of the game, the first player triggers the Arena Clock, which counts their time. When they decide their turn is over, for whatever reason they might decide, they pass play by pressing the Arena Clock. This both ends their countdown and starts the opponent's.&#10;&#10;You will also have to deal with another time factor since each of the characters forming your team has a specific recharge time. When a character is destroyed in the Time Arena, its sand timer is turned over, and the character returns to play after all the sand has run out.&#10;&#10;",

Through her cunning, and with the help of four magic objects, she attempts to escape her fate.&#10;&#10;The Maiden in the Forest is an 18-card solitaire game using only cards. The rules are contained within the 18 cards. The object of the game is to rotate, then turn over, each of the twelve tree cards from their blooming to dormant side. If you can do this before the end of the twelve clock cycles of day and night, you win your freedom.&#10;&#10;To begin, shuffle the twelve tree cards and place them in a ring like a clock face. All cards should have their blooming side revealed and the trunks should point towards the center of the ring. Each card also shows one of four objects. Place the maiden card inside the ring at the 12 o'clock position. Set the four object cards to one side. Each day, you perform two actions:&#10;&#10;1. Shuffle the four object cards and place them face down in a pile. Draw the top card and view the object shown therein. All tree cards with this object may not be touched by the player during this cycle of day and night.&#10;&#10;2. Take the remaining three object cards and use their actions to move, that is, to swap the positions of the tree cards allowed to be touched, keeping their current orientations. You may use these actions in any order and may use none, one, two, or all three of the actions as you choose to.&#10;&#10;Each night, you perform two actions:&#10;&#10;1. You may now rotate blossoming tree cards with matching colors or matching objects that you are allowed to touch this night. Cards are rotated so that their trunks point outward from the ring. Cards previously rotated can then be turned over so that their dormant side is showing. Cards must be rotated (either clockwise or counter-clockwise) or turned over to their dormant side in accordance with the three patterns on the other side of this card. You may use each of the patterns only once during this night, but you may use them in any order you choose.&#10;&#10;2. Move the maiden card one position in the ring clockwise to signal the end of this day and night and the beginning of a new turn.&#10;&#10;If you turn each of the twelve tree cards to their dormant side before the end of twelve clock cycles of day and night, you win.&#10;&#10;",

Among the 99 cards in the game are artifacts and relics that have powerful effects, as well as toys that are not particularly valuable in the year 2642, but that are in great demand by other species. In exchange, these species offer their help in escaping the black holes into which players will be drawn when the collected space debris exceeds their threshold for release. The player who best manages to master the dangers of outer space after three rounds of the drafting game and collects the most valuable items will win.&#10;&#10;Black Hole Buccaneers is a fast-playing drafting game which not only offers new situations and a lot of interaction with other players, but also difficult decisions due to various card effects. In each round, everyone at the table plays one card and passes the remaining cards to their neighbor. Whoever can escape the black hole in the scoring phase of a round gets to score their collected items and thus comes a little closer to victory.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SCOPE is a 2 to 4 player game, set in the Battle of Stalingrad, where players take on the role of sniper teams on both sides. The objective of the game is to eliminate the enemy snipers or enemy troops for a total value of points depending on the scenario being played.&#10;&#10;A fast and immersive game of 5-15 minutes per match, with various levels of difficulty and rules that are explained in two minutes on the clock. When you try it, you won&rsquo;t be able to stop playing it.&#10;&#10;SCOPE is a game of strategy, cunning, and bluffing that will make you feel like a real sniper, searching and selecting your targets, shooting wisely and changing position so as not to be discovered and eliminated.&#10;&#10;&#10;RULES:GAME SET UP: each player places their Area Cards face down, in a rectangular matrix that forms their Front. You can arrange the cards anywhere. The number and type of cards depends on the chosen Scenario. A player can look at their cards whenever they want during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: The player who first eliminates all the Snipers of the rival team or who first reaches the Objective Points of the chosen Scenario wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;BASIC GAME:Two players alternate turns during the game. In a turn, each player must perform only one of the following two actions:&#10;&#10;MOVE: the player takes the 4 cards of any Quadrant (group of 2&times;2 Area Cards) from their Front, and rearrange them as they wish in the same Quadrant.&#10;&#10;SEARCH: The player reveals an enemy Area Card. If the card contains a Sniper or Unit, the player can Shoot and eliminate it.&#10;&#10;If you decide to Shoot, remove the Area Card and place it in your scoring zone. Then, place your Shot Card in the center of a Quadrant of your Front where there is at least one Sniper. The removed card is replaced by an Empty Area card of the same Front. If the revealed card is a Decoy the player is obliged to Shoot without removing the Decoy from the Front.&#10;&#10;The Shot Card represents the loud noise of the shot. It is placed on the Quadrant from where the Sniper has Shot. It remains in that position until the start of their next turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;ADVANCED MODE:Advanced Mode adds rules to the Basic Game, making it a more complete and challenging game experience. In this game mode, Unit Cards provide more actions to choose from in turn, so that the player has more options depending on the allied units present in the Front. Similar to the Basic Game, players can only use only one action per turn.&#10;&#10;SNIPER: provides the SEARCH (and Shoot) action of the Basic Game.&#10;&#10;OFFICER: reveal an allied Officer position to gain an extra MOVE action.&#10;&#10;SCOUT: reveal two adjacent cards without being able to Shoot.&#10;&#10;MORTAR: reveal an allied Mortar position to attack and eliminate any card (also a Decoy).&#10;&#10;MACHINE GUN: can Shoot at adjacent cards and stop Infantry assaults.&#10;&#10;INFANTRY: can invade the enemy Front and return as reinforcements after being eliminated.&#10;&#10;&#10;3-4 PLAYERS GAME:In 4 Player Games each side is divided into Snipers and Units. So that each player controls one of this Divisions. It is played by teams. The round is divided into 4 turns, in which the corresponding player can only use an action from the cards of their Division.&#10;&#10;In 3 Player Games a player leads the two Divisions on the same side.&#10;&#10;",

These ghosts are called &quot;Spukstaben&quot;, a portmanteau of the German words &quot;Spuk&quot; (a spooky commotion) and &quot;Buchstaben&quot; (letters). The players have to come up with words to defeat the ghosts and save their letters. The more type blocks they save, the more points they score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played over ten rounds during which new Spukstaben appear with stolen type blocks, then move towards the exit of the printshop &mdash; although some ghosts will jump towards the door immediately. Whenever a Spukstabe enters the game, its level of spook-energy is set based on the number of players.&#10;&#10;During each round, the players have one minute to separately come up with one word each that contains as many of the stolen letters as possible. These letters then hit the ghosts and reduce their spook-energy by one. However, each letter of a word can hit only one ghost and each word can hit a ghost only once, so the players have to work together to defeat the Spukstaben.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Over several hands, players bid to take the most cards in one or more of the three suits, each a different kind of hat. Players who feel they will take few, if any, tricks may bid to take the fewest cards in tricks played during each hand. Players score points for making their bids and lose points for missing their bids.&#10;&#10;Several cards picture Bob's Hat in addition to the hat of their suit. When a player wins a trick containing a card with Bob's Hat on it, the player takes the Bob's Hat card (worth plus or minus 10 points). The player with the card at the end of the hand add (or subtracts) 10 points to his score. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For a long, long time, goblins and fairies have lived in a magical world right beneath our noses. If you look hard enough, you can find rings of mushrooms, called &quot;fairy rings&quot;, which act as doors between their world and ours. Today, a gang of mischievous goblins escaped from the fairy ring, and it is up to the players to send them back before they cause trouble! But an ancient spell of rhymes which transforms goblins into fairies and fairies into goblins makes this a trickier task than you might think...&#10;&#10;Goblins Drool, Fairies Rule!, a card game of rhyme and reason for kids of all ages, is for 2 to 4 players, and has special solitaire rules for a single player. The game takes about 15 minutes to setup and play. The components consist of 20 unique cards, each card having one side representing a Goblin, and another side representing a Fairy. Each side of a card has one of four Symbols: a Sun, a Moon, a Mushroom, or a Frog. The names of the Fairies and Goblins are divided into five rhyming groups, each name ending in one of five sounds.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with 4 cards each, goblin-side-up. Four cards are placed fairy-side-up in the middle of the table, called the &quot;Fairy Ring&quot;. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their Goblins by sending them to the Fairy Ring, or be the first to obtain six Fairies. Players take turns adding one of their cards to the Fairy Ring. When a card is added, any other cards in the Fairy Ring which rhyme with the name on the added card are flipped over: Fairies become Goblins and Goblins become Fairies. Once all rhyming cards have been flipped over, the player then takes any cards from the Fairy Ring which match the symbol on the added card. The first player to end their turn with no more Goblins or with six Fairies wins.&#10;&#10;",

These cards can be used to further influence courtiers, hide property, and hinder the opponent's ability to do the same.&#10;&#10;Much like in a real-life divorce, this is a highly interactive process, and not an easy one at that.

In a team game, players will command 1 - 2 submarines depending on the number of players. The convoy merchant ships and escorts will be controlled by an AI system. In Wolfpack, players will assume the role of a German WWII submarine commander. Players will need to work together to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;In a game of Wolfpack, players will start by approaching the Allied merchant ship convoy while trying to make it through the escort's screen undetected. If successful, your submarine will make an attack run on the convoy. As the commander, you will make many decisions like maneuvering your submarine to the best firing angle while making TDC (torpedo data computer) calculations for each of your torpedos, trying to achieve your best shot. You will issue orders to your crew to deal with any damage that your submarine may have sustained. Should we run silent? Do we press the attack? The decisions are up to you. Do all of this while trying to sink as much allied merchant ship tonnage as possible and avoid being detected and sent to the bottom by the allied escort ships.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; Mounted Map Board (double sided, small &amp; large convoy)&#10;        Four 8 1/2&rdquo; x 5 1/2&rdquo; Submarine Player Boards (double sided, Type VII &amp; IX)&#10;        240 Cards&#10;        Four Countersheets&#10;        Four 17&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; &amp; Six 8 1/2&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; Play Aids&#10;        One Campaign Information Pad&#10;        One Rulebook&#10;        One Playbook&#10;        One 3&rdquo; Box&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Design: Mike Bertucelli&#10;Game Development: Joel Toppen&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "By the year 70 of the Common Era (CE), the province of Judea had been in revolt against Rome for nearly 4 years. The protests and riots that began in 66 CE had quickly turned into open rebellion. The standard Roman punitive force under Syrian legate Cestius Gallus, having failed to capture Jerusalem, was wiped out at Beth Horon. General Vespasian was given command of the Roman army in the region and ordered to crush the rebellion and restore order. Turmoil in Rome, however, saw Vespasian recalled to become Emperor. In early 70 CE, Emperor Vespasian dispatched his son Titus (a future Emperor) along with four legions to end the rebellion in this important province. Titus arrived in Jerusalem in April to find the city still at war with itself. Throughout the rebellion, differing Judean factions had fought a bitter internecine war among themselves. The primary factions fighting each other in Jerusalem at this time were controlled by Simon bar Giora and John of Gischala. With the arrival of Titus and his legions, however, they were now faced with a common threat to their immediate survival.&#10;&#10;The brutal siege of Jerusalem lasted nearly five months. During the siege, city walls were breached one-by-one, much of the city devastated, and the Temple&mdash;central to both the Jewish religion and the defense of the city&mdash;destroyed and burned. With the capture of Jerusalem, Titus had effectively ended the Judean revolt, with the last of the rebels finally cornered and eliminated in the legendary siege of Masada in 73 CE.&#10;&#10;Storm Over Jerusalem: The Roman Siege is a 2-player wargame simulating the Siege of Jerusalem in 70AD.&nbsp; One player controls the Roman forces, and the other player controls the Judean forces.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Using the Area Move system redefined in Storm Over Stalingrad and Storm Over Dien Bien Phu, the game features the use of tactical cards to augment game play, adding to the tension experienced by both sides. The rules are similar in length to those seen in previous Storm Over games, and are of the same level of complexity, with additions made for the situations encountered in this battle.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Additional rules added to the game include Siege Towers, the Walls of Jerusalem, and Judean leaders.&nbsp; In addition to these new rules, new cards have been created in order to represent events encountered during the battle. These include &ldquo;Battering Rams&rdquo;, &ldquo;Famine&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rigging the Colonnades&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Escape the Siege&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: approximately 10 - 14 days&#10;Area: approximately 1&quot; = 300ft / 91 meters&#10;Units: Legions&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (108 3/4&quot; counters w/ 1 blank)&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (54 3/4&quot; &amp; 88 5/8&quot; counters w/ 17 blanks)&#10;One 12-page full color rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed player aid cards&#10;One deck of 55 tactical playing cards&#10;Four 6 sided dice (2 red &amp; 2 blue)&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Low&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 (or more)&#10;Playing Time: 2-3 hours&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible. To do so, cards are placed clockwise around a five-sided Tarantula tile in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;Before turning over the top card from their stack, a player might have to imitate the animal on the previous player's card (by saying &quot;wuff&quot;, &quot;eee-ah&quot; etc.). This depends on some features of the previous card: If it shows one or two spiders the player has to &quot;imitate&quot; once or twice, else they have to remain silent.&#10;&#10;Then the player may put their top card down in the next slot clockwise around the Tarantula tile, except when there are two animals on the previous card. Then the new card goes in the next but one slot ...  All in a time limit of 2 seconds max.&#10;And finally, if the new card is a Tarantula, all players have to smack their hand down on the table (to &quot;chase it off&quot;).&#10;&#10;If anyone makes a mistake or is too slow, they have to take all cards on the table into their own stack and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Several additional expert rules make it even more complicated to get rid of the cards and provoke more mistakes, e.g. cards have to be placed on previous donkeys as these are to stubborn to move on or curious dogs change the direction of placing cards (clockwise to counter-clockwise and vice versa).&#10;&#10;Announced for Essen 2009.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For thousands of years all we have known is the Rift Storm. It destroyed our empire, sundered our land and severed us from the Old World we once ruled. Sheltered within the eye of the storm we fought to survive, imprisoned in our last remaining city, desperately clinging to life. As the ages passed the eye slowly grew in size enabling exploration beyond the city and a startling discovery. The storm was still connected to the Old World, its erratic rift capturing hapless Atlantic crossings and wrecking them upon Atlantis' broken shores. The age of the Storm Raider was born: Brave souls who for fame and fortune would dare the might of the Rift Storm, to save these precious offerings and bring hope to our dying world.&#10;&#10;The Storm Season is upon us, all eyes look to the sky and we wonder are you the Storm Raider Atlantis has been waiting for?&#10;&#10;The aim of Storm Raiders is to be the player with the most prestige at the game's end. Storm raiding is a perilous task, filled with many dangers - the most devastating being the mighty Rift Storm that encircles the many islands. Players will want to stay close to the storm, without being overcome by its immeasurable force.&#10;Prestige is gained by salvaging wreck sites, fulfilling contracts, acquiring crew, upgrading their vehicles, and earning medals. Players will be drafting dice each turn to either travel using their trike, plane, or sub, or to instead take some much-needed time to rest and repair their battered vehicles.&#10;&#10;After 6 rounds of traversing the splintered landscape, players will add up their prestige points to determine who will be remembered as the greatest Storm Raider of their time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

In both the play and the game, Cyrano writes poetry to woo a woman for another man. The game Cyrano lasts a number of rounds, and each round starts with a player revealing a theme card and two rhyme cards (&quot;-aid&quot;, &quot;-ed&quot; and so on with homonyms being acceptable). Each player then composes a quatrain (a poem of four lines) with two of the lines ending with one of the rhymes and the other two ending with the other rhyme. Players read their poems and score points Boggle-style, with each unique ending word being worth one point; these points are recorded by blacking out squares on a ladder, which represents the lover&rsquo;s climb toward his object of affection.&#10;&#10;Everyone then secretly votes on which poem he or she most appreciated, whether for its beauty, adherence to theme, or some other artistic qualification. Players reveal their votes simultaneously, and for each player who voted the same way you did, you receive one point, with these points being recorded by the maiden&rsquo;s descent from the tower. Whichever player first brings the loves onto the same floor of the tower wins, with ties being broken by a rhyming duel.&#10;&#10;",

Whilst this game is not a &lsquo;narrative driven&rsquo; game as such, with a little imagination it will provide memorable stories. The Missions allow the Player to invent any kind of back-story they like in order to enhance the feel of the game. Some events are randomly generated, but the Player always has at least some degree of control over the level of risk they wish to take and how vulnerable they leave their Tank to these Events.&#10;&#10;The aim of this book game is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. Each of the 11 Missions can be played in around an hour, although sometimes a Mission will last a much shorter time if your Tank is destroyed! Each Mission provides plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and the many Events and decisions in the game.&#10;&#10;This book is a solitaire hex and counter style wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo;). You will need to bring at least 5, but preferably 7, standard six-sided dice. Full colour 'Mission Maps' are included, as are suggested counters which can be removed and mounted on card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Will you take on challenges or hire help, develop your town or command its heroes? Your strategies, risks, and fortune can transform your village into a thriving city or forgotten ruins.&#10;&#10;Overview:&#10;Villagers and Villains is a card game with over 100 unique cards. The game is played over several rounds. Each round has 6 distinct Phases. During each Phase, all players (Mayors) have a chance to take specific actions. The Mayor who builds the most successful village wins.&#10;&#10;Game play: &#10;Villagers and Villains is a building game. In the 1st phase players recruit cards from a common pool neutral to all players. 4 classes of cards could appear in the pool: Challenges, citizens, buildings, and heroes. Each card has different game play applications and different effects on end scoring. In the 2nd phase each player has a chance to defend their town from challenges. In the 3rd phase challenges loot towns left unprotected. The 4th phase is when each town earns money. In the 5th phase money can be spent to expand a town by hiring heroes and citizens or creating buildings. The final phase resets the board for a new round of phases. The starting player changes and rounds continue until a town reaches a fixed size. At that time the game is scored.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;In the end each town is scored based on a variety of facets and features. Players have to assess which facet will score the most points as the game is played--and circumstances dictate.&#10;&#10;Features: &#10;The game ships with a basic and advanced version for experienced and novice gamers and special 2-player game rules. In the advanced game players gain access to the king's favor, special card powers, and pairing options for final scoring. In addition, the home site offers a variety of rules variations for added game play. While chance plays a part in the game (via a die-roll for certain elements) choices in recruiting, and how to use town's abilities and resources play a large role.&#10;&#10;The game includes:&#10;100 different playing cards (challenges, citizens, heroes, buildings)&#10;10 starting cards (5 citizens, 5 angry mobs)&#10;5 player aid cards&#10;a die&#10;1 kings favor token&#10;1 start marker&#10;1 score pad&#10;2 punch-out sheets of gold coin tokens&#10;rules sheet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Relic Expedition is a jungle exploration game with a variable board, hand management, collectible treasures, and dangerous wild animals!&#10;&#10;The game board starts small, with only a few of the tiles revealed. As players explore the jungle, new tiles are revealed and the board grows in unpredictable ways, making for a completely different game each time. Hidden in the jungle, you'll find six different types of treasures made of six different materials. To win, you must collect four matching treasures &mdash; either four of the same type or four of the same material &mdash; and fly away from the jungle to victory.&#10;&#10;If you hope to travel through the terrain and survive the dangers of the jungle to get that treasure, though, you'll also need supplies like machetes, mountain climbing gear, panther traps, tranquilizer darts, vines, and more. You carry treasures and supplies in your backpack, but your backpack space is limited! As the game progresses, you'll have to choose carefully. As you find more treasure, you'll have to make tough decisions about which supplies you have to leave behind.&#10;&#10;",

It has frogs and snakes and trees and fish and spiders and rabbits and mice and mushrooms and worms. It has air and water and dirt, and it has the humans whose pollution can endanger such things. It has all the standard new rules and actions that make it Fluxx, plus a few new ones that go with the theme, including the Composting rule (which lets you draw from the bottom of the discard pile) and new types of &quot;eating&quot; goals (which let you win the game if your Keeper says it eats one of the other Keepers in play).&#10;&#10;Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game.&#10;&#10;Nature Fluxx features the same cards and gameplay as EcoFluxx, but with updated card frame art and packaging.&#10;&#10;",

Report to the Americans, Russians, British, or Chinese (it'll change!). Wield gadgets from the subtle Cigarette Dart Gun to the amazingly unsubtle Bazooka with Incendiary Ammo. Eliminate foes, from the pathetic Defective Defector, through the Interro-Gator and the Not So Secret Police, up to the mighty Super Spy himself. And (all together now)... 'Take Their Stuff!'&#10;&#10;You can play Munchkin Impossible by itself, or combine it with any number of other Munchkin games for more shameless silliness.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Earth Under Siege: Flashpoint is a 1-4 player, co-op, sci-fi dungeon crawler where players complete covert missions against an invading alien force bent on subjugation of the entire Earth.&#10;&#10;Setting:&#10;The world is in chaos. Alien enemies are assaulting military bases all over the globe, obliterating any resistance before them. They attack indiscriminately and they show no mercy. They call themselves the Xethan, but where they come from is a complete mystery. They were simply not here one moment and initiating global conquest the next. If they came from space, there are no signs of it. None of the expected indicators of aliens traversing the stars, such as starships in orbit, have been observed. Indeed, the Xethan seem to possess no vehicles in their assaults at all. Instead, they rely on short range portal technology far beyond anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen, which allows them to teleport short distances bypassing many of our defenses.&#10;&#10;But the situation is much worse than just that. These Xethan are being aided by an insurgent faction of human terrorists that call themselves the Vormacht who seem to be working with these alien invaders and betraying their own species.&#10;&#10;It has only been six months since the Xethan first appeared and they have already conquered large numbers of military bases all across Europe. If their momentum is not halted, the human race may well fall to these alien invaders. Someone must stop them.&#10;&#10;We are that someone. Now is the time. While the world is still reeling from this unexpected assault, we have not been idle. We have come together, as a species, in recognition of this greater threat to our existence. We are no longer just splintered factions of rival groups; no longer separated by our differences. Humankind has never stood so together, united, arm in arm, moving together towards this one mission. We have become AEGIS, an allied force drawn from countries all over the Earth to stand against this threat. No longer will we stay on the defensive. Now is the time we stand up and show these Xethan that humankind will not fall so easily. Now, at this flashpoint in history, we fight back.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Earth Under Siege: Flashpoint missions are heavily focused on stealth, covert actions, and sabotage. Players are Operatives of AEGIS, and their missions are focused on infiltrating enemy facilities, using every method available, such as cutting the power, using the ventilation shafts, making use of silenced weapons, and hacking into the enemy database.&#10;&#10;Players develop their Operatives and HQ over the course of a 30+ mission campaign as they follow the story deeper and deeper until they uncover the true nature of the Enemy and where they came from.&#10;&#10;Each round, players perform actions with their Operatives by exhausting one of their six action tokens until they run out of available tokens, or choose to pass. But players must be judicious in their use of their action tokens, because they normally only recover three of them each Refresh Phase.&#10;&#10;Each Operative comes with a unique deck of Tactics cards which gives them access to powerful actions and effects. Each Player will develop these decks over the course of the campaign allowing them to tailor their gameplay to a particular style or focusing on specific combos.&#10;&#10;",
