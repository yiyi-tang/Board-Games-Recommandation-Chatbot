Margaret Hofer in her book &quot;The Games We Played&quot; refers to the game with this short paragraph.&#10;&#10;&quot;Women's Basketball was introduced on the Northampton, Massachusetts campus of Smith College in 1892 less than 1 year after the game's invention. In 1898 when this table game appeared, women were playing basketball at recreation centers, YWCA's, college gymnasiums, settlement houses, and high schools across the country.&quot;&#10;&#10;This game is also listed by AGCA in its &quot;BOARD GAME CATALOG&quot; 8th edition dated Oct. 1998 and by Joel Shrock in his book &quot;The Guilded Age&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bear in the Big Blue House, Who's In My Room?, is a child's puzzle building game for ages 3 and up.&#10;This game helps children to learn game rules and complete their puzzle with four pieces that specifically match one of four puzzle outlines.  To play the game, each player takes turns by pressing a lever on the front of the house resulting in a puzzle piece popping out.  The puzzle piece is kept if it matches the player's puzzle outline.  If the puzzle piece does not match the player's puzzle outline, it is either passed to the player with the matching puzzle outline (Easy Game) or inserted into a slot in the roof of the house (Advanced Game).  The turn passes to the next player, and the game progresses until a player completes their puzzle.  The Advanced Game contains two Bear/Luna pieces that allow a player who popped it out on their turn to keep it until another player ejects a piece that matches the player's puzzle.&#10;The puzzles are colorful and include Bear's missing friends, Tutter, Treelo, Ojo, Pip, and Pop.  Using the lever to 'pop' out the puzzle pieces adds a fun element for young children.&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives a Route Planner card which determines start and finish points, which may be on the same track or different ones.&#10;&#10;Players roll a d8 for movement and must travel along one of six tracks, each of which represents a different style of puzzle or problem. Where different tracks cross a player may change routes by successfully answering a question from any of the tracks that intersect there. Players have to change tracks at least three times during the game, even if their given route both starts and finishes on the same track.&#10;&#10;The six tracks or Lines correspond to different types of puzzles or problems, the idea behind the game being to develop and test different thought processes. The six lines are as follows:&#10;&#10;The Sequence Line - the puzzle here is to identify the missing part of a sequence.&#10;&#10;The Code line - here one has to break a code or cipher.&#10;&#10;The Process line - the aim here is to take in the information at speed and to deduce the correct answer.&#10;&#10;The Memory line - here a player is given a look at a card with a variety of information on it, and is then quizzed on a particular aspect of it.&#10;&#10;The Perception line - similar to the memory line, problems here relate to observational skill.&#10;&#10;The Lateral line - an exercise in lateral thinking regarding the subject detailed on the card. A player has to identify a series of objects that are related to the card's subject.&#10;&#10;All these puzzles and problems are subject to a time limit -  a sand timer with a 30s limit is included in the box.&#10;&#10;The box contains a board, six decks of 40 cards, one for each line, 15 Route Planner cards, 25 Risk It cards (which may be played when landing on a Risk It board space and have both beneficial and unhelpful effects), and six sets of playing pieces and counters to mark when a player has changed lines.&#10;&#10;",

There are fifteen separate boards, including a Chess / Checkers board in the front papers and a Backgammon board in the end papers&#10;&#10;John Astrop has written a short introduction, outlining the games he has chosen for this book and categorizing them in four groups:&#10;Easy Race Games (for small kids)- Ludo, Fire! Fire! (Snakes and Ladders), Steeplechase and Dragon.&#10;Harder Race Games (for older games) - Palm Tree, Shunting, Jackpot and Space Race.&#10;Position Games (dependent on strategy alone)- Checkers, Chess, Nine Men's morris, Five Field Kono, Asalto &#10;Wargames (strategy, imagination and luck) - Chess, Spychase, Warlord and Backgammon.&#10;&#10;Palm Tree is a combination of Ludo and Snakes and Ladders, with a nice art deco board.&#10;&#10;Space Race, Shunting, Warlord, Spychase and Jackpot appear to be original games.  The others are either classic games or re-themed roll-and-move games.&#10;&#10;Space Race is a bigger scale version of Ludo, requiring the players to roll the right numbers to build their rockets before starting on the trip to the Green Planet.  There are various squares on the way that give different results as you land on them.  The only strategy comes in deciding which piece to move.&#10;&#10;In Shunting players again roll and move, but have to pick up four trucks before returning to the start.  Players have only one train each, and can only move in one direction in a turn, but can then change direction on the next direction, as if they were trains passing through points.  Trains block each other, although they do not get bigger with extra trucks on.&#10;&#10;Warlord is a capture game with a pre-Raphaelite design.  Players have 4 pieces starting at castles on the corners on the board, and can move any one of these 4 in turn.  Landing exactly on an enemy piece captures it, and the captured piece can then be moved back to the castle and imprisoned.  Players can release captive pieces through the enchanted forest or lake.  A single piece can capture more than one enemy piece, but if that pile is recaptured, all friendly pieces go free.&#10;&#10;Spychase is similar to Scotland Yard, with no hidden movement.  The spy player attempts to steal a set of plans by rolling and landing on them, then escaping to the airport or docks.  The police players cannot capture the spy until he has taken the plans.  At that point the police player then tries to block in the spy player so that he cannot move his full roll.&#10;&#10;In Jackpot, the 2 players move their pieces up a fruit machine the full number rolled, but can only move a piece when the fruit under the piece moved is shown on the row of 6 fruit that the piece arrives on.  If no forward moves can be made, a piece must be moved down the dice roll instead.  Once all three pieces are at the final squares, a player wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "These rules were created after watching Richard Lester's film, 'The Three Musketeers' for the umpteenth time. The fighting there seemed so much more immediate and exciting than the gentlemanly way made famous by Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks even thought these may have been more acrobatic.&#10;&#10;In these rules not only is there the possibility of the acrobatic stuff, but we have put in all the fun stuff that makes Richard Lesters view of the three musketeers so distinctive, the head butting, the kicking, the dodging whacking opponents over the head with any kind of implement that may come to hand, even distracting them with the hoary old cry of 'look behind you'. You can attempt to sneak up on opponents, ride over them with horses and even let innocent civilians join in the fun. The rules actually contain two games in one. The first set is for fairly evenly matched sides of swordsmen intermingled with one or two pistoleers or musketeers to surprise the unwary as they come round corners. This fast moving first game is best played with 10 or 15 characters each represented by one figure, and operated by two or more players.&#10;&#10;The second game uses all the main rules but with just one or two little alterations and additions that appear here and there. This is the real Hollywood swashbuckling game with invincible heroes leaping from balconies and out of windows whilst taking on dozens of opponents in dazzling displays of acrobatics and Daring do. These rules, as you might expect, are biased so that the superheroes always win, well nearly always.&#10;&#10;A full range of 25mm figures and these rules can be  found at www.redoubtenterprises.com&#10;&#10;",

These are two games in one.&#10;&#10;Dodecaedron 2007 is based on a hexagonal field (the Esadome) where players use their figertips to push 6 teams of superwarriors, trying to push the Dodecaedron Cap (the DOD) into the enemy goal areas and to stop the cap there (like happens in curling).&#10;&#10;Scaraball has the same theme and background but is played in a totally different way.&#10;No more fingertip hits, but rather calculated movements of the warriors based on a deck of &quot;hit cards&quot; that players use to hit the DOD or other players.  Players try to get the DOD into the goal, or knock opposing players off the field.&#10;&#10;You can simply push with violence the DOD in opposite direction as happens in Dodecaedron 2007 or you can direct it just like Scrabbles do with their food balls, not by pushing but by rolling. In this way you follow the DOD and direct it not only along straight lines but you can draw segmented patterns avoiding enemies, following the lines on the Scaraball field.&#10;&#10;You can score by making a goal (3 points) or by blasting an enemy out of the field (1 point).&#10;&#10;The first prototype of Scaraball was presented on January 2007 at IDEAG Italian Designers and Authors Gathering.&#10;&#10;See the PhotoReport here -- http://warangel.it/IDG7e.html&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://warangel.it/ScaEng.html (English)&#10;&#10;",

When moving, it is important to keep 'in contact' with a piece on your own baseline. Contact is maintained by being in a direct, unobstructed line with the piece or via lines of contact with your other pieces. If you 'lose contact' your agent can be bribed by your opponent if he can make a similar line of contact between the piece and a piece in his own base. A bribed piece cannot be moved by the enemy but can be used in his own lines of contact. If you regain contact with a bribed agent you can re-take control of him.&#10;&#10;The game bears some similarities to Rob Abbott's 'Epaminondas' (in the layout and victory conditions) and to Sid Sackson's 'Network' (in the way lines of contact are maintained).&#10;&#10;",

Players took the role of Captain American and Bucky trying to be the first to reach the secret hideout and thwart the evil plans of the Sky Spider! (Who was he???)&#10;&#10;The game is simple spin and move. The only additional  point in the mechanics of the game is that players could land on locations with friends of Cap's (Thor, Spider-Man, Marvel Girl, Wasp, Giant-Man and Iron Man) and get 'help' - (extra spaces). But if you landed on a villain's space, you lost spaces, or full turns.&#10;&#10;The villains included some of the lesser characters of Marvel Comics of the day - and ironically, only one is a Captain America villain!&#10;&#10;Characters drawn on the board game in full color include: Captain America, Bucky, The Mandarin and the Destroyer.&#10;&#10;The villains are an eclectic lot: The Mandarin, Titanium Man, and The General (from Iron Man's story lines); Loki and the Destroyer (from Thor's pages of Journey into Mystery); Lucifer (who barely made an appearance in X-Men comics - issue 9?); the Molten Man (from Spider-Man); and then the only Captain America foe, Zemo. Of course, by this time in the comics, Zemo had already caused Bucky's death, and had in turn died in a battle with Cap! (It was an early Avenger's storyline.)  But we were kids! What did we care!!!&#10;&#10;This game is redeemed by the great art work on the board and the box. (Looks like the villains on the board might be by Don Heck working from Jack Kirby layouts, though the larger Cap and Bucky item might be vintage 1940's Kirby. The box cover certainly looks like 1960's Kirby. Since this came out at the same time as the first Marvel animated series, which were limited animations of actual comic panels, it is also likely these are art pieces simply lifted from existing art. (The Mandarin's piece is from the cover of one of his earliest appearances). This would explain the Heck artwork, since he was currently doing duty on most of the titles featuring these characters.)&#10;&#10;The game originally came with a comic - one of the few early efforts at cross-over collectibles.&#10;&#10;",

There are also question cliches (&quot;What do you blow?&quot; which is &quot;your stack.&quot;), and there is backward cliches which are simply read backwards.&#10;&#10;If the player guesses the cliche, he or she moves forward in hopes of reaching the end of the track.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the box...&#10;&#10;&quot;This game has been created with the Corvette enthusiast in mind.  We have designed the game where one can broaden his knowledge about Corvette history in an atmosphere of competition.&#10;&#10;A great deal of effort as been put forth to obtain the data for this game. Hundreds of sources and publications have been checked to ensure the proper answer for each question; including 30 combined years of working on the Corvette Assembly Line.  But nothing is absolute in the world of auto production, especially Corvettes. All questions are for the enjoyment of the family.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game is a trivia game but also a race around the board for a certain number of laps which are agreed upon by the players before starting(standard = 3 laps). Each turn you are asked a question (multiple choice). If you answer correctly you may roll the dice and move that number of spaces. If incorrect then you don't move.  There are also some special spaces on the board for flat tire, pit stop, engine trouble, traffic jams, plant tours, etc.  The first to finish the set number of laps wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are three levels to the game: &#10;1. Beginner: Roll the dice and advance WITHOUT answering questions. (I'm being serious, it's in the rules)&#10;2. Enthusiast: Standard rules.&#10;3. Corvette Buff: Ask questions without multiple choice options.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;Game Board&#10;Set of 100 trivia cards (6 questions per card)&#10;4 Corvette pawns&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Some question examples(most are pretty tough):&#10;- What was the first year forr AM/FM tape systems? 1963, 1977, or 1979.&#10;- A soft top was available in 1962.

Then you immediately may put two of your chains on Loke and get a good lead on your opponents.&#10;&#10;But Loke is cunning, and you can not be safe with his capture. He may be stealing the magical apples in Valhall that gives him enough strength to free himself from the chains you have put on him. Are you the one to capture Loke and bring him all the way back to the cave?&#10;&#10;",

If they are able to lay down cards that total eleven (including at least one 1), then they are able to declare takeoff. Subsequent turns allow the player to move closer to the Moon with their rocket parts, crew or cargo. On arriving at the Moon, they need 11 to get back. This journey has to be undertaken 7 times to win. There is a lot of luck in how the cards fall. However it works for young children learning to count.&#10;&#10;Plus rules:&#10;Much like the basic game, except that the game now has Bad Weather (to prevent a takeoff or landing), Meteor Showers (to cause missed turns) and Engine Trouble (to slow down the journey). Of course each problem comes with a solution, Clear Skies, Meteor Shield and Repair Engine.&#10;&#10;2*Plus rules:&#10;Bad Weather can either cause a delayed takeoff (one missed turn) or delayed takeoff until Clear Skies are found.&#10;&#10;3*Plus rules:&#10;There are two spy cards, these cards can abort an Earth takeoff completely.&#10;&#10;4*Plus rules:&#10;The spies become one for the Moon and one for the Earth. Aborting an Earth takeoff just delays the journey. Aborting a Moon landing makes the entire journey useless, and they still have to get back to Earth to start another journey.&#10;&#10;5*Plus rules:&#10;Either the journey cards are played like Gin Rummy, when a set is complete, or the journey can be accumulated as they are in Mille Bornes&#10;&#10;The game played at 4*Plus can take well over 4 hours, with each Spy testing the best of friendships.&#10;&#10;",
