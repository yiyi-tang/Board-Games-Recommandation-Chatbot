Contained within this makimono (scroll) is all the ancient teachings and waza (techniques) of the legendary warriors of old, enabling you to perform like them. Follow the patch of Bushi (samurai), the Ronin the Oni (devils) or even the Kusa (ninja).&#10;&#10;Well OK not quite. But what you will find within the covers of this fast play set of skirmish rules is everything you need to play out the historical, theatrical and even the fantastical action of fact and fictional Japan. Build your Tomozei (retinue) from a wide range of characters, all with different abilities and weapon skills. Fight for your honour, Giri (duty), money or just for the pure &lsquo;fun of it&rsquo;. Sample scenarios lead onto the simple advancement and campaign ideas. You may see your Tomozei fighting for control of the neighboring fief or even seeking to become the next SHOGUN.&#10;&#10;Optional weapon detail, Ki Points and Karma Cards add even more fun to your games.&#10;&#10;The game can be played using any figures from your collection in any scale. A standard game in 28mm uses a 3&rsquo;-4&rsquo; square table and is over in about 50 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

To get there, the player will have to face many battles, and manage their resources well enough to reach their goal. 2000 Miles to Paradise is not meant to simulate real-world physics, rather it mimics the fast paced and frantic combat found in movies like Mad Max.&#10;&#10;Vehicle customization and combat have been streamlined for fast play, yet allow players to be creative. Players start by selecting a vehicle type, then spend salvage points on various modifications. The players then assign bonus dice to sections of the vehicle to tune the attributes of their vehicle.&#10;&#10;The game is then played in a series of duels, with each player fighting to drive 2000 miles to reach the rumored paradise. Each duel won gets the driver 200 miles closer, as well as gas, ammo and salvage to upgrade their car. If the scavenger loses a duel though, it's all over. Do you have what it takes to reach paradise?&#10;&#10;",

But even in paradise, the law of the jungle is absolute. Survival is a daily struggle, and only the strong survive.&#10;&#10;The players in Chimera Isle are capricious nature spirits, observing and subtly influencing the ecosystem. Natural selection is only a game to these immortal beings, who wager on the fortunes of the eponymous &quot;Chimeras&quot;. The strongest creatures will thrive while the weakest go extinct, making room for newer and stranger upstarts. Don't get too attached, as the law of the jungle is brutal and survival is never guaranteed.&#10;&#10;This is a voting and speculation game for 3-4 players. Each &quot;chimera&quot; is a unique creation of one head, body, and tail, drawn randomly from a deck. All chimeras are competing to win the habitats in a second deck, as the alternative is extinction. Players guide their progress by voting for which chimera is the &quot;fittest&quot; for each habitat. In between voting rounds, players speculate on the fates of the chimeras by buying shares in these creatures. The &quot;voting game&quot; influences the &quot;investment game&quot;, and the result is a scoring round at the end of each &quot;age&quot; of play. After three ages, the highest-scoring player wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A version of Monopoly with the traditional properties replaced by rides and attractions from the Alton Towers Resort.&#10;&#10;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Originally created for a now-defunct contest in December 2010, which required that the game be playable in the iggc sandbox, use conversion capture, and be won by the player with the majority of stones.  Though the game can as easily be played with pen and paper, and with variable victory thresholds rather than balancing stones, the rules are presented here as submitted.&#10;&#10;Basic rules:&#10;Players alternately place one stone at a time in an empty space on a board with an odd number of hexagonal cells.  Normally, Black may only place white stones, while White may place either white or black stones.  If the placement of a white stone completes one or more unbroken rows of four or more white stones, all stones in these rows flip to black.  When the board is full, the player with more stones of their color on the board wins.&#10;&#10;Balancing stones:&#10;On most standard boards, White has a small but definite advantage. It is suggested to give Black a limited number of black stones which may be played at any time during the game in place of their usual white stone. Though a 'pie-rule' arrangement can ensure that both players agree on the appropriate number of such stones, CPU self-play suggests the following setups as fair, and the 9x9x9 is particularly recommended.&#10;&#10;6x6x6    Black gets 5 black stones, white gets first move.&#10;7x7x7    Black gets 4 black stones and first move.&#10;8x8x8    Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.&#10;9x9x9    Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.&#10;10x10x10 Black gets 2 black stones and first move.&#10;&#10;Note that once one accounts for the balancing stones, players may mark cells which can no longer be flipped as white, since Black may not play a black stone there, and White should never choose to.&#10;&#10;(submitted by designer)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;&quot;At the start of 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt had divergent views on the conduct of the war. The British Prime Minister favoured a strategy which focussed on the peripheries of Europe: Italy was a ripe fruit ready to be plucked, via Sicily. For the American President on the contrary, Germany was the sole objective. The enemy was to be struck right in the heart of his war economy, the Ruhr, and by the most direct route: France ! Two operations are studied in the game : &quot;Round up&quot; and &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; which for the Anglo-American general staffs quickly became one operation, &quot;Roundhammer&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Trident conference in Washington in May 1943 gave Churchill his way, clearing the road for the invasion of Italy. The Quebec conference in August 1943 (Quadrant) cancelled Roundhammer definitively in favour of the future Operation Overlord in 1944, developed in the game Liberty Roads.&#10;&#10;But what would have happened if the allies had dared to launch Operation Roundhammer in mid-September 1943, as the generals had planned?&#10;&#10;At this date, the Atlantic Wall defences were still barely started on many beaches. A large number of the German divisions in France at that time were undergoing training and were not yet operational. As for the Panzer Divisions, they were not yet equipped with the formidable Panther tank.&#10;&#10;But on the allied side there was a lack of US units. The majority had been sent to the Mediterranean, or were training in the USA. The amphibious capacity of the invasion force was far from sufficient and British reserves were very weak. Worse yet, aerial supremacy was not complete with an omnipresent Luftwaffe. Mission impossible?&#10;&#10;The Roundhammer 1943 module allows you to supply an answer through this what-if game ! The extension of Liberty Roads includes those extra units present in Western Europe at the time, along with new supports and Atlantikwall/D-Day markers, with a &lsquo;1943&rsquo; ambiance.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;Following the collapse of the Russian Empire, Estonia declared its independence. To secure this new freedom, the Estonian Army fought a valiant defensive campaign against vastly superior forces on two fronts. With the help of its western allies, most notably Britain, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark, the brave Estonian Army rapidly built up its strength and experience while fighting furiously for every meter of ground. They successfully held off the Soviet Western Front offensive, as well as crushing the Estonian Red Army, the Red Latvian Riflemen, and multiple Baltic-German armies between 1918 and 1920. Their triumphant bid for freedom established the Republic of Estonia&rsquo;s sovereignty amid the quagmire of World War One&rsquo;s aftermath and the Russian Civil War. On Feb. 2, 1920, the Treaty of Tartu finalized their independence. The mouse roared, and the birds of prey fled.&#10;&#10;The Mouse That Roared is a supplement for the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series, with 10 new scenarios portraying the key battles that enabled little Estonia to fend off the Russian giant and establish her independence from Russia for the first time since the Great Northern War in 1710. We also provide you with 165 new playing units depicting the Estonian military and Red Russians, Red Estonians, and Red Latvians from the Civil War period.  The Mouse That Roared is not a complete game: ownership of Infantry Attacks: August 1914 is necessary to provide the rules, charts, markers and game boards.&#10;&#10;The Mouse That Roared is sold in two formats: printed with laser-cut counters, and via .pdf download.  For the latter, the playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&rsquo;s components.&#10;&#10;",

They need to locate their sights then calculate how to travel to all of them. They may travel by car (10,000 dong per step), boat (50,000 dong) or plane (100,000 dong per step).  Once they arrive at the sight they need to answer a question about Vietnamese culture, history or general knowledge (many questions are multi choice). If they answer correctly they move on to the next sight.  If they throw a 1 they pick up a chance card, which may add a random element by sending them to other parts of the board (eg to Nha Trang to go snorkelling, to the nearest hospital for treatment of a monkey bite).  The aim of the game is to be the first to travel round all 6 sights without running out of money.  In the process players learn the geography and other interesting information about Vietnam.  The board is colourful with photos and counters are china figurines of Vietnamese folk.&#10;&#10;",

Each one is a city in its own right, with hospitals,&#10;shopping malls and parks. It is said that a citizen may be born, live and die in their block without ever leaving it.&#10;But citizens suffer from high unemployment and boredom is rife. It is in these conditions that almost anything, no matter how trivial, may escalate everyday tensions between&#10;neighbouring blocks into all out block war. &#10;A block war is nothing less than an anarchic armed battle between opposing blocks. With only the judges able to put a stop to it before many lives are lost, or worse still, the violence spreads throughout the city - Block Mania! Now you take the role of a Mega-City block and must fight your own block war, dishing out the ultra-violence from the relatively safe perspective of your dining room table. The only hazards you shall face will be spilled cups of synthi-caf, your partner wanting to set the dinner or a knock on the door from the judges.&#10;&#10;Object of the Game&#10;You play the role of a Mega-City block out to win a local block war, through killing opponents, gaining objectives and morale boosting actions, with success measured in &lsquo;Fighting Spirit&rsquo;. &#10;Winning the Game&#10;The game lasts until one block has achieved a comprehensive victory, neighbouring blocks surrender, are wiped out, or when the judges arrive in force to shut the shooting match down.&#10;It is helpful to set a time limit for play, say two hours. Once that time has been reached and the round finished, each player in turn order starting is allowed one turn before points are calculated and a winner decided.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gladiator: Just saying the word conjures up visions of vicious combat between desperate men who fought to the death for the amusement of the crowd. These games of death, originally started to honor the dead (the munus), began in 264 BC and continued through the Roman Empire in one form or another for over 900 years until abolished in 681 AD. Now with Red Sands Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena you can recreate the glory and splendor of these games on three levels.&#10;&#10;As a gladiator you fight your way through the Empire in hopes of reaching the Colosseum in Rome and perhaps the ultimate glory, the wooden sword of freedom, the rudis. Or perhaps you would rather be a lanista, the trainer or manager of gladiators forming your own troupe or familia gladiatoria. And the third way to play Red Sand Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena is as the owner of a ludus or gladiator school seeking to reach the ultimate honor, a school in Rome herself.&#10;&#10;Red Sand Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena gives you everything you need to do this and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the game is that it can be played solo against the game mechanics, cooperatively with all players on the same side, or competitively, head to head against your friends.&#10;&#10;At the core, the game pits gladiators against other gladiators or animals in arena combat.  Gladiator stats determine how many dice are rolled, and &quot;successes&quot; are then counted from among the dice.  Each combatant, however, has a certain number of &quot;bonus&quot; dice which he may allocate throughout the game to improve his chances.  Tactics enter the game in knowing when to use these dice.&#10;&#10;Campaign rules allow you to follow your gladiator's career as he strives to earn his freedom.&#10;&#10;A player may also opt to play as a Lanista, building a school of gladiators, buying and training slaves, pitting them against other players (or against the game mechanics) and earning money by wagering on their performances, or selling them to other schools after they have outgrown the region of the empire in which your school resides.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Red Sand, Blue Sky: Death in the Arenas of Rome&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quest Chess was self-published by Donald, in 1974. It is a Chess variant. It consists of an A4 sheet of rules.&#10;(Conquest on the Chess board)&#10;Quest-Chess is played with a standard chess set. The moves of the pieces are the same as in regular Chess. White begins by making any five moves. After that, each player may make up to ten moves per turn. However, no piece may be moved more than once during your turn, unless that piece has first made a capture, or has moved to create a check. You may pass your turn any time after making at least one move.&#10;When you make a capture you must stop and give your opponent the opportunity to capture your piece which made the capture. He has one move in which to do this, but may make this 'recapture' in any way possible. He may also refuse to recapture. Once he has made his recapture (or refused to recapture) you then continue on with the rest of your ten moves, and you may again move that piece which made the capture any time during your turn.&#10;If you make a capture on your last move, your opponent does not get a free recapture, as it is then his turn and he must start counting his moves. If he then captures, you may recapture. If you intend to capture and pass, you must announce your pass when making the capture.&#10;When you put your opponent in check, you must stop and allow him one move to get out of check. He may capture the checking piece, he may interpose, or he may move the king. Once he is out of check, you continue on with the rest of your ten moves, and that piece which moved to create the check may move again. If you check your opponent's king on your last move, it is then his turn and he must count his first move in getting out of check.&#10;Castling is considered a king move. Therefore, if you castle, the king may not move again, but the castled rook may still move.&#10;If you move a pawn two spaces, passing your opponent's pawn on the fifth rank, you must allow him the immediate option to capture 'en passant'. When a pawn is promoted to a major piece, that 'new' piece may move on the same turn.&#10;You may never make a move that exposes your king to check, regardless of whether the checking piece has already moved. If your opponent puts you in check by making a recapture and the only way to get out of check is by moving a piece that you have previously moved on that turn, then this is permissible even if it involve a capture. However, if you have a way of getting out of check by moving a previously unmoved piece, you must take that alternative.&#10;When a player is in check and cannot get out of check in one move, it is checkmate, and the game is over. Sometimes checkmate may occur on a recapture. If ten consecutive turns are made without moving a pawn and without capturing a piece, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A small dice game that comes with 5 different colored dice and rules. The dice are thrown individually in a sequence: Red to drive off, then black, blue and yellow to determine the second, third and fourth drive respectively, and then the green putting dice. Luck on the black or blue roll can bring you directly on the green in which case you can skip all other dice and proceed with the putter. Scores are cumulated and after 9 or 18 rounds a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;",

The map shows an 18 hole parcours.&#10;&#10;To play a hole, you have to select one of the club dice. The dice rolled tells you how many spaces your ball will fly (or roll) and which direction (if any) it strays off course. Dice are available for wood clubs, irons, wedges and putters, all showing different ranges and trajectories. Choosing the right dice (and taking the right amount of risk) will maneuver the ball nearer or onto the space with the hole and the number of dice you rolled is the score for that hole.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;Snooker Champion is an attempt to capture the essence of professional snooker in a replay simulation, where the strengths and weaknesses of the players become subtly apparent from continual playing of the game.&#10;The game is designed in two parts, the basic game (taking about 10-12 minutes to complete a single frame) with a wealth of in-built data reflecting the players&rsquo; differing styles of play, and the short game (about 2-3 minutes per frame) to enable &lsquo;best of 31-frame&rsquo; matches to be replayed in a reasonable short time.&quot;&#10;&#10;To play a snooker match, you have to select two player cards and agree on the version you want to play: basic or short.&#10;&#10;Depending on your choice, you simulate the snooker game by &quot;potting&quot; balls, or in this case: simulate potting attempts by rolling the dice.&#10;&#10;In the short game, a match is decided by a couple of die rolls on various tables.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, much more dice will be rolled before a winner is crowned. You may choose the the level of risk you want to take, roll two dice and look up the appropriate table, which tells you the outcome of your attempt. Table results will also enable you to try snooker attempts and escaping from snookers. A special display card will tell you how many red balls are left in play.&#10;&#10;For both versions, knowledge of the real snooker rules are helpful to understand the game and the various tables.&#10;&#10;",
