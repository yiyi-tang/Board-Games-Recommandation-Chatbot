First, players gain cards.  Each card has a 3x3 grid (like the holes on a Yago Pool board) of which 8 of the points are punched.  The cards are stacked in the hand held (that is not fanned, like a traditional card game) so that the solid point on each card can be seen through the cards.  Once a player has the right combination of cards and can create a row, players can then place a chip (red or yellow) on one of the corresponding points on the game board. If a player can cover all five points on the wild card, he may place his chip on any point on the board.&#10;&#10;Scoring is via making rows on the main board.  1 point for a line of three chips or placing 5 chips on the board.  Three points if the 5 chips makes 2 lines simultaneously.&#10;&#10;",

Should you play your cards right, you could end up with a ring. But don't get cocky: Many, many beautiful women have tried to play this game &mdash; and ended up dead.&#10;&#10;Beginning in the Foyer, each bachelorette vies to gather a six-pack of ice-cold beer and make her way to the center ring to claim the prize. The winner is the first lady to land, by precise count, on the center ring with at least six beers in her possession.&#10;Danny Hellman&#10;The packaging of the Bad Beer Baron Bachelor Edition board game.&#10;The packaging of the Bad Beer Baron Bachelor Edition board game.&#10;&#10;DIRECTIONS&#10;The player deemed most attractive (without the aid of beer goggles) gets to roll first, followed by the player to her right and so on. Players advance counterclockwise around the board, gaining one beer each time they pass the Foyer. Additional beer may be gained, or lost, by drawing a Manservant Card and by following the instructions therein.&#10;&#10;Each room in the mansion is a shortcut and can be accessed by landing on the orange square permitting entry to that room. However, each room carries the potential for a player's untimely demise. Upon entering the room, players must roll the die and follow instructions for that room. If/when a player is killed &mdash; and history argues strongly for &quot;when&quot; &mdash; she loses whatever beer she's accumulated and must return to the Foyer to start over.&#10;&#10;Only one player is permitted at a time on any square on the pathway. (The Baron is frisky but not into the holy Trinity, if you know what we mean.) If you land on a space occupied by another player, roll the die a second time and send your rival that number of spaces in the direction of your choosing. Rooms can have more than one occupant.&#10;&#10;This game is a work of pure fiction. Any resemblance to real people, events, actual beer barons or real dead girls is only a matter of coincidence.&#10;&#10;No actual women were harmed in the making of this game. Several beers were obliterated, however.&#10;&#10;",

To start a round, place two word cards face up on the table. (If the two words have fewer than ten letters, add another card to the table.) The start player then begins a clapping rhythm, then all players take turns calling out the letters in the alphabet to the rhythm, e.g. clap-clap-A, clap-clap-B, clap-clap-C, etc.&#10;&#10;However, if a letter to be called appears exactly once in the words on the table, then the player should instead say &quot;Uuups&quot;. If a player says the wrong thing, speaks out of turn, takes too long, or otherwise goofs, that player collects an Uuups card. Each Uuuups card bears a letter on it, and that letter now counts toward whether a player should say the letter or &quot;Uuups&quot; in the alphabet recital. Players start the round again with &quot;A&quot;; if players run through the entire alphabet or three Uuups cards are handed out, the round ends and two (or three) new word cards are revealed. Once all the Uuups cards have been taken, the game ends and the player with the fewest Uuups cards wins.&#10;&#10;The game includes variants to shorten or lengthen the playing time or make the game easier or more difficult. This last change involves players saying &quot;Schwupps&quot; instead of the letter or &quot;Uuups&quot; when a letter appears on the table two or more times.&#10;&#10;",

But the strategic situation was much different, as each passing month of the Allied blockade brought the Central Powers closer to defeat.&#10;&#10;Did the Kaiser's reluctance to commit his beloved High Seas Fleet doom the German people?

To discard a card, you need to find or create a group of three cars positioned in the same pattern on the game board as is shown on your card.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays simultaneously. To move a car on the board, take the green light from another player, then move a car of your choice one space in the desired direction. (If you hold the green light, you must wait for another player to take the light and move a car before you can make another move.)&#10;&#10;As soon as you spot a matching combination, say &quot;Beep! Beep!&quot;, then show your card to other players so that they can verify that you're correct. If you goofed, the player who spots the error gives you a card from her hand as punishment for you and a bonus for her. When one player runs out of cards, the game ends; anyone with cards still in hand receives penalty points equal to the number of cards they hold. The player with the lowest score after three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The cards with green backgrounds show more complicated traffic patterns and can be used to handicap experienced players. You can also give them to the player with the lowest score after rounds one and two to give the other players a better chance against this movement maven.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hungarian card game played with a traditional Hungarian deck of cards (standard deck without the cards 2-6, which uses German suits). At first players bid for being the starting player.&#10;&#10;From wikipedia (edited) :&#10;&#10;Lorum consists of 8 or 6 different individual games or contracts each with its own aim and rules. Each game is played four times making a total of 32/24 games in a session. The winner of a trick leads to the next. Suit must be followed; if that is not possible, any card may be discarded. The trick is taken by the highest card of the led suit and there are no trumps.&#10;&#10;The composition of the eight/six contracts varies, but always comprises the following four deals:&#10;&#10;No Hearts. In No Hearts, also called Reds, the aim is to avoid winning Hearts or &quot;reds&quot;. A red may not be led to the first trick unless forehand only has reds. Players may not discard a red to the first trick unless they only have reds. In the succeeding tricks, reds may be discarded if a player has no card of the led suit. Each red card taken in tricks scores 1 point.&#10;Obers. The aim is in Obers to avoid capturing Obers. Each Ober is worth 2 points. An Ober may not be led to the first trick, nor may an Ober be laid to it unless the player only has an Ober in the led suit (i.e. the Ober is a singleton). In the remaining tricks, Obers may be discarded at any stage if a player cannot follow suit.&#10;No Tricks. In No Tricks, also just Tricks, the aim is to avoid taking any tricks. Each trick is worth a point.&#10;Lorum. This contract is, like the last deal in most compendium games, a Domino-type contract. Forehand leads any card to the table. The next player in turn must play either a card of the same rank in another suit or lay off the next highest card of the same suit next to the first card. An Ace follows a Seven. If a player is unable to play a card, he misses a turn. Players may not miss a turn if they are able to play. Every turn missed costs one point. As soon as the first player goes out by laying off his last card, the remaining players score a point for each card still held in the hand. Alternatively the deal can continue until each player in succession goes out. In this variation, the second player to go out scores 1 point per card, the third player, 2 points per card and the last player, 3 points per card.&#10;&#10;In addition, one or more (typically two or four) of the following contracts are usually inserted between the third deal above (No Tricks) and the final deal (Lorum).[6]&#10;&#10;First and Last Trick. In First and Last (Erster und letzter Stich) the aim is to avoid taking the first and last tricks; each of which counts as 4 (variation: 5) points. Short variant: Only two cards are dealt to each player, the stock being given to the next dealer. The first player to lead plays one of his two cards. The winner of the trick then leads to the 'last' trick. Suit must be followed if possible. Each trick scores 4 (or 5) points.&#10;Fifth Trick. In Fifth Trick (F&uuml;nfter Stich) players must avoid taking the fifth trick, after which the deal is ended. It scores 8 points.&#10;Seventh Trick. As Fifth Trick except players avoid taking the seventh trick.&#10;Red King. The aim in Red King, also called Red King-less, is to avoid capturing the 'red king' (the King of Hearts). It scores: 16 points when captured in the first trick, 8 points in the second to seventh tricks, 32 points in the last trick and 64 points if announced before playing the last trick.&#10;Hairy Ape. As Red King, but players hold their cards facing their opponents; then play cards at random. If two or more are of the same suit, the highest wins otherwise each card 'takes' itself. The player who take the red King scores 8 points.&#10;Train (Vonat). Using the Ace-Ten scoring system, card points are added cumulatively as they are played. The first to exceed 25 wins 1 point, 50 wins 2 points, 75 wins 3 points and 100 wins 4 points.&#10;Quart(el) or Kvart. In Quartel, to the first card played, the 3 next higher cards of the same suit must be added in sequence by whoever has them until and unless no-one has the next higher card. Players do not need to play in clockwise order. The trick is won by the player who placed the last card in the sequence and he then leads to the next trick. If an eligible player has a highest card of its suit at that stage of the game in his hand (usually an Ace, but also a Seven if the Eight of the same suit has already been played), he can put it away as &quot;high&quot;. The game ends when the first player goes out by discarding his last card. This may not necessarily be the current player. The cards remaining in the other players' hands score 1 point each.&#10;All Bad (Mindenrossz). A combination of several contracts e.g. No Tricks, No Hearts, No Obers and No Red King.&#10;&#10;",

To score a point, the numerical value of a drive must total exactly 21.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;In order to play the game you will need 2 different team decks, a printout of the rules, and a play mat.Each 16 card deck represents a different football team themed after mythic characters and races.&#10;&#10;Game-play:&#10;The game-play is fast and simple with each coach simultaneously playing cards into the down positions in order to either score or keep the opponent from scoring. Each card has four values associated with the four down positions. This means that the usefulness of each card varies depending on when it is played. If the coach on offense doesn't score within those four downs then the drive ends and possession switches to the other player. Some cards also have special powers that can be triggered on certain downs that help add flavor to the different teams. An example power is &quot;push&quot; which pushes all the cards back one down position causing all their values to change.&#10;&#10;Touchstone was followed by Touchstone: Oubliette.&#10;&#10;",

At first they have to pick up weapons (there are circles on the board where they have to go around till they step on the appropriate square), then go and eliminate the targets. If you miss the target squares, you have to start again. If you step on some specific squares, your plane is destroyed - yes, it is a roll-and-move game with player elimination.&#10;&#10;",

In that earlier game, one player would reveal sections of an image bit by bit until another player would guess what the image showed; the earlier you guess the image, the more points you score.&#10;&#10;For Das gro&szlig;e Tier-R&auml;tsel the core of that earlier game remains in place: Players try to guess the identities of animals hiding in the picture box. But in addition to that challenge, players need to guess various qualities about the animal in question: What does it eat? Is it faster or slower than a human? How many legs does it have? It is a mammal or reptile? Each animal card has two sets of questions relating to it, and players in the know will score additional points. The first player to circle the score track wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implements Klappe auf!&#10;&#10;",

Each card holder is then placed window-side up on the game board, in the matching-color rectangle. Each player selects a token, places it on the 'Start' space on the game board, and rolls the dice to determine who plays first (highest roller, play continues clockwise).&#10;&#10;Ona player's turn, that player rolls the dice and moves his token that number of spaces in any direction (backtracking in the same turn is not allowed). If the player lands on a colored, lettered space, the player must open the corresponding window (by letter) on the corresponding card holder (by color). If a player lands on one of the four outside corner spaces, [b]all[/b] the windows on the corresponding card holder (by color) may be opened. When a player lands on a pink &quot;Face ID&quot; space, the player selects [b]any[/b] card holder and opens all unopened windows. When landing on a pink space marked FAID, the player selects any holder and opens the F, A, I, and D windows.&#10;&#10;During his turn, after opening any windows allowed, a player may try to identify the person on the card in the card holder that corresponds (by color) to the space his token is on. To identify the person, the player must state the name of the person on the card--[b]not[/b] the name of any character the person has played. (Example: &quot;Bob Keeshan&quot; would be correct, but not &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.)&#10;&#10;All players determine whether the player is correct. If there is a dispute, the Master List is consulted by revealing the identification number at the bottom of the card. The player making the identification consults the list in secret. If he is correct, the card is removed from the holder and rewarded to the player, who closes the windows and places another card in the holder. That player rolls the dice and moves again.&#10;&#10;If the player is incorrect, he places the card holder back on the board (leaving the windows open or closed, as they were). He does not reveal the correct identity of the person on the card, but he may not (of course) make another guess on the same card.&#10;&#10;An incorrect guess, or no guess, ends a player's turn.&#10;&#10;After a player has collected two cards of each color, he must land on a FACE ID space to attempt a Final Face Identification. When he lands on a FACE ID space, the player must attempt to identify the face in the corresponding (by color) card holder. The player consults the back of his collected face cards, which contain assorted letters. Those letters determine which if any of the unopened windows on the card holder he may open before attempting to identify the person.&#10;&#10;If the player is incorrect on the Final Face Identification, his turn is over and play resumes as normal. On that player's turn, he must attempt again to land on another FACE ID space to make another Final Face Identification.&#10;&#10;If the player is correct on the Final Face Identification, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

By carefully choosing from the available actions, players will draw road tiles and attempt to explore castles without getting caught by an Evil Leprechaun.

These brave souls may escape the clutches of the Evil Leprechaun but not even the luck of the Irish can save them from a Banshee!&#10;&#10;The game system allows players to choose from the available six actions, but players may not take more than four.

    "Description": "Take Your Pick II is the third title in SimplyFun's Take Your Pick series of party games, which gets each player to challenge his knowledge of fellow players.&#10;&#10;Each round one player is the subject; each other player is dealt three cards. Each card shows two words or phrases on it &ndash; Fried / Grilled? Do it Yourself / Pay for Labor? &ndash; with one word or phrase circled on the top half of the card, and the other word/phrase circled on the bottom.&#10;&#10;Turn the cards so that the phrase you feel most matches the subject on each card is on the top, then stack the cards with the phrase you feel the subject would most likely agree feel describes herself in the front. Players take turns reading their chosen phrases to the subject. If the subject agrees that a phrase describes her, you score a point and move on the next card in hand; if not, you're through for the round. Play as many rounds as the number of players, and whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Push your luck and your opponent by taking part in developing Cleveland's early streetcar lines. Players roll dice to improve their portfolios, expand their railroads, harness new trains or force dividends. Play continues until three of the four railroads have expended their cubes.  The most cash wins.&#10;&#10;This game is an approachable, quick train game, similar to a lot of Winsome games.  It uses cubes for track.  It uses shares in a manner similar to Chicago Express.  Payouts and dividend trigger in a manner similar to German Railways.  The unique twist in this game is that there are no treasuries for each company - dice are rolled for any company the player has a share of - and actions are performed on behalf of that company by the player.  Trains are also purchased which work similar to 18XX trains and also add bonuses to the company value as well.  Dice may be rerolled, but 6's are automatically removed and one group of dice for a specific number must always be locked for each roll, like Pickomino.&#10;&#10;There are choices to be made along the way - do you invest heavily and buy into shares?  Do you force a swap with your opponent to ruin his position?  Do you build into another railroad now to trigger a dividend or wait until your opponent goes to take it?  Do you take a turn to send your opponent's company into the woods?  How do you manage a poor roll?&#10;&#10;This was designed for the 2011 One Sheet PnP Contest.&#10;&#10;",

The player must then get home with the rug.&#10;     &#10;Game Mechanics&#10;It&rsquo;s a roll-and-move game. The board is laid out in a circle, with 8 starting points on the perimeter. The player may roll a single die, or for more control (to land on a more desirable space) may bowl instead. 5 bowling pins and 2 marbles are included. 1 marble is rolled and each pin knocked down equals 1 space. Each space requires its own action, or inaction. E.g. answer a trivia question and roll again. &#10;The players may move in any direction, there is no predetermined path. Once a player gets possession of the rug, the other players must catch up and challenge for possession. This is determined by a roll-off. Each player bowls a frame, and the best score wins possession of the rug.&#10;&#10;There is some adult content. This game is not intended for little Larrys.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to bring their pieces home first - pieces of the opponents can be taken on the way and so get sent back to their home square.&#10;&#10;Yucatan, though, has got some interesting additions to make it more tactical than the average race game: it is best played by partnerships of two, who can under certain circumstances move the partner's pieces; a cross within the track allows the pieces to take shortcuts, and similar pieces can be stacked and moved as a unit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rules:&#10;The goal is to earn maximum points judiciously revive France as a puzzle. The board represents the hexagon National (without DOM but with Corsica!). The game consists of many pieces of the puzzle of departments, as well as tokens indicating the prefectures or departmental specialties.&#10;Initially each player draws 5 counties, 10 prefectures and 10 specialties, and each poses its puzzle pieces and a cache behind chips individually. In turn, the players put pieces in the correct spaces beginning with peripheral places (or coastal) and can put together non-coastal places provided they are placed adjacent to the already in place spaces. Thus France will fill the edges toward the center.&#10;&#10;A player may ask the prefecture or the specialty in the corresponding space, provided he/she has needed token and collects extra points. If the player can not ask any evidence, he filed a reserve one of its departments and takes one back into the pile. After playing, the player takes all the puzzle pieces or chips in the pile that the number had (the reserve is used when the original deck is empty).&#10;One space on board alone is worth 10 points (and one prefecture alone or in a specialty only), a department with his or her specialty prefecture reported 50 points, 30 points for the prefecture and the specialty, and finally 100 points by asking the 3 elements of same department. The game stops at the laying of the latter department. A penalty of 10 points is imposed for any pawn prefecture or specialty kept on hand.&#10;The highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

The peasants have spent a hard week scything hay in the fields, but tonight the festivities begin, starting with a sumptuous banquet of roast hay. Then, the annual nose-stealing competition.

The first player draws 7 letters by choosing the convenience vowels or consonants.&#10;&#10;It has 1 minute 30 to form a word that has spread before him, if a player can form a longer word, it announces and shape. Whoever has the longest word advance his pawn on the course as many spaces as there are letters forming the word. Maps of the word are removed from the game The next player must keep the other letters and return to pick the missing cards to replenish his hand to 7 letters. If nobody finds a word, 7 letters are rejected and the tour resumed.&#10;&#10;On the course, when a player lands on a black square, he rolls the dice, takes the letter corresponding to the figure obtained (this letter can be A, E, I, O, U or S) and must reform a word of the same number of letters in the word presentation of the current lap. If it fails, it returns to the box where it came from.&#10;&#10;",
