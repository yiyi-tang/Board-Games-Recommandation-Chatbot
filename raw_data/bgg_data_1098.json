    "Description": "Wildlands: Map Pack 1 &ndash; The Warlock's Tower &amp; The Crystal Canyons adds a new double-sided game board to the Wildlands base game that features new opportunities and obstacles; this board can be used in conjunction with any faction expansions. Here's an overview of each side:&#10;&#10;&bull; The Crystal Canyons: Most of the rumors about the Crystal Canyons agree that when the Darkness broke, the crystals still in the earth either corrupted or became inert. That hasn't stopped survivors seeking out the place where the first arcane crystals were found, delving into the mines that once fueled the empire. This board makes full use of the rules for high and low ground. The majority of spaces are high ground, looking down at the low ground of the canyon below. Using this terrain to your advantage will be key if you hope to claim victory.&#10;&#10;&bull; The Warlock's Tower: Few know the truth of the great warlock and the powerful spells he once wove. They say that the tower sank below the waves when he died long ago. Now it has risen once more &mdash; what could that mean?&#10;&#10;When playing on this board, players need to be aware of the trickery that the warlock's magic allows. Dotted around the map are four portal spaces, each counting as adjacent to each other for the purposes of movement and area attacks. Stranger yet is the Tower, a single space at the center of the board that seems to be the epicenter of the powerful magic of the area. While no character can start the game here, it contains one of the four portal spaces on the map and gives characters here line of sight to every other space on the board, making it a tempting space for a ranged character to take position, but one that will certainly leave them vulnerable to attack.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Clash of Minds: Holmes vs Moriarty is a two-player card game in which players take on the roles of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his greatest rival, professor James Moriarty. Two powerful minds trying to figure out the intentions of their adversary every step of the way. They only have 12 hours to solve or commit the crime of the century.&#10;&#10;The crime plan plotted by Moriarty is divided into 3 threads: Tool, Type and Victim of the crime. Using the Influence cards and the unique abilities of their Agents, players try to reveal or keep secret the individual threads of the crime.&#10;&#10;Each round of the game is a different, characteristic location on the map of London. Each of these places changes the rules or introduces some restrictions. Thanks to this, each game is different and the multitude of strategies and ways to gain an advantage gives you a lot of room for maneuver and makes each game unique.&#10;&#10;When the clock on the clocktower strikes twelfth and one of the threads is still uncovered, Holmes is defeated and Moriarty triumphs by comitting the crime of the century. However, it does not have to happen ...&#10;&#10;Beautiful artwork by Barbara Wiszy&#197;&#132;ska-Kubit and great replayability will ensure hours of unforgettable fun for everyone.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Hence, they are forced to travel the world up and down in order to buy the best bottles directly from local producers.&quot;&#10;&#10;There are 6 markers in the game, each one representing a character; players choose who they want to be at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The Game table show the world that is divided in cells linked with each other. The greater part of the cells represents the world, the cells with the bottle icons indicate the typical wine production places. Other cells represent the market, the blue ones, the sea.&#10;&#10;The players, only at start, will stand about two meters away from the board and will, when prompted by an agreed cue, throw their marker on the board trying to get as near as possible to a convenient cell. If the marker does not fall within the cells area, it will be positioned in the closest permitted cell to start playing. In case of launch failure, players can have as many attempts as it takes at throwing their marker on the game board.&#10;&#10;The youngest player (alternatively, if you are having fun playing BOTTLES in a bar, the guy buying the first round) starts to move. &#10;The player throws the die and checks the result on the movement chart, according to this the given marker will move from the start cell to a different one.&#10;&#10;During his turn the players move and can buy bottle-cards. Moreover they can auction, sell, exchange or donate their bottle-cards or beg other players for theirs at any time during his turn.&#10;&#10;There are approximately 80 different cards representing the wine bottles that the players can buy. Each card shows a variety of information about the type, the name, the country of origin and the value of the wine. This value is given by the amount of wine glass icons on the card. For instance, a card with 3 wine glass icons will cost 3 Monetary Units.&#10;&#10;When players run out of money they get out of the game... Unless they convince other players to lend them money.&#10;&#10;The first player that collects at least ten bottles from ten different countries wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One Helluva Fight: The Battle of Medjez-el-Bab, December 6-10, 1942. One Helluva Fight is a low to moderate complexity wargame on the Battle of Medjez-el-Bab, fought in northern Tunisia. The Allied landings in Morocco and Algeria ushered in the collapse of the Vichy government in France, and a dramatic strategic shift in the war in Northern Africa. With Rommel&rsquo;s Army in full retreat following battles around El Alamein, the Allies had the opportunity to completely cut-off all Axis forces in North Africa, provided the vital port of Tunis could be taken quickly.&#10;&#10;The first major engagement fought by the Anglo-American forces of the war occurred near the crucial crossroads town of Medjez-el-Bab. A British and American battle group, named Blade Force and composed of units from the US 1st Armored and British 78th Infantry divisions as well as some former Vichy French units, initially took the town and then drove on to Tebourba to come within striking distance of Tunis (forward observers could actually see the minarets of the distant port). The Germans, however, cobbled together a battle group of their own, centered on the newly arrived 5th Fallschirmjager Regiment (a unit initially detailed to attack Malta) and 10th Panzer Division. Supported by Luftwaffe and Italian Bersaglieri units, a no-holds-barred tank and infantry fight was fought in which the Allies were thrown back. Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;Each copy of One Helluva Fight is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets that include the game charts and tables&#10;&bull;    264 single-sided, un-mounted counters&#10;&bull;    8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Units are mostly companies, each turn represents 8 hours of time and  a hex is approximately a half mile across. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Ilya Kudriashov. The game uses a chit-pull activation design by which the sequence of play is determined and which units and/or formations can activate. The game is very interactive, easy to learn and fun to play.&#10;&#10;",

Markers are removed from the board if they are surrounded by their opponents markers, or have one or fewer neighbors.&#10;&#10;This means that games of Kansho are often won or lost on a single critical move that can occur at any time during the game. Players must therefore play with precision and cunning in order to be victorious.&#10;&#10;The rules of Kansho are few and simple to grasp but a great deal of practice and skill is required in order to master the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In A Walk in the Woods, players take the best path to see as many features as possible and score the most points.&#10;&#10;A Walk in the Woods takes 15-30 minutes and is for 1-10 players. This is a print-and-play game which requires the following: &#10;- Player Sheet&#10;- 1 red die&#10;- 1 green die&#10;- 1 yellow die&#10;&#10;One player rolls all three dice and then selects two of the three dice. The sum of those two dice is used to determine which shape can be added to their path. Once a shape is added to the player's path, any features that are covered by the new path are scored at the bottom of the player&rsquo;s sheet. After each player selects their two dice to use, there will be 1 die left over. The player will fill in one side of the top most incomplete shape on the Bonuses section of the player sheet that matches the color of that die. When all sides are filled in, the player gets a special power they can use on any future turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends on the round when 1 or more players extend their path to or past one of the 6 ending Finish squares.

    "Description": "Market Master is a quick playing card game about controlling and dominating international markets and industries.  Game play involves playing market cards to claim control of either regions or industries, manipulating market limits, or developing key growth industries.  Markets may only be developed to fixed limits (based on the number of players) and thus it is essential for players to balance their limited investments with efforts to manipulate the market limits.  Controlling a growth industry provides players with additional cards with which to plan, but growth industries can shift rapidly.&#10;&#10;Business is both a regional and an industry affair.  Although each region and industry operates within its own context, there are strong connections that interweave to create the global market.  Knowing how just one market works can earn you a fortune, but to be a true economic titan one must know how to manipulate all the markets together.  As the newly appointed director of an international investment company, you have a simple goal&hellip; dominate the world markets and claim the title of Market Master.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are 3 Major suits (each with 10 cards) and 5 Minor suits in the deck (each with 6 cards).&#10;&#10;The 3 games included are each distinctly different from each other.&#10;&#10;GROK: A trick-taking with escalating bids in which 1 player takes on all other players.  Players bid on the number of cards of either Major or Minor suits they will capture during the round.  A player wins the bid points if they are successful; however, if a player obtains a result that is better than the highest bid at the start of the round, all other players score points per that result.&#10;&#10;GUMP: A hand-elimination game in which players attempt to be the first player to play all of their cards - or - be the player with the least cards in hand when the round ends.  This game makes use of 18 supplemental GROK Rule cards that specify how cards must be played.  If a player is unable to play according to the rule, they add all played cards to their hand and flip up a new rule.  The game ends when a player plays their last card or if all 18 rules have been used.&#10;&#10;GROK-or-GUMP: A pattern-recognition and social deduction style game.  This game uses a small number of GROK Rule cards and a hand of 5 cards.  Prior to starting the round, all players secretly decide if they will follow 1 of the face up rule cards or follow none of them.  Once all players have decided which way they will play, players each play 1 card down in front of themselves.  Players may then choose to place a bet on any player as to which way they are playing.  Play continues until all 5 cards are played.  Players score points based on when and if the other players' bets were correct.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;Some people are natural players; some are just plain lucky.  And though it can be hard to tell them apart, at least each has a name.&#10;&#10;GROK:(n) A player who understands a game intuitively and completely and thus obtains success through skill.&#10;&#10;GUMP:(n) A player who plays without obvious thought or plays randomly but nonetheless has consistent success.&#10;&#10;Not sure which you are? The games included in GROK-or-GUMP will figure it out for you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Dice are used to represent power modules that enable astronauts to move, station rings to rotate, or enable the power modules to move themselves. However, the dice are not rolled, but are instead manipulated up and down in power.

Each player starts with an identical deck of forty cards in their color. Each card has a color, element, and power. Players place cards from their hand onto any free space next to a preexisting card. The board is generated from the card placement and unique to each game.&#10;&#10;In Level 1, players try to align the color of their cards while blocking their opponent. In Level 2, players must align their cards into strings where each element appears exactly once. In Level 3, players may also move their cards on the board.

If you fail to stack them, your turn ends immediately; if you succeed, for each block you stacked, your pawn advances one square or you gain a fragment. Depending on the square where your pawn lands, you gain additional fragments or convert fragments into a fragment of better quality, or you may spend fragments to regain the full memory of your deed, earning several points. Turns go clockwise, and the next player begins their turn by stacking a number of blocks on top of the existing stack.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, if any player has scored 40 or more points, the game ends. Players score their end-of-game bonuses, and the highest scorer wins the game and enjoys a good start for their next life.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#187;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#150;&#132;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#137;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#191;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#232;&#179;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#178;&#179;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#150;&#132;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#190;&#179;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#168;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;40&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#190;&#179;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

As many as 36 8-hour turns (12 days, but warships may not stay at sea for longer than 9 days).  ca. 80 miles per hex.  Single sided pieces.&#10;&#10;Will the &quot;mongeese&quot; - 3 ... or 4? ... Eastern Fleet carriers - get close enough to launch their night attack torpedo bomber squadrons?  Or will the 4-6 King Cobra Kido Butai's fleet carriers catch and slaughter them within their aircraft's long range in daytime like they did carrier Hermes and heavy cruisers Cornwall and (Bismarck veteran) Dorsetshire?&#10;&#10;There is a quote of Churchill saying that the threat of losing (unsinkable aircraft carrier) Ceylon - and the Japanese gaining control of the Indian Ocean - was the most dangerous moment of the war, although (with hindsight) we now know the Japanese had decided not to invade.&#10;&#10;Against all 4 Kongo class fast battleships, the British muster only minimally sufficiently fast Warspite, but then there are the 4 old wheezing R class battleships which have limited duration at sea and being slow would be easy meat ... and victory points ... unless *they* can somehow get within gunfire range of a (secret 50% possible) Japanese landing force's transports or a slowed, damaged carrier.&#10;&#10;The British player is thus always under heavy pressure, and if the Japanese get the Ceylon landing/invasion mission, they feel that too.  A good 3-player game can be with one British player and a player each for the (invading or instead just raiding) Japanese Malaya Force and Kido Butai.&#10;&#10;Replete with questionable Ceylon Defence Force loyalty.  Will the Ceylon Planter's Brigade mutiny into a(n ill-advisedly) pro-Japanese Trotskist(!) brigade?

And as for my Dutch East Indies and other such games, level bombers can press their luck and bomb lower, albeit at higher risk of being shot down by antiaircraft gun batteries ... not that the Zeroes won't slaughter them anyway.&#10;&#10;Lots of freighter fish milling around the Bay of Bengal for the Japanese to bag too.&#10;&#10;Our first game, I was the overwhelmingly strong Japanese ... and got SMEARED.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "CardsLab Countries is an award winning game from the Novabase Gameshifters 2016 gamification event held in Portugal. This new edition includes a total re-branding and new game mechanics/components.&#10;&#10;CardsLab Countries is a turn-based game and the goal is to reach a certain amount of mission points or conquer all the opponents' country cards, which are evenly distributed, forming an upside down stack in front of each player. Each turn has a turn owner that has advantages in the mission and battle phases described below.&#10;&#10;Each country card features its national flag, world location and capital, as well as stats like population, life expectancy or GDP.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, three mission cards are distributed and placed in front of each player, which allow them to score points and earn special cards by forming combinations with their country cards in hand. There are two types of missions which score points based on their difficulty: easy (1 point) and hard (3 points). The first player to achieve 10 points wins the game (for the fast game mode - average duration of 30 minutes).&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of special cards that players earn by completing missions:&#10;- Steal the turn (become the turn owner)&#10;- Double the turn prize&#10;- Exchange all hand cards between 2 players&#10;- Search for a card in your own pile&#10;- Cancel any of these effects&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of 5 phases: Draw, Mission, Special, Battle and Prize.&#10;&#10;Draw phase: Each player draws cards from his stack until having 5 country cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Mission phase: Starting with the turn owner, each player tries to accomplish missions with their country cards. When a mission is completed, the country cards used to accomplish that mission are placed at the bottom of the players' card pile and the accomplished missions are placed at the bottom of the missions pile. The player can also discard one or more missions. At the end of the phase, players update their scorecard and receive new missions.&#10;&#10;Special phase: Each player can play his special cards, one at a time.&#10;&#10;Battle phase: The turn owner chooses a card from the hand, puts it upside down on the table and decides between asking a question about the card to an opponent (flag/location/capital, depending on the thrown dice value by the opponent) or choose a statistic that will have to beat all opponents' cards. For the latter, after the turn owner announces the chosen statistic, each opponent picks a card from their own hand and plays it face-down on the table, to win the battle. This adds an element of suspense and bluffing on each turn, forcing players to carefully choose their plays. Note: the number of possible questions depends on each players' difficulty level. For the easiest level, the player only has to answer the cards' continent.&#10;&#10;Prize phase: The winner of the Battle phase receives a number of cards from opponents' hands, based on the number of special cards played, the duel type (question or combat), and player count.&#10;&#10;CardsLab is a fun, educational, trivia and strategy game for ages 8-80, designed with simple mechanics that can easily bring together three generations of players to the same table. It features difficulty levels tailored to a variety of gamers, and without noticing it, they are learning as they play.&#10;&#10;Pedro Gordalina, CardsLab Designer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Champions: Hills of Glory is tactical arena style card/board game for 2 to 4 players where each takes the role of a commander in a fantasy battlefield who is ordered to capture and hold a strategically positioned small hill. Commanders will send their units up the hill battling the opponents&rsquo; in a 4x4 field, trying to keep as many as possible alive while assisting them with their unique abilities and specialty cards. Each unit in the field will grant their commander 1 victory point at the end of each round. The first player to score 24 victory points claims the hill and becomes the winner.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two types of cards; units (of levels 1 to 5) and specialty cards (of five types: combat, tactics, sorcery, trickery and faith). Each player chooses a commander and takes the appropriate template. On their commander templates, players can track their power (the resource needed to play cards), their actions and their abilities (each commander has two). Commanders aslo have one or two specializations each, noting which specialty card types they're favoring. Units are set up on 5 stacks - one for each level and players will reveal the topmost of each level and place it in front of its stack. Specialty cards are also separated in 5 stacks by type.&#10;&#10;During a game round each player will take two turns. When one's 1st turn comes, he or she will choose and execute two of the four available actions (any of them in any order). Once done, turn passes to the next player and so on. When his or hers second turn comes, he or she will execute the remaining two actions. The actions player can take are: A) Increase Power: player increases his or her power by 3. If he has a specialty card in hand, he can discard one to increase the power for 2 more. A player's power can't be more than 6 or less than 0. B) Draw: player can draw up to two cards whether they are units, specialties or a combination of both. If a player wants to draw a unit, she must pay the unit's level in power. She can either draw from the revealed ones or the top face-down unit of a stack. To draw a specialty card the player needs to pay no power. She can just draw one from any stack plus one of the stack she specializes. C) Play: player can play up to two cards from their hand, being a unit, a specialty or a combination of both. To play a specialty card he must have at least as many power as the card indicates (though he doesn't spend it). Specialty cards can empower friendly units or effect negatively the opponent ones. Each specialty type focuses on different gameplay aspects (damage, buff, debuff, heal, extra activations etc). To play a unit he puts it face-down on his starting area. Opponents can see now that he is about to send a unit of X level (it's typed on the card back) in the field. D)Command: the meat of the game. During this action the player can activate up to 2 of her units in the field. Units have 4 characteristics indicating how long they can move, how many dice they roll per attack and what type of attack they have (determines its range), its defence (how difficult is to get hit) and its life (how many damage it can sustain). They also have special abilities that they can use at that moment. When a unit attacks another, the controlling player rolls dice equal to its attack. For each roll that was equal or higher than the target's defense, he scores a hit. The number of hits is the damage inflicted upon the opponent unit. If a player has more than 2 units in the field and he didn't activate them, he can put them under &quot;defend command&quot;. They can now act during an opponent turn! Special condition effects such as daze, poison, bleed or shatter can be applied to units via abilities or specialty cards, to spice up the game and give it more tactical depth.&#10;&#10;When all players have played 2 turns each, the round ends and they count score - 1 point for each of their units remain on the field. If a player has 24 points at that time, he or she is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "If the Lannisters are known for one thing, it's their deep pockets. Their wealth lets them afford only the best when it comes to arming and armoring up their troops. Halberds tend to be a relatively cheap weapon to produce, but those made for Lannister troops are still of the highest quality, almost guaranteed to never break, even when receiving a charge from enemy cavalry. And receiving a charge is just what these men are trained to do, and do it well.&#10;&#10;The Lannister Halberdiers unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Lannister commanders new options for their forces. The unit is formidable in both offensive and defensive capacities, not losing dice after their first rank is destroyed, and being able to brace for an enemy charge, granting them a preemptive attack against their foes. The addition of an Assault Veteran Unit Attachment gives them staying power once battle has been met, adding extra dice to their melee attacks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, that speed comes at a price in terms of armor.

Now they have to keep exploring the labyrinth, taking all they can carry while they seek a way to escape from this place; but at the same time, they have to watch their backs from themselves as just the one who recovers more treasures will be the real winner of the game.&#10;&#10;In this game, all players are represented with a unique token that represents the whole expedition. What happens to this token is decided through anonymous voting using cards, in which every choice is represented with a color.&#10;&#10;The game board is built base in tiles of chambers of the tomb. Every tile has a color that shows it&rsquo;s risk level, in a range of 5 colors going from blue to red. The more dangerous a chamber is, the better chances you have to find treasures.&#10;&#10;The players decide voting to which type of tile go next, choosing the color of the tile, then placing it connected to the previous one forming a maze that the expedition must explore. In these chambers you can find different types of events that the players must confront to continue, from finding new treasures, facing hard decisions that compromise the group integrity or falling into traps.&#10;&#10;In order to escape the tomb, the player will need to find an exit and 4 keys hidden among the treasures to open it, all this while being chased by the tomb&rsquo;s guardian and surviving critical injuries.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Epic monster pack for Deep Madness.&#10;&#10;It rises majestically before you, enthroned on its towering rocky seat. A scepter crowned with otherworldly fire burns like a maddening beacon in the night, its multitudes of thick, meaty tentacles coiling, curling, and whipping against the slimy, barnacle-encrusted stone of its dais. Staring in wonder at its magnificence, you can't help but sink to your knees. Tears well up over your eyelids and streak down your face. Reaching a hand up, you wipe them away and wonder briefly how your hands became streaked with blood.&#10;&#10;Around you the world shimmers and shakes, reality slowly fracturing as the king's court assembles from the cracks in-between the worlds. The creeping courtiers pantomime and cavort, their movements flowing into an eldritch play that would drive even the sanest person into gibbering fits. You begin to laugh, clapping your hands, as your face starts to harden. A symbol shimmers in the air: the sign of the king.&#10;&#10;As the courtiers collect you to offer you as a gift to the king, you realize that all of reality is nothing but a stage, and life a production of little more than sound and fury. Meanwhile the audience, beings beyond time and dimensions, look on in laughter and callous impassivity. As the king begins to feast you realize you desperately want to weep, but you can no longer move your mouth to make the sounds. Your face has become a rigid mask. Leaning down, the king removes it for you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the Age of Piracy and the best way to make a living is with a strong ship and a crew.  With Pirate crews being formed from people of all walks of life, riches are won with witts, sword and flintlock and losses are counted in blood.  All of the trade of the entire world is up for grabs with opportunity for wealth all around, if you know how to go out and get it, and you do not mind getting bloody.&#10;&#10;With the seas teetering on the brink of total anarchy, the mainland have ordered their ships to capture and kill any pirates they find.  The coastland offers exciting and dangerous opportunities with the ships that navigate these waters.  The Pirate Captains, heroes, defy the mainland.  Plundering is their trade and their only means to grow their reputations and fortunes.  Each Captain is a force of nature themselves.  Powerful, cunning and resourceful they are the only ones that can tame these wild places on the fringes of the empire and make them their own.&#10;&#10;Dangers lay ahead for any Captain and crew that sales these waters.  The seas and their islands are ever-changing with untold riches and horrors awaiting anyone on their shores.  Mysterious Islands, lost wrecks, dangerous encounters, and supernatural creatures.&#10;&#10;The greatest danger of all may not be the seas or the mainland, but other Pirates.  Each Captain and crew seek their own wealth, even at the cost of your own fortune and lives.  Making alliances can often beneficial, but keeping one eye on all of the Captains is the best strategy.&#10;&#10;Can you roll dice with fortune and death?  Can you stare down the elements, natural and unnatural and make a name for yourself in the shadows of an all-powerful mainland empire?  Your chance to be infamous, free, and rich awaits with us all on the seas.&#10;&#10;To win at Avast! players recruit crews, strategically gather resources, complete Pirate jobs and fight to gather a reputation, and become the Pirate King. The player who collects the winning amount of Pirate Rep, is The Pirate King.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An app assisted fully customizable board game with some Chess, Stratego, Carcassonne, Ur, Senet, and Hnefatafl DNA.&#10;&#10;With each different game type there are different ways to play and win. Below are some of the current available game modes:&#10;&#10;Chestego-WAR - A game which combines chess with stratego and the addition of dice. The board is 10x10 with special pawns which hide their identity from the opponent until being attacked or attacking. There is also two dice which are used when heroes attack each other (or when attacking the princess pawn). One with a square and one with a triangle. The triangle die is used by the defender while the square die is used by the attacker. The triangle die has a High chance of loosing while the square has a high chance of winning. The lowest number wins. A triangle rolled is a counterattack which kills the attacker. A Square rolled is a miss and the attacker has to move back to the space he attacked from. The game mode is won by killing the king.&#10;&#10;Chestego-WARZ - a 2v2 WAR with the option for free for all if you have 2 more sets or colors or COOP with the standard set. In COOP one player controls the Warrior King while the other controls the Queen. The Warrior King can move up to 3 spaces in any direction so watch out. Also, the player with the King also gets the Assassin. The player with the Queen always get the Princess. The objective is still the same. In free for all there are 4 different colored armies.&#10;&#10;Chestego-EDGE.LINE - Players build edges and lines and try to surround claimed dots to maximize points. There are 100 tiles and the possibility to play between 2-6 players. More players can be added with combined games. The game starts off with players building the Rift 1 piece at a time. The Rift has some starting edges and lines which can be claimed(12 pieces). The remaining 88 pieces are played one at a time until all pieces are played. The player with the highest score wins. The soon to be release app will keep track of each players score. Anything which was not completed gets counted at the end.&#10;&#10;Chestego-RIFT - Players rush to claim resources and towers to build up their forces to be able to attack the enemy. This can be played 1v1 or 2v2 coop. There are resources and outposts which can be built to speed up your attack and slow the attackers. Each side is working to establish their land and is preparing to travel across the Rift. You win by destroying the opponent(s) or forcing a surrender.&#10;&#10;Chestego-JUMPS - 1v1 version of Checkers with some special pieces and a 10x10 board. With 15 Jumpers and 5 Leapers each side. Jumpers can only move forward and can only jump other jumpers. If a Jumper jumps two enemies he is promoted to a Leaper or if he gets to the back line. Leapers can only jump Leapers and Jumpers. There are 5 Leapers to start with which can be promoted to Vaulters if they jump two enemies in a row or get to the back line.Vaulters can jump two pieces right next to each other in a line. Any combination of friend and foe can be jumped. Vaulters can jump anything. If a Vaulter jumps a promoted Leaper he is demoted to a Jumper. The game is won by the player left standing.&#10;&#10;Chestego-JUMPZ - a 4 player version of JUMPS. You will need two additional colors or you can play 2v2 and split the existing pieces into the four corners. Each player gets 2 Leapers and 6 Jumpers. For the Jumpers that have to attack straight ahead. All the remaining rules apply.&#10;&#10;Chestego-NEF - a variation of the Viking board game Hnefatafl with a 9x9 board instead of 11x11 (11x11 could be done with the addition of more board pieces). This version has 3 different piece types instead of the original 2. There is the King which can more unlimited spaces in any straight line. The Valkyries which can also move orthogonally unlimited spaces and the Berserkers which also more the same way. To remove an enemy piece you have to surround it. For Valkyries 2 would have to surround another Valkyrie one on each side to remove it. To remove a Berserker you would have to surround it on four sides with Valkyries or two sides with Berserkers. The King has to always be surrounded on four sides to be removed. The King tries to move to one of the 4 corners where there is a King square that only he can occupy. There is also a King square in the center which only the King can occupy. A King square can be used to surround pieces.&#10;&#10;Chestego-WUR - A variation of the ancient game UR. Players race to move their pieces from the starting area to the ending area. The board can be setup in two ways. One with a longer battle lane and the other one a shorter one. There are also 3 towers used. One for each player's color and one special tower. To move past the center you have to occupy your tower. Once a player is in the tower he is safe and is considered removed. The player can jump down to attack an enemy if he lands in the lane right next to the tower but then he becomes vulnerable to attacks. The game is won by the player who gets all of his or her pieces out first.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You win the game if you have the most points among players.&#10;&#10;The only change for the second edition was to rotate the cards, from portrait to landscape orientation.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#156;&#232;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#229;&#177;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;4&times;4&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#168;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#228;&#187;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#229;&#191;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

A group of different families are stuck in the restroom and have to escape from this vengeful ghost called Kayoko. &#10;Each player will have 3 of the same colored play figures which represents a family to control. The players need to cooperate to escape the restroom, avoid the vengeful ghost Kayoko by rolling a die and moving to different toilet stalls and opening them by flipping cards either finding items or hiding in the toilet stalls to avoid danger. Be careful though you might encounter Kayoko or other vengeful ghosts on your search. If you find Kayoko the player needs to roll the die to escape from her which is represented by a meeple. If you roll any of the bloody marks on the die Kayoko will move that many spaces counterclockwise only around the restroom. If Kayoko lands where a play figure is that play figure is dead and sent to the depths of hell. The goal of the game is to find a key to open a door card and escape.  Only one play figure needs to escape for all players to win.  The players will lose if all play figures are dead or if the time hits 2AM. The time will start at 6PM each time a player reveals a Kayoko card the time will move by one hour.&#10;&#10;Note: The rules are also written in English. There is a QR code to scan for English card descriptions for the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher description:&#10;---Story---&#10;N&#231;&#156;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#165;&#165;&#229;&#189;&#188;&#229;&#178;&#184;(&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#147;)&#230;&#157;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#136;&#165;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#157;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#145;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#230;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#233;&#156;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#157;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#187;&#131;&#230;&#160;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#128;&#168;&#233;&#156;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#10;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#232;&#170;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#128;&#170;&#232;&#171;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#168;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#150;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#232;&#190;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",
