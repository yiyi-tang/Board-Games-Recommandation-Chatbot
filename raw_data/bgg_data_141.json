    "Description": "In July 1920, the Red Army's Tukhachevsky launched an offensive to put an end to the war with Poland that had begun the previous year. His goal was Warsaw, but it was only a passing phase. After conquering Poland, the aim was to export the revolution to Germany and then to all of Europe. However, Pi&#197;&#130;sudski, the commander of the Polish army, ordered a desperate counterattack against the southern flank of the Western Front, which was created by the delay in the advance of the Southwestern Front. With this blow, the Western Front collapsed, and the dying Poland was saved by the &quot;Miracle of the Wis&#197;&#130;a River&quot;.&#10;Warsaw 1920 is a two-player strategy game based on the Polish-Soviet War. One player is in charge of the Russian army, aiming to take control of Poland. The other player is in charge of the Polish army, protecting the newly independent country from the red tsunami.&#10;The game system is a typical &quot;IGO-UGO&quot; with both players alternating turns, but each player can combine up to three movement or combat phases, and the Russians are constrained by supply, so players will have a lot of decisions to make.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Solitaire Game of the USAAF Strategic Bombing Campaign against Germany: 1943-1945&#10;&#10;In 1943, the US Army Air Force (USAAF) began a strategic bombing campaign with a small but growing number of aircraft. By 1945 it had, for all practical purposes, swept the German air force (Luftwaffe) from the skies, and was bombing targets throughout the shrinking Third Reich almost with impunity. But getting to that point was no easy task&hellip;&#10;&#10;You, as commander, 8th Air Force, have a very full plate! Early on, insure victory in the Battle of the Atlantic by bombing submarine bases in western France, then support the eventual Allied invasion of occupied France by bombing railroads and river crossings throughout France and western Germany. Failure in these critical bombing campaigns is not acceptable. Long-term, you&rsquo;ll need to pulverize Germany&rsquo;s aircraft factories and oil facilities to reduce the Luftwaffe&rsquo;s aircraft production and support, and win the war by blasting Germany&rsquo;s heavy industry. There will be more challenges along the way, from providing heavy support for the D-Day invasion and Normandy breakout, to suppressing the demoralizing V1 and V2 attacks on England, to assisting your Soviet ally by attacking German army staging areas in the east. In the meantime, the Luftwaffe is developing advanced jet and rocket technology that may tip the tide of the air war if you have not crippled their industrial capacity.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a rule set for WW2 naval combat written in French.&#10;This is not a classic wargame, as it has no mapboard or counters, but cards for ships. The rules are very simple. Basically, blank sheets and pencils are the only things needed to start playing. Miniatures are not needed to play but can be used.&#10;&#10;The main difference with other naval rules is that Amiraut&eacute; (Admiralty) is not purely a tactical game. Although it has detailed guns rate of fire, penetration,  rules for aircraft, naval bombing for operational scenarios and campaign games are included. For example, you can play the exactly same scenarios as Avalon Hill&#039;s Flat Top, not only the battles.&#10;&#10;What you need to play:&#10;&#10;     rules&#10;     ruler, protractor, pencil, eraser&#10;     two 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;A referee is strongly recommended for a better gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Naval units: each ship is described on a card with its size (length, width), armor, detailed weaponry (diameter, range), max speed, defensive value (calculated from tonnage, vertical and horizontal armor, age).&#10;Air units: air units are defined by their max speed, range, weaponry and defensive value.&#10;&#10;Combat:&#10;&#10;     Combat is resolved with tables.&#10;     Combat against ships is resolved with a probability of impact check, then computing the number of hits, and finaly damage.&#10;     Torpedoes have length, speed, angle and distance parameters.&#10;     Anti-aircraft fire is handled globally for air to naval attacks and air to ground strikes.&#10;     Damage can have effects on speed and attack capabilities.&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;&#10;     strategic moves : 1 cm = 10 km&#10;     tactical moves : 1 cm = 100 meters&#10;     miniatures (if used) : 1/3000&#10;     strategic turn : 1 to 4 hours&#10;     tactical turns : 5 minutes&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Following a furious fighting where the French army, under the eyes of the King Louis XV, struggles but does not fall, the Pragmatic army retreats, leaving behind thousands of fallen men.&#10;&#10;On October 11, 1746, at Rocoux, on the uplands of Li&egrave;ge, he defeats the allied army led by Austrian commander Charles Alexandre de Lorraine.&#10;&#10;Finally, on July 2 1747, at the battle of Lauffeld near Maastricht, the French army attacks and is victorious from a position diametrically opposed to that of Fontenoy. Following fierce fighting around the village of Lauffeld, the Allied Army, once again commanded by Cumberland, owes salvation to the sacrifice of the British cavalry.&#10;&#10;Les victoires du Mar&eacute;chal de Saxe (Marshal de Saxe's victories) allows players to replay in an evening the Battles of Fontenoy and Lauffeld.&#10;&#10;The game features the 5th entry in Vae Victis Wargames Collection and includes:&#10;- 59x40 cm map (printed on both sides)&#10;- 216 double-sided die-cut counters&#10;- a rule and scenarios booklet&#10;- a player-aid card in color&#10;&#10;Complexity : 5/9&#10;&#10;Bilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).&#10;&#10;",

Battlefront:WWII is designed to model this tactical level of combat. The basic organization used is the &quot;maneuver element&quot;, usually a company sized formation of units fighting as a group. In Battlefront:WWII each player takes command of one or more maneuver elements. A game involving several players recreates tactical actions between opposing battalion or regimental sized forces and can be finished in a single evening.&#10;&#10;* Each miniature or stand represents a squad of men, specialized team, or 2-3 vehicles or guns.&#10;    * Each game turn represents approximately 10 minutes of real time.&#10;    * The rules are designed so that each player can handle one or two maneuver elements (a maneuver element is roughly a company).&#10;    * Units of up to battalion size can be handled comfortably by experienced players.&#10;    * Although designed for 15mm miniatures, play aids and rules allow miniatures from 5mm (1/285) to 20mm to be used comfortably.&#10;&#10;Battlefront:WWII began life as a training aid for the Army in the 1980's. The rules are not only easy to play and fun, but also historically accurate. Poor tactics or 'gamey' gambits will quickly fail. Players who learn how to combine the strengths and capabilities of their units will be effective on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;",

This game has been extensively updated from the original and includes twelve scenarios (and additional new rules) as well as additional ships for future scenarios to be made available on line at Quarterdeck International&rsquo;s ConSim World (CSW) site.&#10;&#10;Iron Bottom Sound III includes corrected scenarios from earlier versions, several 1943 actions, one Channel action between the Brits and the Germans, as well as two revised 1928 hypothetical actions between American and Japanese battleships and battlecruisers. The Japanese and Germans have slightly higher Victory Point value as their loss is tougher on them than the Allies.&#10;&#10;This boxed bookcase style game (and a STOUT box at that!) weighing OVER a kilo contains the following components:&#10;&#10;     One 22.5&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; dark blue MOUNTED map.&#10;     Two cut out islands - one is Savo in the old traditional daylight hour&rsquo;s style and Kolombangara in nighttime shades.&#10;     Two FULL countersheets.

Also torpedoes, smoke screens (NEW), fires, decoys (NEW), wrecks, fired markers (NEW) and starshells are included.

Marrakesh is an odd amalgam of backgammon and cardplay which works remarkably well. Each player sets up six pieces on their board based on the roll of six dice. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards from a special deck, and then try to collect two card tricks, using the card values to bear off the pieces. Points are awarded for bearing off pieces in various combinations, such as 2 on each of three turns, or the legendary Marrakesh itself, when all six pieces are borne off on the same turn. Defensive points are earned for keeping the opponent from removing many pieces from their board. Play continues for 12 rounds, which goes by quickly. This game is long out-of-print, but well worth it if you can find it.&#10;&#10;",

It features hand-building, simultaneous action selection, and a modular track.&#10;Each player starts the game with a hand of 7 action cards. Each round, players simultaneously choose 2 cards to play from their hand and reveal them. Players then take their turns, using their chosen cards as well as their accumulated speed to catch up with opponents, drift, use their nitro, launch bombs and missiles, and use their precious special ability. But watch out! Curves are dangerous, and might damage your vehicle! Upgrade cards can be acquired to enhance your options, but sometimes require you to remove another card from your hand. The first to finish the last lap of the race wins it all.&#10;Megapulse includes clever catch-up mechanics, and multiples game modes like Derby, Neon God, and Spellflux Ball.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vive L'Empereur! is an exciting, solitaire wargame depicting the Battle of Waterloo fought on June 18, 1815. Controlling the French side as the Emperor Napoleon, you have conducted a brilliant campaign so far against not one, but two, Allied armies, defeating Field Marshal Blucher&rsquo;s Prussians at Ligny and forcing the Anglo-Allied army under the Duke of Wellington to retreat from Quatre Bras. You have sent a wing of your army under Marshal Grouchy to keep the Prussians and the British-Dutch armies separate. Meanwhile, Wellington and his Dutch allies with 68,000 men have fallen back to a ridge line before the small town of Waterloo. On this rainy and muddy day, your 72,000-strong French army must defeat the Anglo-Allied Army before the Prussians can regroup, avoid Grouchy, and arrive on the battlefield at Waterloo. Are you up for the challenge?&#10;&#10;Vive L&rsquo;Empereur is a hex-and-counter war game that uses a chit-pull system to generate random force activations for both sides. The Anglo-Allied and Prussian forces (the forces of the solitaire side) move and conduct combat using random instructions from the game&rsquo;s Activation Table.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Lay out fences that show the numbers 2-6, then shuffle Farmer Benno into the bottom of the deck. Each player takes a colored die, with all the white dice being placed in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, reveal the top card from the deck, then place it under the fence showing the matching die number. You then choose to either STOP and take a white die from the reserve, or HOP and try to make it over a fence. Choose one of the fences (2-6), then roll your colored die and as many white dice as you wish from your supply. If any die shows a value equal to or higher than the fence, you claim all of the vegetable cards under this fence, then return all of the white dice you rolled to the reserve. If you fail, keep all of the dice you rolled.&#10;&#10;When Farmer Benno is revealed, the end of the game nears, with no more cards being added to the fences. Keep playing until all of the revealed cards have been claimed, then score your holdings. If you have the majority of a vegetable type, e.g., eggplant, which has 12 cards, then you score points equal to the number of cards of that type: 12 points for eggplants! Anyone else who has eggplants scores 1 point per card they have. (Ties are friendly for majorities.)&#10;&#10;Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

(This word cannot be real, and if anyone claims it is, reroll the dice and try again.) Each player writes a definition for this new word, then places her sheet of paper in the center of the table. The active player shuffles these papers, then hands one to each person; the active player then reads off the definition, followed by the other players in clockwise order. A player might end up reading her own definition.&#10;&#10;As a reminder of the definitions, each player then gives a short keyword or key phrase for the definition she read. Players will then each distribute three tokens to the answers they thought best, with one of those tokens going to the player's own answer. (This self-congratulatory vote aids in the scorekeeping process.)&#10;&#10;After each person has been the active player once, the game ends and the player with the most tokens is crowned Queen Frigiti!&#10;&#10;",

And, until now, no one has ever tried to make a game to capture the struggle.&#10;&#10;Late December, 1944, while the Allies began to pinch off The Bulge, the Soviets&mdash;and their new-found Romanian allies&mdash;began the assault on the &quot;twin cities&quot; of Buda and Pest, where 79,000 surrounded Axis defenders held on against heavy odds, made more difficult by &quot;high command&quot; orders to defend everywhere and not to consider a breakout effort. With German mobile reserves and stockpiled supplies expended by the Wacht am Rhein, a mixed force of Germans and Hungarians held on with little hope of relief. By mid February, after the city fell, less than 1000 Axis troops of all kinds made it back to the dwindling safety of German lines.&#10;&#10;Hungarian Nightmare puts you in the difficult command situations for both sides. The Soviets have two full &quot;fronts&quot; worth of troops, plus a corps of their newly gained (and doubtful quality) Romanian troops, while the Axis player commands a hodge-podge of various unit types of widely ranging enthusiasm. German units include remnants of two SS cavalry divisions, panzer kampfgroups, rear-area units, and strays, while Hungarian units are even more diverse, with everything from assault gun companies to police units and WWI veterans, with some troops ready to hold on to the bitter end and others looking for an early opportunity of melting away. The Axis player struggles with dwindling fuel, supplies, and manpower energy, while the Soviet player competes with a difficult time-table and the loss of key units to repel relief efforts. In game terms, the actual historical result would be a &quot;draw,&quot; thus each player has the opportunity and the challenge to &quot;do better.&quot;&#10;&#10;Designed by Mark Stille (North Wind Rain, Imperial Sunset, Wintergewitter), Hungarian Nightmare offers 280 counters, an area-movement map of the cities, with each space about one square kilometer, and three-day turns that cover the entire, brutal campaign.&#10;&#10;For the first time in gaming, the assault on Budapest is yours to make or to fend off.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kurruf: Aventura en la Selva Patagonica: is a simple and dynamic family game portraying the biodiversity of the Park Huilo-Huilo.&#10;&#10;We roll dice, walk the marked trails on the game board, activate lockers, obtain biodiversity cards, use Mapuche tips, and score points for completing biodiversity scales.&#10;&#10;In Kurruf, players are racing to be the first to get to 50 points on the point track. They&rsquo;ll win points by acquiring and combining different cards depicting organisms (Biodiversity Cards), either through building food chains according to their relationships within the different ecosystems or by possessing majorities on the different kinds of cards acquired.&#10;&#10;The player board is divided into four quadrants, each one depicting an ecosystem. These quadrants are traversed by tracks with different symbols on them.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player will roll a die and move their Explorer into the track across one of the four ecosystems, advancing as many spaces as indicated by the roll. If later on any other player lands on the same space, they will share it.&#10;&#10;Upon landing on a space, the player will immediately take a card depending on the symbol depicted on that space.&#10;&#10;All Biodiversity Cards acquired are laid face up on the table, building rows. As soon as a row has been built up as a complete food chain, it must be scored. All the cards which were used to build it are then discarded into a discard pile.&#10;&#10;After all actions for that player have been resolved, gameplay goes around the table in clockwise order and the first player to get to 50 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The APBA Golf Game was origionally published by APBA in 1962.   It contained 18 Greatest Holes and came with 32 well known golfers.   The 18 Greatest Holes publsihed in the 1962 edition contain 4 different holes than later versions of the 18 Greatest Holes.&#10;&#10;As the Golfer card sets ran out of production APBA publshed new sets to replace the out of production sets.   This led to the creation of a:&#10;&#10;1962/64 set, 1972, 1976, 1978, 1981, 1985 and an All Time Greats Set.   Sports Game Publishing and the APBA Journal also published a number of golf sets in later years as well.&#10;&#10;8 Courses were published by APBA officially (Two Versions of the 18 Greatest Holes).   The now defunct Sports Game Publishing company also published at least 3 more courses for the game adding: Sawgrass, Winged Foot, St. Andrews and Oakmont to the list.  The format for these course were 3 to a page on 11 x 17 paper and then changed to 8 1/2 x 11 with one course per page.&#10;&#10;ASG Golf (George Gerney | www.asggames.com) has gone on to publish courses for: Bethpage Black, Pinehurst No 2., Augusta National, Pebble Beach, TPC Scottsdale, St. Andrews, TPC Sawgrass and Bay Hill.&#10;&#10;From the APBA Journal: An Eighth APBA Golf Course (For Holes 3,4,5,6 of the greatest hits)&#10;&#10;&quot;While preparing the Golf Archives Reference Pack (now available from the AJ office). I encountered a letter to the editor in the August 15, 1971, issue of APBA Innings. (Back in those practically prehistoric days, the AJ covered only baseball, leaving APBA's other sports to its competition, AI.)&#10;&#10;The letter, by Doug Bauer, notes that the original APBA golf course, the 18 Greatest Holes compilation, had changed between the game's original appearance in the mid-1960's and 1971.&#10;&#10;In the original course, holes 3,4,5 and 6 all came from courses in Southem California. Number three was the fourth hole at Riviera Country Club, Los Angeles. a par three. Number four was the eighth hole from Lakeside Golf Course in Hollywood, a par four. APBA's fifth hole was the third at Vaney Club in Santa Barbara, a par four. And number six was the 14th at Los Angeles' Bel Air Country Club, a par five.&#10;&#10;In the later version, number three is the 13th hole at Congressional Country Club in Washington, D.C., a par four. APBA's fourth hole is the 14th at Brookline (Mass.) Country Club, a par five. Number five is the eighth hole at Westchester Country Club, Harrison, N. Y., a par four. And number six is the third hole at Akron's Firestone Country Club, also a par four.&#10;&#10;As a consequence of these changes, par is 71 in the later course but just 70 in the original version.&#10;&#10;So it turns out that there are, In effect, eight APBA golf courses rather than the seven we knew about:Augusta (1964), Merion (1975), Pebble Beach (1976), Firestone (1976), Pinehurst (1977), Pine Valley (1977) and two versions of the 18 Great Holes (1964 and c.1970).&quot;&#10;&#10;Sports Game Publishing was a company that published expansions for APBA products, they maintained a web presense from 2002 thru 2006.  During that time they produced a number of products for APBA Golf.&#10;&#10;The main product that they published was Doctor Clines Advanced Rules for APBA Golf&#10;&#10;St. Vincent College (Latrobe, PA) Golf Coach Dr. Thomas Cline's APBA golf innovations and upgrades have been published many times in the APBA Journal, and gamers have acknowledged the accuracy and realism his work has added. Recently Dr. Cline started from scratch and carefully dissected the game with a mathematical precision not possible when the game was developed. The result is a game completely compatible with the golf courses and cards you currently own, while allowing you to play a modern golf bag and manage holes the way today&rsquo;s pros do.&#10;&#10;Golfers will drive the ball, hit fairways, and putt the way they do in real life. You can finally choose from the clubs the players really carry; no more 2-wood that today&rsquo;s players never use. Instead, choose a 4-wood, 5-wood, and/or 1-iron&mdash;just like the pros of today! If you have always wanted wind, course conditions, lie conditions, and each golfer&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;work the ball&rdquo; to have the same influence on your course that they have in the real game, now they can!&#10;&#10;Dr. Cline&rsquo;s new Master Game elements are individually implemented, so you can add some of them, all of them, or none at all, and still achieve a level of golf accuracy never before possible. Combined with charts that finally are capable of reproducing the abilities of golfers of the 21st century, this fantastic new game will allow you to use the golf courses and golf cards you already own with accurate results, while integrating future cards and courses as well.&#10;&#10;The new &ldquo;boards&rdquo; are actually a spiral-bound, 8&frac12; x 11-inch booklet, printed on card stock for durability, that contains complete playing instructions and play charts for both the Basic and Master games. The game box also includes all the components you need to play: dice, shaker, ball markers, and score sheets designed for use with both the Basic and Master games, along with nine sample golfers and a sample golf hole.&#10;&#10;APBA has announced that they plan on re-publishing APBA Golf in 2010.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Mayan Sun, Aztec Destiny: 500 BC - AD 2012 - Beyond&infin;, players are ancient astronomers reading the stars and sun patterns. Using the Mayan Haab agricultural calendar invented in roughly 500 BC, players inform their villages when to best plant their seeds so that they may grow a tremendous harvest to feed their people. After their seeds are planted, the astronomers recommend rituals to aid in their harvest and their reading of prophecies in the stars, but problems arise. A village conducting a ritual to help their crop could be stealing the power of the sun or cosmos from a nearby neighbor. Droughts may crush other villages.&#10;&#10;After crops have been harvested, the ancient astronomers now begin to forecast the prophecies of the stars. Using the technologies found in the Aztec Calendar, the important messages from the sky above may be telling us when and how the world will end. Players wager a bet about the ultimate destiny. With their knowledge of Prophecy they may influence this ultimate end, and also may know the exact date! Could the world end by the fires of a super volcano in 1969 AD, or will an alien race arrive in 2012 AD, or will a super nova occur light years away destroying our planet in 3,000,000,000 years? Players are now trusted prophets and will have the knowledge of the end of time.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as either a basic SUN game or an advanced DESTINY game. The basic Sun game involves players moving the tiles by conducting rituals, tile positioning can help or hinder players as they grow crops and collect prophetic knowledge. Players in the basic game will score for the amount of villages they feed and Prophecy tokens they collect. The Destiny game is for players desiring a more involved game in which Prophecy tokens, earned conducting ritual, must be used to either influence the value of villages, investments in the future, and/or influencing how and when the world may come to an end.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Overwhelmed by the Goblin hordes, remnants of the Five Realms were forced to flee their prosperous Hiddenlands, eventually establishing their civilizations again in the newly discovered lands of Pandoria. But as they stake their claims and build anew, the old rivalries that were once their downfall resurface. You take on the role of one of these realms, working together with your opponents to develop Pandoria. But all the while, you are also looking to be the dominant realm in the land through gathering resources, building, and learning spells that harness the magic of this mysterious place.&#10;&#10;Pandoria Merchants transforms the critically-acclaimed board game into a &ldquo;roll-n-write&rdquo; game that you can print at home and play anywhere &mdash; even online! In the more streamlined &ldquo;family&rdquo; version of the game, you gain valuable spells whenever you close out a region, and instead of managing different resources, every region rewards you with victory points. If you are new to the world of Pandoria, then Pandoria Merchants Family is highly recommended.&#10;&#10;For the first time, you can play Pandoria solo:&#10;Your scouts have discovered a hidden valley deep in the mountains, divided by rivers and enormous lakes, a place for your Realm to expand exclusively! But as you begin to settle these new lands, you find that you are not alone: Trolls from the surrounding hills have come to lay claim. As you compete for the most influence in these 8 new territories, the Trolls become stronger. Can you develop your realm fast enough to be the dominant people group when the land is settled?&#10;&#10;Pandoria Merchants is one of the most interactive &ldquo;roll-n-write&rdquo; games ever created!&#10;&#10;Key differences with the Pandoria Boardgame&#10;Pandoria Merchants retains some of the main elements of the board game, but there are several key differences in addition to the components:&#10;You use dice to determine the 2 resources on your &ldquo;tile&rdquo;.&#10;The merchants of Pandoria produce an additional Resource: &ldquo;Crafts&rdquo;.&#10;You draw your worker on its own hex space, not on a space with a resource.&#10;Workers stay on the board the entire game.&#10;Resource tracks have a capacity of only 5, and every 2 resources over that is exchanged for a victory point.&#10;You can buy any Spell and Building &ldquo;card&rdquo; on your sheet, but if you buy all 3 in a column, your opponents are locked out of buying further cards from this column.&#10;There are no special powers for each realm.&#10;The Artifacts and Relics from the Pandoria Artifacts expansion are included in this game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from ATO website :)&#10;&#10;Guns of the Askari (GoA) recreates the imperial struggle for East Africa during WWI. This often overlooked campaign featured classic land battles, naval engagements between lake flotillas, cruiser duels at sea and finally hit and run guerrilla engagements. It opened with conventional force-on-force battles dominated by infantry, machine guns, and trenches. But the low troop densities and wide open spaces enabled a war of movement spearheaded by South African cavalry that broke the stalemate in mid 1916. This left Von Lettow-Vorbeck a choice between surrender or guerrilla war. He chose the latter and dragged his weary pursuers through a series of running battles in Portuguese East Africa.&#10;&#10;Designed by WWI game specialist John Gorkowski, Guns of the Askari features 280 half-inch full color counters that represent forces as varied as rifle companies, armored cars, naval units for oceans or lakes, and the supply units on which both sides depended. There are even artillery units back-printed with the other side&rsquo;s colors, so that they can be captured and used again.&#10;&#10;The game offers four different scenarios, from the complete campaign to the 1918 guerrilla operation and two periods in between. Combat mechanics change as the nature of the conflict evolves, and each turn has a variable end point.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two OR THREE players, giving the option for German, British, and Belgian players, and making it possible for the &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; Portuguese to (perhaps) join the German side!&#10;&#10;Can you, commanding greatly superior numbers, do better than the Allied commanders? Can you, commanding a mix of Europeans and native troops (including sailors from a scuttled German cruiser), manage the right balance of caution and audacity to keep your foes off-balance and elude destruction? The choices are yours in Against the Odds Magazine #38, Guns of the Askari.&#10;&#10;Map - One full color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet&#10;Counters - 280 full color 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces&#10;Rules length - 12 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire suitability - Average&#10;Playing Time - 6 to 8 hours&#10;&#10;",

Each player secretly &quot;owns&quot; two of the twelve characters in the house, and each character starts in a different room of the house. On a turn, a player either moves any character that is alone in a room into an adjacent room or starts a fight in a room that contains at least two characters. Well, it's not much of a fight really, as the player removes one character from the room and places it in a line with other removed characters. Once a single character remains, the round ends. The first two characters removed are worth zero points, while the third through eleventh characters are worth 1-9 points; the character that remains in the house is worth ten points. Each player collects points only for his most valuable character.&#10;&#10;Cthulhu in the House differs from its predecessor, Rumble in the House, thanks to two types of tokens that are placed in some locations. One type switches a character into a different room, possibly causing a fight in the process, while another type is an abyss, which switches which character would be removed from play.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Command a Greek city's hoplite soldiers. Push and rout enemy lines. Coordinate allied attacks to secure victory, but watch your flanks!&#10;&#10;Nika, inspired by ancient Greek geography &amp; warfare, is based around two core mechanisms: facing and formations. Pieces can be routed off the board if attacked from the side or back, but not from the front. A routed piece can rally back onto the board at the cost of an action. Your pieces can move or rotate together in a phalanx if they are adjacent and facing the same way, and you can push back enemies facing you if your phalanx is deeper than theirs.&#10;&#10;There are four cities: Athens (white) and Messene (blue) are allied against Sparta (red) and Thebes (black). Allies start across the board from each other, and you win by getting a piece into your victory area in the heart of your ally's territory. Each two-city alliance can be played either solo or with a partner, so the game can support two, three, or four players.&#10;&#10;Every player has enemies on both sides, making the distribution of both pieces and actions between fronts a strategic and often tactical consideration. Maneuvering, timing, coordination, and sacrifice are all key elements of strategy.&#10;&#10;Says designer Josh Raab, &quot;Nika is the ancient Greek word for 'conquer'. The concept of Nika came to me in a dream while I was studying abroad in Athens. The rules were honed across nearly two years of testing. The board shape and core mechanics were inspired by ancient Greek geography and warfare. Greece has many narrow valleys and mountain passes, and sometimes the only way to defeat an enemy force was to collide with them head-on and literally push them off the field. This othismos ('shoving') is thought to have been the critical phase of most battles between hoplite armies, who were the heavy infantry that dominated ancient Greek war for four centuries.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Players will face off against a main demonic foe, and they'll need to utilize their followers to stop catastrophic events, acquire relics, and delay the final ride of the Four Horsemen.&#10;&#10;Each asymmetrical hero has their own divine powers and starting deck. Upgrade your deck by acquiring powerful relic cards each turn. Play strategically and choose carefully which relics to play and which to sacrifice to optimize your ability to respond to new events, destroy the demonic horde attempting to overrun the world, and delay the horsemen on their ride to bring about total destruction.&#10;&#10;Will your strategy keep the world intact long enough to seal away the demonic entity forever? Featuring gorgeous art on every card, hero and Horsemen minis, and a surprising blend of gameplay mechanics, Four Horsemen is a game where every round brings new challenges. With a large variety of heroes, villains, and events, Four Horsemen has thousands of unique scenarios, meaning no two apocalypses are the same.&#10;&#10;Four Horsemen is for 1-4 players and takes 60-120 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Explore far-away planets.  Discover what resources and surprises they hold. Be the first to set foot on a new planet and claim it as your own. Collect resources to gain fortune and fame. All of this comes courtesy of: the Jump Gate.&#10;&#10;Players are spaceship captains that are competing to be the best at claiming new planets and collecting the resources found at those planets.  Points are scored at the end of the game based on the number of planets they scanned and claimed, and their combination of resources collected.  Each type of resource has a different method for being scored -- so, collecting sets of the same resource is encouraged ... and disrupting other players&rsquo; collection plans is good strategy.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Summary (1st &amp; 2nd Editions)&#10;Eight planets are set in a circle around the Jump Gate and Black Hole Boards.  Resource cards are distributed:  1 face-up to each player, 1 face-up to each planet, and the rest are distributed face-down amongst the planets.&#10;&#10;Players are each given 5 NavComp cards and the rest of the NavComp cards are set as a draw deck in the middle of the table.  Each NavComp card contains 2 codes (used to take some of the standard actions) and possibly a special action.&#10;&#10;Players take turns around the table.  On a player's turn, he/she takes 2 actions in any order, and may select from the following actions:  Research (refill hand), Fly (move to neighboring planet), Jump (use the Jump Gate to move to another Planet), Scan (reveal a resource at a planet), Land &amp; Claim (claim a planet and reveal all resources there), Harvest (collect a resource), and Special Action.  Special actions include being able to scan a far-away planet, harvest extra resources, swap locations with another player, etc.&#10;&#10;When players &quot;Jump&quot;, they add one of their markers to the Jump Gate Board.  The player with the most markers on the Jump Gate Board at the end of the game gains an extra 5 points.  If a player collects a Resource that has a &quot;Black Hole&quot; icon on it, a marker is added to the Black Hole Board.  If too many markers get added to that board, the game ends and the player with the most markers on the Black Hole Board loses some of his/her collected Resources.  The game can also end when all non-Black-Hole Resources have been collected from all of the planets.&#10;&#10;Scoring is done at the end of the game, and players are awarded points for Scanning and Claiming Planets, as well as for the combination of Resources they had collected.  Each type of Resource has a different method for scoring -- but all encourage a player to collect as much of that Resource as possible.  The player with the most total points is the winner.&#10;&#10;3rd Edition Gameplay Changes&#10;The 3rd Edition, published in a smaller box with artwork and player component updates, also included a number of design changes:&#10;&#10;    Max. Players is reduced to 5&#10;    New &quot;Sand&quot; resource replaces the &quot;Nothing&quot; cards from earlier editions&#10;    Setup changes include giving players two or three hidden resource cards (as opposed to a single face-up card) and not every resource getting used in the game&#10;    In-game changes include cleaner, more thematic scanning and harvesting rules&#10;    The Black Hole only has 7 marker spaces on it, and triggering the end game via the Black Hole results in the player with the most markers on the Black Hole losing their hidden resources they received during setup instead of randomly-chosen resources&#10;    No points are scored for scanning or the Jump Gate ... only the resources collected and Planets claimed&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slap .45 is an old western shootout for three to seven players. Each player will control a six-member gang competing to survive with only their instincts, a quick draw, and dynamite.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each player has a home base card in front of them. Each turn, the player whose turn it is flips open a card from the common deck. The other players now have a chance to react.&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Talkin&rsquo; Iron card is revealed, players can choose to make an offensive or a defensive move. If players want to take a shot, they can slap one hand on the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card and simultaneously make a pistol-finger with their other hand, pointing at any other player. Only one player gets to actually take a shot - the one who slaps the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card first. Instead of trying to slap the gun, players can slap into a home base by slapping any of the home bases on the table. Only one player&rsquo;s hand can be in a home base at a time. Players who slap into a home base can&rsquo;t be hit by a player who takes a shot, and they can safely keep their hand on that home base until they&rsquo;re forced to move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Big Gun card is revealed, players can slap it to take a shot or slap into a home base. Just like a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, only one player can use it to take a shot - the first one to slap the card and simultaneously point a pistol-finger at another player. Unlike a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, a Big Gun is extraordinarily destructive, and damages players even if they&rsquo;re in a home base.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Gold card is revealed, players can take the card into their possession by slapping it. If you point at another player while slapping the gold, the player you point at takes the gold instead. Gold is required to activate most gang&rsquo;s special powers.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When a Move! card is revealed, everyone needs to slap into a home base. If a player is already in a home base, they need to slap into a new home base. The last player to slap into a new home base loses one member of their gang. If anyone mistakenly slaps the Move! card, they lose one gang member, everyone else is safe regardless of where they slapped, and the turn ends.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take turns until only one gang is left standing.&#10;&#10;",

Two historical and one theoretical scenario at an operational level.&#10;&#10;It is the summer of 1943 and the fate of the Russo-German War - the largest land conflict of the Second World War - hangs in the balance. A decisive victory for either side means a profound change in the course of the war.&#10;&#10;Clash of Titans: The Tank Battle for Kursk, 1943 is an operational simulation of the battle for Kursk which took place during July 1943. On 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht attacked with 435,000 men in fifty divisions and 2,700 tanks and assault guns (including the new Panther and Ferdinand types). The Red Army was able to field 1,550,000 soldiers and 4,800 armored vehicles for this battle of titanic proportions. Operation Zitadelle had begun... Clash of Titans comes with two more scenarios, one featuring a hypothetical early German attack in May (favored by some German generals), the other simulating the historical Soviet summer counteroffensive in August. One side represents the German forces of 9th Army, 2nd Army, 4th Panzer Army, and Armeeabteilung Kempf while the other side controls the Red Army forces of Southwest Front, Voronezh Front, Central Front, Bryansk Front, West Front, and Steppe Front. It uses the highly popular Ring of Fire /Eastwall game system and is suitable for two or more players or solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Scenarios: 3&#10;&#10;Complexity: Low to Moderate&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;Scale: 8 miles per hex, 2 days per turn, battalion, regiment, Kampfgruppe, brigade, division, corps.&#10;&#10;Contents: one 22&quot;x34&quot; color maps, 600 full color backprinted counters, one rulesbooklet, three player aid cards, boxed or in ziplock bag (please state your choice!).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Moonrakers are on the brink.&#10;&#10;They have thrown off the oppressive yoke of the Utopian Alliance, but they are in a constant struggle to stay independent and find their identity. Alliances are formed and factions arise as the Moonrakers agree to turn their focus outward instead of squabbling over what little they have. Captains push out into unknown corners of the system in attempt to gain resources, influence, and power. The tenuous alliances will only last so long and soon someone must emerge to lead or they will fall.&#10;&#10;Brink is a worker placement, trading, and hidden voting game that brings the world of Moonrakers to a new genre. It combines the strategy and planning of a worker placement game with the negotiation and &ldquo;above the table&rdquo; play found in Moonrakers and Fractured Sky.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will place one of three different sized ships (workers) onto a grid of hexes. Each hex will gain the player resources and actions, but even more importantly, it will give them power within a faction based on the color of the hex. At the end of each round, players will vote on which faction will score points, which is then multiplied by the amount of power each player has in that factions color on the board.&#10;&#10;Players will upgrade their ships, hire ambassadors, explore new systems, and spend influence to complete faction objectives, granting them new abilities. Each game, the map will reveal in a totally new way as regions are explored, presenting new strategies as well as strengths and weaknesses to existing strategies. The player with the most prestige points at the end of 3 rounds wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A large plastic stove in the middle of the board is the game's exciting gimmick, and comes into play when two opposing devils share the same space and start dueling.  Each player takes turns pushing the plunger that forms the oven's stovepipe, and eventually a large devil pops out, deciding the winner!&#10;&#10;Is a rethemed and slightly altered version of the author's earlier Top Secret (1985) and  Spion & Spion (1987).&#10;&#10;",

Richard originally built Xenos Rampant as an unofficial variant based on Daniel&rsquo;s Origins-nominated system, and we have worked together to develop the idea. The basic rules should be familiar to players of Lion Rampant, although the very different nature of futuristic warfare has necessitated some changes to the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns playing food cards from their hand to try to steal pigs and score the most points.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 cards, which can consist of food cards of five different colours (pink, yellow, blue, red or black) and goat cards.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player plays all the cards they have from one type of food by placing it in a stack. If their stack has the most food, then they earn the same-colored pig figure &mdash; or can steal it from another player! Players can also play goat cards to discard a food card from an opponent's stack, possibly forcing them to give up their pig!&#10;&#10;When a player redraws cards at the end of their turn, if they have any pigs, they&rsquo;ll score a point for each drawn card that matches their pig&rsquo;s color. The player who scores 8 points first wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Designer Inc's latest video game title Black Souls has achieved international success! Hailed as one of the toughest digital games ever, it has attracted millions of hardcore gamers. The secret behind this huge success lies not in just making an extremely difficult game. Anyone can do that. The true challenge lies in balancing it to be as difficult as possible, but still fair enough that the very best players can survive to the end. Alas, the game studio is heavily short staffed and the management is looking to hire one more Game Designer for developing more content in Black Souls.&#10;&#10;You have been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be hired by Designer Inc as a level designer, an integral part of Black Souls' development team! As one of the finalist candidates, you must prove your designing skills under the judging eyes of your future employers in an 'Early Beta Access' trial to create a level that best reflects the spirit of Black Souls - a very difficult, yet fair game. A group of seasoned playtesters will be sent to try out your carefully designed level, and provide feedback on whether they like or dislike it at the end of the run. If the level is too easy, they would not feel challenged at all. If it is too hard, they would all be killed and find it unfair. Who will be the final candidate to be inducted into the ranks of Designer Inc?&#10;&#10;This is a uniquely themed game - A game about designing a game!&#10;&#10;How To Play:&#10;&#10;All players begin the game with the same mix of party, randomly generated from a deck of Party Cards. The game is split into two phases - The Design phase, followed by the Gameplay phase.&#10;&#10;Place all tiles (also known as Assets) into the drawbag, then randomly take out an amount of Assets equal to the number of players and place them in the middle of the play area. This will be known as the Asset Pool. (Minimum Assets drawn from bag is 3, even if it is only 2 players)&#10;&#10;Players then secretly select one of their 6 Bid Cards (valued 1 - 6) and reveal them at the same time. In descending order with highest bid value first, players take turns to pick an Asset from the Pool. Players must immediately place their newly acquired Assets onto their own individual player boards. They can choose to place the Asset on any of the 3 available levels. When placing on levels 1 and 3, the Asset must be placed in the leftmost empty space of that level. If the player decides to put it on level 2, the Asset must be placed in the rightmost empty space of that level.&#10;&#10;On each Bid Card, there is also a secondary effect that will occur. Much of the game's strategies revolve around cleverly using these effects at the right time. The value 1 card allows a player to place a Tavern on the newly acquired Asset, while the value 2 card allows a player to immediately add 1 party member with the type based on a card draw from the Party deck. Value 3 allows one to take back all his previously played Bid Cards, including that card itself. When value 3 is played, all other players must place their newly acquired Asset face-down! Value 4 allows one to add one more Asset from the drawbag to the Pool when it is his turn to pick, and value 5 allows one to swap the positions of two previously placed Assets. Value 6 allows a player to place a Shrine on the newly acquired Asset. On a tie (more than 1 player playing the same value Bid Card), both players go last! (Even if they both played a 6) On top of that, their Bid Cards' secondary effects do not trigger too! Value 3's secondary ability will always trigger, even if tied.&#10;&#10;All players do have a Hack skill they can each use twice per game, which allows them to avoid losing the effect of secondary abilities during ties as well as keeping their bid numbers instead of going last. Between the tied players, the play order follows the previous turn. If player A and B tied, and player B had her turn before A in the previous turn, she will continue to have her turn before A in this new turn. If players tie in the first turn of the game, the play order ascends from the youngest first.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that Assets belong to three types - Cave, Dungeon, and Outdoor. Players will gain bonus points if they can chain and connect more Assets of the same type together.&#10;&#10;After 12 turns of Design phase, all players' boards should be filled completely with 12 Assets each. The Gameplay phase will then begin. This is when all players' parties start from their leftmost Asset on the first level, and work their way forward until the last Asset on the rightmost space of level 3. All Assets in the game have 4 values - The first value shows how many fighters will die in that Asset, the second shows how many mages will die, the third shows how many healers will die and the fourth shows a rating of how difficult the Asset is. Players choose to resolve only ONE of the first three values.  Clever decision making is important to minimize death across the various classes in each party.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you must ensure that your party survives throughout the entire level to the very end (yes, the same level you designed earlier) Then you will gain bonus points for your dungeon's difficulty, as well as for every 3 dead members. Hence, the best players are the ones who can design very difficult levels but still get their party to the end. It is VERY common for entire parties to be completely wiped out though - afterall, this is Black Souls!&#10;&#10;",

Brave knights and heroic beings wage war against sinister demons and monstrous abominations.&#10;&#10;Warlord is a complete game system that uses the Reaper Adventure Game Engine (R.A.G.E.) for faster and more enjoyable play. Each model in the game has a set of numbers and abilities that dictate how well it performs in the game. These numbers and abilities are listed on a Data Card, an easy to read record sheet about the size of a standard poker card and freely downloadable here at reapergames.com. A key component of the R.A.G.E. system is the Damage Track. Each row of stats on the Data Card represents a Damage Track which is the total points of damage that the model can sustain before being destroyed and removed from play. As a model takes damage, its stats change to reflect its changing performance on the field of battle!&#10;&#10;Tabletop Miniatures Games:&#10;Reaper's tabletop miniature games are played with plastic and/or metal 28mm miniatures on a large flat surface - typically a 4' x 4' square table. Each player will need to build an army using the various 28mm plastic and/or metal miniatures that Reaper produces in its various product lines.&#10;&#10;Reaper produces an official line of Warlord miniatures for use with the game. However, you may use any Reaper miniature to represent the models in your army.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;About the World of WarlordWarlord takes place in the war-torn land of Taltos in the world of Adon. The region is a place of dry, blistering summers and mild winters. Various leaders and their forces battle for the control of their own destinies. The battle for the power to become Warlords and become legends by their own hands - some are just and fair and others are cruel and capricious. Life in Taltos is brutal but there is a fortune to be made and eternal fame to be won.&#10;&#10;When playing Warlord, you choose a faction from the 10 different factions of Taltos.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Farkle is a traditional push-your luck dice game similar to Dix Mille. Players roll six dice (or five, in some versions of the game), and remove any dice they want to use for points. They can stop, keeping the points, or re-roll the remaining dice.  Points are scored by specific numbers (e.g. 5 or 1) or sets of the same number. If all six dice are used points, they can be picked back up and the player can keep going.  The first player to 10,000 wins.&#10;&#10;Originally Farkle was played with five dice. The game originated in the 1930s, (Hugo Kastner: Die gro&szlig;e Humboldt Enzyklop&auml;die der W&uuml;rfelspiele. Humboldt 2007, pp. 205-208) but has various joke origin stories, such as that the game was &quot;first played in Iceland by Sir Albert Farkle in the 14th century&quot; or &quot;derived from the Farkleberry tree, a small tree native to Texas. When the early settlers came to Texas, they discovered the Farkleberry would harden as they dried. The settlers carved these berries into the shape of dice so that they might play games.&quot;&#10;&#10;Reiner Knizia describes the game as being identical to the French game Dix Mille, and notes that when played to half the target score it is known as Five Thousand. (Dice Games Properly Explained, 1999) The 1975 game Cosmic Wimpout uses similar dice and rules. In 1996, Charlie and Mary Potter published Farkel, a version of the game with a copyrighted scoring system, and lodged various trademarks.&#10;&#10;",

The Chinese, in common with many other Asian people, believe that every person will demonstrate in their lives those qualities of temperament of the special animal which controls the year of their birth.&#10;Players can discover what Animal Year they were born in by looking for their year of birth around each animal picture on the board. The Chinese Year, unlike the Western Year, runs from February to January, so remember this as you discover your animal sign. For example, a person born in January 1956 would be a goat, whereas a person born in February 1956 would be a Monkey.&#10;Operation of the Tile Dispenser&#10;Tiles are drawn one by one from the Dispenser by firmly pushing down on the lever on the side of the Dispenser. Occasionally, and especially when very few tiles are left in the Dispenser, no tile will be dealt on the first push of the lever. Simply push again, until a tile appears.&#10;Game set up&#10;Put all of the tiles in the Dispenser and place the lid on top. Gently shake the Dispenser and place it in the center of the board. Each player chooses a Mandarin and places it on the board on the center Chinese Character space of their own animal sign. If two or more players share the same sign, simply place the Mandarins side by side on the same space.&#10;Object of the Game&#10;Players collect tiles and place them in the appropriate places on their Collection Cards. The game ends when one player has collected at least one tile of each animal type, or all 6 tiles of one animal set. The first player to do this is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Usually the commodity has a base value, but in every city, one commodity is not wanted at all and another one is more expensive. In Gdansk, for example, you cannot pay with grain, but glass has a value +2. The buildings show victory points and persons.

If five cards are now in the shop, you must take cards.&#10;&#10;When you take cards, if 1-4 cards are in the shop, take all cards of a single color from the shop and add them to your collection; if five cards are in the shop, take all cards of two colors from the shop instead. If the number of bulbs in a color in your collection is now a multiple of three (3, 6, 9, 12), score those cards, placing them face down in a corner of your playing area. If you have 1-2 bulbs of a color, leave those cards where they are. If you have four or more bulbs of a color and didn't score them, discard all bulbs of that color. The next player then takes their turn.&#10;&#10;When the final card is revealed from the deck, the active player finishes their turn, then the game ends. Add the points on your scored cards, then subtract the points showing on all cards that remain in your playing area. Whoever ends up with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The water, however, surrounds the city and when it rises, you will great bodies of water form and the ever-disappearing streets will be impassable. What will the future of Venice hold?&#10;&#10;The year is 2099 and Venice is sinking. Players take on the role of art collectors and try to save as many treasures and artworks as possible. Strategic thinking is required to save the masterpieces. Gondolas are used to escape the floodwaters. The players move on floating platforms, wishing to avoid being in the part of town that is sinking...'&#10;The 8 by 8 board depicts Venice. At the start of the game, all land and bridge tiles are randomized in the plastic frame. Each player receives 3 tokens that they place anywhere on the board. All tiles have a value (higher numbers equating with higher value). Each player is also dealt 5-9 cards and receives 9 coins.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all dealt cards have been played. On their turn, players must play their lowest numbered card. The cards are numerical from 3-8.&#10;&#10;When playing a card, the tile that has the same number is flipped over to its water side, eventually flipping a tile with a player's token. Players use the two gondola cards, enabling them to rescue their tokens to another tile. The tokens excavate treasures by travelling to a specifically coloured tile and exchanging one coin for the corresponding coloured treasure.&#10;&#10;When all cards have been played, there remains part of the map that is not submerged. These remaining tiles are used to calculate the value of the treasures by rarity.&#10;&#10;",

On the die roll, you wander the mansion, collecting Clues and Items (represented on the board by magnifying glasses and Xs) and making suggestions to other players to see their cards or not. In addition, Event cards (drawn when a red spot is rolled) allow the movement of the non-PCs, Hogarth the Butler, Inspector Grey and The Black Dog. When satisfied that you've identified the murderer, weapon and location, you write your accusation down, make it to the telephone in the main entrance and check the hidden result. &#10;Interesting variant, but still the same basic game.&#10;&#10;The original designer of Cluedo is Anthony E. Pratt, and www.cluedofan.com reckons this is the best edition for tactical play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Little Wars was first published in 1913, but has been published many times since then, including editions from MacMillan publishing and Dover Press.  The rules portion of the book can be read for free online.&#10;&#10;The full book includes a fairly extensive history of the game and socio-political discussion of wargaming.  Wells (the famous historian and science fiction writer) was a pacifist, and the book makes for interesting reading, as wargaming was his favorite hobby.  He considered the generals he played with to be reckless buffoons, and was worried for his country should war break out.  (WWI broke out the year after the book was published, and given the massive casualties of WWI, he seems justified in his opinions.)&#10;&#10;The rules themselves are fairly simple, as miniatures games go.  There are rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, terrain setup, prisoners, etc.  There are three types of units: cavalry, infantry and artillery.  The toy soldiers of Wells' day were fairly large, so the movement factors are also large, and it's made to be played on a floor.&#10;&#10;Ranged combat results are entertaining, but hard to recreate in today's world.  In Wells' time, toy cannons fired little pellets and were actually tooled to be quite accurate.  The game calls for aiming the cannons and firing them, and any figures you knock over are casualties!  The best recreation I've seen was at a convention where we used toy pistols that fired plastic disks: the player had to place the butt of the pistol on the floor next to his artillery and fire from there.&#10;&#10;Melee combat does not use a randomizer.  (In the book Wells discusses how he started with a coin flip but was turned against it when one soldier won over twenty battles!)  Instead, compare sizes of units, add in &quot;supporting&quot; units (within a certain distance), and each side takes casualties proportionately.  The remaining smaller force is then taken prisoner and may be escorted to the rear lines - or freed on the way by a rescue attempt.&#10;&#10;Although modern miniatures rules are more complex and realistic, this is still a very fun game to play, and is a big hit at conventions.  It's also free online!  It is best played on a floor with one-foot tiles for ease of measurement.&#10;&#10;Stand alone expansion of Floor Games&#10;&#10;BGG Microbadge -- &#10;&#10;",
