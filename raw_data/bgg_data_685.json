    "Description": "Zanshin is a fast-paced bluff-based game about samurai fencing inspired by kendo and &quot;Book of Five Rings&quot;. This game is my attempt to focus gameplay on &quot;learn your opponent&quot; rather than &quot;learn in-game tactics&quot;.&#10;Each player has same hand of skill, bluff and attack cards and five random Strike cards. Each round player try to spend less skill cards than his opponent in order to get advantage or catch an opponent on opposite strike. Players play their skill and bluff cards face down to form their intention for current round, than reacts on opponent's strikes and than ether evade or counterattack.&#10;Three player variant Twofaced Dragon allows player to recreate 2vs1 fight. This variant keeps almost all mechanic from main rules and all players starts with same sets of cards, so wining this fight is very thought challenge for Dragon. I tired to make this variant as close to real situations in kenjutsu as possible. There is no artificial benefits or constrains and every mechanic change justified by real aspect of that kind of fights.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Designers Note:&#10;&#10;Have found a potentially interested publisher, and several changes to the design have been made. I'm very pleased with them, but this may mean that the description here will change. - Alex&#10;&#10;SEVEN WEEKS is a 2 to 3 player Euro-style war game that aims to recreate the maneuvering, bloodshed, and events of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 in the German and Bohemian theaters. (The Italian front is also represented as an influence upon forces available and overall morale.)&#10;&#10;Players represent the Prussians and their North German allies, the Bavarian and Federal German forces (including Baden, Hesse Darmstadt, Nassau, and Wurttemburg amongst others) , and the Habsburgs (who also control the Saxons, Hanoverians, and Kurhessen/Hesse-Kassel forces). The Bavarian and Habsburg forces must work together to stop the Prussians from achieving the historical victory - a crushing blow for the Habsburgs, a defeat for independent states in Germany, and the beginning of a long era of Prussian hegemony over German affairs.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes hand management and card driven mechanics. The map is a traditional hex map, depicting major population centers, fortresses, and rail lines. The combat system uses a system of &quot;tactical cards&quot; and battlefield deployment, implementing some fresh ideas intended to represent the player's role as the commander in chief of a military establishment and the necessity of relying upon the battlefield doctrine practiced by his/her forces. Prussian forces, for example, heavily rely upon open order formation and &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; technique, while the Habsburgs are fond of the &quot;Stosstaktik&quot; approach and rely upon a superior artillery arm. The game is completely diceless.&#10;&#10;The aim is to produce an exciting wargame that can easily be played within two hours. The game is currently in playtesting, and hoping for a &quot;Sooner than Later&quot; publication date as we look for a publisher.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Zombie strategy game for 3 or more players, where the person who survives the longest wins.&#10;&#10;Each player controls 1 Human and 3 Zombies. Aim of the game is to be the last Human to survive the Zombie attack. Each player takes turns to run from the shuffling Zombies, then each takes turns to move their Zombies to try and corner and bite the other players' Humans. Humans generally move a fixed number of 6 speaces, whilst Zombies move according to a dice roll (1-6). Get bitten as a Human and you still have 5 turns - or until you get bitten again if sooner - until you become a Zombie yourself. Cards take it beyond a basic roll 'n' move, with positive (for yourself) and negative (for others) special effects.&#10;&#10;There are various cards that can either help or hinder.&#10;&#10;",

Battle engines do not replace Warjacks or Warriors, but instead provide players with survivable, concentrated firepower and a wealth of tactical options that will appeal to a wide broad range of playstyles.&#10;&#10;Wrath also introduces another new model type; Ranking Officers. Ranking Officers give players more reason to field Mercenaries in their armies. They provide all the benefits from a typical unit attachment, but they also transform their Mercenary units into faction units subject to all of the spells, abilities and feats the faction has to offer.&#10;&#10;Of course, Wrath also contain new models for all the different factions.&#10;&#10;",

In his turn, a player must turn over the top card. If it matches any other face-up card, both players with the now matching cards must call &quot;Oosehe&quot;?, and name the animal now revealed. The first to do so, claims the matching cards plus all the cards beneath it.&#10;The rules are a little strange in that you are asked to call the name as listed on the Key Card but as this name is also on the cards, players could just read the card itself. Maybe Victorian children found these animals exotic and not instantly recognisable.&#10;The name of the game is pronounced &quot;Oose he?&quot;, as rhyming with the phrase &quot;Whose He?&quot;&#10;&#10;",

For once, it is not a Snap, Happy Families or Old Maid variant.&#10;The cards have a fair amount of text on them (see images), not just the naval illustration. I am assuming that cards are revealed and interaction takes place between the different kinds of vessels now on view. The Battleship can protect 'Simple cards' drawn against a Destroyer. The Cruiser is a 'Simple card' itself and needs the protection of the Battleship. And other ships have their 'rules', the Destroyer, the Merchantman and the Torpedo Boat. A Victorian boy must have been thrilled with this game, with its military links.&#10;By the way, the odd title is intended to be pronounced 'Sea-Fight'.&#10;&#10;",

With a mixture of strategy, action, control of risk, and some touches of role, FQ3 represents a real way (and funny too), all that happens inside and outside of the tracks.&#10;&#10;&quot;FQ3&quot; has 3 difficulty levels of rules to satisfy all kind of players;&#10;&#10;- BASIC RULES: Aimed at casual and undemanding gamers.&#10;&#10;- ADVANCED RULES: For fans of race games. These rules are more realistic, and involved all sorts of factors: such as types of tires, fuel loads, setting the car, kers, yellow flag, Safety Car, moral of drivers and injuries, etc.&#10;&#10;- MANAGER MODE: Only for those who  drink gasoline! In this game mode, in addition to the role of pilot, you will assume the role of team manager. You will manage the economy, hiring drivers, sponsors, engineers, desing the car and evolve it. The years pass and drivers will gain experience and they will improve their skills.&#10;&#10;SUMMARY OF GAMEPLAY: The Friday of the GP, the player must decide the strategy (number of stops, tires, and fuel load).&#10;&#10;On Saturday, will be held the pole position, it follows a mathematical operation involving various modifiers (skills of the pilot, car performance, fuel load, tires, moral, blunders, and a roll of 1d20).&#10;&#10;The race takes place the Sunday.&#10;The circuit is composed of squares. The cars will go moving by circuit as many squares as the speed (gear dependent) of your car.&#10;When the cars reach the corners, the drivers must brake and accelerate. Brakes and accelerates with a d100. Drivers have an ability to Brake and Accelerate that used to take curves (higher or lower depending on driver).&#10;These skills will be modified by the fuel load, tire types, and how close you decide to brake and accelerate.&#10;The risk you take in the curves is important; you can take away your opponents, but be careful!, fail brake roll or acceleration roll will damage your car.&#10;&#10;The game stands on four pillars:&#10;The driver, the car, the pit stop mechanics, and the circuit.&#10;Each of them has many different skills, qualities or details that make it different from the others.&#10;&#10;This is a brief summary of how to play. There are many and funny rules, such as kers, spin, overtaking, blunders, drivers' virtues, drive's defects, safety car,etc.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of each round, 2 cards from the deck are dealt face up and 3 face down. After players indicate whether they will continue or fold, a face down card is turned over. This continues until all 5 cards are turned over. At that point, remaining players who didn't fold will receive the cards. Players who folded receive a number of chicken chips equal to the number of face down cards plus one.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, having one of a particular picture card is worth 2 points and two of that picture card are worth 6 points. Having three or more is a minus 3/4/5/etc. points. Each chicken chip is minus 2 points.

    "Description": "In Poker Carr&eacute;, players add cards to a grid and try to create sequences of at least four numbers (e.g., 1-2-3-4), sets of at least three cards of the same suit, and sets of at least three cards of the same value.&#10;&#10;Why is this difficult? The deck consists of 49 cards &ndash; seven suits of seven cards numbered 1-7 &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of four cards, while nine cards are randomly laid out in a 3x3 grid. On a turn, a player adds a card to the grid adjacent to at least one card already on the table, with the restriction that at least one of the adjacent cards must have a value exactly one higher or one lower than the card being played. That player then draws a replacement card. Once all the cards have been played, tally the points; the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Horsefeathers is a bluffing-and-betting dice game requiring only twelve 6-sided dice, a dice cup, a handful of tokens, and a box of poker chips in order to play.&#10;&#10;Players roll one die each turn and add it to the dice that are already in the center of the table.  These dice are grouped by number.  When there is one die of a given number (say, one 6), it is referred to as a &quot;single&quot;; when there are two dice of a given number (say, two 3s), they are referred to as a &quot;double&quot;; there can never be three dice (a &quot;triple&quot;) of the same number in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;When players roll their die, they conceal it under the dice cup and then declare its value.  If, however, the number rolled would create a triple, then the player must call it something else.  The player must lie.&#10;&#10;Other players can challenge the declaration by calling &quot;Horsefeathers.&quot;  If the rolling player was lying, then the challenge is successful and the challenger takes a token from the center of the table; the lying player is out of the round.  If, on the other hand, the rolling player was telling the truth, then the *challenger* is out of the round.&#10;&#10;The goal in each round is to be the last player standing -- that player gets the pot of chips.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this fashion until the last token is taken.  The current round is finished, payouts are made based on any token discrepancies, and then the chips are counted.  The player with the most chips is the winner.&#10;&#10;If you want to give it a try, the rules can be found on the game's homepage, http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/horsefeathers/.&#10;&#10;",

Cards from this deck allow the ghosts to possess the living, bequeath items from their will, inspire or weaken others, reveal information on cards in player's hands, warn of impending doom, and so forth. Ghosts however, can spoil each other's plans.&#10;&#10;With a strong thematic background, Death Mesa should add to the fun of BANG! and draw new fans to it who could not stand the player elimination.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trade-off, the land-use simulation game, allows participants to experience a wide range of community development situations in a relatively short period of time. Trade-off players will think about land-use and resource problems they have probably never considered before.&#10;In Trade-off, 3 to 7 players act as Planning Commissioners, serving to regulate the actions of the 4-8 players who represent the Agricultural/Forestry, Industrial, Residential, and Commercial Center/Tourism Developers. The Developers aim to build their respective projects by purchasing and improving land on a grid map of a river valley. Meanwhile, the Commission, along with a Banker and Recorder, must maintain the area's environment and settle disputes between developers.&#10;Time is measured in Trade-off with a Monopoly-type track running around the board. A full run of the track represents an in-game year. At each space on the track, events occur that affect the Developers, such as stock market fluctuations or environmental damage.&#10;The game ends when the players agree to finish. At that time, the Developers assess the extent of their accomplishments, while weighing them against the environmental damage they potentially caused. Trade-off is primarily a classroom aid, and so discussion of actual land development is encouraged. No &quot;winning&quot; Development team is chosen officially, but players may use the map and each player's wealth to make a decision regarding victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A rapid-fire &quot;print-and-play&quot; game where players have to sell arms to various unsavoury customers across North Africa and the Middle East.&#10;&#10;The order of play is through a series of quick rounds, with both players racing to claim territories - either as selling opportunities or to shame the opposing player for already selling weapons there.&#10;&#10;The tricky decisions arrive as the best customers are the ones most actively repressing their own people (popular uprisings are great for business). Getting called out on selling arms to politically dodgy customers means your diplomats will be shamed into retirement and your ability to do further deals is then reduced.&#10;&#10;The first player to sell all their weapons wins.&#10;&#10;From the game:&#10;&#10;&quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt is reported to have said of the Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza, &quot;He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch&quot;. The story is apocryphal, but it tells a truth that persists today. We will support, encourage and sell arms to the worst of humanity as long as it is convenient to do so. Once the relationship sours, however, it's time to back out as quickly and quietly as possible, preferably invading in the wake to claim a righteous victory for democracy and freedom!&#10;&#10;To sample the exciting diplomatic thrills of global politics, we bring you this game. All it takes is about 15 minutes, 30 coins, 3 dice, a determination to sell weapons to anyone and the cunning to avoid being caught.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mechropolis is currently under development.&#10;&#10;Mechropolis is a game of adventure, tactical combat, and choose your own adventure-like campaign play.  As added replay value, the game also incorporates a quicker player vs. player combat system included in the base game.&#10;&#10;Taking place in the turmoil-ridden machine-city of Mechropolis, players assume the role of a mechanical freedom fighter, and travel the land in attempts to unhinge the current regime ruling the city with an iron (literally!) fist.&#10;&#10;Players will have access to hundreds of items, weapons, skills, powers and upgrades, giving them fully customizable characters to play with.&#10;&#10;Two ways to play:&#10;&#10;1)  Follow the &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style game play in the cooperative campaign and fight against the enemy using tactical combat on a large, interchangeable game board.   Players play against the game itself, no &quot;dungeon master&quot; needed.  While not in combat, player traverse the terrain on the overall city area map, visiting locales, buying/selling scavenged items, and fighting through random encounters.&#10;&#10;2)  Play with or against your friends in player vs. player deathmatch, capture the flag, king of the hill, and other team games for a free for all, fun filled action packed gaming experience.&#10;&#10;If you enjoyed PC games such as the Jagged Alliance series, X-COM, or Fallout: Tactics, you'll enjoy the tactical game play and customizable options in Mechropolis!&#10;&#10;If you like games such as Star Wars: Epic Duals, Frag, and Gunslinger, but wish the game was more epic, strategic, less luck driven and deeper with more replay value, this will be the game for you!&#10;&#10;",

It fought in Sicily, in Italy (Salerne and Anzio landings), then in southern France, in Alsace, and finally in Germany, near the Czech border, where it finished the war.&#10;&#10;The division suffered heavy losses throughout the war, as it was engaged in violent battles in Italy and in the Vosges mountains.&#10;&#10;One of the bravest soldiers of this division was Audie Murphy, the most decorated American soldier of Second World War. He started the war as a private in the 15th US Infantry Regiment in 1943. By they time the war was over in 1945, he was a lieutenant with 38 medals, including the Medal of Honor. After the war, he became a Hollywood movie star and wrote an autobiographical book, &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, about his World War II experience.&#10;&#10;Required expansions: Terrain Pack, Eastern Front&#10;&#10;Recommended expansions: Winter Board, Campaign Book, Pacific Theater, Tigers in the Snow&#10;&#10;",

The tiles specify the directions and distances the snowmen may travel. When players land on a tile containing opposing snowmen, they must melt one down or mug one. If the mugger&rsquo;s victim capitulates, the mugger receives a coin that he can use to alter his movement or defend himself with a force field; otherwise, the victim is melted down one piece. Some tiles act as traps; if all your pieces are trapped, they melt, one by one. The winner is the last player with any snowmen left on the board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Heroes Inc 6: Overmind&rsquo;s Invasion is an expansion to Heroes Inc 1, 2, and 3. All three games are required to use this expansion. In this expansion, an alien villain named Overmind is invading the Earth and only two heroes (Firefly and Liberty Lass) are there to fight him. Overmind is an alien with a very large brain and over-sized head. The scenarios in this expansion are linked together and are meant to be played in a specific order. For example, if the heroes lose scenario one, they move on to scenario two. If the heroes win, they can skip to scenario three.&#10;&#10;The game uses a points system to buy characters with. Players have 40 points to spend on their heroes and villains in order to build the best group. The game follows the core rules of the other Steel and Glory games but adds new rules to accommodate for super hero fighting techniques.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. The villain side has certain objectives (such as do a certain amount of damage to the city and exit the board) and the heroes win if they prevent these objectives from happening.&#10;&#10;",
