    "Description": "LIGHTNING &amp; BOLT is an asymmetric, co-operative game built for parents and kids&mdash;or anyone who wants to mix together a lighter and heavier game for a great time.&#10;&#10;LIGHTNING &amp; BOLT is a dice-rolling, tile-flipping, bot-destroying search-and-rescue mission with superheroes, robots, and extreme asymmetry. To win, you need to rescue all 9 neighborhoods, fighting off the evil bots that are terrorizing them, reuniting friends and family, and cornering the Evil Doctor in his secret lab!&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;Lightning always plays first. On her turn, she can move, smash DocBots on her location by rolling her die, and rescue neighborhoods she's cleared of bots. Lightning ALWAYS defeats all DocBots on her space, even if she rolls below the number of bots surrounding her. But, when she rolls low the extra DocBots make her trouble meter tick upward&mdash;one for each extra bot. Once her trouble meter is full, Lightning is trapped, and can't move until Bolt comes to rescue her!&#10;&#10;Lightning rescues neighborhoods by flipping over tiles that have been cleared of DocBots. Once she flips over a neighborhood tile, it stays face-up until the next neighborhood is rescued. If the tiles match, they're safe, and remain up and clear of bots for the rest of the game! If they don't match, they both flip back face down, and moving back to fac edown tiles you've visited before brings a new batch of DocBots to fight.&#10;&#10;On Bolt's turn, the giant robot rolls three dice, and assigns them to the actions described on its player mat. Some actions (like moving and searching a neighborhood) require 1 die assigned, regardless of value. Others (like attacking DocBots or rescuing Lightning from trouble) depend on the value rolled. If Bolt needs to increase the value of its roll, it can increase its heat by 1 per die re-rolled. But if Bolt's heat meter gets full, it overheats, and must spend all three dice on the following turn to cool down. Still, sometimes overheating is preferable to taking too much damage from being swarmed by DocBots in neighborhoods Bolt enters&mdash;bots Bolt doesn't defeat remain on its tile turn after turn, dealing continual damage and preventing it from moving or taking any actions until Lightning swoops in, destroys the bots, and spends a turn repairing her robotic friend.&#10;&#10;If Bolt rolls a 6 on any of its dice, it can choose to assign that die to downloading an upgrade, drawing a card from its upgrade deck. On the following turn, dice can be assigned to that upgrade to activate it.&#10;&#10;To win, Lightning &amp; Bolt must match all four pairs of neighborhood tiles. But if at any point they reveal the Evil Doctor's lair, all unmatched tiles are shuffled, setting back our heroes badly! However, if all four matches are made, and the last tile flips up to reveal the Evil Doctor's lair, Lightning &amp; Bolt have cornered him, and take him off to jail, saving Midtown once again!&#10;&#10;",

The game uses the proven Blue &amp; Gray combat system where morale is as important as the number of soldiers.&#10;&#10;You are limited in how many units you may move based on the number of action points you receive, plus a random number of action points based on your commander, and play an Event Card, not necessarily in that order.

You fight off the relentless Norman attacks as they seek the victory that would begin centuries of French-speaking kings and nobles controlling all of England.&#10;&#10;Two players battle each other by aligning their cards that represent their units into battle columns. Your choice of battle formations will decide who wins the field that day. The Saxon player's army is led by Harold Godwinson (King Harold II). While the Norman's army is led by William of Normandy, later known as William the Conqueror because he was lucky enough to survive and win the battle. Will you be so lucky?&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to force the enemy to flee or wipe them out.&#10;&#10;This game uses a &ldquo;virtual board&rdquo;. Two &ldquo;sides&rdquo; of the board are supplied, which helps players visualize the central area of the board where the game actually takes place. The players&rsquo; troops (cards) outline the shape of the board.&#10;&#10;The battle takes place on a grid divided into six columns and seven rows. The rows are shown on the &ldquo;side&rdquo; pieces.&#10;&#10;The battlefield for each side has 3 opposing sectors and each sector has two columns. You win by breaking two opposing sectors.&#10;&#10;If all break in the same player&rsquo;s turn, Saxons win! You gain a &ldquo;Major victory&rdquo; if you also kill the opposing leader and yours is alive.

Extra joker-like cards are optionally attached; any given deck may have from 0 to 5 of these extras (of which only two ever appear to be used in any published sets of rules).&#10;&#10;The games played with these cards tend to be multi-trick games for three to four people; in these games when there's a fourth that person doesn't actively play but only deals and is active in the ensuing payouts.  The deal changes each round depending on who won the previous.&#10;&#10;Most cards of this variety have only the characters for suit and number (in Hakka traditional form, not normal Chinese characters) although some larger, more elaborate decks may have illustrations.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Everything happened because of a single cat.&#10;&#10;It had to get on board during our rendezvous with the Adrastea science vessel, orbiting the DB-198 protoplanet. Soon after, we took samples from DB-198 and made our jump back with everyone tucked away safely in their stasis pods. Everyone, except the cat.&#10;&#10;Even its nine lives couldn't save it. As the ship accelerated up to 1000G, poor critter turned into a four-kilogram projectile that smashed several sample canisters and turned into a thin layer of protein soup on the bulkhead door. Nothing too bad, right? Well, it turns out something weird was hidden in the damaged samples. A voracious, parasitic form of XNA that could attach itself to many different genetic molecules, including DNA, and rewrite them to grow carrier organisms. This strange virus recombined the cat&rsquo;s remains. Then, it went through all the biomass in our kitchen supplies. Finally, it found us, locked away in our stasis pods; pieces of canned flesh waiting to be opened.&#10;&#10;Soon, all hell broke loose. We tried to fight these things, but the more we bled and the more of us died, the stronger and larger they became. The last of us now plan to destroy the ship, but the road to control room is blocked by the original carrier, now a lumbering hulk of flesh that still has a disfigured cat&rsquo;s head. I volunteered to fight it with a jerry-rigged flamethrower. I know it&rsquo;s irrational, but this damn animal has to pay for everything that happened to my crew!&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Now lets get some more detail on the rules. Again, this is just a general idea, that we will be developing hard in the upcoming time! But we hope it will give you enough feel to give you decision to get it or not ;)&#10;&#10;Larvae (Metagorgers):&#10;&#10;Biggest change will be larvae stage - at the begging of the game this will be the ONLY thing that will be in the alien bag (no other stronger aliens), but whenever you will happen to get one, you will roll a die to determine how many there will come (probably 2-4).&#10;&#10;They will be able to only give you light wound, but if they do, they will try to run (with the part that they have bitten off and your DNA). So if at the end of the round they will not be killed, you take them off the board and put one Shambler token into the alien bag (so Metagorger escaped, evolved and now is somewhere in the ship).&#10;&#10;Shamblers:&#10;&#10;Shamblers will be much stronger opponent and be able to hit you pretty strong. In addition they will try to find and eat whole body to evolve into next stage.&#10;&#10;We are thinking about giving players possibility to burn bodies to prevent this from happening.&#10;&#10;Fleshbeasts:&#10;&#10;Evolved Shambler. They will be the strongest opponents in the game - stronger then Intruder Queen - they can come into being only after eating whole corpse so there can be more of them on the ship at the same time.&#10;&#10;Generally, they will be designed in a way to create amazing pressure on players to do everything they can not to make Flashbeast creation possible, or they will be really screwed.&#10;&#10;Butcher:&#10;&#10;With the pass of time, one of the shambler can eat another and Butcher is created - it is also really strong opponent, but there can be only 1 Butcher in time at the Board.&#10;&#10;Overall combat:&#10;&#10;As you probably can tell, combat will be very different from Core Box. It will force players to take much more active approach - you need to make sure that whatever will be on this ship will not evolve beyond its current state.&#10;&#10;It will still not be a combat game, but a survival one, but the feeling will be very different. You will want to fight and make sure to kill (and then double kill just to be sure), instead of mostly run.&#10;&#10;Mutation cards:&#10;&#10;Infection cards will be changed into mutation and once again they will come with some serious disadvantages. They might be instant one-time thing or they might be a permanent setback.&#10;&#10;What can also happen, that with some major disadvantage, you can get some small buff (for example you will not be able to hold any weapon, but you will be a little bit better in close combat).&#10;&#10;We will try to keep mutation in very cinematic fashion.&#10;&#10;Corpes:&#10;&#10;We will also probably want to add heavy impact at corpses left on the ship and introduce more then just one starting and you will discover them during ship exploration. You will either waste resources and time to burn them (but meanwhile you can also burn very important parts of the ship) or ignore them, but it will fire back at you.&#10;&#10;All in all this expansion will be designed in a way to give you constant pressure between trying to meet your goal and managing Carnomorphs on the ship.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game features tokens and dice expanding it beyond the limits of a mere card game, creating an exciting combination of tactics and luck.&#10;&#10;Runes of Mayhem is a game where choosing the right units, using the proper abilities and formations are vital, but luck matters too - after all, you cannot wholly control the mayhem of an epic battle.

Take a defensive or an offensive approach, concentrate building momentum and speed or take your time and trade. Many paths lead to victory, but only if you pay close attention and grasp the pace of the game. In Runes of Mayhem, you decide what road to take!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Air Combat 1960 - 2000&#10;&#10;Missile Threat is a simple yet comprehensive modern air combat game, covering every major air conflict from 1960 to 2000, and designed for use with miniature aircraft.&#10;&#10;Missile Threat is aimed at providing a realistic air environment and short games of less than 2 hours (including preparation).&#10;&#10;What does Missile Threat offer?&#10;&#10;&#10;     Simple yet accurate mechanics: Missiles actually track aircraft in-game, forcing you to conduct defensive breaks or last-ditch missile defenses.&#10;     Fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, ground forces, naval vessels and air defenses all play an important role&#10;     Stats for over 250 different aircraft&#10;     11 Conflicts covered: Vietnam, Arab-Israeli wars (Six-Day, Yom Kippur and 1982 Lebanon war covered), Indo-Pakistani Wars, South African Border War, Ogaden War, Iran-Iraq War, Falklands, 1991 Gulf War, Bosnia / Kosovo, Eritrean-Ethiopian War, and the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis as a bonus conflict. Many of the longer conflicts are split into periods for more accuracy as units and tactics evolve.&#10;     Each conflict has a tailor-made aircraft and ordnance list for each faction, as well as accurate options for ground assets like SAM sites and AAA.&#10;     Flight plan &quot;bidding&quot; system: Players must write a flight plan before the game starts, indicating when aircraft will enter and leave the game. Will you try to get your ground attack aircraft in before the enemy fighters arrive? or wait until later? Will you send your fighters in early because you know the enemy will try to get their bombing done early?&#10;     Complete air environment: Ground assets like AAA, SAM sites and various radars are an important aspect of the game, allowing weapons like the AGM-88 HARM to have a use and for SEAD flights to have a purpose.&#10;     Pilots can be shot down, wounded, captured by enemy ground forces, picked up by on-call SAR helicopters, or make their way back to friendly lines on foot. Rescuing downed pilots is important for victory.&#10;     4 Mission types to fly: Combat Air Patrol, Strike, Combat Search and Rescue, and Close Air Support. CAS missions will see an active land battle being fought while you attempt to support friendlies.&#10;     Detailed yet simple rules for Naval Vessels and Submarines. Naval Vessels can launch and recover helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, and could potentially be caught unprepared for combat...&#10;     Forward Air Controllers, Recon, AWACS, AEW and Anti-Submarine Warfare aircraft all have a purpose in-game Campaign System provided so each game can have an effect on the next: Wiped out all the enemy SAM sites? I guess you won't need to focus on SEAD as much any more!&#10;&#10;&#10;Missile Threat is the culmination of 8 months of research and play-testing. Markers are provided for the various missiles, ground assets and ground forces, as well as naval vessel markers for the Falklands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Its members live in harmony with Nature. The tribe obeys the laws of the Four Elders, themselves guided by the most venerable of the Elders, the Neta-Tanka. When the Neta-Tanka enters the twilight of life, the Frostrivers gather at the Sacred Grounds to designate a successor. During this ceremony, each clan presents a young leader who will need to demonstrate generosity and the ability to provide for the tribe in order to become the new Neta-Tanka.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;When it is your turn, place a worker on the board. All the players place their workers, one at the time, until everybody has placed all their workers.&#10;&#10;Then, in the order of the turn, the players trigger all their workers.&#10;&#10;Think ahead, because some actions require other actions to be triggered beforehand! For example, if you want to get pelts, the &quot;Hunt&quot; action must have been triggered earlier in the turn. And when you skin the game to get the pelts, then the meat becomes available for the other players. It is crucial to remember the turn's order when you place your workers, or they might have nothing to do when you resolve your actions!&#10;&#10;Another key point of the game is that the spots on the board are linked with each other. Triggering 2 actions that are linked with each other gives you a boost (by improving those actions, or giving you extra resources, ...).&#10;&#10;There are different ways of scoring points in the game. You score points by:&#10;&#10;     Building tents for your tribe&#10;     Feeding your tribe&#10;     Handcrafting objects&#10;     Raising the highest Totem for the deities&#10;     Showing generosity to your opponents&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end is declared N&#196;&#147;t&#196;&#129;-Tanka!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "UNDEAD ROAD is a cooperative card game for 1 to 2 players*, where the participants cross an inhospitable road, represented by the deck of cards, in which they must survive to endless waves of zombies as much as possible, managing the limits resources they will find in a strategic and convenient way for the group.&#10;&#10;UNDEAD ROAD is defined as a &quot;Endless survival game&quot;. Each game lasts until the players are defeated by the zombies in the deck. The goal is to endure the most &quot;waves&quot; as possible. Each wave is the full use of a deck. When all the cards of the deck have been played, are shuffled again and start another &quot;wave&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each deck allows games of 1 to 2 players. You can play games of 3 to 4 players with an additional deck. You can play games of 5 to 6 players with a third deck, taking out the Resources Cards of it.&#10;&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;In Undead Road, players (up to two with each gamebox set) collaborate each other trying to go as far as they can through a common deck of cards that represents a dangerous road, full of danger and zombies.&#10;&#10;Each player has a card that represents a survivor. That card is used to record the life points of the survivor (turning the card clockwise) and equipping up to a maximum of two objects (one on each side of the card).&#10;&#10;During his turn, each player draws a card from the deck and all the players try to resolve the situation that the card presents. From the decks can come out zombies, objects of different types (weapons, healing stuff, ammunition, resources) or multiplying cards that force you to draw huge number of cards at once. Players must agree together how to solve the situation (eliminate the zombies, equip or use the objects, exchange them, etc).&#10;&#10;Gradually, the game ends up beating the players. The idea is to try to go through the entire deck as many times as possible.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hitler Strikes North is a remake and facelift of a classic game from the 1980's by Quarterdeck Games, and licensed to Hobby Japan. Many of the changes from the original reflect research I have conducted since the original game design and are reflected from our co-authored book Hitler Strikes North. Errors have also been corrected. The game map shows portions of the North and Norwegian Seas.&#10;&#10;In April, 1940 World War II was locked in a &quot;Sitzkrieg&quot; - a phony war. There were naval activities and limited air operations, but the Allied Armies faced Germany on her border where little was going on beyond training and planning. Attention was drawn north to Norway because of vital Swedish high-grade iron ore resources feeding both side's weapons industry through the ice-free port of Narvik and brought further into focus with the Russo-Finnish &quot;Winter War&quot; that had just concluded. Great Britain, with ally France, had a preponderance of ships and naval support, even if the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) was more modern. Britain was on the defensive, though she had advanced plans for invading Norway to cut off the supply of iron ore going to Germany. But the British did not know when or with what that the Germans might try to break raiding warships out into the Atlantic to attack her vital convoy routes, or marshal an attempt to overwhelm a tragically weak and under armed Norway.&#10;&#10;Hitler Strikes North allows you to explore the various possibilities of this highly charged strategic situation.&#10;Can you break through the vaunted Royal Navy to unleash your raiders?&#10;Can you successfully use all the elements of modern war - air, sea, and land to swiftly subjugate an entire nation in the world's first modern &quot;Joint&quot; operations?&#10;Can you, as the Allies, respond to the German thrust with your forces to stop the German objectives?&#10;Hitler Strikes North not only has these historical scenarios but also includes optional and hypothetical units, including the Danish navy, that allow you to play alternative plans and operations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Ziplock Contents:&#10;1 24-page rulebook (pages not numbered); There is a single line of errata on the inside back cover at the bottom left by the way.&#10;1 Player Aid Card #1, PAC #1, Weather Levels, Weather Table and Turn Record Chart&#10;2 Player Aid Card #2, PAC #2, Gunnery Table (two-sided)&#10;2 Player Aid Card #3, PAC #3, Tables for Torpedo Attack, Critical Flotation, Bombing and various other tables (two-sided)&#10;1 Player Aid Card #3A, PAC #3A, Contact Table, Evasion Table and Norwegian &amp; Danish Entry Table (single-sided); also printed on back of rulebook&#10;1 Player Aid Card #4, PAC #4, German Goal Determination Table and Sequence of Play (two-sided on lighter stock)&#10;1 Player Aid Card #5, PAC #5, Historical Set Up For The Game (actually 2 two-sided cards on lighter stock)&#10;2 Allied Ship Logs sheets, two-sided&#10;2 German Ship Logs sheets, two-sided&#10;1 Countersheet, two-sided, unpunched containing 216 counters (no blanks) in crystalline sleeve&#10;2 Game maps, identical&#10;1 Ziplock bag, thick&#10;&#10;",

Most of this changed after Guadalcanal, where elite Japanese forces and US Marines experienced heavy losses. By that time, US Army National Guard divisions had greatly improved. Throughout the fighting in the South Pacific the Australians were widely regarded as having provided the most proficient and effective infantry. Fighting in the South Pacific was not homogeneous.&#10;&#10;Each campaign and island provided a unique set of circumstances. &#10;This supplement adds Japanese morale result tables, Banzai Charges, Night Infiltration, Die in Place, Hidden Japanese Positions, with a detailed vehicle and weapons list.&#10;&#10;The requirement for new action decks for the Japanese is not required but makes the game easier.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tower Capture combines the strategy of checkers and chess with the luck involved in a quick roll of the dice. The idea of Tower Capture is to simply capture the tower of your opponent by moving across the board of white and black hexagons. However, the movement of your 10 pieces is partially controlled by the two dice, which determine whether you move to a white or a black space, and whether you move through a red, yellow, or blue path. To win, make it to the space adjacent to the opposing tower, and capture opponent's pieces along the way by landing on the same space.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Invitation is a three to five player cooperative tabletop game where the players explore a derelict mansion and fight to avoid madness while completing the chosen scenario. Each scenario presents a plot, objective, and special rules for the gameplay. Certain scenarios introduce special mechanics that change the dynamic of the game. For example, the second scenario introduces a traitor mechanic in which one player secretly works against the rest of the players to accomplish his/her own goals.&#10;&#10;The exploration of the house is based on a randomly ordered deck of Room Tiles, so each play through is different in how the house is laid out. Items, enemies, and events are also encountered in a random order, which also serves to differentiate each play through and adds to the replayability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game was developed on a public forum and accepted input from users through two major revisions until a final publication date.&#10;&#10;Play uses many methods common to traditional wargaming.  Movement and distances are presented in &quot;inches&quot; and determined with the use of a tape measure.  Modified six-sided dice rolls are used to determine many outcomes.  Various arena tokens are used to denote alterations to the battlefield that occur during play.&#10;&#10;Each player controls the units of an opposing force.  Forces are built using a points pool.  As these calculations can become rapidly tedious, numerous armies and forces are provided by a variety of forum users.&#10;&#10;Each unit in each force is represented by a model that is placed on the play surface.  Models have a paper record that tracks various statistics and play values such as speed, armor, ammunition, and so forth.  Units may make attacks on opposing units as long as they have the range, remaining ammunition or power, and line of sight.  Successful attacks deal damage that may destroy, disable, or partially disable targets.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds in alternating player turns, each half-turn being sub-divided into movement, fire, and assault phases.  Victory conditions are set before the scenario begins and typically involve force destruction or &quot;capture the flag&quot; goals.  Rules disputes are resolved by a simple die throw.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Scrollhammer 2nd Edition is a miniatures wargame with a setting derived from the Elder Scrolls media franchise.  It is notably distinct from Scrollhammer because Scrollhammer 2nd Edition uses a completely original move and combat system.  The game has gone through repetitive playtest/revision cycles, leading to numerous (iterative) versions, each published as a static PDF from 2013 through 2017.&#10;&#10;Scrollhammer 2nd Edition focuses primarily on squad-based skirmishing where opposing players control a force composed of individual units, each unit represented on the play surface by a model.  Each model has a corresponding data card.  Scenarios may use either pre-determined setup or a deployment zone method.&#10;&#10;Models should conform to a 25mm standard; the play surface is assumed to be flat (terrain is indicated but not created).  Distance and movement are performed in &quot;inches&quot;, determined by tape measure.&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided into two half-turns, one for each player.  Initiative determines which player acts first.  During each turn, every model may take two Actions (during the controlling player phase) and take one Reaction (during the opposing player phase).  Attacks may be made on any other model that is in range and which is in &quot;line of sight&quot; of the attacker.  Attacks and other opposed situations are resolved by a modified six-sided die roll.  Attacks may destroy, disable, or partially disable the target.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover command influence, cover, missile and thrown weapons, dual-wielding combat weapons, blast attacks, and so forth.  The game utilizes a magic system as an organic component; magical effects are circumscribed and are &quot;low powered&quot; in scope.&#10;&#10;Scenarios use a pre-determined victory condition and play proceeds until the condition is achieved.  Many pre-built units are presented in the rules (custom unit creation is supported but complex).&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The roman numerals would then be used to score the throw of the bones.&#10;&#10;Players ante into the game similar to modern gambling games.  Once to play and then for each round.  Every round each player will get to throw the bones.  You score when getting at least one VI.  The player who achieves either a Venus or the highest total will win the round and the coins in the round pot.&#10;&#10;The Venus throw will win the game pot and the round pot (each face, I, II, IV, and VI).&#10;&#10;A micro role-playing game has been added to the historic base game, in which each player selects a historic character from 1000 AD to play.

These cards may be ghost, zombie, scary pumpkin, or haunted house cards. They then roll the three dice in an effort to satisfy the conditions to win that card. If successful, the player takes it and places it face-up in front of them, drawing any &quot;spooky action&quot; cards as instructed.&#10;&#10;They may PLAY any spooky action cards they have before relinquishing their turn to the next player. Spooky action cards may place a deck &quot;off limits&quot;, force an opponent to play for a specific card, manipulate dice, split, etc. There are also three &quot;ghost&quot; cards in this deck that count toward your overall ghost total.&#10;&#10;Collecting sets of 3 of zombie, pumpkin, or haunted house cards allow special powers that are important later in the game. A special effect of winning a haunted house card is getting to &quot;peek&quot; at the bottom card of the deck it came from, which helps direct a players strategy.&#10;&#10;A few of the main deck cards have a &quot;vanish&quot; effect, which can be spent to move a card from the top of a deck to the bottom, thus keeping it away from an opponent. Spending a &quot;vanish&quot; card in this way may break up a valuable set of three, so care must be given before deciding this course of action.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player has acquired seven ghost cards and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Contents: 60 cards(25 main deck and 35 spooky action), 3 six-sided colored dice, and rules.&#10;&#10;",

But a higher prize awaits: the presidency of the United States! The American government is built upon a system of checks and balances. Things get done only when everyone works together. At the same time, only one can rise to the highest office in the U.S. Will it be you? Only time - and the American people - will decide! God bless America!&#10;&#10;In Congress: The Board Game, you and your fellow senators compete to earn the most nomination points (&ldquo;NP&rdquo;) in order to secure the nomination for the U.S. presidency. This is accomplished by passing bills that reflect your interests and agendas over three terms. You must also support the interests of your state&rsquo;s residents or risk defeat in your midterm elections, harming your chances in the presidential race. The game is over at the end of the third term and the winner is the player with the most NP.&#10;&#10;Each session consists of four phases:&#10;&#10;Committee Phase - players bid for 'speakership' and select a bill.&#10;&#10;Amendment Phase - everyone takes turns adding riders and/or playing action cards.&#10;&#10;Voting Phase - the bill is either voted through in simple majority or killed.&#10;&#10;Election Phase - if this is the final session of the term, players receive campaign donations and roll for their election.&#10;&#10;After the third term and final election, secret agendas are revealed and NP is counted. The most NP wins, and in case of a tie, richest senator wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You're on a mission to explore all places beautiful and forgotten before your vacation is over.&#10;&#10;Start the game by picking a Start Space and a Vehicle. Each Vehicle gives you different abilities, such as moving a little faster under certain conditions or immunity to negative events. Plan your route by choosing byways. Then travel across the country a little bit every day, planning around highway construction, moody weather, and your car's pesky tendency to break down!&#10;&#10;The first player to travel all their Byways and circle back to their Start Space is the winner. Each player's route is determined by Byway Cards, which are drafted at the beginning of the game. After routes are chosen, players receive a hand of five Event Cards, one of which is drawn by the clockwise player right before the player can move. Whatever is written on that Event Card - good or bad - happens to the player who is about to move. Players can then travel up to six spaces per turn, trading in each unmoved space for the ability to discard an unwanted Event Card and draw a replacement.&#10;&#10;Each time the game comes back around to player 1, a new Construction Card is flipped. Construction Cards block off some of the fastest roads in the game. After five Construction Cards are drawn, players pass their Event Cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players are given a secret loyalty card, assigning them as a Traitor, Loyal, or the Heir in hiding. Loyals win by rooting out and eliminating the Traitors, or passing five Quests to safely herald in the new King. Traitors win when four Quests fail, or by finding and assassinating the Heir. Players will scheme, deceive, and persuade in order to complete their objectives.&#10;&#10;Each round, players contribute Knowledge cards in secret towards a Quest. Knowledge that matches the colour of the Quest will increase the chance of it passing, whilst off-colour cards increases the chance of failure. Players may vie for powerful Court cards, plot assassinations, or simply pass their action while they garner information. Play continues until the Loyals win and the Heir is safe, or the Traitors win and the Kingdom is left to ruin. As the game progresses, tensions will rise. Players will resort to accusations and assassinations in a last ditch effort to save the Kingdom, or force its destruction.&#10;&#10;Act of Treason was inspired by social deduction games like Mafia, Werewolf, and Battlestar Galactica. It takes many aspects of these games and seeks to amplify what makes them so much fun: the social interaction, suspicion and deception! In Act of Treason, the only thing that stands between you and victory is your ability to read, bluff, and persuade others.&#10;&#10;",

It is a completely separate game with its own rules and components.  The biggest differences are not needing to choose goals (Victory points are scored) and not needing to record a plan for each day&rsquo;s actions.&#10;&#10;Players choose one or more characters to play and move those characters through the game area of clearings on a 4 x 4 grid of tiles.  They will fight and avoid monsters that appear on the map, look for treasure sites and the treasures therein, meet with natives to buy and sell, hire muscle, and take on quests.  They gain Victory Points by discovering treasure sites, treasure, killing monsters, fulfilling quests, and learning new spells.&#10;&#10;The game lasts thirty days.  Characters can perform a certain number of actions each day based on their current health.  The actions include: Move, Sneak, Search, Parlay, Rest, Magic, and Combat.  Every two days, an Occurrence chart is used to randomly determine which monsters and natives appear on the map and which ones leave.  At the end of the thirty days, characters add up the Victory Points they scored and a winner is determined.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Once here, they will secretly grow and spread, damaging your crops and wilderness areas.&#10;&#10;Fortunately you and your biosecurity team have the skills to stop them in their tracks! Intercept them before they arrive, or find them quickly and eradicate. Can you bust every invasion?&#10;&#10;The Invasion Busters board depicts a simplified version of a real biosecurity system (based on that of New Zealand). A deck of cards represents invasive species which may arrive, grow and spread. Players co-operate to allocate dice to different biosecurity activities, then roll the dice to see if their actions have been successful. At the end of the game points are gained for the species successfully excluded or eradicated, and points are lost for any species which have become established. Players compare their score to a scale printed in the rulebook to see how well they did.&#10;&#10;Invasion Busters was developed specifically for use in the classroom, to help teach concepts of invasion, biosecurity and population dynamics to 8-12 year olds, but has also been enjoyed by their teachers and other grown up invasion busters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Downeast Dealer is a fast-paced card game of strategy for 3 to 5 players based on the old Yankee obsession with finding a bargain. Players run auctions, make bids on collectable items, and challenge other players to deals.&#10;&#10;Everyone begins with cash and a few bad checks. Play begins with the auction of an item you might find in a classified section of the newspaper, on Craigslist, or in the uniquely Maine publication, &ldquo;Uncle Henry&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Players take turns auctioning these Classified Items to each other and bidding on items to add to their own collection.&#10;&#10;Each Classified Item has a point value. The most sought after Classified Item, the Moose Trophy, is worth 100 points. Lesser items, like the Blueberry Rake, are worth as little as 5 points.&#10;A player only earns the points indicated on a Classified Item when they collect the complete set of four cards. When two players each hold the same Classified Item card, one player may &ldquo;Downeast Deal&rdquo; to try to capture the set.&#10;&#10;Downeast Deals are when bluffing becomes a major element of the game. Players might offer large sums of cash in a Downeast Deal, or they might just throw down a bunch of bad checks. There&rsquo;s no telling until the deal is done &ndash; and the savviest dealer takes the collection (or perhaps a large pile of cash!).&#10;&#10;Play continues with auctions and deals until all of the sets are complete. The final scoring depends on the point value of the cards a player has &ndash; and the number of sets the player has. Having a moose trophy to hang on the wall is cool &ndash; but having a fly-fishing rod in your hall AND a lobster trap in your living room AND an anchor in your cellar is even cooler. Right?&#10;&#10;Of course, collectors always run the risk of crossing paths with the village ne&rsquo;er-do-well, and Downeast Dealer is no different. Keep your collection safe from the Thief. If you don&rsquo;t, he may run off with your prized heirloom chest!&#10;&#10;",

The Fox is a tricky scoundrel that shows up in all the wrong places and chases off the Hens and destroys their Eggs! It&rsquo;s your job to keep the Fox out of your Henhouse and keep your Hens safe so they can produce as many Eggs as possible.&#10;&#10;In Fox in the Henhouse, each player has only 1 card in their hand and two face down cards in front of them. The two face down cards are called your Henhouse. Hen cards have 1-4 Eggs shown on them. You are attempting to gather the most Eggs into your hand and Henhouse by the end of the Week (7 rounds). In addition to each player's hand and Henhouse are two face down cards in the center of the play area called the Field. On your turn you can select a card from anywhere on the table (cannot take a card from someone's hand).  Once you have selected a card, you can choose which of the two cards you now hold to keep and which to put back, then other players take turns following the same format of selecting a card and placing a card.  If a player selects a Fox card they must keep it in their hand unless they are also holding one of the 4 Fox repelling cards (The Farmer, The Farmwife, The Farm Dog or The Rooster).  The 4 Fox repelling cards also have special abilities when played face up to help you manipulate the cards in play.  At the end of the Week all players total up their Eggs and take the number of Egg tokens they have accumulated.  After 4 weeks have been played then the player with the most Eggs wins!&#10;&#10;",
