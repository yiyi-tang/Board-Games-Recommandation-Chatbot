To make your premi&egrave;re is the most successful, you will need to attract and sit the audience onto the best possible locations. This will not be an easy job. The word got round and the most important celebrities, authorities and press do not want to miss this glamorous event. Will you be able to find the best seats? Now if you'll excuse me, the &quot;Show must go on!&quot;&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;&#10;Take a Seat introduces an innovative mechanic named Share &amp; Write where the randomness is created by player interaction (instead of a dice or a card). In each turn players will get a reservation panel and they will have to decide whether to use the usher's ability or get direct points. Then they will need to mark a reservation in the board of their right or left (depending the turn) by scratching on any of the 4 tickets of the reservation panel.  Finally they will have to assign seats on the theater by marking the outline and the circles that correspond to the selected pieces in the previous step.&#10;&#10;The game last 14 turns. Once ended you proceed to the final score. There are 3 areas to score: objective cards, reservation majorities and usher bonus. Players add up all points to get the total scoring. The player with the highest score wins the game&#10;&#10;",

Let&rsquo;s see how long you can keep the ball running on your favourite old pinball machine this time.&#10;&#10;If everything runs perfectly, you will start the nerve-wracking Multiball, or you gain an Extra Ball to play an additional round.&#10;&#10;Can you achieve a new High Score, or do you lose the balls faster than you are able to push the flippers?&#10;&#10;Freaky Frogs From Outaspace recreates the exciting experience of a real pinball machine as a card game. Try to keep playing as long as possible, relying both on skill and luck.&#10;&#10;This game can be unfair, exactly like a real pinball machine. Sometimes you lose a ball very fast without having any opportunities to aim on the targets: Bad luck!&#10;&#10;Do not give up if you initially only score 1000 points. From game to game you will get better. Score Bumpers, hit the Ramps, and possibly activate the Multiball... and you will get to scores of 100000+ points, as you score with a real pinball machine.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The bigger the risk taken, the bigger the potential reward.&#10;&#10;The first player to &quot;extinguish&quot; their hand by playing all 13 cards wins the round and earns the most points possible on their hotspot card.

Each pawn&rsquo;s move is governed by the colour of the square it moves away from (red = rook, yellow = bishop, green = knight, blue = king). For each game the board is constructed from four double-sided quarterboards, each of which can be placed either way up and any way round, yielding a total of over 24,000 different 8x8 boards. In the basic game your aim is to get two of your pawns to the opposite side without being captured. The same equipment can be used for playing a variety of other games with the same rules of movement and capture. Can you invent more?&#10;&#10;",

If the opponent does not block the attacker, one damage is dealt.&#10;&#10;When you deal 7 damage to your opponent, or your opponent runs out of cards, you win the game.&#10;&#10;Popular characters of various Final Fantasy video games appear in this game.&#10;&#10;",

There are also variations on the game to make it harder (like using the same letter for all five words) or to allow children to play against adults competitively with easier questions.&#10;&#10;2007 update: Now part of University Game's Bookcase Series.  The game has been updated to remove many of the esoteric categories (foreign words, spelling, authors of ______ descent).  It's now much more a test of pop culture trivial knowledge and there is no longer the option to select a category only.  One must now pick a Category and Topic (the term 'class' was removed).

One of which is the addition of transporting lumber&mdash;a huge export from the region&mdash;that can't be carried by E-trains, but by engineering the right 7-train route you can add a significant amount of revenue to your bottom line.&#10;&#10;Finally, one big departure from the '22 family is that 1822PNW does away with concessions and instead features a merger mechanic that more closely mirrors the way in which the major companies staked their claim in the PNW.&#10;&#10;All of the features combine for a refreshing and exciting take on the genre-defining 1822 series.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The differences between these three concern the timing of the outbreak of war and the resultant state of readiness of the respective forces. Due to the large number of optional rules, however, the players may in fact choose from a vast array of possible Campaign Game situations.&#10;&#10;Six smaller scenarios depict smaller areas of operations over briefer periods of time in the regions of Berlin, Vienna, The Baltic, Fulda, North German Plains, and the Main Front (Fulda + North German Plains).&#10;&#10;The game components: three 22&quot; x 35&quot; map sheets plus one 6&quot; x 8&quot; and one 10&quot; x 12&quot; map extensions, 2400 die-cut 1/2&quot; counters, one 32 page rules book, one 40 page Scenarios and Situation Briefing book, two identical 4 page Charts &amp; Tables folders, and one 17&quot; x 22&quot; Air Allocation Display.&#10;&#10;",

On a player's turn, he rolls the three colored dice and can make up to three moves accordingly, with the blue die moving a blue fighter, etc. Moving a fighter that has other fighters on top of him moves these other fighters as well.&#10;&#10;If, as a result of movement, his fighter (or stack of fighters) encounters an enemy, a fight between the two top cards in each stack occurs, the result of which is decided primarily by the color (via a rock-paper-scissors mechanism) and secondarily by the number (highest wins). If the boss wins a fight, its power is reduced by the enemy's power for the remainder of the current fight; if two fighters draw, they both retreat one step toward their own village, possibly precipitating other fights on the same turn. The fight continues until either pile is depleted.&#10;&#10;The first player to either defeat all of the opposing fighters or reach the end of the line (and clear out the opponent's fighters in his village) wins.&#10;&#10;",

A computer malfunction at the Bedlam Zoo has short-circuited the gates for all the enclosures and the animals are escaping and making their way to the zoo exit. You will work together with your fellow zookeepers to round up all the animals and lock their enclosures before it's too late.&#10;&#10;Zoo Break is a crisis-management game that requires dynamic and cooperative problem-solving. You will spend your turn deciding how to use limited actions to move about the board, collect and trade supplies, capture animals, and lock cages, all while evading injury and coping with other challenges caused by the animals marauding through the zoo. Escape and Move cards control the animals with maximum variability, leading to endlessly different game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Success hinges on the keepers' ability to anticipate, adapt, and make strategic decisions, applying their skills and resources to regain control of the zoo. It's complex and suspenseful enough to keep adults riveted, but also playful and inviting to ambitious, game-loving kids. (Difficulty can also be regulated using a simple card selection mechanism at the start of the game.)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once the crown jewel of Czarist Russia, Leningrad is now the second most important city in the Soviet Union. Its array of ordnance factories includes the massive Kirov Tank Works that turns out most of the heavy KV-1 and KV-2 production for the Soviet Army. Loss of Leningrad would deprive the Soviets of a major population and industrial center and give the Germans the advantage of position in any drive against Moscow from the northwest. &#10;Army Group North, short of Luftwaffe support and motorized forces, is the only army group that fails to achieve a significant encirclement at any stage of its campaign. Skillfully utilizing terrain and ruthlessly exploiting the civilian population, the Soviets construct a fortified line along the Luga River that stalls the Germans for a month until massive Luftwaffe and motorized reinforcements from Army Group Center allow a decisive breakthrough and dash for Leningrad itself. In a furious September battle, the Germans fall just short of taking Leningrad when time runs out. Operation Typhoon, the final push against Moscow, is imminent. Army Group North must give up almost all of its Luftwaffe and motorized formations. With no strike force remaining, the Germans dig in. Leningrad survives capture only to endure a brutal, epic 900 day siege.&#10;&#10;Can you, as the Axis commander, succeed where German High Command failed? As the Soviet commander, can you repeat history and halt the Axis invaders short of Leningrad?&#10;&#10;980 multi-colored die-cut counters. &#10;MAPS &#10;Five 22&quot;x34&quot; &amp; two 17&quot;x22&quot;full-color mapsheets &#10;OTHER One 10-sided die &#10;36-page Rule Book &#10;48-page Play Book &#10;Player Aid Cards: 11 two-sided Set-Up cards, Soviet Status card, Axis Status card, two 11x17 two-sided game chart cards, one card of additional charts and tables.&#10;&#10;Five 22x34 inch color mapsheets (with a reprint of Map C from Army Group Center), plus Maps A, B, L, and a full sheet devoted to the Leningrad inset map. &#10;Two 17x22 inch color mapsheets (front and back printed).

    "Description": "Once a year, all family members of the notorious Azzardo family meet in the warehouse of the &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; seafood restaurant to divide up the stolen goods according to an old family tradition. Everyone can try their luck, but only one will leave the meeting with a full suitcase. Who will prove to be the most skillful player in the hot-blooded game of gamblers, skillfully challenging luck and risk?&#10;&#10;At the start of each round in Family Inc., if you have face-up chips in front of you, you score them, advancing your counter on the score board, then removing those chips from the game. Next, you reveal one new chip after another from the middle of the table, placing them face up in front of you.&#10;&#10;After each new chip, you decide whether to reveal more chips or whether to end your turn. If you reveal a new chip during your turn that matches one of your face-up chips, your turn ends, collecting only a diamond in compensation if your turn ended after your second or third chip reveal. (If you collect a third diamond, return all your diamonds and score 50 points.) When you end your turn voluntarily, collect all face-up chips from in front of other players that match the values of your chips.&#10;&#10;When a player reaches the 100 space on the score track, the game ends and this player wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;This third printing of the award-winning initial game in GMT's GBACW series offers upgraded components and information throughout. If you own the original 1995 edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, or if you have the upgrade kit, you can continue playing those versions with no problems; those versions still stand the test of time quite well. In this Special 2004 Edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, we've done our best to improve and enhance the components and rules to this already classic game.&#10;&#10;Specifically:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The six countersheets contain all of the original and replacement counters from the first two versions of the game, as well as some new counters and units with modified unit strengths and morale levels based on recent research. Rodger MacGowan and Mark Simonitch have revised and upgraded the original counter graphics, and these counters are printed on the higher-quality stock you've come to expect from us in recent years.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Mark Simonitch has completely reworked the three game maps. He's used the original work and maps from Rick Barber and Joe Youst's first two versions as a base, and come up with another of his clean and elegant looks that makes these maps both nice to look at and easy to play on.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The GBACW 4.4 rules that appeared in Gringo! were a major step up for the series in terms of both rules streamlining and presentation. We have further edited those rules and released version 4.5 for this new edition of Three Days of Gettysburg.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Mark has streamlined and done new layouts on the game charts to give players the best mix yet of readability and utility in the least possible table space. We've also included some neat charts created by Mike Lemick that allow you to easily keep track of the status of each side's command and routed unit status..&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    As you'll note from the graphic above, Rodger has created a whole new game box for this new edition of the game. We think it's some of his best work ever, and hope you agree. The game box is the crowning piece of what is, for a Reprint Edition, about as close to a brand new game, component-wise, as we could get (which is why there is no Update Kit for this version - it would essentially be a whole new game). &#10;&#10;&#10;So, if your original copy is showing some wear and tear, or if you want an edition of this classic game in which the updated graphics and systems outshine the original (and that is saying a lot), or you simply missed purchasing the first edition of this best-selling game, then this Special 2004 Edition is for you! Enjoy!&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;&#10;     A revised Command System, using Maximum Effectiveness to portray the strengths and vicissitudes of battlefield command.&#10;     Seven scenarios, from microcosm 1-mappers to the full 3-day battle.&#10;     Brigadiers rated with Action Profiles so that, when on their own, you may never know exactly what they'll do! Will an aggressive Dick Garnett recklessly charge everyone in sight, seeking to regain lost honor? Will a cautious Stannard sit and watch? Or will an unreliable Iverson hit the bottle instead of the front line?&#10;     Artillery Barrage, simplified Ammo rules, special rules for green units, and an optional Fatigue Rule that really places an emphasis on careful unit usage.&#10;     A remarkably simple Shock Table that features Continuous Attack: you can roll up the enemy's flank in one massive charge. &#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    1 Scenario Booklet&#10;    1 Great Battles of the American Civil War Rules Booklet&#10;    6 Full-color Countersheets.&#10;    3 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;    1 Player Aid Card (11&quot; x 17&quot;)&#10;    1 Union AM Sheet&#10;    1 Confederate AM Sheet&#10;    1 Union Reinforcement Schedule&#10;    1 Confederate Reinforcement Schedule&#10;    1 Gettysburg Turn Track &amp; 2nd Disorder Card&#10;    1 Orders Chart/Terrain Effects Card&#10;    1 10-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;Designer: Richard H. Berg&#10;Developer: John Alsen&#10;&#10;&#10;(user's description:)&#10;&#10;The third edition, otherwise known as the &quot;2004 edition&quot; of this very popular tactical level simulation of the battle of Gettysburg.  The game spawned the &quot;Great Battles of the American Civil War&quot; series and is a direct descendant of the old SPI favorite, Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game.&#10;&#10;Components include three newly revised and beautiful maps by Mark Simonitch and Joe Youst (building on older work by Rick Barber and Joe Youst), 1680 counters including units and markers, some new charts, and ver. 4.5 of the GBACW rules.&#10;&#10;This edition attempts to bring a simplification to the complicated LOS procedures of the previous editions.  The counters have also been cleaned up and overall this edition has quite a bit of visual appeal.  This game is very complex but is a great simulation of ACW tactics.  However, the game also works with a slimmed down version of the GBACW system rules called &quot;Simple Great Battles of the ACW,&quot; the release of which coincided with the publishing of the game.  SGBACW brings the series to players who are do not have the inclination or time to master the relatively formidable GBACW ruleset.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Long ago, a vengeful god stole the stars from the night sky. To illuminate the night, hopeful people sent glowing paper lanterns floating toward the heavens. Out of nowhere, clever magical phoenixes appeared, soaring through the sky. As they flew from lantern to lantern, their enchanted touch changed the lanterns into new stars! The phoenix who can create a constellation of seven new stars will be the champion of a world looking for light!&#10;&#10;Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is a new entry in the classic Tsuro series. The game shares a bond with the foundations of the venerable original: play tiles, move pawns, and stay in play, but it introduces a revolutionary board that allows for the double-sided tiles to flip and rotate throughout the game, creating diverging paths and opening up new strategies.&#10;&#10;Featuring gorgeous phoenix miniatures, beautiful lantern tokens, and unique gameplay elements such as life tokens that allow your phoenix to be reborn from the ashes once per game, Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is a new chapter in the legacy of Tsuro!&#10;&#10;",

But watch out for Billy Goats--if you&rsquo;re not careful they will knock parts of your precious stolen cargo out of your boat!&#10;&#10;With so many goodies lying about on these islands, it feels like you&rsquo;ve died and gone to troll heaven, or perhaps someplace even better -- Trollhalla!&#10;&#10;Object&#10;Players take turns placing trolls on the board. Trolls emerge from below each ship&rsquo;s deck ready to plunder and scout the seas of Trollhalla! Trolls placed on ships claim plunder from nearby islands when a ship sails. Trolls placed in the sea will scout for destinations and determine where these ships sail, and also award players cards that perform special actions. The player who uses his trolls to fill his private boat with the most valuable collection of plunder wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

More than 700 British bombers are dispatched to the distant city of N&#194;&#129;&#194;&#129;&uuml;rnberg. As the bomber stream crawls across the German Reich, it is set upon by swarms of nightfighters. Following the bombers' contrails the figthers infiltrate the stream in great numbers and before the moon can set, they pick off bomber after bomber. The mauled stream makes a desultory attack on the target city, scattering much of their payload of high explosive and incendiaries harmlessly into the surrounding countryside. Then the raid struggles back towards England while fresh formations of nightfighters snap and bite at the retreating formation. More than ninety bombers fail to make it home safely. Soon afterward, the C-in-C of Bomber Command, Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, calls off the Battle of Berlin.&#10;&#10;BOMBER COMMAND is a game of the night war in the skies over the Reich in World War II.&#10;The game recreates the great RAF bombing raids against the heart of Germany and the defence of the German Luftwaffe's night fighter arm.&#10;&#10;Based on an air combat system derived from the award-winning Downtown and The Burning Blue 'raid-scale' games, Bomber Command details the tactics of night fighting.&#10;&#10;The German player must manage flak, Himmelbett zones, Wild Boar and Tame Boar tactics. RAF 'main force' raids are supported by Mosquito diversions, &quot;Gardening&quot; operations (mining of seaways) and decoy raids. Two card decks--one for each player--are used to resolve the complex interactions of electronic countermeasures and radars, along with other operational factors such as Mahmoud patrols, Flower raids, and Beleuchter illumination units. A detailed bombing resolution system depicts the difficulties of marking targets and area bombing at night.&#10;&#10;There are two scenarios:&#10;&#10;1. Berlin covers raiding from the 1943 Hamburg firestorm to the great Battle of Berlin and the RAF's defeat over Nuremburg in March 1944.&#10;&#10;2. Downfall recreates the period from the Summer of 1944 to the collapse of the Luftwaffe in the face of fuel shortages and the RAF's &quot;bomber support&quot; effort.&#10;&#10;The game is fast-playing and raids typically resolve in 2 hours or less.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Titan Race, each player is a rider astride a titan, racing on one of the many wild circuits of Neverworld. It's a short, brutal three laps as you jockey for position, ram your opponents, and leverage bonuses and your titan's abilities to race across the finish line!&#10;&#10;The game board is an infinite circuit that wraps around at opposite sides. Each circuit has specific features that allow for interesting tactical maneuvers. Movement is governed by drafting dice from a pool rolled at the beginning of each round. If you choose a die that matches the color of your titan, you regain a life point.&#10;&#10;When you ram into another titan by moving into the same space, you push that titan and deal them damage. There are also ways to lay traps on the circuit that will damage titans who encounter them. If you get KO'd due to taking too much damage, you'll spend a turn resetting right where you were knocked out, but you're not out of the race.&#10;&#10;Each titan has a special ability that can be activated once each round. Moving into certain bonus spaces on the circuit also grant players bonus cards that can be played for additional effects.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game scales are Column-Brigade-Division, with monthly turns. There are Corps HQs for the Nationalists and Army HQs for the Republic. There are one 22&quot; x 17&quot;map, and two &frac12;&quot; counter sheets including Nationalist, Republicans, Italian, French, German, Portuguese and British units. The sequence of play is quite classic: Mutual Administrative Phase (Events, replacements, reinforcements, withdrawals), Nationalist Movement-Combat, Republican Movement-Combat, Victory/Attrition Phase. Supply is checked for both sides at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;The main trouble designing this game was how to simulate the first months of the war and the transition to a more conventional conflict during and after the battles for Madrid (October 1936-March 1937). The main unit during the firsts stages of the war was the &quot;column&quot; formed by a mix of police, army, paramilitary forces, volunteers, etc. The &quot;column&quot; tactics was used during the Moroccan wars, and consisted in separating a force in small independent groups, highly mobile but with few possibilities of supporting each other. These tactics were mostly used by the Nationalists, but also by the Republicans. For the Nationalists, it worked against the militias of the early months of the war but failed against a better organized, armed and commanded army during the battles for Madrid. To simulate this, most early Republican units have two steps: the first would be the &quot;column&quot; or &quot;militia&quot; side, the second the &quot;Ej&eacute;rcito Popular&quot; (People&rsquo;s Army) side. After passing a &quot;Conversion&quot; or &quot;Militarization&quot; phase, the Republican columns are flipped to their EP side. The &quot;Militarization&quot; , that began during the Fall of 1936, was the conversion of the politically enthusiastic but poorly led and trained militia in more orthodox military units. The Nationalist columns are divided between &quot;Army of Africa&quot; columns and the rest. Their colonial units are two-steppers and are withdrawn and substituted by brigades and divisions during 1937. The O.B. of the first months of the war is also a problem. Between July and November 1936 both sides formed dozens of small military and paramilitary units, called &quot;battalions&quot;, &quot;columns&quot;, &quot;regiments&quot;, etc., etc. It is rare to find two authors that have the same OB, and the few that offer an Order of Battle are rather imprecise. Sometimes the same column receives different names. One author names it after their commander, other after their area of operations, and so on... so I had to compare and check which column was cited in most of the sources.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.&#10;&#10;General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.&#10;&#10;Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ELO Darkness is a complete customizable card game in which two players (or four in the team vs. team mode) fight against each other in an epic MOBA-inspired arena.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a 40-card deck representing a team of five heroes (divided into five different classes). Players can delve into the deck-building aspect of the game by customizing their own Team and play style. Heroes can be picked through an initial draft mode in which players alternate selecting among 30 different characters.&#10;&#10;The unique aspect of the game is the interaction with the board, which adds an interesting tactical aspect as well as a strong thematic feeling to the concept of the card duel.&#10; No dice are involved in the game. Randomness is limited to the draw and is mitigated by the Farming and Backing phases in which players can manage their hand and retreat from their position on the map in order to draw more cards from their deck.&#10;&#10;Hero cards can be used for multiple purposes: they can be played during combat or they can be discarded in order to gain Experience points and gold used to buy and upgrade powerful items during the game.&#10;&#10;Combat takes place every turn on each Lane and is determined by a simultaneous action selection mechanism and a back-and-forth phase in which players take actions like playing Gank cards or activating combos and special abilities.&#10;&#10;In addition, to increase tension during the match, there are also objectives (monster cards) that player can conquer through a simultaneous resource bidding occurring during specific turns.&#10;&#10;The final goal of the game is to invade the opponent's base on the map, destroying the enemy towers and breaking through one of the Lanes on the board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Napoleon&rsquo;s Last Gamble contains five battles from the Waterloo Campaign, which Napoleon began by seizing the central position between the Prussian and British Armies. On June 15th the Grande Arm&eacute;e was unleashed across the Sambre River. Allied screening forces sent out the warning to headquarters. The Allies executed a forward concentration behind the cover of their screens. As the 16th dawned, troops of both sides still converged on the battlefields.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Last Gamble is one of the games from OSG's Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) series. Details on the series are below, as all the games share a common rules set and game system.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;     Two 22x34&quot; maps &#10;     One 17x22&quot; map &#10;     560 die-cut counter units &#10;     100 playing cards &#10;     two rulebooks &#10;     15 Player aid cards &#10;     covered in a box &#10;&#10;&#10;BATTLES SIMULATED&#10;&#10;Quatre-Bras, Ney at the Crossroads, 16 June &#10;The French attacked on two fronts simultaneously.  The tenacious defense of Quatre Bras by the Anglo-Allied troops saved the Prussians from receiving the full weight of the Arm&eacute;e du Nord.&#10;&#10;Ligny, The Last Victory, 16 June &#10;Finally unleashed, the Guard pushed the Prussians back from the Ligny brook. Bl&uuml;cher himself was wounded and separated from headquarters. But Napoleon&rsquo;s hoped-for knock-out blow remained undelivered.&#10;&#10;Wavre, Grouchy&rsquo;s Blunder, 18 June &#10;Napoleon separated the two wings of his army, ordering Marshal Grouchy on the track of the Prussians while he pursued Wellington.  Grouchy&rsquo;s prescribed route was wide of the mark, and took him to the outer flank, allowing the Prussians to interpose themselves between the two French wings&mdash;Bl&uuml;cher achieved a strategic reversal of the opening.&#10;&#10;Waterloo, A Near Run Thing, 18 June &#10;While Grouchy frittered away time engaging the Prussian rear-guard at Wavre, Ney conducted the mid-phase of the battle like a rear-guard action in the Peninsular Campaign, failing to provide infantry support for his spectacular cavalry charges. Wellington fought a successful defensive battle, managing to cling to his ridge until the arrival of three Prussian corps. The broken French army retreated toward Charleroi; Grouchy&rsquo;s intact wing moved south-east toward Namur.&#10;&#10;La Souffel, Rapp&rsquo;s Last Stand, 28 June&#10;Three days after Waterloo, Rapp woke up and began a slow withdrawal from the Rhine, pursued by the vanguard of Schwarzenberg's Army. On June 26 the heavily-outnumbered Rapp skirmished with the Austrian III Corps. Two days later he made a stand along the Souffel River, and the Austrians attacked.&#10;&#10;DESCRIPTION&#10;&#10;Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: &#10;&#10;     480 meters per hex, &#10;     1 hour per turn, &#10;     400-800 men per strength point. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns.

    "Description": "On an icy lake, two clans of prehistoric men clash in a match of Kairn, better known as Caveman Curling, this being an ancestor to the modern sport of curling. Players compete as individuals or are grouped into two clans, and they try to land their stones the closest to a target each round. On a player's turn he takes two actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; He launches a stone across the ice, flicking it with his finger toward the target on the other end of the game board.&#10;&#10;&bull; To improve the positioning of his stone or the chances of it staying in place, he can choose to use either a small or large hammer or a totem. With a hammer, the player moves the stone according to the size of the hammer. As for the totem, the player sets it on top of the stone; if the totem falls off the stone, the player can shoot it again on a later turn.&#10;&#10;If your player or clan has one or more stones closer to the center of the target than the other clan, you score points. The first player/clan to collect six points wins.&#10;&#10;A note about the different editions.&#10;&#10;Caveman Curling (2012)&#10;Kairn (2010)&#10;&#10;There are significant production differences between Kairn and Caveman Curling, though the game play is almost identical between the two versions. Kairn (200 copies) was designed and self-published by Daniel Quodbach in 2010. Blackrock Editions and Scorpion Masque produced 1000 copies of Kairn and released it at Essen in 2011. Gryphon Games version of the game has yet to be produced, pending the conclusion of a current Kickstarter campaign that was organized to gauge demand for its version. Caveman Curling is scheduled for mass production in January, 2012, and to be released in late February, 2012. The first and only production copy of the Gryphon version will arrive in the US on December 14, 2011 and a video will be made showing the differences between Kairn and Caveman Curling.&#10;&#10;",

During the action phase players take turns to remove workers from these jobs to perform a large variety of actions to help propel them to victory.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most influence points at the end of the game, influence points can be gained via many different strategies, such as helping to build giant megastructures, influencing the upcoming election and building outposts across the solar system. Play continues until one player has built all of their 15 unique outposts tokens which triggers the election phase and end game scoring.&#10;&#10;Solar 175 has an innovative end game scoring system which changes based on how the players interact with the game-world. &#10;This creates unique winning conditions in each game making each one feel fresh and distinctive.  The legacy campaign contains dozens of hours of content with engaging narrative and multiple endings. Once complete, the game is fully replayable and the game-world continues to expand and evolve endlessly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Eleusis (and later New Eleusis, 1976) is a card game that simulates the scientific method in action.  You need two packs of cards, a table and some paper and pencil to play.  The 4-8 player range works best.&#10;&#10;One player (&quot;God&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; or the &quot;Demiurge&quot;) thinks up a rule (a &quot;law of nature&quot;) that governs the correct play of the cards.  Usually, the rule only involves the most recently correctly-played card, but it can be more complex.&#10;&#10;The other players (&quot;Scientists&quot;) take turns playing cards (&quot;performing experiments&quot;) and race one another to see who can come up with a good hypothesis about the rule.  The first player to correctly deduce the rule scores big; God also scores based on how long it took for the players to figure the rule out.  God should not choose a rule that is so hard to find out that nobody does, because then he doesn't score.&#10;&#10;Additionally, a player with an hypothesis can declare himself to be a &quot;prophet&quot; who can predict the results of the other player's experiments.  Other players can then try to bring about the overthrow of the prophet by trying to find experiments whose results cannot be predicted (falsification), thus gaining a chance to become prophet themselves.&#10;&#10;A very simple rule would be &quot;Alternate between black and red cards&quot;.  A simple but hard to discover rule would be &quot;Alternate between cards which have closed loops in their number or letter designations (e.g. 4, Q), and cards which don't (e.g. 2, K)&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game was first published in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column in June 1959. A revised version appeared in Gardner's October 1977 Scientific American column.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your small island is peaceful and prosperous &ndash; so prosperous that your tribe has grown beyond its ability to sustain you! Fortunately, being a peaceful people you have chosen not to fight over what little there is. Instead, you set out in your seagoing Wa&rsquo;a (canoe) to fish and gather crops from the many nearby islands. The fertility goddess Haumea has blessed these islands, and they are rich with fruits, vegetables, and spices. It is a matter of pride to collect the finest harvest for the village. Can you win the race against time and the sea, and prove that you are the best gatherer of all?&#10;&#10;In Tahiti the goal is to collect crops (coconuts, taro, bananas, spice) and fish from the surrounding islands to score points with bonuses for making full sets and acquiring the most of their family favorites which are hidden from the other players.&#10;&#10;The game starts off with just your home island and its immediate neighboring islands. Players build up the archipelago of fertile islands with the guidance of Haumea for the first part of the game until all islands are in play. Players seed the islands each turn giving them some control over where crops replenish. Once the archipelago is formed, the late season is triggered when crops start becoming scarce, with players occasionally stopping an island from producing altogether. Although the late season may not be as good for crops, fishing becomes easier with bonuses given to the waters around some of the islands.&#10; During all this the players travel by Wa&rsquo;a from island to island using action points to collect the crops they want or can get to before the others take them. As the Wa&rsquo;a fills, it becomes slower limiting the number of actions they have. There are also treacherous reefs around the islands that require you go around them or risk losing some of the crops aboard your Wa&rsquo;a. At the end of the year, the one who most efficiently gathers food for their family wins.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is for the players to work together to get the three animals to the safety of the tree.&#10;&#10;All the animals move based on the roll of two dice, each containing three black pips and three green pips.  A black pip moves Max one space, while green pips can be distributed by player consensus (teaches logic, consultation and decision making) among the other animals to move them.  Max moves more often and further than the other creatures who share the green pip rolls.  The players can opt to move their animals before or after Max; they may also use four cat treats to call Max back to the starting position, allowing the other animals to escape possible capture or lengthen their lead.&#10;&#10;Each animal has their own special short cut on the game board to speed their journey or dart from Max; if they end a turn on their shortcut start space, they may immediately move to the other end; if they overshoot the entrance, they miss it.  However if Max ends a turn on any short-cut entrance, he takes it immediately (but will not eat any animal on the shortcut start.  Max can end up between or even ahead of the other animals as they advance down the path together.  When Max reaches the base of the tree, he camps out and can't be returned to the start with a cat treat.  The other animals will have to risk a final leap on and off Max's back to get to safety.  The players all win or lose depending on how successful they are at saving the bird, mouse and chipmunk from Max.&#10;&#10;",

Along the way, the alien lifeform will ruthlessly attempt to stop the crew from carrying out this plan.&#10;&#10;The crew and alien lifeform both have a unique deck of cards, and each card has symbols on it to indicate possible actions. The alien can move around the starship, attack, cocoon, activate a malfunctioning android, sabotage equipment and the vessel's wiring, scurry into vents, and more; while the starship crew can fire flamethrowers, search, move or run, protect themselves with shock-prods, hide, shut security doors, and other actions.&#10;&#10;Lifeform is a standalone, dice-less game that tells of twelve commercial astronauts working on a battered mining starship, far away in space and time, who encounter an awesome galactic horror. Featuring an innovative self-destruct game mechanism, and alternate playable endings, depending on crew success, Lifeform presents a tense, suspenseful adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;",

Too bad this is not today's reality...&#10;&#10;In this Utopian society, we all will work much less. Our robots can do nearly everything already. There is no need for great envy. It is simply about equality, justice, and the fair allocation of the complete and still necessary work, which then gives us ALL more leisure time.&#10;&#10;Success means we will have time for the activities we like the most: fishing, farming, fencing, flying, ..., as well as gaming, building, painting, traveling, composing, and more. If somebody wants to work more than needed, they should do that. This is about the freedom! So let us rethink this: joblessness is not a disgrace, it is the new goal!&#10;&#10;We are members of a team striving to realize this utopian ideal. We try to develop completely self-sustaining homes that function as efficiently as possible. They must generate enough food and energy to allow the residents the greatest possible freedom (thus, leisure time). The more people in our development who no longer need to work, the closer we are to reaching our goal! The player who builds the best development will win the game, and their development will become reality!&#10;&#10;Futuropia is a luck-free economic game. To ensure you always encounter new challenges, we offer multiple game set-up variations, which create a variety of gameplay situations, ensuring new experiences and replayability. The solo game offers you an option to learn the mechanisms and processes of Futuropia before you play it with other players. See our hopeful future in...Futuropia!&#10;&#10;",

Since its original release, Gulf Strike has shown its ability to simulate the changing character of the Gulf Wars from the Iran-Iraq war to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and its potential aftermath. In fact the original 1983 edition correctly anticipated the type and character of units the United States would send to the region in the event of a crisis. Seven complete scenarios cover the recent history of the region, plus the current Desert Shield operation, and portray the multitude of alliances possible to counter threats arising in numerous quarters. Complete air, land, and sea orders of battle for several dozen nations allow you to fight each conflict to its unpredictable and often startling conclusion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There are many different versions of Rummy. Rummy 500 is the most commonly played form of Rummy. Rummy 500 is a standard deck playing card game using 52 cards.  It is one of the most popular family card games, and has a simple premise.  Players are dealt a hand of cards, with the goal being to rid yourself of all the cards in your hand.  You can do this by playing cards to the table, in groups of three, either in sets (groups of cards with the same value from different suits) or in runs (three or more consecutive cards for one suit).  Once a person lays down a group of cards, other players -- including the player who played the original set -- can now &quot;lay off&quot; cards to that group.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they can take the top face down card from the stock, or take the top face up card from the discard pile.  After melding, laying off, or making no plays on the table, a player must discard a card face up on the discard pile. The discard pile is spread out, so that the value of all cards is visible.  If you see a card that you can use, you may take it, but you must also take all the cards that have been discarded on top of it, and you must play the lowest (physical) card in the deck as soon as you pick it up. If you only take the top card of the discard pile, you do not have to meld it immediately. (Variant: No wait, actually you do.)&#10;&#10;The hand ends as soon as one player discards her last remaining card (going out). Cards on the table are worth positive points, and cards left in your hand are worth negative points.  Numbered cards from 2-10 are worth their pip value (Variant: 2-9 are worth 5); face-cards are worth 10 points; aces are worth 15 points, unless used in an A-2-3 run; jokers are worth 15 points. (Variant: All players add up the pip values of the cards in their hands, and those points are given to the player who went out.) A player who goes out without previously laying down any cards goes &quot;rummy,&quot; and scores double the points. Normally, games are played to 500 points, but players can opt to play to fewer points, or play a specific number of rounds.&#10;&#10;When playing with 2, both players get 13 cards.  When playing with 3 or 4, each player gets 7 cards.  When playing with 5 or 6 players, each player receives 6 cards.&#10;&#10;There are many other variations of the game.  Early versions of Rummy were often played with a 44-card deck, Ace through 11 in four suits.  In the 2-player version players are dealt 8 cards, with 3 or more players, the hand size is 6 cards.&#10;&#10;One such variation, Romm&#195;&#169;, played in Germany, requires that a player cannot start laying any cards down at all, until they have broken in with a lay down valued at 40 points or more (the exception being if you can play all of the 13 cards in your hand in one go).  In the German variant, each face card is 10, number cards are worth their shown number, aces are worth 11 (if used after the king or as a set) or 1 if used as a 1 in front of a 2 in a sequence.  Jokers are the value of the card they are representing.  This German rummy variant is also played with 2x52 cards + 6(or 4) jokers - for a 110 card deck.  Another difference from American Rummy is that one can only pick up the top discard, from a single growing discard pile - never a larger part of a spread out discard deck. Rather than scoring points based on what you have laid down in front of you, the winner (first person out), gets zero, and every other player adds up the cards remaining in their hands and takes that much in points (adding up the deadwood)  Here the player that finished has no deadwood.  When someone reaches 500 (or agreed to goal) the game ends and the player with the lowest score (least penalty points) wins.  Because of this 'breaking through with 40+' rule, this game is a bit more difficult and closer to Gin Rummy.&#10;&#10;Pagat.com considers the overlapping discard pile, from which a player can take any card plus all cards above it in the pile, to be the feature distinguishing Rummy 500 from basic Rummy. However, numerous other optional rules for each variant are also listed, some of which could be considered to be equally significant, and there is no consensus across the web as to what defines one or the other.&#10;&#10;",

If a Biplane is shot down, the game ends immediately and the surviving player is declared the winner! If the third round ends and neither Biplane has been shot down, the player who has taken fewer hits is the winner.&#10;&#10;Both players choose a tile to play from behind their player screens and simultaneously reveal them. Each player then moves their Biplane the number of spaces equal to the value of the tile played, which may also have &quot;hit&quot; icons. The game features nine Biplanes, and they have different tile distributions. Several scenarios are also included.&#10;&#10;The Biplanes must follow the direction of the arrows around the white path (except when Looping the Loop). Each circle counts as one space and the colors on some spaces affect shooting. Biplanes may move past one another and even finish in the same space, but be careful -- one wrong move and your enemy will loop behind you and blast away!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game last three rounds, with players scoring points at the end of each round.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players reveal a communal task card, which is added to any other task cards in play. If a player creates the shapes depicted or create colored groups of the appropriate size, she'll gain or lose points as shown on the task card(s). Each player then randomly determines a different starting tile for the round and places it on her board. Then the building cards are revealed one at a time, and all players take the tile shown and add it to their board by placing it in the top row of their row, then letting it slide down into place among the other tiles. This continues until all tiles have been placed.&#10;&#10;Players then score (or lose) points for the round, and the player with the highest score after three rounds wins! Players can complete an optional fourth round, if desired, and the rules also contain scoring targets for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;",
