At the start of each round, players bid for resources, which include polyomino tiles, domes, landing pads, and science stations. After players reveal their bids, the players place (draw) the resources onto their sheets, trying to accomplish various things, such as having multiple items of the same type in a row or column.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, players score based on the development of their colonies.&#10;&#10;",

This is done by journeying through the eight unique biomes of the Overlands, Underlands, and Oceans of the world of Vrahode.&#10;&#10;Dice-based combat is enhanced by powerful skill deck building and racial abilities unique to each race. Every enemy encounter is different, with the enemy behavior deck threatening to change how the heroes must fight them each battle!&#10;&#10;The world of Vrahode is based on a narrative first imagined in 1990 by designer Jeffrey Irving. The Vrahode series of games includes a introductory game Vrahode - Age of Prophecy and three additional expansions: The Enlightened &amp; The Enslaved, Facing The Storm, and The False Gods' Deceit. All are part of the Vrahode Game System which invites players to generate their own content, adding to the expanding lore of Vrahode! This game is compatible with our proprietary 3D terrain system called Harbinger, players can create dynamic, multi-level dungeons up to five levels deep.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You need something to represent your forces. Model kits or LEGO are what I recommend. You will also need two sets of polyhedral dice and some paper for your character sheets. Last but not least: you will need a flat surface to play on. I also would recommend some books to use as terrain.&#10;&#10;The game is won when you destroy or demobilize the opposing player's carrier or they do the same to yours.&#10;&#10;In the future, I hope to introduce solo play and a campaign but for now let&rsquo;s get to the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Since then, the sword has disappeared and reappeared many times over the years and it has determined the destiny of all nations time and time again.&#10;Recently, the legendary Scarlet Sword was rediscovered, causing the most powerful leaders in all the land to seek out an ally and once again prepare for war.&#10;&#10;In Allies, you will create and control a fantasy army by uniting two different factions of your choice. You can either use your cards to command your troops or deploy them onto the battlefield. The unique abilities of each faction can be combined to create many different synergies, so choose wisely.&#10;&#10;Allies is a competitive two-player card game in which every move matters. It includes tactical and strategic components. Prepare your strategies well and don&rsquo;t get distracted! Remember that your plans need to change constantly to anticipate your enemies&rsquo; movements as well as to disrupt them.&#10;&#10;In the end, the army that gains control of the battlefield first claims victory!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Are you one of those people who see other people at first? Put it to the test!&#10;&#10;In the Likes card game you will be able to see first-hand that people are never known as well as we like to believe. Try to guess the tastes and hobbies of other people through the images on the cards. At first everything will depend on your intuition, but little by little all people will become an open book for you. Of course the feeling will be reciprocal.&#10;&#10;Likes is fun while we get to know each other!&#10;&#10;",

The Skinchanger Unit Attachment can be placed in any unit, ignoring usual Unit Attachment rules (so they can join a unit with another attachment already in it). When being added, the player can also add their animal unit to the table. When the Skinchanger&rsquo;s unit activates, the accompanying animal can activate immediately afterward, creating perfect &ldquo;one-two punch&rdquo; combinations. Just be sure that the two are never further than Long Range from one-another, or the Skinchanger is killed. Either situation will cause the animal to also be destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

If he picks the wrong card, he places it face up with his other cards. The player to his left then takes a turn. If the pile you pick from gets used up, play continues. Each player, in turn, must play the right card if he has it, or, pass if he does not have it. The first one to play all of his cards is the Game Winner.

This gives the deck a total of 340 points; the goal of the game is to divide the deck into 10 stacks of 34 points each.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game the player deals a row of three cards and a row of four cards. They then find any subset of those seven cards that total exactly 34, set them aside, and deal cards to fill the empty slots.&#10;&#10;If there is no way to make 34, the player chooses one of the two rows of cards to set aside and deals a new row. They can bring the set-aside row back in later by completely emptying the row of matching size. Several rows can be set aside at any given time.&#10;&#10;",

Your pet stays out on your player mat, ready to compete using its Beauty, Brains, and Brawn stats! Each turn, draw 5 cards from your deck.

By pairing cards of the same element, you can activate even better abilities and add extra pets to your game board to help win competitions. After buying cards, placing pets on your mat, activating abilities, or any combination of those things, place your hand in the discard pile, and draw a new hand.  As the game progresses, your deck will grow more and more powerful!&#10;&#10;Once the pets on your player mat, with the assistance of any cards in your hand that turn, have enough Beauty, Brains, and Brawn, go claim your prize! Each trophy has a unique combination of statistics required to claim, and once you've claimed a prize no one else can claim the same one. Trophies also give you victory points to win the game.  But be careful.  Once your pets win a trophy, they retire and you will need to purchase new ones for the next competition.&#10;&#10;Play until all the competitions are claimed, then add up victory points from your trophies.

Do you have the goblin grit to pillage your way to victory and emerge from the town with the most fireworks?&#10;&#10;The game is played over a number of rounds. Each round, every goblin takes a turn pulling a loot token from the town's treasure pile. These tokens might represent useful tools or valuable treasure like fireworks, dogslicers (goblin knives), or shields. Unfortunately, the tribe's most fearsome beast, a pig called Squealy Nord, is also hiding in the treasure, bringing mayhem and chaos to any who draw his token from the pile. You never know what you might get.&#10;&#10;Fighty goblins can choose dogslicers and just steal from their neighbors instead of raiding the village. Smart goblins will take some shields to defend themselves from their peers. Crafty goblins with leadership qualities may choose instead to take the badge of leadership, the Pickle Token, signifying for all their prominence and importance as well as the right to pick first next time.&#10;&#10;After 10 rounds and one last free for all opportunity to steal from each other on the way back home, one goblin is declared the &quot;bestest goblin of the raid&quot; and basks in glory and the admiration of their peers.
