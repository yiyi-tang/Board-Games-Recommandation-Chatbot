    "Description": "&quot;Proch i Stal&quot; (Gunpowder and Steel) is a cooperative board game based on events that took place in 1771-1772 in and around a benedictine monastery located near Cracow (Tyniec). A group of confederates (rebelling against Russian influence in Poland) gained control of the monastery and turned it into fortress. Attacked both by Russian armies they managed to hold Tyniec and to organize numerous attacks on nearby areas. Probably the most amazing of those is conquest of Wawel castle (confederates managed to enter it via old sewer tunnel and took its Russian garrison by surprise).&#10;&#10;In the game players take on the roles of officers of confederate forces. Their task is to hold the fortress for specified number of turns (based on difficulty level). They need to organize food for soldiers, support the garrison of Wawel castle, try to keep decent morale among the confederates and most of all prevent casualties among their units. If at any point during the game Tyniec will be left without units to defend it the fortress falls and players loose. Cooperation, planing and a bit of luck is what it takes to win the game.&#10;&#10;Player's turn consist of two things. First you draw an event card that will have two effects - one it will control the movement of the Russian forces (reinforcements, advance or press attack on Wawel), second will be actual positive or negative event (that often will give a players choice whether to accept consequences like loosing units, food, morale or discard action cards as a group). Next the player will have a chance to act by playing action card - actions include organizing reinforcement for Wawel, bringing food to the fortress, fighting with Russian units etc. After 4 players turns an upkeep phase occurs - food is needed for soldiers, moral is checked and Russians forces strom the Tyniec.&#10;&#10;",

Each player represents a character from that comic.&#10;On your turn, you roll the dice and move that number of spaces. The space you land is either blank (and the next player takes his turn); it on contains an event (like miss one turn, roll the die and move that more spaces, pay a fine, etc.); or it contains a color and a symbol. In the latter case, the player consults his character booklet and looks up the page with the corresponding color and symbol. A short story there is read and and the player has to decide what to do next: the booklet gives two or more choices and each choice corresponds to a numbered paragraph in the rule book, which is looked up and carried out. &#10;These paragraphs are the heart of the game and the key to victory. The rule book also suggests that you read the comic book to understand the game and the story better.&#10;&#10;",

This is a game of strategy, luck and a bit of deception. Players must strategically blend honesty with deception when making bets for each hand as each player is at risk to lose their dice during game play. Ultimately, the dice, once revealed, will decide the winner.&#10;&#10;The Deception Dice cubes get rolled into the &quot;pit&quot; to set the format of play for each hand. The red DD cube defines the number of dice at risk to the loser of the hand (i.e. 1 die or 2 dice). The green DD cube establishes the format of play (i.e. NL - No Look hand, R - reverse direction, Star - extra wild in play, etc.). The red DD indicator is bad luck (roller loses a die) and the green DD indicator is good luck (roller gets to return a previously lost die to their hand). Rolling double DD's has a special consequence! All players shake their colored dice in their shaker cup and throw down keeping their dice concealed from the others. Ones are wild and a player's turn requires a bet to be made which is based upon all the dice in play. Bets will continue to be increased until a player challenges another players bet. Once the dice get revealed, the bettor or caller will lose dice.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player with at least a single die. Wagering can be incorporated into the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Colorado Smith and the Sacred Temple is a tongue-in-cheek boardgame adaptation of popular pulp adventure movies like Indiana Jones. An evil priest wants to sacrifice a virgin priestess of the forces of Light to his deity (some unspeakable horror with tentacles of course). Just like in the movies, the players reach the ceremonial altar just in time to prevent the sacrifice, but each of them has different goals.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with three or six players (in which case there are two of each character). The game characters are an adventurer, whose first objective is to steal the jewels embedded in the idols and his second to rescue the princess, an avenger (whose first goal is to kill the priest, then to steal the jewels) and the father of the priestess (whose goal is to save his daughter, then to kill the priest). Each character gains victory points according to his goals, the player with the most victory points win. Each character also has different stats and equipment.&#10;&#10;During a game turn, the priest is moved on the board, then players move and fight, then if a player's character or a dead body is in the line of sight of the priest or a cultist, the player roll a die and consult a table indicating what happens (the cultists may move or shoot arrows, the priest may try to possess one of the characters for one more turns).&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the characters are either dead or have left the board.&#10;&#10;The game was published in Casus Belli magazine issue #23: Casus Belli (Issue 23 - Dec 1984)&#10;&#10;",

Each player must destroy the opposing cities' generators while protecting her own.&#10;&#10;The game uses a standard card deck. Each turn, players move their forces on the board, then attack enemy territory. Combat strength is computed by adding the number of fighting pieces, the point value of a random card and another card from the the player's hand; highest combat strength wins and can occupy the defender's position, the defender withdraws to an adjacent position, or is eliminated if retreat is impossible. If a player has a pair in her hand, she can play it to gain additional advantages (for example a pair of threes allow a player to take control of an opponent piece for this combat).&#10;&#10;The game was published in Casus Belli magazine, issue #24: Casus Belli (Issue 24 - Feb 1985)&#10;&#10;",

To set up the game, 22 magic ingredient tiles that show mushrooms, spiders, frogs and the assistants themselves are shuffled, placed into two even stacks, then covered with a &quot;book&quot; cover.&#10;&#10;To start the first round, the book cover is &quot;opened&quot; so that four ingredient tiles are revealed (the &quot;recipe&quot;). Players then race to assemble their cauldrons and place them on their fireplaces; after doing so, they then rotate the fireplaces and mark the locations from which they can see the ingredients needed to complete the potion. The cauldrons tiles have mirrors on half of them, so a mushroom on one tile might be reflected in the mirror, thus giving a player two mushrooms for a potion. Similarly, a half mushroom can be made whole with a mirror.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he has marked exactly the number and type of ingredients he needs, he ends the round. If he created the potion correctly, he moves his pawn two spaces on the track; otherwise everyone else advances one space on the track. Players then disassemble their cauldrons, flip over two ingredients tiles (thereby showing a new recipe), and start the next round.&#10;&#10;If an assistant shows up on an ingredient tile, that player advances two spaces after cooking ends that round. At a certain point in the game, a mouse comes to aide the player in last place, providing all the mushrooms that player needs.&#10;&#10;Der verflixte Zaubertrank ends when all recipes have been used or a player reaches the final space on the track. The player who advances the farthest on the track wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

In WTNW players take the reins of generals and command massive armies of steam driven behemoths.  In the end, the thunder that cascades across the battlefield to settle in the souls of the fighting men will only be assuaged with the assistance of the landship.&#10;&#10;When the Navy Walked is the first in a series of books that will outline the story and history behind this alternate Earth, its culture and the rules for fighting massive battles.  In future supplements players will have the opportunity to play through various alternate historical scenarios, including the colonization of Africa and the deep, dark folds of the Aether.  So grab your goggles and your Aethertech and get ready for a good time filled with steam and adventure!&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player places one of their tokens on a free space on the game board. When all spaces have been occupied, it's time to check the effects of each token on the opponent's neighboring tokens. The square tokens work horizontally and vertically whereas the round tokens work diagonally. A token is considered conquered if the score of the pieces surrounding it is higher than its own value. It is then turned onto its black framed side. The winner is the player with the most points (i.e., a higher difference between the points of the pieces they conquered and the points of your pieces conquered by the opponent).&#10;&#10;Originally published in spielbox 1991 #6.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is given two each of the $500s, $100s and $50s; six of the $20s; five each of the $10s, $5s and $1s.  During the game the bank cannot go broke.

If the bank runs out of customers, no more can be obtained until some are sold back to the bank.&#10;&#10;To Win the game, a player has to be the only player not to declare personal bankruptcy.  When a player owes more money than he can raise by selling customers and bankrupting his businesses, he is out of the game.  Any bankrupt businesses a play has, goes to the persona or bank that he owes money to.  The player who receives the bankrupt businesses immediately has to pay the bankruptcy charge plus 10% for any business he wants to own.  If he does not pay the charges, the business goes back to the bank to be sold to anyone who lands on the square.  Players may trade and sell businesses between themselves.&#10;&#10;",

Fighting had broken out early that morning. Meade had shifted the assorted corps of the Army of the Potomac northward to that town. General Reynolds was reported down. Hancock had the field in hand (he hoped) and Meade was now moving his headquarters to that fateful field. In the few days since being thrust into command of the Army of the Potomac, Meade had gained full control and would now direct it toward what was to be its single most important battle.&#10;&#10;Turning back R.E. Lee's second invasion of the North, Meade would end the Southern general's significant offensive capabilities. For the North. it was the beginning of the march which would eventually win the war.&quot;&#10;&#10;Scale&#10;Each hex on the game map equals 200 yards of real terrain. Each day-time turn represents 30 minutes, each night turn one hour. The vertical scale between contours is 30 feet.&#10;Infantry and cavalry units are brigades, artillery units usually 16 gun battalions. A strength point of infantry or cavalry is 100 men. A gun point of artillery is roughly 3 cannons.[...]&#10;&#10;Orders&#10;Orders are the heart of the main command system of this game series. Players prepare orders in writing as instructions to the corps (generally) as to what they are to do. An order is not a hex by hex record of movement. It is the actual wording in the same form as the historical orders.&quot;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Thunder at the Crossroads: The Battle of Gettysburg, July 1-3, 1863  (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Irish Wolf is a betting card game for 3 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 25 cards (5 each in five different colors and values from 1 to 5) showing a figure of a greyhound, 25 tokens (5 each in five different colors), and chips (e.g., 20 of value 1 and 20 of value 5). The game is about racing with greyhounds and its progress can be influenced by the cards each player plays. To begin, the cards are shuffled and distributed to all players. The remaining cards are placed on the matching color group, causing the greyhound of this color to take the lead in the race. Thereafter, all players play a card from their hand and the greyhounds then move forward according to the number on the respective cards. Players use their tokens to wager on a greyhound of their choice. The game ends when no tokens remain of one color. Players receive chips according to their tokens of the same color as the winning dogs. The player with the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;Originally published in spielbox 1992 #1.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is an Expansion for Death Ride Kursk - Gross Deutschland.  Ownership of DRK-GD is required in order to play this game.  This will be the second in the series of games that simulate the battle to eliminate the Kursk Salient.  This game is an expansion game and players must own DRK-GD in order to play this game.  The 3rd Panzer Division held the left flank of XLVIII Panzer Korps and plays a major role in the crossing of the Pena River and keeping the pressure off the Gross Deutschland Divisions left flank so they can push north to Oboyan and Kursk.   This game expands the order of battle by 1 Panzer and 1 Infantry Division, 1 Tank Corps, and a Rifle Division.  Most of the maps from DRK-GD are reused in this game and an additional (4) 11&quot; x 17&quot; map sections are added along with about 500 additional unit counters and markers.&#10;&#10;Death Ride Kursk - 3rd Panzer is GSI's second offering on the Eastern Front. The game focuses on tactical level combat and maneuver during the German attack at Kursk in July 1943.&#10;&#10;The game features the 3rd Panzer Division and some supporting XLVIII Panzer Corps units at mostly Platoon and some Company/Battery level and the Red Army (10th Tank Corps, and other rifle and supporting elements) at Company/Battery level. The combat system utilizes combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. Each hex is 330 meters.  Turns are 2 hours long during the day and 4 hours at night.   The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.  Unlike other games at this level the rules are not massive.  This system features extensive use of obstacles (mines, wire, improved positions, and fortifications), a patrol rule, overwatch fire, air and artillery support, and reserve movement.  These obstacles help channel the attack and force the Germans into kill sacks and forcing them to push through the heavy resistance to take ground.  Overwatch is a type of fire that allows the player to move a short distance and then setup to fire suppressive fire at enemy units that might otherwise use opportunity fire.  Reserve movement will allow a player to respond to enemy movement and move more units into a hex to strengthen it before an assault.  Units are modeled to represent the 2 major types of weapons that most units have.  Secondary (usually small arms) and a primary (main gun, machine guns, etc...).  These weapons may fire at different targets if they want.  They also effect targets differently.   Suppression is also handled uniquely in this game.  Units that are suppressed get a defense bonus since they take better advantage of the terrain in the hex, while at the same time they have their other factors reduced.  Units are also modeled as needing transports and get the benefits of movement from them with the vulnerability that goes with it.  The battle follows the divisions actions during the 10 days of the battle.   The division operated on the left flank of the Gross Deutschland Division.   The additional armor in this game makes play extremely fun and intense and they include Panzer Regiment 6 (90 MkIII and IV tanks) and 10th Tank Corps 3 Tank Brigades (120 T34 and 60 T70 tanks).  3rd Panzer has its 2 Infantry Regiments and supporting elements.  The game will also force players to account for Command and Control and Supply.   Maintenance and repair are critical to both sides as this determines most of the replacements that arrive every morning.  Troop replacements are generated by returning casualties to the battle.  Lots of these casualties are minor in nature and both sides worked hard to get these wounded back to the front quickly.  Air-Ground Attack can have a significant effect on the battle and both sides have a capability in the air to affect the battle.  The Germans were eventually bled white and forced to suspend Citadel.&#10;&#10;This 3rd Panzer division game fits into the DRK-GD game framework by being primarily a reinforcement in that game and replacing the 3rd Panzer battalion counters that simply fill the void and help cover the extended left flank of GD.&#10;&#10;3rd Panzer - comes with (in Full Color):&#10;&#10;        (4) Map Sections of the Pena River Area of Operations (maps A1 to A4)&#10;        Supplemental Rules Specific to 3rd Panzer&#10;        Order of Battle Cards&#10;        Task Organization Charts for Each Major German and Red Army Formation&#10;        Approximately 1800 Unit Counters and Markers&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This is important as any player may contest a players bankroll at any time in the game and if it is found to be faulty that player suffers a punishment. Once all players have their bankroll play beings and each player rolls a die to move the indicated number of spaces and take the actions on the space on which they land.&#10;A player wins when they achieve &quot;Nirvanna&quot; which can be achieved by a number of different means as they pass the 9th street bridge space.&#10;&#10;",

After all players have written this word, the next player says his word and the game proceeds in this way. If a player is unable to write a next word, he is out of the game. The aim of the game is writing the words in such a way, trying to have the fewest empty fields. Naturally, the words will have no sense after the empty fields have been filled.&#10;&#10;",

The 52 card deck showcases some of the new cards available.&#10;&#10;Rhythm Deck Contents&#10;The MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck includes playing cards based around music notation as the basis for games and activities. The deck includes cards for a range of notes &ndash;quavers, crotchets, semibreves and minims; dotted crotchets and dotted semibreves; along with doublet and triplet crotchets and doublet, triplet and quadruplet quavers. It also includes the corresponding rests for quaver, crotchet, semibreve and minim.&#10;&#10;The card designs differ from the earlier decks. As the cards focus upon elements of rhythm, the notes are depicted on a plain background without staff lines. This allows players to visually focus upon the individual note values rather than positioning against the staff to discern the pitch of the notes.&#10;&#10;Games&#10;The MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck provides a set of cards only. The cards may be used with the games from the MelodieXpress Note Reading and Composing Music packs. &lsquo;Snap&rsquo;, &lsquo;Memory&rsquo;, &lsquo;Rows&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rhythm Lunch&rsquo; all work well with this deck &ndash; though the players focus upon matching the note duration rather than its pitch.&#10;&#10;Next Steps&#10;This deck provides fans with an early look at some of the cards which will be used in the upcoming MelodieXpress Rhythm Pack. This will include a further 150+ cards which can be integrated with this Rhythm Deck, along with a 16 page game guide.&#10;&#10;The MelodieXpress System&#10;MelodieXpress is a fun, educational and easy way to learn to read music. Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory. This step-by-step approach allows you to learn at your own pace, while the games provide an enjoyable way to learn and consolidate your knowledge of music.&#10;&#10;",

The players clockwise play a card and try to win sticks, but the sticks are individually not worth the same amount of points. The first stick is worth 1 point + 1 point for every card played in this stick. The winner of the second stick receives 2 points for the stick + 1 point for every card in that stick and so on. When one player plays his last card it is the last stick, and thereafter the results are calculated.&#10;&#10;This card game was invented by Dan Glimne in 1991 inspired by the Swedish parliament elections at that time.

The players now look at them and sort out 4 cards and from these 4 cards he decides whether to use 1,2,3 or all 4 of them to use in the race. They are used to determine the result of the player. Spades are not allowed to use among these 4 cards. They are instead among the the rest of the cards (9 cards) which are placed face down in front of the player. If a player accuses another player for being doped, he then chooses to look at one (or maybe 2 or up to 4 cards depending on how many cards the player used for the race) of his 9 face down cards, and if any of these cards is a spade, the player is doped and disqualified.&#10;&#10;This card game was invented by Dan Glimne in 1988 inspired by  Ben Johnson&acute;s Olympic doping scandal at that time.

The aim of the game is to dominate the majority of the 12 lines that connect the spaces. A line is considered dominated if the sum of the spaces of a player&rsquo;s pieces on the line is higher than that of the opponents.

For each horse, there are 12 cards (3x &quot;+&quot;, 2x &quot;++&quot;, 1x &quot;+++&quot;, 3x &quot;-&quot;, 2x &quot;- -&quot;, and 1x &quot;- - -&quot;). The start position of each horse is the field of its respective line in the central column.&#10;&#10;Each player receives six betting slips (one of each color) and an amount of the 72 movement cards (previously shuffled and distributed amongst them). The objective of the players is to give adequate movement cards to the player nominated as the game master in attempt to best influence the position of the horses during the race. Simultaneously, the players may change betting slips with each other, trying to achieve the best winnings. For that, the players are free to communicate among them and change both betting slips and movement cards. During the race, the players may give movement cards (face down) to the game master. After the game master plays five cards, they move the corresponding horses according to the played movement cards. The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds are played and the players receive points according to their bets. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Originally published in spielbox 1992 #5.&#10;&#10;",

There is only one winner in Storyteller but every player takes away an amazing prize - a unique story that they all created together.&#10;&#10;The game set for Storyteller contains 200 cards which are divided into two different types: plot and ending cards. Plot cards contain elements of the future story: the heroes, places, objects, events and other characteristics. Each ending card has a final sentence for the story written on them. When developing a story, the players illustrate it by taking plot cards from their hands and placing them onto the table. As the game progresses, players take turns telling the story. Each player is trying to steer the tale in a direction that would ultimately fit their ending card. Since the ending cards are all quite different, each player will attempt to tailor the story in a different way, causing the plot to take notorious twists and turns.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Story:  The year is 1702. As a humble bean farmer, you have grown restless and yearn for adventure. You gather your belongings, sell your farm and purchase a small sloop from the local shipyard. With entrepreneurial vigor, you set sail for the nearest island, hoping to turn a meager profit on your final barrel of beans. The leaders of your nation soon hear of your courage and petition your service. They provide you with a small satchel of gold, a crew, and Letters of Marque. As a newly commissioned privateer, you must navigate the treacherous seas, and bring home great riches and glory to your country of origin.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  A player&rsquo;s turn begins by drawing one adventure card and selecting one action card. Depending on the type of adventure, the card may be resolved immediately (e.g. a group activity), or the card may be placed on the ocean map by the player. The player then sails to an island or ocean space, choosing to either experience an adventure, or trade in the market. The market is the heart of this game. Players aim to buy low, sell high, carefully watching future prices, hoping to turn a profit. The action cards provide one-time bonuses to fight pirates, escape disasters, trade in the market, etc. Gold is used to upgrade ships, explore shipwrecks, gamble, etc. The game ends when a player&rsquo;s ship is upgraded to level 10, and victory goes to the player with the most gold.&#10;&#10;",
