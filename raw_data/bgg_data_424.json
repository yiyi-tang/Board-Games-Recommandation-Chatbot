    "Description": "Beyond the Beachhead offers players the opportunity to do cardboard battle on more &quot;Normandy-like&quot; terrain. The scenarios range from 6 June to 25 July, 1944 with a variety of forces including U.S., British, Canadian, German, and SS. The Battlepack includes the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     2 geomorphic mapboards depicting Normandy terrain (HOB III, HOB VI)&#10;     2 geomorphic overlays (the overlays fit on to either Normandy board: village; Bocage hill)&#10;     8 Action Packed Scenarios&#10;     Cover that includes special rules (describes terrain, Light Bocage, etc) and LOS examples&#10;&#10;&#10;The 2 overlays fit on to either mapboard in the pack, essentially creating 6 possible boards. Also, the overlays can fit on to some other boards.&#10;With the new Bocage artwork it is possible to have hedges and Bocage on the same mapboard!&#10;&#10;",

Like the excellent original, which was developed to instruct young people in the important fundamentals of baseball, this version may also be played alone or with others.&#10;&#10;No one has to tell a serious player that a MENTAL MISTAKE can often make the difference between winning and losing a ballgame.  It is for this reason that college and high school students - as well as the recognized professionals - are required to read and memorize play books and study sheets.  They are aware that such activity is just as important to becoming a good ballplayer as knowing how to hit the ball and run the bases.&#10;&#10;Fielder's Option is different because it puts the &quot;fun&quot; into it.  It generates a sense of competition, which is what baseball is all about.  And when you play Fielder's Option you have the opportunity to learn not only what is requested of you when playing your &quot;favorite&quot; position, but all the other positions as well.&#10;&#10;Pete Rose has recommended it.  The creators of Fielder's Option are grateful, for we know there is no better example of a player always being mentally prepared than Pete Rose.&#10;&#10;",

Their tokens (plus same tokens in other colors representing items such as beer barrels and tow ropes) can be stacked below the airships in order to raise them above ground, which gives a good indication of who is on the winning path.&#10;&#10;The game had extremely good manufactured components, oversized dice and playing cards printed on thick game board stock.

    "Description": "A sports trivia game published in Quebec in 1988. The marketing of this game used heavily the name and image of ex-NHL all-stars player Guy Lafleur. His picture appears on the box cover and on the board, and a letter signed by him is in the box. Another sheet invites people to write in to become a game-club member, in order to get souvenirs and a signed photo.&#10;&#10;Communications SportStar inc., the publisher of this game, were also TV producers of Hockey-related television programming. The game itself was released to publicize a sports trivia TV show of the same name, then in development, that would have been co-hosted by Guy Lafleur. The show was never produced.&#10;&#10;The game is a standard trivia game, with questions in 5 categories: Hockey, Baseball, Football, Olympic sports, and miscellaneous.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two phases. Starting on the inner ring, the player can go in a direction of their choice the number of spaces indicated by their die roll, in order to accumulate 150 points. In the first phase, a player may choose to move to the outer ring. Once they have reached 150, a player will attempt to answer the most consecutive questions in each of the five sides of the outer ring, one per category. Missing a question forces the player to leave that side. A completed side is worth 40 points. The first player to accumulate a total of 350 points wins the game and is named &quot;Prodige du Sport&quot; (i.e. &quot;Sports Prodigy&quot;).&#10;&#10;",

E.S.R., Inc. hopes that you will find it interesting and delightful to play Dr. Nim and that you have at least an insight into the workings of computers.&#10;&#10;Who is Dr. Nim?  He is a fascinating, challenging, digital computer, ingeniously designed and simply made, so that all can play against him.  Less than a minute is needed to learn the rules of play.&#10;&#10;If you can count, you can play Dr. Nim.  Or, if you wish, you may try to work out the mathematical formulas for beating him at the ancient game of Nim.  This game, played for thousands of years, really comes to life with Dr. Nim.&#10;&#10;The instruction booklet that comes with Dr. Nim not only describes the extremely simple rules of play, but it also presents a detailed write-up of Dr. Nim as a computer.  Included are discussions of the mathematics and programming of computers.  An intriguing discussion of the philosophy of computers as &quot;Thinking Machines&quot; is included.&#10;&#10;Dr. Nim was invented by a computer genius.  That is why he is so simple to operate and yet so intriguing to play by both young and old.&#10;&#10;Many variations on the game of Dr. Nim are possible.  You can even make Dr. Nim play against himself or you can use Dr. Nim to play against another person.&#10;&#10;Match your wits against Dr. Nim.  He has been fully tested with children and adults.

You earn Victory Points by reaching these objectives. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Stratagem is played in Game-turns. A Game-turn proceeds as follows:&#10;&#10;First, up to 10 minutes per turn are allocated for negotiation among the players. &#10;Then the first player receives Resource Factors (RFs) and deploys them. The number of RFs each player receives is specified in the Scenario Instructions. &#10;The player then conducts attacks against other players' RFs. This completes the player's turn. &#10;The remaining players receive RFs, deploy RFs, and then make attacks with their RFs in the sequence given in the Scenario Instructions. &#10;When all of the players have taken their turns, one Game-turn has been completed. &#10;Each game lasts for a specified number of Game-turns. The game is over after all of these have been completed. The players total their Victory Points and the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;Stratagem is based on Jim Dunnigan's Origins of World War I and Origins of World War II games.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:&#10;&#10;        StrataGem (2004)&#10;        Stratagem (2014)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Revision Kit for 1914 (also designed by Jim Dunnigan). Consists of new counters (unmounted in first printings, mounted in later printings), a new CRT and revised rules. This is not a stand-alone game. Additional parts (like the mapboard) from Avalon Hill&#039;s 1914 are required to play the revised game.&#10;&#10;(from the Designer's Notes:)&#10;&#10;&quot;... one of the purposes of this revision is to include the &quot;idiocy factor&quot; in the game. This is done by using the Plan 17 rule. The Germans are given an additional boost by use of the &quot;Forced March&quot; rule; a rule which was inadvertently left out of the original game.&#10;&#10;While we were at it, we thought we might try to make 1914 more playable.... in the revision we have included all of the &quot;playability&quot; elements left out of the original for the sake of extreme realism.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;For those who do not have the revision kit:&#10;&#10;Forced March:&#10;Each unit rolls on a D6 (as I recall this is limited to infantry and cavalry units)&#10;1,2 Cannot move at all.&#10;3-6 Gain 1 mp.&#10;&#10;The Plan 17 rule requires the French to make 6 attacks on turns 1-3.&#10;&#10;",

From the starting area, paths of circles lead to a picture of each animal. Three dice are included in the game; two regular 6-sided dice and one special 6-sided &quot;track&quot; die with a track of each animal pictured. Each player also gets 10 counters per animal representing a track of that animal.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player can either use the regular dice or the track die; using the track die, she can place one of her own track counters on an animal's path or alternatively remove another player's track counter from a path. Using the regular dice she can advance one of her playing pieces, but only on an exact result that lands her piece on one of her own previously placed track counters. The players must thus place their own track counters as &quot;stepping stones&quot; before advancing on a path, while sabotaging other players' game by removing their counters. They can freely use any animal each turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach ANY of the pictured animals (with an exact roll) on the board wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by J&#195;&#164;nnitt&#195;&#164;v&#195;&#164;t j&#195;&#164;ljet!&#10;&#10;2 Finnish marks (about 0.60&euro; in 2020) from the sale of each copy were donated to WWF Finland fund.&#10;&#10;",

As the American and Australian Dock Operating Company rests for the night on the beach and under a half moon, the Japanese lunge from the jungle with DC and Molotov Cocktails...in minutes the Japanese have set fire to several buildings, blown up supply depots, and freed several POWs from a nearby pen...the carnage is just beginning!&#10;&#10;- Tarakan Island, May 3rd, 1945: The vital airfield on Tarakan must be taken before further operations may continue.

The real purpose behind behind this greater complexity is to more accurately reflect the influences affecting command decisions, by presenting the complexity of tactical detail facing the original commanders.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Kit consists of a set of expansion rules and new counters.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules of the original basic game continue to apply in the advanced game.  The mapsheet remains the same (and is not included with the expansion kit), although terrain effects are changed.  The unit counters are more numerous, since brigades are the basic level of combat units, rather than divisions as in the basic game.&#10;&#10;Changes to the basic rules include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Artillery may only attack by means of bombardment and all artillery attacks are resolved separately from other combats.  All Artillery attacks are resolved before other (non-artillery) attacks.&#10;     Zones of Control are &quot;sticky&quot; (not &quot;rigid&quot; as in the basic game).&#10;     Stacking of units is allowed.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

When two appropriate rings are lined up, a marble can be dropped into the formed pit and captured. A capture is also created by dropping an opponents marble into the wrong goal. The game is over when a player's marbles are all out of play. Each player scores 50 points for a goal marble and 30 points for a captured marble. High score wins. Tournament Stadium Checkers can be made more challenging by rotating the center goal indicator to a different orientation. Thus, making it harder to move a player's marble into the correct goal.

You fight with ground and air units, but you don&acute;t have atomic strike forces. There are two parties (red and blue), but you can play it with up to ten people, so that everybody can lead a part of the army. There is a large board, 80x150cm, with a painting on it, including power stations, railroads, roads, hills and rivers. Each party rules the following units: Commandos, Infantry, Recon, Grenade launchers, Engineers (Anti-mines and bridges), Tanks, Artillery, Flak, Minefields, Air-bases, Paratroops, Jet-fighters and bombers. Every unit has different move and battle strengths. You must coordinate your movements with the players in your team. A commander in staff will be elected, before the battle starts. First the units will be set-up face-down, so that your opponent can&acute;t see your troops. Every player has 100 numbers, to determine each unit on a small sheet of paper, showing the whole map. Unfortunately this game is not well known.&#10;&#10;",

The first boat (team) to deliver all four fish to the processor and return to its home port wins the game.  Advancing around the board becomes more of a challenge when the team members must guess mystery words related to the ocean, seashore or boats by the means of CHARADES and SKETCHES.  There are short cuts and good news/bad news situations that also come up during the game which make HOOKED(tm) even more exciting and always changing.  Playing time is about 60 to 90 minutes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Requires at least four players (two teams) to play.  Up to four teams (eight players) can play.  Teams take turns rolling the die and moving the boat and following the directions on the space landed on.  Spin the spinner when instructed and following the instructions.  In SKETCH situations, one player must guess the mystery word based on clues drawn by the partner.  If the mystery clue is correctly guessed, the team goes again.  There is also a CHARADE option in which the mystery word must be guessed based on CHARADES type clues.&#10;&#10;No designer or publisher listed but a Petersburg, Alaska address is provided.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Triapon&#10;&#10;This abstract game is played on a triangular board with 45 holes (the longest row has 9 holes, the tip has one). It can only be played by 3 players exactly, and is, in essence, &quot;Nine Men's Morris&quot; for three.&#10;&#10;Each player gets 9 playing pieces and play starts with placement of these pieces onto the board. Clockwise, each player places a piece onto a free space until all pieces are on the board. From then on, in each turn, a player must move one marble to an immediately neighboring empty space. When this result in one or more &quot;Triads&quot; (three uninterrupted marbles of that player's color in a straight line), then that player removes an unprotected marble from one opponent. Extending an existing Triad does not count as creating a new one. The first player who reduced both opponents to 2 marbles each, is the winner.&#10;&#10;The designer has come up with a rules set that makes great use of the nature of a triangular grid, making Triapon a  much cleverer strategic game than a simple connect-3 on a triangle. A careful observer will notice that, besides the obvious Triad that is made on neighboring rows, there are two other straight lines along which Triads can be formed. If a &quot;short Triad&quot; uses 3 neighboring rows, a &quot;medium Triad&quot; uses holes that lay one row removed from each other, and a &quot;long Triad&quot; even has gaps of 2 rows between the marbles.&#10;&#10;Pieces get taken first from the opponent who has the most marbles left on board, and only vulnerable marbles can be removed. These are pieces that don't form part of any Triad, are in a Triad that gets crossed by a longer Triad, or are part of an extended Triad, but, when removed, leave the other marbles still in a Triad.&#10;&#10;And in the Nine Men's Morris tradition: when a player is reduced to just 3 pieces, that player gains the option to move a marble to any free space. The moment that a player has only 2 pieces left, that player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;This is, in broad lines, how standard Triapon is played. An entertaining variation in which blocking marbles are brought back onto the board is also included.&#10;&#10;Publishing history: released in 2 versions by the Swiss &quot;Murmel Spielwerkstatt und Verlag&quot; in 1999. The packing is as clever as the game itself: the board edges flap up to form a pyramid shaped box, neatly holding all the pieces. The deluxe board, or &quot;Triapon Classic&quot;, is made of 8-layer plywood and comes with 30 glass marbles  (10 in 3 colors) in a pouch. The cheaper version is made of cardboard, has a picture of a famous Swiss Alp printed on the outside, and is hence known as the &quot;Triapon Matterhorn&quot; edition.&#10;&#10;",

Each team consists of 6 players (generic pawns); one pawn at a time is used to move the puck with 2d6, trying to get to one of the shooting positions in order to score - but the puck can only stay with the same pawn for one turn, after which it must be passed. Opposing pawns will naturally try to capture it on their own turn. Some points on the board will trigger an event card which can be good or bad; the designer suggests that this is an 'advanced variant' and the first few games should be played without.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pre-agreed number of goals have been scored; in a tournament game, the losing teams and the winning teams will meet each other, and the one to score the most goals wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Polemos project sets out to create a series of rules sharing a basic structure, yet that are carefully tailored for specific historical periods. You do not wish to fight an American Civil War battle and be forced to use concepts designed for the English Civil War, and we don't want to produce bland mechanics devoid of any period flavor or distinction. Polemos rulebooks now include The Great Northern War, English Civil War, and War of Spanish Succession, in addition to the new Napoleonic rules.&#10;&#10;If ever there is an historical period that can lay claim to be THE classic subject for wargamers, then surely it must be those early years of the nineteenth century when Europe was gripped by the power of Napoleon Bonaparte, self-crowned Emperor of France and her conquered territories. A sublime hero to some, a tyrannical despot to others, Napoleon is a man who can still inspire great passions and emotions amongst his supporters and detractors alike.&#10;&#10;The Emperor of France demonstrated his mastery of warfare in a period where the infantry were armed with smooth bore muzzle-loading muskets and the mounted arm could indulge in dashing charges with cold steel in hand. The armies were vast and the scale of the battles epic.&#10;&#10;There was a great deal of variety in the size of Napoleonic battles. the French army that fought at Wagram was ten times the size of that which fought at Vimiero. It is a lot to ask of any single;e set of rules to cope with such diversity.&#10;&#10;Polemos Napoleonic Wars is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, General De Division will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Marechel de L'Empire will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period, so he can emulate Bonaparte at Borodino, Wellington at Waterloo or Blucher at Leipzig.&#10;&#10;The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal; only the nominal scale will differ.&#10;&#10;Polemos:Napoleonic Wars is aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Basing and Representation&#10;&#10;The basic unit of maneuver in Polemos Napoleonic is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected. The 'official' base size is&#10;&#10;In General De Division&#10;&#10;A base of infantry represents an infantry battalion - about 4-800 men.&#10;&#10;A base of cavalry represents a regiment or two to three squadrons.&#10;&#10;An artillery base represents a company or battery of 6 &ndash; 8 guns.&#10;&#10;In Part Two &ndash; Marechal de l&rsquo;Empire, square bases are used. These can be formed by using two General de Brigade bases, butted up one behind the other.&#10;&#10;Generals are placed on bases 30mm square. The higher the status of the general, the more aides, hangers-on, lackeys, etc he can have on his base.&#10;&#10;Messengers may be depicted by a single mounted figure on a small base&#10;&#10;All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.&#10;&#10;This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no re-basing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organized on this basis.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The &lsquo;FireFights!&rsquo; system continues with FF2. The scenarios are small, intense actions compatible with the ASL game system or other tactical level wargames. Variety and re-playability are key components of FireFights 2. The fog of war and variety remains high with variable reinforcement groups. Each scenario also comes with its own historically based map which also serves as a half board overlay. The half board overlays are compatible with boards 1, 14, 19, 26-31, 33. Designed for those that love a great game that can be played in one week- night setting, while they pit the opposing forces against each other and against time as the FireFight! Series has only 4-5 game turns per scenario.&#10;&#10;FF-10 Near Bicske, Hungary, 4 January 1945 - A small group of SS troopers and tanks from the 5th SS Wiking Division have been ordered to fight a rear guard action. In an ancient castle they take their stand against Russian heavy metal... the feared IS-2 heavy tanks.&#10;&#10;FF-11 Tug Argan Pass, British Somaliland, 11 August 1940 - The Italian army in Ethiopia needed a way out of the country. The only way was through the Tug Argan Pass... Only the Indian troops of the British Empire stood in their way.&#10;&#10;FF-12 Ste. Marie du Mont, France, 6 June 1944 - Scattered far and wide the US paratroopers of the 506th Parachute Infantry, have come down in the wrong place... directly into a German occupied French village. Now, all they have to do is GET OUT!&#10;&#10;FF-13 Mt. Cochen, Agordat, Eritrea, 29 January 1941 - The British want the Italians out of Eritrea and send the 11th Indian Brigade to roust them out. But on this lonely mountain, the Italians wanted to fight! After 2 days the Italians were counter-attacking and the Indians were in retreat.&#10;&#10;FF-14 Bodange, Belgium, 10 May 1940 - War has come to western Europe! On 10 May 1940, the German XIX Korps crossed into the Belgian Ardennes. What to stop them? Nothing!, But stiff resistance by the Belgian Chasseurs could sure slow them down.&#10;&#10;FF-15 Haut le Wastia, France, 14 May 1940 - French units of the 5th Motorized Division, in a desperate attempt to stem the German tide, counter-attacked the German 7th Panzer Division near the small hamlet of Haut le Wastia. Surprising the Germans, French were able to reoccupy the hamlet for awhile.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Advanced Squad Leader&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Created to make your preparation for English exams more fun, 800: The Game of Verbal Perfection features the most commonly found words in over 2400 questions, divided into three levels. The questions are modeled after the verbal SAT in a Trivial Pursuit-like format. You'll increase your vocabulary while having fun with your whole family!&#10;&#10;The questions simulate actual questions from the SAT, ACT, GRE, and MAT with a bit of a humorous bent.&#10;&#10;A board is placed on the table with an octagon track on it. The track is made up of six rings, each ring, containing spaces that are either a number (the outer ring spaces are &quot;300&quot;, with numbers increasing until the final inner space, which is &quot;800&quot;), an arrow, or a &quot;RC&quot; space (Reading Comprehension.) Two decks of cards: the Level Deck and the Reading Comprehension Deck are placed on the table, and each player puts a pawn of their color on one of the arrow spaces on the outer ring. All players roll the dice, with the highest roller going first, with play proceeding clockwise around the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player simply rolls the die and moves their pawn counter-clockwise that many spaces. Depending on what space a player lands on, the following occurs:&#10;&#10;     &quot;RC&quot;. Another player reads the passage on the top Reading Comprehension card to another player, and then asks them a question with five choices.&#10;     Level Space (&quot;300&quot; through &quot;800&quot;). Another player asks them a question, using the matching question on the top Level card. These questions are ones such as &quot;Machete is to brush as&hellip;&quot;, and there are five choices to pick from.&#10;     Eliminate One: Some level spaces say &quot;eliminate one&quot; on them - and are the same as a normal space, but a player only has to list one wrong answer to get the question correct.&#10;     Arrow Space: The player is asked a question from a Level card that is equal to the level of the ring they are currently in. If they get the question correct, they move their pawn one ring further in; if incorrect, one ring out.&#10;&#10;&#10;No matter what space they landed on, if a player gets the question right, they may roll again and continue.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player gets their pawn into the middle 800 space and answers a question correctly. At this point, all other players gladly crown them the winner.&#10;&#10;--gameplay summary from Tom Vasel (see https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12318.phtml)&#10;&#10;",

The game is set in a typical year during the wost disturbances sparked by the annual Drumcree Orange Parade along the Garvaghy Road (1995-2000).&#10;&#10;The game requires 3 players: The Loyalist player represents certain members of the Protestant community in Northern Ireland, such as the Orange Order, and various paramilitaries (e.g. UVF, LVF, UFF, RHC). The Republican player represents certain members of the Catholic community in the Occupied Six Counties, such as Residents' Groups, and various paramilitaries (e.g. pIRA, cIRA, rIRA, INLA). The final player represents the Royal Ulster Constabulary police force (RUC). The Republican and Loyalist players use cards to influence regions on a map of Northern Ireland, reacting to one another and actions of the RUC player whose objective, in this game, is to reduce the influence of both the Loyalists and the Republicans.&#10;&#10;The crux of the game is in judicious playing of the cards: The Loyalists play a March card in Armagh - will you, as the RUC player, allow it to go ahead and risk a Republican Riot; or do you Re-Route that March and risk a Loyalist reaction that may itself provoke a worse Republican reaction?&#10;Should have kept that Tear-Gas card...&#10;&#10;",

The round continues until all players are out of cards; then point cards taken are scored.  The first player to go out  begins the next round by getting the two best (i.e., lowest-numbered) cards from the last player to go out, giving any two in return; likewise, the second to go out gets the best card from the next-to-last to go out.  (With three players, the first and last to go out exchange one card.)  Play continues until one player reaches 50 points.&#10;&#10;",

The other player then attempts to knock said ball into one of the various scoring bins using the tethered ball; if that player misses, the other player may catch the swinging, tethered ball and immediately try their hand at knocking the rolling ball into a bin.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one of the two players succeeds in scoring.  The object is to accumulate 1500 points (though any total works nicely).  It's harder than it sounds!&#10;&#10;Balanko is wonderfully simple and accessible to almost anyone regardless of age (a suggested age of 3+ is more because of reasonably small pieces than anything else).  As it mounts directly onto its packaging, it's easily stored when not in use.&#10;&#10;",

A face-down person (Mr. Aay, Mr. Bee, Mr. Cee, Mr. Dee) and a face-down weapon (hammer, gun, knife, poison) are laid about on the board, and each player gets 2 cards, one showing which person to find, and one showing which weapon to find.  Players spin the spinner to move around the board, looking at the face-down pieces in each area until they find the 2 on their cards.  They then return to the center, reveal their cards, and tell the other players where their weapon and person are on the board.  If they succeed, they win!  If they declare wrong they are eliminated.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Publisher's website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Behind wooden walls beat hearts of iron...&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash; Austrian Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff,&#10;private letter to his mistress, June 1866&#10;&#10;In the summer of 1866, the Austrian fleet fought the Italians in the first open-sea battle between ironclad fleets, at Lissa in the Adriatic. An Austrian victory, it prevented Italian seizure of the strategic island of Lissa.&#10;&#10;Hearts of Iron is loosely based on the Great War at Sea series of games.  The operational part of the game is very similar; there is an operational map of the Adriatic and central Mediterranean, on which fleets move and attempt to make contact.  The tactical part of the game is more detailed, with armor (or lack of it), rifled and smooth-bore ordinance, ship maneuvering and leadership playing much more prominent roles.&#10;&#10;In addition to the Austrian and Italian fleets, there is the American Mediterranean Squadron that the Austrians believed would fight alongside the Italians, and the Turkish European Fleet that entered the Adriatic to support Austria. Plus the British Mediterranean Fleet and a large French contingent, along with the Greeks, Egyptians and several other smaller navies.  There are a wide variety of both operational and battle scenarios, based on extensive archival research into the original reports and dispatches of the Austro-Italian conflict along with many hypothetical engagements.&#10;&#10;",
