    "Description": "In this game, not only you can build a crypto empire, but also you can try to manipulate the market to gain advantage for your own coin or invest and trade your opponents&rsquo; coins to benefit from their success or failures.&#10;&#10;Crypto When Lambo (CWL) board game was inspired by crypto fortunes that were made and lost overnight. Your goal is to build a crypto empire with your own crypto company and coin to become the most successful crypto investor.&#10;&#10;The game takes place across the 8 cities of the world that contain 64 resource producing city tiles. You begin the game with 3 offices, 2 crypto company share cards (each representing 1 million coins), and 5 million game currency. The first player to reach 1 billion or 50 Winning Point Count (WPC) wins the game.&#10;&#10;To gain WPCs, you must increase the number of your employees, build products, open new offices, complete your management team, ICO your coin, and list it on crypto exchanges. There are 5 resource types (Real Estate, Employee, Management Team, Product, and Crypto Exchange) in the game that allow you to perform various actions to gain points and make money. For example, using 2 Real Estate cards and paying 2 million, you can establish a new office. Each office placed on the board is 2 WPCs and each Product you produce is worth 2 WPCs. There are multiple paths to getting additional points such as by becoming the richest person in the crypto world or leading a crypto company to ICO with several products and employees dominating the markets.&#10;&#10;How do you acquire these resources? It&rsquo;s very simple. Each turn a player rolls the dice and the total determines which city production centers will produce resources. Different cities have different attributes. For example, New York and London have more management talent but real estate is harder to get. Hong Kong has a lot of employees that can be recruited. New York is highly regulated and harder to have Crypto Exchanges whereas Tokyo and Hong Kong have more Crypto Exchanges that are accessible.&#10;&#10;How do you earn money? For example, 1 Product card can be traded for 5 million. Other resource cards can be traded for 1 million. You can also trade your resources with other players during your turn. You can also do Crypto Trading during your turn and risk some of your money for potential high reward. You can also make money by buying low and selling high your opponents&rsquo; coins by manipulating the market with CWL Action Cards.&#10;&#10;In CWL, your most important asset is your crypto company shares. You start the game with 2 of 10 company share cards, each representing 1 million coins. In the beginning of the game your coins have zero value. This is tracked by the Coin Price ticker cards you have in front of you always visible to all players.  You must try to acquire as many as your company share cards as you can while they have zero value. You can also acquire other players&rsquo; share cards before they go ICO to benefit from their ICO price hype. Picking the right time for ICO will determine the revenue you will get from your ICO. Number of products, employees, management team, and manipulation of markets will all affect the coin price. You should try to increase your coin price as high as possible before launching your ICO while trying to manipulate your opponents&rsquo; coin prices. This is all done by using combination of resource cards.&#10;&#10;In order to ICO, a player has to own at least 5 company share cards, a Board of Directors Management card, one of the C-level management cards (CEO, CFO, CIO or CISO) and at least one Employee card. One well timed successful ICO could take you from several million to well above 500 million. ICO is worth 10 WPCs.&#10;&#10;There is a strategy involved around placement of Offices on the board in the beginning of the game to trading and manipulation of coin prices to timing of the ICO to raise money. Every game develops differently due to actions of each player.&#10;&#10;CWL is full of fun with trading, resource management, market manipulation, and teaming concepts. It is simple to learn but hard to master with all the strategies available to you.&#10;&#10;Get ready for your first adventure on CWL. Have fun building your Crypto Empire!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players gather kitties from the clowder; then trade, steal, and get even more kitties. Watch out for Crazy Kitty Clashes!&#10;&#10;Before starting, spread all of the kitty cards in the center of the table and each player will take 3 kitties. These are placed face down in front of the player. Shuffle the action cards and place then in a pile near the kitty cards.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they will draw one action card. If it is green, play right away and do what it says (have a kitty clash, look at another player's kitties, etc). If it is blue, the player will hold on to the card until they are involved in a kitty clash. Blue cards help in kitty clashes to give an extra die, end the clash, roll again if you don't win, etc.&#10;&#10;When a player draws the pink Sleepy Time card, the round ends and all players count up the number of points on all their kitties. The player with the most points wins. Rules suggest playing 5 rounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This would appear to be a traditional two player abstract strategy game from Africa.&#10;&#10;It was well enough known in the Ivory Coast for that country to issue a set of two postage stamps featuring the game on 11 August 1984 [SG 810-811 / Scott 720-721; designed by Didier / Edila].  Curiously, however, no other information seems to be available on it except from these stamps, and it is not mentioned in any of the major games books in my possession, including that by L'H&ocirc;te, who is usually a good source for games of the Francophone world.&#10;&#10;It is played by two people, on a board similar to that of Nine men's Morris, that is to say, there are 24 playing spaces arranged on the corners and mid-points of the edges of three concentric squares.  However, no diagonals are marked, and the spaces consists of holes, into which the players insert black and white sticks.  One of the stamps shows Eklan being played on an apparently traditional board fashioned into a small table, similar to those used in quality Go or Mancala sets.  The dimensions I give below have been estimated from those pictures (the depth being the approximate height of the illustrated table).&#10;&#10;The board is shown as having a narrow raised 'lip' around its edges, except at open at the corners.  The part of the board between this lip and the outermost set of eight holes is coloured beige, and the regions within it are respectively coloured white, green, and - at the centre - yellow.  Presumably these details are merely decorative.  The sticks would seem to protrude about 6 centimetres out from their holes, and the white ones slant towards one player, while the black ones slant towards his opponent who sits opposite.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

No accepted English name has been found for it, but the words &quot;kr&#196;&#153;gle szachowe&quot; can be translated as &quot;chess bowling&quot; or &quot;chess bowling pins&quot;.&#10;&#10;Lech Pijanowski, a Polish games expert, described it as a &ldquo;folk game&rdquo; known in Germany and Scandinavia.&#10;&#10;The game is played between two players (termed White and Black), who sit opposite each other across a 9&times;9 checkerboard, which has a line drawn around the central block of 3&times;3 squares.  The source illustrates this board as having dark squares in each corner.  Each player has nine undifferentiated pieces or stones.  Initially, each player places one of his pieces in the corner square to his right, and the other eight complete a square with the first piece as its corner.  White starts, and play is then alternate.&#10;&#10;Pieces move a single space, to any of the (maximum of) four diagonally adjacent squares.  Capturing is by custodianship, which is to say that an unbroken diagonal line of (one or more) enemy pieces, terminating with a friendly piece at one end of the line, will be captured if a second friendly piece is moved onto the space at the opposite end of the line.  [The source is silent on whether such a move can capture lines of enemy pieces in more than one direction].  Unusually, though, captured pieces do not vacate the board, but are placed elsewhere on the board on a vacant space chosen by the captor, with the restriction that the new space must be the same colour as that from which it was removed.  Thus, pieces will always remain on the same coloured square as that upon which they start the game.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to complete a previously agreed arrangement of ones own pieces in the marked central sector of the board.  Six examples of winning arrangements are:&#10;&#10;&ndash;o&ndash; || ooo || &ndash;&ndash;o || ooo || &ndash;&ndash;o || o&ndash;o   &#10;ooo || o&ndash;o || &ndash;&ndash;o || ooo || &ndash;o&ndash; || &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#10;&ndash;o&ndash; || ooo || ooo || ooo || o&ndash;&ndash; || o&ndash;o&#10;(where o represents a friendly piece, and &ndash; an empty square).  &#10;Arrangements involving more pieces are harder to achieve and will make for a longer game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

In this fast-paced educational game, ABC shooters take up the pursuit of the greedy rodent and learn very easily how to read and understand texts.&#10;&#10;To stop the voracious reading rat, all players have to read different task cards together. If they have understood the text correctly, they can slide the matching images together on the Turn game board. However, this must be done before the rat has gnawed its way through the shelf. Reading beginners from the age of 6 are just right here. The tasks come in two difficulty levels, so this entertaining learning game can be improved from time to time.&#10;In the race against the reading rat, children immerse themselves in the world of letters, words and their pronunciation. This makes the game a welcome addition to school learning or the ideal preparation for it. Its great pedagogical value derives from the use of the Mildenberger syllable method, which has proven its worth many times over. The syllables highlighted in colour on the text cards lead to a faster comprehension of a word. If it is read syllable by syllable, a word sounds as we have heard it before. Children learn in this way spielerisch that reading makes fun and is not at all so difficult.&#10;&#10;Great reading fun with pedagogical demands&#10;&#10;&#10;     Improves text comprehension in scalable difficulty levels&#10;     Increases the joy of learning and motivates teamwork&#10;     According to the syllable method of Mildenberger&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Im spannenden Wettlauf das Lesen lernen: Wer huscht denn da verstohlen durchs B&uuml;cherregal und knabbert alle Seiten an?

Damit ist das Spiel eine willkommene Erg&auml;nzung zum schulischen Lernen oder die ideale Vorbereitung darauf. Seinen gro&szlig;en p&auml;dagogischen Wert erh&auml;lt es aus der Anwendung der vielfach bew&auml;hrten Mildenberger Silbenmethode. Die auf den Textkarten farbig hervorgehobenen Silben f&uuml;hren zum schnelleren Erfassen eines Wortes. Wird es n&auml;mlich silbenweise gelesen, klingt ein Wort so, wie wir es schon einmal geh&ouml;rt haben. Kinder lernen auf diese Weise spielerisch, dass Lesen Spa&szlig; macht und gar nicht mal so schwer ist.&#10;&#10;Ein gro&szlig;er Lesespa&szlig; mit p&auml;dagogischem Anspruch&#10;&#10;&#10;     Verbessert das Textverst&auml;ndnis in skalierbaren Schwierigkeitsstufen&#10;     Steigert die Freude am Lernen und motiviert zur Teamarbeit&#10;     Nach der Silbenmethode von Mildenberger&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

Players also get a hidden Personality Card which shows their interests and secret objectives.&#10;&#10;Players start the Round by drawing from the Dating Pool Deck.  When a Profile Card is drawn, each player secretly decides whether to match or pass.  After everyone reveals, the highest ranked User Card who chooses to match has found their special someone, for now...  Be careful who you match with: once you're matched, you can't pick up a new card if someone better comes along.&#10;&#10;Don't think you're ever safe though!  Breakup cards can appear at any time and ruin your relationship!  They force you to break up with your match if your match's Profile Card is too many points higher than your User Card, but they also give you the opportunity to voluntarily end your relationship. Bonus cards like Pets, Glitch in the App, and Speed Dating add even more player choice.  Players continue to draw from the Dating Pool Deck until a &quot;No Matches Nearby&quot; card is drawn, which ends the round when certain conditions are met.&#10;&#10;Your score is your Match minus your User score, so the higher your User score, so the higher priority you get in matching, but also the more points you lose at the end of the Round.  Add in extra points from shared interests and for fulfilling your secret objective from your Personality Card, plus any bonus card points you may have gotten along the way.  If you're not matched, you get negative points.&#10;&#10;Dating Pool is played over a series of Rounds.  Each Round, Players get a new User Card and Personality Card, with lower scoring players getting preference on choosing their User Card.  The first player to 50 points is officially the best at Dating Apps!  That is, until you play another game...&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You received notice that a terrible storm is coming and you must harvest everything before the storm destroys your crops!&#10;&#10;This is a solitaire card game using only 12 cards (18 cards come with the game for more variability, and all cards are different).&#10;&#10;Remove the &quot;switch&quot; card and mix the remaining 17 cards.&#10;&#10;Now deal down 11 cards and add the &quot;switch&quot; card, mix these 12 cards and deal them down in a 3x4 grid making sure all cards are oriented the same way, easily done by looking at the back of the cards.&#10;&#10;1  2  3  4&#10;5  6  7  8&#10;9 10 11 12&#10;&#10;Put the rest of the cards away, you won&rsquo;t be using them.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to save your crops by removing every single card from the tableau, otherwise you lose.&#10;&#10;You begin by carefully observing the cards....&#10;&#10;On every turn you will be removing two cards from the tableau by &quot;activating&quot; a card, and removing both the card activated and the card it affects (either due to arrows or instructions). If removing cards by an &quot;arrow&quot; action, the activated arrow card needs to be directly adjacent to the card it affects, either horizontally or vertically, otherwise the action does not take place.&#10;&#10;Some cards mention &quot;positions&quot;. Be aware of cards referencing positions 1, 4, 9, and 12.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Switch&quot; card gives you the option of switching the position of two &quot;other&quot; cards when activated, once the two other cards are switched, you remove the switch card, then eliminate a card from either side of it. If the &quot;switch&quot; card is activated and there is no card directly adjacent to the right or left of it, the switch cannot be activated.&#10;&#10;It's not as simple as it seems, you'll have lots of options, and one mistake can cost you!&#10;&#10;Will you be able to save your crops before the storm?&#10;&#10;www.DualBrainGames.com&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Common player comment, &quot;This is not the game I thought it would be.&quot;  It may look like a kids game but it defies labeling.  It may be perfect information but it is not an abstract...&#10;&#10;Apex Portal presents Lost Plateau, inspired by the 1912 classic novel, The Lost World, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  On this secret plateau, dinosaurs roam a land of volcanoes and treacherous cliffs.  Expeditions navigate stampeding dinosaurs while chasing and delivering eggs.&#10;&#10;Dinosaurs! At Apex Portal we love primal physical mechanics.    We evolved Lost Plateau for over 10 years. This design strived for 2 goals to produce primal tension.  First, to have dinosaurs with an elegant set of behaviors (stampede, defensive facing, double dino combinations) to spawn eggs and eliminate opposing dinosaurs.  Second, to balance the influence of the 2 entities, the expeditions and the dinosaur packs, so both are always in consideration for their way of scoring and to maximize the interaction between them.  Each player controls a pack and an expedition.  The dino behaviors are truly predatorial for the fun tactical side of the game.  When will your expedition feel safe to run the gauntlet of opposing dinos for the eggs?  That question and getting your packs into safe but threatening areas of the plateau is the strategy side of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Description&#10;   This is a physical primal game.&#10;   A player turn is 2 actions &ndash; may do the same action twice.&#10;Move Expedition Action &ndash; Pick up and deliver eggs to the Safe Camps by moving 2 spaces per action.  Or use the in-game Trail Blaze expansion to allow unlimited movement on established trails -- that can be co-developed between competitors.&#10;Move Dinosaur Action &ndash;  Dinos stampede dinos and opposing expeditions.  The dino is moved and then given facing to prevent stampede from one direction.  If both actions are Move Dino then sly double dino stampedes appear out of the mist!  This encourages dinos to stay within reach of pack mates and maximizes a true predator mind set &ndash;  you always see opportunity, but often don't see the other pack coming after you.&#10;&#10;Winning the game&nbsp;- Score 6 total eggs and/or dino captures.&#10;&#10;Two unique team versions for 4 to 6 players.  Can play as team mates or as competing &ldquo;pack mates&rdquo;.  Pack mates control and share the points scored by their pack, but don't share in egg scoring by their private Expedition.  The team games are unique for the speed of play.  A 6 player game runs!&#10;&#10;Trail Blaze Expansion. The in-game expansion adds a 3rd action, for experienced gamers.  Each player or team has 20 blazes.  The Blaze Action is the placing of 5 Blazes on any spaces of the board.  On move Expedition Action, the player may move the tent into any space that is adjacent and has at least 2 Blazes and at least one is of the player's color.  May move up and down connected trails with out limit on each Move Expedition action.  This adds deeper strategy in avoiding opponent dinos and adds co-opetition to jump in on other player's developed trails with your own Blazes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player in Croco Rider has twelve discs that they lay out in a circle on their half of the game board. These discs have values from 1 to 6 and from -1 to -6. The game board shows five crocodiles on it, with the crocodiles having 3-7 spaces on them.&#10;&#10;To start the game, a player places one of their discs on an empty crocodile space. The next player chooses a disc and places it on an empty space, whether on the same crocodile or a different one. On each subsequent turn, a player can play either disc from the open end of their circle.&#10;&#10;When a crocodile has two face-up discs on it, whether of the same or different colors, one of those discs is turned face down. If both discs are positive or negative, the disc closer to the crocodile's head wins and the other one is turned face down; if one disc is positive and the other negative, then the disc closer to the tail wins.&#10;&#10;Once all the pieces have been placed, the game ends. Whoever has their disc face up on a crocodile scores points for that disc, with the value being equal to the number on the disc (1-6) multiplied by the position of the disc on the crocodile from the tail forward. If the crocodile has four spaces, for example, and you have a 3 near the crocodile's head, then you score 12 points for it (3 x 4 for the fourth space on the crocodile). Whoever has the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game board in Anacund is composed of 17 wooden slats; fifteen of these slats have an ideogram at either end, with these ideograms representing the numbers 1-6. Shuffle these slats, then place them in a row, then place the remaining two slats (each with three ideograms) on either end to create a single path of 36 spaces. One of these spaces is colored red and dubbed the &quot;bonus square&quot;. Each player takes 18 of the double-sided tokens, then places them in three groups of six, with their color face up.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must place three of your tokens on the game board. The space that you place a token on must equal the number of tokens in the group before you placed that token. Thus, at the start of the game, you take a token from a group of six tokens, then place that token on a 6 space. Your next token must be placed on a 5 (if taken from the same group) or a 6 (if taken from one of your remaining two groups).&#10;&#10;If after placing a token, you have sandwiched one or more of the opponent's tokens, those opposing tokens are flipped over and placed next to the spaces they once occupied. These spaces cannot be played in again. If you would create a sandwich with yourself in the middle, then your own pieces are captured &mdash; unless you have simultaneously sandwiched the opponent at the same time, in which case you capture them instead.&#10;&#10;Once all the pieces have been placed, players tally their scores. Each piece showing your color, whether on the board or next to it, is worth 1 point; whoever has a piece on or next to the bonus space scores 5 points. Whoever has the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the role of community leaders, each of them with a specific vision of what their society could be. They will need to work together to keep the community safe, erect new buildings, and instill new ways of doing things among the populace, but always remembering that none of the other players shares their exact vision.&#10;&#10;What We Became is highly competitive, but the environment presents enough of a threat that players will need to negotiate and work together with adversaries to stay alive, all while trying to outmaneuver them to come out ahead. At the end of each game, you will realize that a story has been told about the ups, downs, successes, and failures of a community decades after the world as we know it has ceased to exist.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The scientists discovered that the mechanism depicted a high dimensional map encoded in 9D quasicrystal in one dimension upon 9 wooden pieces(board of the game), a pixelated scale reality of a multiple quantum universe of a world in the past. A civilization with Cities that function with gravity, and magnetic forces. Mechanisms control the dimension of time and quantum technology is used to teleport among the cities. The quantum (plural quanta) is a discrete packet of energy with wave-like properties. An earthquake on the island from the distortion of the geomagnetic field in this strange and different world would cause the sudden disappearance of this advanced civilization.&#10;&#10;Each copy of the game has the same mechanism of time dilation as a gameplay play but it is designed with a different unique art style and has its' own serial number. The new edition of the game board,  book box, and game pieces glow in the Dark.&#10;&#10;Through its masterful blend of science and strategy, the game represents a magnificent quest: Are we stuck in a single definite state or all multiple realities result in a single certain outcome? Play with time in a world where time has stopped, and control the momentum of the devastation of an unknown and strange civilization.&#10;&#10;",

Pilots are to battle each other in order to earn a place in their ranks. You are one of these pilots!&#10;&#10;- Pilots battle it out by drawing from constructed decks and playing cards to activate System Discs (SD). Activated SDs can have various types of weapon and special abilities. These are then physically launched from your RIG. &#10;- Five different RIGs (buildable spaceship models) can be customized by mounting the parts the way players want and the ships can also be mixed to build a totally new RIG.&#10;- Configure your RIG by installing various types of Platforms into your RIG's Modules and construct your deck according to the installed Platform Systems.&#10;- Earn points during battle to eventually be accepted into the Guild. As you earn Battle Points, you'll gain benefits in the Battlespace to aid you on your way to Victory.&#10;&#10;Victory conditions: &#10;The game ends when a player's RIG is destroyed or after the turn where a player's deck runs out. &#10;- The player with the surviving RIG wins the game.&#10;- If both players survived when the game ends, the player with the most armor wins the game.&#10;- If the armor amounts are equal when the game ends, the Junior Guild Member wins the game.&#10;- If both players are Junior Guild Members when the game ends, the players must place their RIGs 2 Proximity card lengths apart and load 1 SD each. The players launch simultaneously. The player who achieves the closest Proximity wins the game. A Direct or Surface Hit is an automatic loss. Relaunch if both players scored a Direct or Surface Hit.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Neal @ CGT&#10;&#10;",

Attacking is the only way how players can deal damage to an opponent's character and defeat it. Each round players put 4 hidden cards on the board that creates their action decks. Once both action decks are complete, players execute all card from their decks one by one. The games end when one of the player's characters health is reduced to 0.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Dashboard contains a Health Meter which indicates the health of your character, a Damage Meter which indicates the condition of your vehicle and a Binoculars Meter which helps you look into the distance.

The player who possesses the compass is able to find and go through these paths. Other players may steal the compass.&#10;&#10;During certain conditions, Game Cards can be flipped. If so, the player cannot use them. To un-flip them, the player must roll a 4 and choose not to move their vehicle.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player crosses the finish line. The next closest player is declared 2nd Place and so on.&#10;&#10;There is also tournament format. A tournament is when 2 to 5 players have agreed to participate in 10 races.

They expand the trading routes of these families and establish trade relationships with other families. The player who gains the most victory points with relationships and goods will be the winner at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players either marry into a merchant family or expand the trading route of a family they are already married into.&#10;&#10;To marry into a family, the player pays the cost of the family. Only two players may marry into each family. To expand the trading route of a family, the player must be married into the family and may pay for the route with the money of the family. The goal is to meet other families not met before (gaining trade relationship markers) and to reach goods spaces first (gaining goods tokens).&#10;&#10;When all families have established at least one trade relationship or one family has established five trade relationships, the game ends. Each player scores their goods cards with the corresponding goods markers they have acquired, the trade relationship markers they have collected, and their money.&#10;&#10;Family expansion:&#10;Family ties are established even tighter now. Being merchants, the players equip their sons and daughters with goods and gems and send them out to travel the trading routes. The only thing still missing is the adequate partner. Which marriage is most promising?&#10;&#10;",
