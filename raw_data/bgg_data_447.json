The board represents the convention area of a hotel, composed of 25 rooms separated by 42 doorways. You need to provide a pawn for each, some pennies, 1D6 and a 'Master Pawn' to represent the monster. The object is to not be caught by the monster.&#10;&#10;The pennies represent tables blocking doorways. The board is set up with pennies in certain doorways, the monster in the middle space (the ballroom) and the players in certain rooms. Players take turns. On your turn, you roll the die and take that many steps from room to room. After each step you take, you may move a table from any doorway in that room to any other doorway in the room if you wish. Also after each step you take, the monster takes a step towards you via the shortest path.&#10;&#10;You may not move through a blocked doorway nor into an occupied room, and you must take a step if you can. The monster can't move through blocked doorways and always takes the shortest unblocked path in pursuit.&#10;&#10;First player caught is the loser.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to manoeuvre the War Craft to capture the opponents Flagship.&#10;&#10;In each Battlefleet there are three types of War Craft, and a Flagship.  These all have different values of mobility and attacking power.  The two players take it in turns to move the pieces anywhere on the playing board in an effort to capture the opponents flagship.&#10;&#10;The War Craft may be used independently or combined to increase their power.  However, when pieces are combined their mobility is reduced.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Politically, they must track the relations their kingdom has with each of the other 15 kingdoms on the map (a record sheet is provided for this purpose) - there are six possible relations two kingdoms can have with each other, following the description of Kautilya, a great Indian political theorist. The military sphere is not neglected, as there are fairly elaborate rules for invasion of other kingdoms, battles, and sieges.&#10;&#10;Additional rules include those for monarch abilities, monarch death, and the famous Indian horse sacrifice.&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the player with the greatest percentage increase in their resource levels.&#10;&#10;Crows &amp; Owls was produced by the author in a fairly small edition - an article in Simulacrum magazine put the total at 95 copies.&#10;&#10;",

You need to provide a token to represent you on the board, 1D6, and paper and pencil to keep track of your character and the number of turns spent in the tomb.&#10;&#10;&quot;In this solitaire game, you are the explorer, seeking treasure in old tombs. Each turn, more of the crypt is revealed as you travel along the dark and dusty tunnel. Each game is different, and danger lurks around   every corner.&#10;&#10;The object of this quest is the recovery of the Pharaoh's Scepter.&quot;&#10;&#10;Place the starting tile face up. &quot;The character moves through the various rooms and corridors depicted on those tiles. Each turn, when the character wants to move in a direction not yet explored, a tile is picked at random from the unused pile and placed in the direction the player is moving. Make sure the corridors line up with each other. If there is more than one possible way to align the corridors, the orientation is up to the player. The token representing the player is then moved to the new section.&#10;&#10;After a player has moved, look at the new tile. If it has a letter in the center, refer to the lettered paragraphs at the end of the rules. If the tile has a door, it must be opened. If the tile has no letter, then a roll must be made for Wandering Monsters.&quot;&#10;&#10;Basically, you explore the crypt (looking for the Scepter), fighting monsters and picking up magical items when you can. The tiles in my copy are missing the identifying text on the tiles that are not supposed to be blank; however, you can figure it out without them.&#10;&#10;You must complete your quest - to return alive with the Pharaoh's Scepter - within 40 turns. For more of a challenge, reduce the number of turns allowed.&#10;&#10;",

However, the game itself is quite fun. The game rules include information about how to take the lessons learned into real life and where to find further information.&#10;&#10;The game is also notable for being a partnership project between a UK government department (the Environment Agency) and two non-governmental organizations (The Groundwork Trust and the WWF).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Invasion is a simple wargame concerning a hypothetical invasion of England by an unnamed enemy.&#10;&#10;The map shows a square grid superimposed on a map of southeast England, the Channel, and a small section of France and the North Sea (there is a Channel tunnel, interestingly enough). Each player has a small number of men (14 for the English player, 12 for the enemy player) which move from square to adjacent square, or farther if using railway lines. Pieces on adjacent squares may be captured. The enemy player's objective is to move a piece into London, the English player's to capture all the enemies before this happens.&#10;&#10;There is an &quot;extended&quot; set of rules which turn this basic abstract system into a bit more of a wargame. Naval movement is now differentiated from land movement (and much faster), the English player may make greater use of the railways than the enemy player, pieces require support to capture opposing pieces, etc. It is also suggested that an umpire be used so that each player only knows the position of his or her pieces.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by F. H. Ayres in a book, Handbook of REVERSI and other new GAMES of SKILL. INVASION. HALMA. FANORONA. Explanations. Rules, Problems and Suggestions to Players, and also in a boxed version (publisher unknown). The book version was reprinted in Sid Sackson's game column in Strategy &amp; Tactics #21, from which all this information is taken.&#10;&#10;",

The castle needs to hold out until the wagon train and its defending Lansquenets arrive, or until the rest of the Count's knights return from the tournament in Quedlinburg.&#10;&#10;The rules are close tactical, with each figure representing a single man. They are designed for 40mm Elastolin figures and accessories, but since they give movement allowances and firing ranges in numbers of sectors (squares) rather than inches, the game could easily be played in other scales or even as a board game. The rules are fairly elaborate, with sections for hidden movement, sallies, scaling ladders, supplies, morale, etc.&#10;&#10;Siege of Bodenburg was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics Volume I, Numbers 6-10. It is misspelled &quot;Siege of Bodenberg&quot; on the cover of issue #6 and on the map in that issue. Bodenstedt also printed up copies of the rules which he gave out in his store and at conventions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the kids version of the famous The Farming Game.  This game has three levels of play for harvesting your crops:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The first level is for kids ages 3-5.  It consists of rolling a red die (values 1-3) and moving the number of spaces indicated by the die roll.  If you land on a type of produce, you get a matching card for it.  If they land on a school bus or playground, they get nothing.  The first player to reach the end stops the game.  All players count their cards and the one with the most wins.&#10;     The second level is for kids ages 5-7.  Again, you roll the red die to move, but instead of collecting produce cards when you land on a produce space, you roll a white die (values 1-6) and match it with a produce rate card to see how much money you sold that produce for.  You then get it in play money.  The first player to reach the end stops game play and all count their money.  The one with the most money wins.&#10;     The third level is for kids ages 7-9.  This combines the aspects of levels 1 and 2 and adds additional complexity.  When you land on a produce space, you get the matching produce card.  You can then roll the white die to sell the produce, or keep the card.  If you keep it, the next time you land on that produce space, you get another card.  You then have two of a kind.  If you want to sell them, roll the white die, consult the rate chart, and sell all of your cards of that produce.  The one who makes it to the end, stops the gameplay and the one who has the most money wins.  You can also trade cards with other players before the red move die is rolled.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game has a colorful board and easy-to-read rate charts and money.&#10;Even parents can find amusement with this game.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    The Farming Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Barbarian is a tactical simulation of combat between the armies of Rome and her early barbarian foes, the Samnites and Gauls, from 315-200 B.C. To play Barbarian, you will need the game SPQR for maps, basic rules, and some counters. Barbarian can also be played with the Simple Great Battles of History Rules.&#10;&#10;As Rome strove to conquer the Italian peninsula in the Fourth and Third Centuries BCE, her most formidable opponents were not the advanced Etruscans, nor the crafty Greeks. Instead, it was the barbarian tribes that nearly overcame Rome: the savage warriors of Cisalpine Gaul and the fierce hill tribe fighters of Samnium.&#10;&#10;The nimble mountain warriors of Samnium taught the Romans the advantages of a more flexible formation over the ponderous phalanx. After suffering a sharp reverse at Lautulae, 315, the Romans recovered and dealt a counterstroke at Tifernum, 297 in two battles representative of the many fierce fights between these implacable foes. The political genius of the Samnite general Gellius Aegnatius welded former foes Samnium, Etruria, Umbria and the Gauls into a grand coalition that nearly broke the power of Republican Rome at Sentinum, 295. This battle, more than any other, decided the fate of Italy.&#10;&#10;Even as the Samnites and their peninsular allies were subdued, the Gauls arose to carry on the struggle. Calling on reinforcements from across the Alps, the Gauls invaded Italy in 225 and only by a stroke of fortune was this army trapped between two Roman consular armies at Telamon. The battle that followed was one of the most unusual in all of military history, with the Gauls fighting in desperation in two opposite directions, as Roman armies closed in from north and south. Finally, just after Rome had withstood Hannibal&rsquo;s devastating invasion, Hamilcar, a die-hard Carthaginian officer, raised the Gallic tribes for one last great battle at Cremona, 200. In the end, Rome emerged victorious and dominated the Italian peninsula from the straits of Messina to the Alps.&#10;&#10;",

Or play the Countdown Card to force someone to make a play and gain control of the board.  Don't wait for your turn, either, play any of these any time you want!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zards puts a twist on the trick-taking card game.   When a player takes the trick, he is allowed to cast a spell to manipulate the rules governing the rest of the round (when possible). The further the game progresses, the more spells become available.&#10;&#10;The game is played from a unique deck of 84 cards ordered by three characteristics: rank, set, and suit. The rank corresponds with the card's spell level. As players increase their score and achieve new levels, more spells open up to them.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players split the 13 cards dealt to them into a wand of 10 cards and a bag of 3 cards. The wand determines which cards are played during the round, while the bag is a selection of pre-determined spells to cast during the round. Spells are only cast by a player taking the trick.&#10;&#10;Zards is unique to other trick-taking games:&#10;    * Zards is adjustable to play 3 to 6 players without the need to add or remove cards from the deck.&#10;    * By not dealing out the entire deck, the ability to accurately count cards is reduced, providing more comfort for novices playing against experts.&#10;    * Players can manipulate the rules for the round with a selection of over 20 spells.&#10;    * Each round allows the player in last place the advantage of playing first. Though, maintaining the lead depends on how cards are played and spells are cast.&#10;&#10;",

An elaborate plan was created and carried out without a loss. Iraqi resistance was non-existent. With the town in British hands, the attacking force was dispersed elsewhere. The British did not think the Iraqis would counterattack. On May 22, in the early morning, the Iraqi 6th Brigade\\3rd Division (800 men) with CV33 tankettes attacked. Iraqi artillery pulverized the two British companies holding the town in their trenches surrounding it. They were forced to pull back into the town. The three Iraqi battalions with tanks were as good as the British by accounts in combat but for one thing: steady morale. From 3 a.m. to 10 a.m., the two British companies held but were nearing their end in this urban type combat. Luckily, the Luftwaffe had failed to support this attack (although they did the following day!). At 10 a.m., the tables began to turn when two additional British companies arrived. The battle did not stop but raged onward until the Iraqis gave up at 6 p.m. The road to Baghdad was now open. It had been a near thing!&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;1 11x17 inch map&#10;160 counters, &#10;Player aids&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;company\\platoon &#10;1 hex = 100 yds&#10;1 turn = 1.5 hours for a total of 11 turns.&#10;&#10;",

It works fine for engagements of up to four vessels a side (thus allowing 8 players to participate), beyond that things tend to drag a bit.&#10;'Small-scale' at the moment also implies that the ships captained are smallish merchants, pirates and navy ships. The rules will be expanded to include line-of-battle ships later on.&#10;The game is not tied to a particular line of models or a scale. You can play with anything from 1/1.200th to 1/300th scale ship models.&#10;The rules sport a fair amount of complexity in order to keep managing a single ship a tactical challenge. Still, the rules essentially aim at gaming, not simulation.&#10;&#10;Lastly, 'LoMaR' is a hobby project which its author would like to share. &#10;That is to say: any feedback on the game or new input is welcome, be that criticism of the rules, adding new ship sheets, expanding the rules to different periods or styles of naval warfare (the galleys of Lepanto) or writing scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

The game uses cards which depict plays to simulate football game.  Includes Football field board and metal football, plus both offensive and defensive play cards.  The game does not include a board, per se. Rather, the football field is printed on the box bottom. It is expected that you will punch small pilot holes in this box bottom with the included pushpin. The plastic football token for tracking the scrimmage line has a spike that can be wedged into these holes as you advance down the field.&#10;&#10;The game is played by both players playing cards, one offensive, the other defensive.  The strategy of the game comes from trying to force your opponent to play inopportune cards, such as ones that will cause a turnover, and guessing when they will play those cards, so that you can capitalize on it.  Significant luck is involved, but there's also playing the odds through card counting and outguessing your opponent.&#10;&#10;",

And each battle takes only a couple of hours, as well as being very playable solitaire.&#10;&#10;Palo Alto: May 8, 1846. The opening battle of the war, what looks to be a straightforward Napoleonic battle line special but ends up nothing of the sort, thanks to Ringgold's &quot;flying artillery&quot;, grass fires, and a cast of most unusual characters.&#10;&#10;Resaca de la Palma: May 9, 1846. A numerically superior Mexican force in an extremely strong defensive position, mostly hidden from the incoming Americans. One of the most unusual battlefields in gaming, the scenario is given a variety of gaming possibilities as well as two-player hidden deployment.&#10; Contreras: August 20, 1847. An assumedly unassailable and unapproachable Mexican position is trumped by some great scouting work by a young Robert E. Lee, resulting in a Mexican rout. But it did not have to happen that way. Maybe Santa Anna will use his reserves to negate the American attack. Maybe it will turn out completely differently.&#10;&#10;Puebla: May 5, 1862. A venture into another way, for the battle that resulted in the well-known Mexican holiday, Cinco de Mayo. A strong division of veteran French soldiers, fighting for the Emperor Maximilian, attack a nicely-defended Mexican position right outside this important, of-fought-over city. Cavalry charges, assaults on forts, and a rather prescient use of trenches result in a nicely balanced game.&#10;&#10;Components &#10;&#10;    Two 33&quot;x22&quot; mapsheets (each with 2 battles) &#10;    One sheet of counters &#10;    Battle Rules &#10;&#10;&#10;You will need GRINGO to play the battles herein.&#10;&#10;(adapted description from publisher)&#10;&#10;",

For example, players with a base score of 90 and cards 41 and 45 would score 22.5 points.  The player with the smaller number in each pair gets a 5 point bonus.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, first place gets 5 points, second place gets 4 points, etc.  At the end of five rounds the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;There are several variants:&#10;&#10;1) Lying - players do not have to reveal their actual card numbers.&#10;&#10;2) Cheating - players can cancel a marriage if they find a better partner.  Players who are dumped receive a 5 point bonus on the round.  Emptied spaces on the score track are not refilled.&#10;&#10;3) The Big Trick - play the game with two different groups.  With one group, describe the game mathematically.  With the other, describe it romantically.  Compare the differences in behavior of the players.&#10;&#10;Love and Marriage was created for a middle school teacher who was looking for a good interactive classroom game on the subject of love and marriage.
