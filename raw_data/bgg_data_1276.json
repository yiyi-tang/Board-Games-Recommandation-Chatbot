If you&rsquo;ve ever played trick-taking games like Spades or Hearts, climbing games are a little bit like that, but with poker hands instead of singles cards, and the tricks can go around the circle multiple times.&#10;&#10;The big difference between Willow and other climbing games is that most combos stay on the table after they are played and can be &#10;added to (like in German Rummy). This makes it a lot easier for more players to play in more Tricks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rules&#10;&#10;Nebuchadnezzar is a game of annihilation for two players. Not only are draws impossible in Nebuchadnezzar, almost any game of Nebuchadnezzar played to its conclusion will end with a board completely filled with a single color of disc.&#10;&#10;Materials: A square board of any size (nothing bigger than 15x15 is recommended due to the amount of recycling and potential number of moves along with the amount of mechanical flipping involved) and an unlimited supply of discs with each player's color on either side. Go stones can also be used if you're willing to replace them instead of flip discs. (note: If you have an Othello set, 8x8 is a fine size to get started with)&#10;&#10;Objective: wipe your opponent completely off the board!&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Starting with black, on his turn a player may place a disc with his color facing up as long as it isn't orthogonally adjacent to exactly 1 enemy disc and 3 empty points. He may alternatively capture enemy discs according to the following convention. He cannot place and capture on the same turn.&#10;&#10;A player may flip a rectangle of discs consisting purely of enemy discs, if the following qualifications are met&#10;&#10;&#10;     The rectangle is entirely bounded by single-colored walls (of discs) on all 4 of its sides&#10;     The player owns the majority of the perimeter created by these walls &#10;     The rectangle is not part of a bigger rectangle meeting these criteria.&#10;&#10;&#10;Edge rule: If one or more of the walls bounding a rectangle are board edges these will take on the color of the parallel walls opposite to them. If a rectangle is bounded by two opposite board edges then these are considered to be neutral walls.&#10;&#10;Forced passing: You automatically pass your turn if no legal move is available for you on your turn. Otherwise passing is not permitted&#10;&#10;Pie: After the first move, the second player may choose to switch colors instead of playing a disc of his color for his first move.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Your goals are to take your objectives while trying to keep as many of your men alive as possible during realistic tactical missions.&#10;&#10;T34 Leader features various historical campaigns that can be played as individual campaigns or linked to form one huge mega-campaign that follows your troops from the Invasion of Poland to the final battles on the Eastern and Western fronts.&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Europe, the first two decades of the eighteenth century were characterised by almost constant warfare. Western and Central Europe had been involved in the Nine Years&rsquo; War that ended in 1697. The peace was shortlived and by 1701 Western Europe was once again plunged into a new conflict, the War of Spanish Succession. Elsewhere, Denmark, Russia, Saxony and eventually Prussia all sought to dismember the Swedish Empire and share it amongst themselves. This conflict, known as the Great Northern War, was to last over twenty years.&#10;&#10;Designed to refight the battles of the period, In Deo Veritas: Captain General is an expansion book for the popular rule set In Deo Veritas. The rules focus on the command decisions needed to maintain the motivation of the army. The battle scenarios offer the player a series of different challenges from the wars of the early eighteenth century.&#10;&#10;Battles are played at the brigade level with all major elements on 75mm/3&quot; wide bases. Using smaller scale figures (6-15mm) lets players give their units a realistic feel. The ground scale of 1&quot; = 40yds means the typical 6ft x 4 ft table is large enough to accommodate most battles of the period.&#10;&#10;Most players will already have everything needed to play (d6, tape measure and a deck of cards). More scenarios and game support will become available in the future.&#10;&#10;To learn the rules will take 2 hours or so using some of the smaller battles. Once you have become familiar with the core elements then your games will flow more quickly and a larger battle such as Blenheim should last for 3-4 hours depending on the arrival of the reinforcements.&#10;&#10;Nothing is certain, but generals that hone their skills are more likely to be victorious.&#10;&#10;You will need a copy of In Deo Veritas: Fast Play Rules for Exciting Seventeenth Century Battles in Smaller Scales to use this book.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

These books will lead the players through a story that unfolds during the game and offers greater immersion into the Valeria setting. New rules and cards will be introduced in each book, some lasting only through the current book and some persisting through the unfolding Saga, somewhat like a &quot;legacy game&quot;.&#10;&#10;Darksworn uses six book-decks to tell a story of wonder, sacrifice, and adventure as you explore the territory west of Valeria and encounter a darkness that cannot go unchecked. Each book presents you with a set of new rules and several tasks that must be completed by your gaming group in order to advance to the next book in the saga. Within each book you'll find special boons to assist you and powerful monsters to challenge you. Your team will have to strike a balance between building effective tableaus of citizens that will allow you to complete the tasks and defending the decreasing center stacks of citizens that are the health of your kingdom.&#10;&#10;The play area for Darksworn is much the same as an ordinary game of Valeria: Card Kingdoms, but there are some notable changes. The story board sits above the monster row. This is where each book's story and challenges are presented, where new rules are displayed, and where citizens captured by monster attacks languish in a dark oubliette. Walls provide additional protection from the attacking monsters, but if they make it past the walls, your citizen stacks are going to suffer. At the bottom of the play area is the Blessings Board where your devotion to the radiance of Aquila can grant you special powers, free captured citizens, and even rebuild fallen walls. If any of the monsters make it through to the Blessings Board, however, all is lost.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When the autumn comes and ice gets thicker, the emperor penguins go inland to mate. After partnering, the female lays one single egg. Worn out by the effort of laying the egg, the penguin mothers set out to sea to regain her strength and nourish, while the father takes care of the egg during the cold Antarctic winter.&#10;&#10;About two and a half months later, the chicks will be born, hungry, waiting for their mother, who brings food, while their fathers provide them with heat. Soon the mothers will arrive with their belly full of fish, that will be used to feed their chicks. The fathers will now be able to run to the sea to feed after about for months of fasting.&#10;&#10;This game is setted up at this point, where the mothers are arriving in large columns from the ocean to find their partners and chicks and feed the young and let the manes run for the fish.&#10;&#10;To represent that, we will have a big pile of &quot;father and chick&quot; cards at the center of the table (grouped together to avoid the cold of the antarctica), and each player will have a bunch of &quot;mother penguin&quot; cards. To recognize each other, the penguins sing the songs they sang during the mating. So, to pair the couples, you will have to find which ones are singing the same song (this is: they have the same notes with the same order and color). The twist here, is that to simulate the chaos of the mothers arriving, every player will be looking for the matches at the same time in the central pile of cards!&#10;&#10;The first player to match all his/her mothers with the partners and chicks, will win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Every year, just before winter, hives around the world kick out all the Drone bees so that the Workers and the Queen can survive through the winter and come back strong in the spring. The game is based on this.&#10;&#10;In Hivernation, two players (or two teams of two players) receive a stack of 20 double sided, hexagonal bee tiles (one side Workers, one side Drones) as well as 3 specialty tiles chosen at random (or, for fairness, 2 flower tiles and 1 bear tile).&#10;&#10;The Queen Zizi Tile is placed in the center of the play space and players take turns playing tiles from their stack. They can attach to Queen Zizi or their own bees but not directly to their opponents bees. When the two sides meet, each player, on their turn, can start converting their opponents tiles to their own by sandwiching their opponents tiles between two of their own and flipping the tiles in between to show the opposite side. There are opportunities to flip tiles in multiple directions at once as well. When a player does this they've made a multi-directional play and  they're awarded another specialty tiles chosen from the stack at random.&#10;&#10;Or they can modify game play by using one of those specialty tiles to flip tiles in a ring, stop tiles from being flipped or removing them from the game completely. The winner is the player with more of their tiles face up when the first player runs out of bee tiles to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Dice combinations resolve into strikes on various hit locations on their opponents or into defensive options such as blocking and taunting. A built-in rage meter lets fighters on the ropes turn the damage they've suffered into powerful dice mitigation and combo attacks to battle back from the brink of defeat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Oh, and remember &ndash; do not let the competition outsmart you!&#10;The fight to stay on screen and be loved by the crowds is neither easy nor simple.

The producers will do anything to reach their goal.&#10;&#10;How the gameplay looks:&#10; When creating their teams, players also build their own deck of Action Cards. Action cards allow you to move characters on the board, build a pool of &quot;fans&quot; or use special actions (buying new contracts, weapons, using special abilities of characters, etc.). Action cards also determine the order (initiative) in which players can move.&#10; The game is divided into 12 rounds. In each of them, players draw 4 cards and, by playing it alternately, make their moves according to the initiative and the actions assigned to them. They can also use Intrigue Cards - which make the game more difficult for other players. At the start of each new game round, an Event card is drawn that describes &quot;what's new&quot; happened in the program and what circumstances need to be resolved - but this is also possible during the round (players can also initiate their own events themselves).&#10; Characters moving on the board can fight each other. Fight is done by using and influencing a pool of dice (re-rolls, changes to results due to character and / or weapon abilities, etc.). Players earn points for eliminating characters and completing contracts. They can also earn special bonuses for special achievements (most participant eliminations, top performer, last survivor, etc.)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Both players will roll their basketball die and compare the number rolled with their basketball player's skill number of the shot that is being attempted. If the player's skill number is equal to or exceeds the number the player rolled on his/her die, then the scoring attempt is successful. The player gains the number of points the shot attempt awards (1,2, or 3 points). Players then move their scoring marker on their player scoreboard.&#10;&#10;Players will repeat this process until the Shot Attempt Deck is depleted. This completes a quarter. The game consists of 4 quarters. After all 4 quarters, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Keepsakes, players create a line of memories, competing to select, arrange, and recall those memories in order to gain the most Keepsakes, representing the player's score. Players start with two Keepsakes, and may gain or lose more as they complete challenges and recite the line of memories, represented by various face-up and face-down cards. Players take turns by drawing a new memory card, adding it to the line of memories, defining the memory, and reciting the line of memories in order, starting with the first one played. Players may then call out if the person seems to have done something incorrectly, with Keepsakes trading hands accordingly. Each memory card is different; they may require players to say something only they know, something they can see, something that they prefer, etc. Sometimes tasks appear, requiring players to complicate their turns, or players can opt for available challenges to increase their Keepsake collection. Some memory cards may reorder the memory line or be turned face-down, forcing players to reorient themselves or risk losing Keepsakes. Play ends when any player has zero Keepsakes remaining or the memory deck runs out, and whoever has the most Keepsakes wins (ties permitted. With that in mind players can opt to play cooperatively instead to attempt to gather the most Keepsakes collectively.&#10;&#10;",

The two sticks are stuck through this hole and made to form an X.  The shot is then taken by quickly pulling apart your hands so that the Aero is forced to fly forward.  Depending on where you land on the board you can score or knock your opponents back.&#10;&#10;The game is won by scoring enough times to advance your marker to the end of it's track and then tagging the KOOBA in the center.&#10;&#10;",

In Storm Chasers, players manipulate the weather across region tiles to maximize their film footage of Thunderstorms and tornadoes as they sweep through regions.&#10;&#10;In a turn, a player can use cards in their hand to benefit themselves or to affect other players. They can move from one region tile to another to increase the number of regions they will view when a storm is activated.

Players can clear rubble left from previous tornadoes, and complete special assignments to earn additional income. A player's turn ends by activating a storm using a card from their hand. Income or loss of income due to damage are subsequently dealt to each player who is affected by the activated storm. But players should be careful not to get to sure of themselves. The competition is fierce, you never know when a competing storm chaser might surprise you by adding an unanticipated challenge.&#10;&#10;After 4-6 rounds (depending on player count of 2-4 players) the player with the highest earned income value wins and is awarded the coveted &quot;Eye of the Storm Award&quot; for excellence in extreme weather videography.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Congratulations Pitizens! You and your families have been volunteered to help humanity reclaim the Earth by establishing a settlement in No-Man&rsquo;s-Land. You have been resettled from the Hub to a promising location and it is now your duty to follow the Committees&rsquo; directive to ensure this settlement prospers. Should you be successful in your endeavours, you will be granted an official &lsquo;Thank You&rsquo; from the Committee. Best of luck!&#10;&#10;In Volunteer Exile Programme players take the role of a Pitizen &ldquo;volunteered&rdquo; to manage a new settlement in the wasteland (consisting of a tableau) in order to try and earn the approval of the Committee.&#10;Each turn they follow the Committee&rsquo;s directive and attempt to perform as many actions as they can or wish.  The directive will include actions such as:&#10; &bull; Draw a card into your hand,&#10; &bull; Play a card into your Settlement or the Directive,&#10; &bull; Discard a card from your Settlement or the Directive,&#10; &bull; Place a Raider,&#10; &bull; Eliminate a Raider,&#10; &bull; Move a Pitizen&#10;&#10;Adding locations to the settlement will provide the player with bonuses for building and attacking.  Attracting Pitizens to those locations provide additional bonuses to the settlement and to the wider wasteland.  Attracting Raiders, however, removes all these bonuses and renders the location usefulness.&#10;&#10;As players are adding to their settlement, the directive and moving Pitizens and Raiders, the availability and usefulness of the available actions will change as well as limits on useable Pitizens, Raiders and your carry over hand size.&#10;&#10;The game continues in rounds until the Committee approval process is triggered when a player meets one of the end-game objectives set at the start of the game.  The players then sum up their Action points, their Settlement value plus any Raiders they eliminated and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle is developed primarily for those people who are just starting to play wargames. It is based on the classic mechanics of wargames, which implies the presence of a playing field, divided into hexagons (with different types of terrain), game pieces reflecting combat units and the use of the so-called &quot;Battle Table&quot;. Combat pieces-tokens move around the game map, spending their &quot;movement points&quot; - the more &quot;movement points&quot;, the higher the speed of the unit. The main characteristic of the unit is its &quot;combat strength&quot;. When troops enter a battle, then, depending on the &quot;combat strength&quot; of the units participating in it, a column is selected in the &quot;Battle Table&quot;, on which players roll a die, which is used as a random number generator. The more the player has gathered strength in battle, the higher his chances of success.&#10;&#10;In Battle players will control &quot;armies&quot; roughly corresponding to the troops of France, Russia, Germany and Great Britain in the second half of the 19th century - the opponents will have approximately more or less the same number of chips, However, each army has its own small characteristic national &quot;flavor&quot;. Having become familiar with the game principles, the player can almost easily join the world of the historical tabletop wargame by turning to more complex game developments. In them, already dedicated to specific historical operations, it will be possible to lead &quot;real&quot; armies on historically accurate maps and try to achieve specific military goals that faced the real commanders of that era.&#10;&#10;We are confident that as a result, our game will be interesting to everyone. For beginners, it&rsquo;s like getting to know the first wargame, for sophisticated connoisseurs, it&rsquo;s like a simple &ldquo;tournament&rdquo; balanced game that can be played quickly and easily in half an hour.&#10;&#10;",
