Movement is made by turning over one of 36 hidden tiles numbered 1-6 (using the tile that the previous player turned over is not allowed). Depending on the space you land on you may move again, must end your turn or go to the end of the caravan. Overlapped camels are out of the race. Last camel in wins.&#10;&#10;Mainly a memory game with some nice racing elements in it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Monopoly with a couple of interesting twists.  For kids, the most interesting twists are the canine theme.  All the markers are dogs, the spaces around the board are different breeds, jail has become &quot;the pound&quot; and the houses are actually doghouses.  Community Chest and Chance morph into Trees and Telephone poles (less sophomoric than it sounds) and instead of bank error in your favor you get rewarded for running off the dogcatcher or you have to go to the vet. The theme encourages a more light hearted approach than the serious real estate game.&#10;&#10;For adults the best &quot;twists&quot; are those that speed up the action.  The game does not require you to own all the territories of a given color before you can build a doghouse.  You can only build as many doghouses as you have territories of that color, but you don't have to own them all.  For instance, yellow in Dogopoly has three territories, if you own two of them you could have two doghouses on each, even if the third is unowned, or even owned by another player.  Whenever you first buy a territory you are also given the option to immediately buy a doghouse at half-price.  Taken together these little twists make the game go much faster.&#10;&#10;There are few other twists, like the addition of shortcut paths across the board that can reroute players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "First was published 'Corona' (1974). Moonstar (1981) added planets and variants&#10;(variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). &#10;'Harun' (1984) is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! &#10;'Orbit' (1993) a new variation including the Corona variations &amp; Harun.&#10;Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his 'Rasende Roboter' ('Ricochet Robots') (1999) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.&#10;&#10;Quite possibly the first &quot;German&quot; game to cross the Atlantic...&#10;&#10;About the game (from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.&#10;&#10;Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.&#10;&#10;The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.&#10;&#10;The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.&#10;&#10;The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.&#10;&#10;But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard&#10;    15 moon pieces&#10;    21 planet pieces&#10;    1 minute sand timer&#10;    11 6-sided dice&#10;    rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Corona&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Orbit&#10;    Ricochet Robots&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In the Borderlands, survival is an exception.&#10;&#10;Gearworld: The Borderlands is a game of conquest and survival in a post-apocalyptic world for 2-4 players who must gather resources and use them wisely. Players need those resources in order to strengthen their military might, to enhance their transport capabilities, and to reach the final goal of building the skyworks. Resources can be produced in areas with resource tokens, traded with other players, and taken by force. To build a development &ndash; e.g., weapons, transport vehicles or skyworks &ndash; all of the required resources have to be located in the same space on the map. This makes effective transport an important issue in the game. At the same time players must be strong enough to protect their resources from the other players while investing resources in their skyworks in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Seize territory, marshal resources and defend yourself from your rivals.

Each player has three effort tokens: one (low), three (medium), and six (high). Each player, in turn, will assign one effort token face down to any Challenge card. After all the players have assigned their effort tokens, the events on the Challenge cards are resolved. One Challenge card at a time, the effort tokens are revealed and the winner of the event is determined. Each player total one&rsquo;s own Effort tokens plus the Attribute rating called for by the card, plus alliance bonuses (from Tribute cards not already in play) plus a die roll. The player with the highest total wins the event and the approval rating associated with the event.&#10;&#10;Three End of Day cards were shuffled into the Event deck at the beginning of the game.

    "Description": "This is a simple plain-trick game, suitable for children. It seems to be played mostly in Britain, and is often called by the alternative name Trumps. Any number from two to seven may play. A session consists of seven hands, of diminishing size.&#10;&#10;A 52-card pack is used, with four suits ranking from high to low A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. A player is selected to deal, and deals seven cards each, clockwise. The uppermost of the undealt cards is turned face upwards to indicate the trump suit.&#10;&#10;The player on dealer's left leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can, otherwise they may play any card. Each trick is won by the highest trump in it; otherwise by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;After the first hand, a second hand is dealt, by the next player in order around the table, with only six cards each. The game continues like this, with one fewer card per player on each hand, until the final hand consists of one card each.&#10;&#10;The winner of most tricks on the first hand chooses the trump suit on the second hand, and so on (i. e. the winner of the second hand chooses trump for the third hand, etc.). If there is a tie for who took most tricks, the players involved in the tie cut cards for the right to choose trumps.  A player who takes no tricks at all in a hand is knocked out, is dealt no more cards, and takes no further part in the game.  There is one exception to the rule about being knocked out: the first player during the game who takes no tricks on a hand is not knocked out immediately but is awarded the &quot;dog's life&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the winner of the one trick on the final hand. Or if all but one of the players are knocked out before this, the surviving player is the winner.&#10;&#10;Source: pagat.com&#10;&#10;",

But he had no need of the moon to locate his target, his eyes were able to see in the darkness better than anyone else. He moved slowly, not to avoid making any noise, his movements were always soft, almost ethereal: never in his eternal life he had been sensed by his prey; a few more steps and he would be on target. It was there, unaware, helpless in front of his attack: a quickly and decisively move and it&rsquo;s neck would not have even realized to be drilled. No worries, no tension, the cold calm that always filled him, made him perfect for this task. Suddenly the beating of wings, a night bird, inappropriate and unwanted, alerted the defenseless creature. But it was too late to avoid the arrow...&#10;H. - Why he doesn&rsquo;t use his tentacles to destroy it?&#10;B.- Which vampire has tentacles or shoots arrows?&#10;J.- From immemorial time, orcs are killed by elves with bow and arrows.&#10;B.- You have turned the helpless girl, alone in the dark night, in a putrid orc?! Who can drink the slimy, filthy, black blood of orc?&#10;J- No one will drink the blood of anyone, Bram!&#10;H.- Yes, I agree with John, Cthulhu never drinks anything!&#10;B.- What is this Cthulhu, Howard?&#10;H.- The protagonist of our story, isn&rsquo;t it?&#10;&#10;The Vampire, the Elf and the Cthulhu (VEC) is a strategic card game in which players represent writers who are trying to complete a novel together. That said, VEC is a &quot;light game made for gamers&quot;, not a storytelling game.&#10;&#10;Players must acquire cards through an auction system. Cards represent the writer's ideas: protagonists, characters, events, places, items, encounters. Cards have special powers and players activate them to interact with other players (move cards, turn cards, refill energy, etc). The aim of the game is to move specific cards to a special zone of the table game area, called the NOVEL area. Cards must be placed there in the right sequence and type/color: each player has a different objective with a different sequence and colors, so as the result will be identical/similar to player objective, victory points will be scored. Card powers can be combined resulting in a huge number of play combinations creating many possible strategies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of this game is to assume the identity of a famous American Colonist and collect bounty, money and signatures for the Declaration of Independence. This is done through a series of reenactments of historical events from the landing of the Pilgrims through the American Revolution&#10;&#10;User review: Players start the game with an Identity Card. This tells the player who that person is during the game and what victory conditions must be met in order to win: the number of Signature Cards, bounty units and amount of money. Players also start with $5000 and a pawn on Independence Hall. In turn, players will roll the dice and follow the instructions on whatever space the pawn lands. A player who lands on another player&rsquo;s space sends the latter player to stock where that player must lose one turn. Players are free to barter Signature Cards, bounty units, and money amongst themselves. Every time a player passes Independence Hall that player gets $1000. A player who reaches Independence Hall with the assigned requirements is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Every turn, players can rush to finish their work or sabotage those who are pursuing the same potions they are, and once you've completed a potion, you can keep it for victory points or drink it to try to get even further ahead.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players draw cards and 'transmute' a component from a pool they share with all of the other players at the table in order to produce 'elements' (earth, air, fire, water) that can then be combined to try to match the formulas at the bottom of the potion cards that act as victory points.&#10;&#10;Potions are randomized each game, so each match has its own feel - some are very directly competitive, producing potions that allow players to directly attack one another, and others require more indirection and planning. Analyzing the available potions and trying to predict the interplay between them and the value of victory points vs. the effects of the potions is a key element of play.&#10;&#10;",

Remember where are the high value items hiding, and plan to play the right passenger card at the right time to maximum effect. Whatever you do, don't reveal an inspection card!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Metro City is redeveloping an old industrial district for mixed use (residential, commercial and industrial) and the mayor is offering bonuses to two developers for aesthetic completion of key streets. Can you win greater bonuses than your competitor by strategically building homes, offices, stores, courthouses, parks and malls in ways that upset your opponent&rsquo;s plans for the city?&#10;&#10;The city district is a 6 x 5 grid with 11 named streets. Each street has a mayor's bonus associated with it, from $1 to $15, drawn randomly at the start of the game. Players try to develop each street better than their opponent to claim its bonus.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps a hand of 5 Building tiles out of 20 available to them. When placing a tile on an empty city block, if the tile completes a street (a row or column) they compare the value of their Buildings on the street to their opponent's Buildings to determine who wins the bonus. A straightforward comparison simply involves adding the number of each tile: Residential Buildings count from 1 to 5, Commercial Buildings count from 2 to 6 and Industrial Buildings count from 3 to 7. However, four types of special tiles change how the bonus is determined: a Park or Mall prevents either player's Industrial Buildings from counting towards the bonus on a street; a Power Plant or Mall prevents Residential Buildings from counting towards the bonus. Finally, the Courthouse allows the player to switch the bonuses of two streets.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile on an empty block, a player can discard a Currency token and build over a block they have already developed.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most money wins, and earns a key to the city from the mayor!&#10;&#10;",

This Disney version of Meme the Game is more kid-friendly than the original, and is perfect for the entire family.&#10;&#10;To setup, shuffle the Word Card deck and the Picture Card deck separately, and the oldest player serves as the dealer. Each player receives three Word Cards and three Picture Cards, which are dealt face down and kept private from other players.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to create the funniest &ldquo;meme&rdquo; combining one picture card and one word card from your hand. To start, the first Dealer serves as the &ldquo;judge&rdquo;, who does not submit a meme that round, and other players submit their best picture-and-word combo for the judge to analyze. The judge determines the funniest meme created, and the player who submitted the best meme is given one point. After each round, it is important that every player draw a new word and picture card to bring the total number of cards in his/her hand back up to six (three word cards and three picture cards). From there, the &ldquo;judge&rdquo; responsibilities are passed to the left, and play continues until one player gains five points (that is, wins five rounds with the best meme).&#10;&#10;Contents: 112 picture cards, 88 word cards, and instruction sheet.&#10;&#10;Note: There is another boxed version with 225 picture cards and 175 word cards.&#10;&#10;",

The order that players go out determines the hierarchy for the next round.&#10;&#10;But at the beginning of each round, the QUAO adds a new bizarre QUAO Rule Card to the game. If a player breaks a QUAO Rule, they must draw a card &ndash; and so must all of the lower-ranked players. (Of course, the player who caught them gets immunity!) Over the course of the game, other special cards may come up. Bully Rules are similar to QUAO Rules, but affect only one player. In addition, the lower-ranked players have access to a few special Wild Cards in the deck, but they require players to perform stunts.&#10;&#10;The end result is a card game in which you can rise from the ranks of the chicken proletariat to ruler of The Farm through good play and a lot of luck, but you might also have to win a fashion runway walk-off, talk only through a sock puppet, and never say the word &quot;turn&quot;.&#10;&#10;Good luck, QUAOmrade!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game Play Description&#10;&#10;Exile Sun combines some of the most compelling strategic mechanics in a way that delivers a streamlined, integrated, and fast-paced game of competition and conflict. Simplified deck building, hand management, simultaneous hidden worker placement, a card draft, 6 unique player advantages, and a revolutionary zero-luck combat resolution system ensure that playing Exile Sun is like no other game. Private and public card-based objectives give players options for points, but they must choose carefully when allocating their limited resources. The player with the most points accumulated at the end of three game cycles wins.&#10;&#10;A Game Round&#10;&#10;The game simply consists of cycles where each player in turn makes four fleet moves and then ends their turn by moving a pawn on the 'Timer Track'. The 'Timer Track' triggers events like 'Supply' and 'Battle' that effect all players simultaneously. Once each event is resolved, the player turns continue.&#10;&#10;&#10;            Moves - These moves can be regular movement, scanning an enemy fleet, launching a decoy fleet, and initiating a battle.  &#10;            Events - The battle and supply events are resolved with a mechanic that may be best described as simultaneous hidden worker placement. This unique mechanic involves the use of a control card with 10 sliding tabs. The resulting game play is tense, intuitive, and intensely competitive. &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Theme Overview&#10;&#10;Far off and forgotten, orbiting the Exile star, a fragmented group of Colonial powers is struggling to exist in the harsh environment of their foreign home.  Having been unexpectedly cut off from contact with Earth over two hundred years ago, the process of gaining some economic recovery has been slow and arduous.  With dissension rising among the populace, these leaders must compete to gain military, economic, and technological advantages over each other in a race to lead the united colonies in a mission to contact Earth. Time is short. While an outright planetary assault could express dominance in military power, perhaps luring out and destroying an opposing Flagship or Construction Shipyard can have the same effect using fewer resources. Or hit and run assaults with fleets of strike craft can be equally effective. But be warned, leaders dare not neglect their own colony resources, or their supporters will lose faith in them and they&rsquo;ll fall quickly out of the race.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on the value rolled he must then place that die on a placement card that is less than or equal to that value. Since there can only be one die per placement there is a possibility that he will be unable to place his die due to another player being there or that space being patrolled by a guard, if that is the case he will temporarily lose that die.&#10;&#10;Step 2: Take Action on Placement Card&#10;&#10;After landing on a placement card the player then takes the action associated with that card. Some placements will allow you to collect materials while others let you steal from other players.&#10;&#10;Step 3: Use Material Cards to Craft Items&#10;&#10;Anytime during a players turn they may take two material cards to create a crafted item. Each crafted item has a special ability which helps throughout the game. Some crafted items will alter dice rolls while others make it easier to escape.&#10;&#10;Step 4: Gather the Items for an Escape Plan&#10;&#10;There will be a handful of escape plans that are available for everyone to utilize. Use the escape plans available as a guide on what combination of crafted items you should be creating. Once you have collected the required items needed (2-4 depending on the type of escape plan) you can execute that escape.&#10;&#10;Step 5: Execute an Escape Plan&#10;&#10;In order to successfully escape the player must draw the required success cards needed (Depending on the type of escape plan) one by one. This number is indicated on the escape plan. You may back out at any time but if you fail then you will lose all the items you used during that attempt.&#10;&#10;Step 6: Escape with Two Prisoners&#10;&#10;The first player to escape with two prisoners wins the game&#10;&#10;",

During the game set-up, six differently-colored crystals are hidden underneath six temples placed on the board. An additional eight crystals are laid out on the game board, with four types of golden treasures on display as well, one type in each corner. On a turn, the player rolls the die and gets one of two results:&#10;&#10;&bull; If the die shows one or two colors and the player has a crystal matching one of these colors, then she can move up to two spaces on the board. If she lacks a matching crystal, she picks up a temple and secretly looks inside: if the crystal inside the temple matches, she reveals it, moves her figure up to two spaces, then sets the temple down again, possibly in a new location; if the crystal doesn't match, she replaces the temple and doesn't move.&#10;&#10;&bull; If the die shows a mummy, the player moves her token up to three spaces and moves the mummy three spaces around the outer edge of the board. Any player caught by the mummy leaves a golden treasure (or a crystal if no treasure is held) in that space, then returns to start. The mummy and token movement can be done in either order.&#10;&#10;Land on a crystal or golden treasure that you don't have, and you can claim it. Collecting crystals helps you move more consistently, and collecting treasures is how you win the game. The rules include a few variants for mummy movement and crystal power.&#10;&#10;",

In this case, they may place a pyramid of any value. &#10;The board has inset spaces to take the cubes at an angle for stacking the number cubes. A player forms a pyramid by having using three dice on the same level to form a base. Add together the numbers on the bases of these three cubes. The cube placed on the apex of this pyramid must match the last digit of the sum of numbers on the bases. (example: the base is formed of the numbers 5,7,9. The sum is 21.

    "Description": "Kamakura is a game of feudal Japanese warfare in which you attempt to defeat an opponent by taking their territories before they take yours; this is done by carefully choosing combinations of weapons, soldiers, and arrow barrages to attack with, while defending your own territories with a myriad of defensive techniques. Strategy, deception, and bravery will be your most valuable assets in the complex and varied game of Kamakura.&#10;&#10;The game features original artwork and game play.  The premise of the game is to capture all of your opponents territories OR gain a score of 17 or more. You combine various soldiers each with unique abilities with crafty weapons in order to take territories as your own. The mechanics behind the game are card management and general strategy.&#10;&#10;As of 2014 edition:&#10;&#10;Gameplay;&#10;We&rsquo;ve decided to introduce &ldquo;Clan Power&rdquo; cards. Each deck comes with 1 Clan Power card for each Clan, totaling 4 Clan Power cards per deck. Each Clan Power is unique, adding new strategic elements and depth. &#10;To compensate for adding the new Clan Power cards we took away 1 Naginata and 1 Yumi (the two most powerful weapons). The deck now totals 54 cards. &#10;Color coded backs have been added for easy sorting with their corresponding Clans.&#10;&#10;Updated Territories;&#10;Barrages and Walls now have point values. 1 barrage (Attack Power of 2) can take either the Farm or Village, but 2 barrages (total Attack Power of 4) are needed to take a Fortress or Palace. Walls now have a Defense Power of 2.&#10;Walls also have the ability to scout territories. For example, 1 Barrage can be played on a palace, if your opponent doesn&rsquo;t have a wall, they must still reveal the Territory, but it cannot be captured.&#10;Even though the Barrage now has an Attack Power, it still may NOT be used with a soldier.&#10;&#10;Refined Card UI;&#10;Along with enhanced card and box quality we wanted to address the card design and how they explained themselves. We rethought how to phrase the descriptions and abilities of every single card. This led us to add slight iconography to the cards to further help explain the context that each card may be used in. At the top right of the Abilities box is either a sword, shield, flag or a combination of sword and shield.&#10;&#10;For more info on the 2014 edition refer to the updates section of the Kickstarter for the 2011 edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Camelot, players vie for control of Excalibur. Each player controls five Arthurs and a host of other Arthurian characters in a heated attempt to grab and retrieve the sword before any other player succeeds in this task.&#10;&#10;On the surface, the game appears to be a very simple wargame, combat being quickly resolved without any dice as characters fight each other. The key to the game, however, is that two players are always taking turns at the same time, the turns being regulated by &quot;turn tokens&quot; that pass around the board. When one player finishes his or her turn, the turn-token is passed to the next player who does not already have one. If one player is a slowpoke taking his turn, then the other turn-token passes around the table, allowing other players to take turns. This forces players to take very fast turns, usually about 5 seconds each, allowing the game to move along with the intensity of a video game. Games usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, even with three to six players.&#10;&#10;Special rules resolve potential conflicts that could occur when two players try to perform actions simultaneously where priority is in question, resolving quickly and simply.&#10;&#10;No player ever quite gets knocked out of the game due to loss of characters; Arthurs always &quot;rejuvenate&quot;, returning to your pile of pieces (your &quot;village&quot;) that can enter the board. Characters start at a chosen entry space at the edge of the board, and move to the center to grab Excalibur, returning the Sword to their entry space to win. Each of the 5 character-types (Merlin, Lancelot, etc) have their own unique abilities, but everyone starts with an identical set of pieces.&#10;&#10;There are also two variants in the rules, allowing players to vary the game by going after the &quot;Accoutrements of Kingship&quot; instead of the Sword, or by gathering a number of gold pieces scattered around the board so as to &quot;buy the kingship&quot;. Tokens are included for these variants.&#10;&#10;The game is very intense and fast, requiring players to think on their feet and make fast realtime decisions; if you are a big fan of slow, deep thinking, strategy games, you might look elsewhere.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a Swedish historical wargame based on Kingmaker. It recreates the historical happenings in around 1306 between King Erik Magnusson and his brothers Duke Erik and Duke Valdemar called the &quot;H&aring;tuna games&quot; which culminated in the &quot;Nyk&ouml;ping Banquet&quot; in December 1317. (See Wikipedia for details.) Since this is a game it might end in different ways!&#10;&#10;The game is intended for three players, but it is of course conceivable that one player plays both the dukes or only one of them. Another interesting feature is that if one of the royal participants die married, the player continue to take part in the game through the wife - one of three princesses - of the deceased.&#10;&#10;",
