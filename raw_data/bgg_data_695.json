    "Description": "This is a team trivia game with a betting element (guessing how many answers your own teammates or the other team will get right).&#10;&#10;The game is played in two teams, team white and team black. Team white starts by drawing a card. Each card contains one general question or overall topic (e.g. &quot;Which of these fungi are edible?) and 6 specific questions (in the example above: names of different fungi). The first player of team white announces the general question for the first player of team black to answer. Before the specific questions are read, a die is thrown to determine which of the two teams (the active player's own team or the opponents) has to guess how many correct answers the active player will be able to give. The number of points gained by the active player's team is determined by both the number of correct answers and by how close the team's guess were. (The system for point allocation is a bit complicated; the game comes with a cardboard dial for determining the number of points.) Then the next player in team white has to answer questions and so on, until one of the tams reaches a  previously established numbers of points (40, 50 or 60 points).&#10;&#10;Question cards come in three different types: &quot;for all ages&quot;, &quot;young players usually have an advantage&quot;, and &quot;more experienced players usually have an advantage&quot;, which allows the players to adjust the level of difficulty. Each player also randomly draws two joker cards, which can be played after the general question has been announced (but before the specific questions are asked) and is then discarded. Joker cards also come in three different types: one allows you to pass on your question to a different member of your team (the &quot;I'd rather you answer&quot; joker), one allows you to take over a question from a member of your team (&quot;I'm an expert in this area, I want to answer this&quot;), and one allows all the team members to answer a question together.&#10;&#10;",

It uses the interactive electronic tiptoi&reg; pen (sold both separately and in combo packages with games).&#10;&#10;The players (or player, as this can either be played cooperatively or solo) are detectives. They are trying to stop Professor Mad, who is wreaking havoc in several places in town (professor's laboratory, zoo, museum, TV studio, open-air concert stage, toy store, detective's headquarters, fast-food restaurant). In order to stop him, they have to complete assignments in all these places. If a player completes an assignment, he/she earns a medal. If an assignment fails, Professor Mad gets the medal instead. The players win if they have more medals than the professor at the end of the game.&#10;  &#10;The electronic pen is used to discover the main game board and the eight location boards. Tapping components with the pen triggers an audio explanation of the components, and the pen also tells the players the English words for the objects whose depiction they have tapped. An info button triggers hints and rules explanations. The pen also functions as a game master and a die: when all players have registered their player tokens, the pen chooses a start player. The active player taps his token with the pen, and the pen tells him how many spaces to move. It also announces three locations as the current targets for assignments. If a player reaches one of these locations, he takes the corresponding location board and tries to complete the assignment. Assignments include things like tapping a correct number or color code, or musical instruments. All the instructions are given by the pen and the players have to associate the English words they hear with the corresponding pictures. When an assignment is completed, the pen announces a new target location. (There are always three active locations, and all eight locations are used in every game.)&#10;&#10;",

Second, the players want to complete the unfinished church La Sagrada Familia. Towards this end, each player gets a number of jigsaw puzzle pieces which they have to buy during the game. The required money is earned by trading in language cards and asset cards. The game ends when one player has bought and laid out all their puzzle pieces and also manages to correctly solve five of the language cards he/she has collected during the game.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics in more detail&#10;&#10;A die determines the players' movement on the game board. The board contains the following types of spaces:&#10;Event spaces and special spaces: The player draws a card from the corresponding stack. Event cards must be played immediately, special cards can be kept until needed.&#10;Attraction spaces: The player receives an asset card of the corresponding tourist attraction. Different attractions have cards worth different amounts of money.&#10;Language spaces: The player gets a language card, which they have to learn during the game. Each language card contains two different words or phrases in German and Spanish.&#10;Metro spaces can be used either as a shortcut to a different metro space, or as an event, special or language space (player's choice).&#10;Bank spaces: On a bank space, the player can exchange asset and language cards for money. To do so, they must have learned the language cards. During an exchange attempt, one asset card and two language cards are submitted. The German words are read out, and if the active player correctly translates them to Spanish, he/she receives the amount of money specified on the asset card. If they fail, they get back their cards and can try again later.&#10;Casa de Pledras spaces: The player can pay for one of his puzzle pieces to be added to the puzzle that is laid out on the table (all players contribute to one puzzle).&#10;&#10;",

The beans they tossed out the window grew a stalk that climbed to the sky, and Jack soon climbed that beanstalk to find out what might be found among the clouds (and to escape further punishment from his lame close-minded parents).&#10;&#10;In the card game Jack and the Beanstalk, players collectively build three beanstalks that will reach for the sky. At the start of the game, three differently-colored root cards showing five potential stalks are placed on the table and each player receives three cards in hand. Each card has a value, with difficult-to-play cards having a higher value.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must play one card to extend the beanstalk of the proper color, if possible; the stalks on the card being played must line up with at least one existing stalk. Whether the player can play a card or not, she ends her turn by drawing a card.&#10;&#10;The card deck includes stalk cards with icons that give the player a special action &ndash; forcing the next player to skip his turn or use a particular color, taking an extra turn, swapping cards with opponents, and landing a golden hen on top of the stalk which prohibits its further growth. The deck also includes one axe card that can be used to cut a stalk back to its roots, removing all growth from the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when all players pass in turn (being unable to play and the deck being empty) or when the 16th card is played on any stalk. In both cases, the player with the lowest sum of cards in hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player receives one order card of each size.&#10;&#10;Master of Pizza lasts 3-5 rounds. In a round, each player starts with 8-10 topping cards in hand; thus, each round consists of 8-10 tricks. The lead player in a trick plays one topping card to the table, then each player follows, with no requirement to follow suit. The highest card in the suit led wins the trick, and the person who played that card collects the topping cards one-by-one, placing those cards in separate stacks by topping type on the table in front of him, with the most recently played (and collected) cards on top.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player decides whether to score for one of his order cards in hand. For each topping shown on the order card, the player scores only the topmost topping card, scoring zero points if that topping is missing. The player then discards the order card.&#10;&#10;The game ends after five rounds or at the end of a round in which at least one player has scored his third order card. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

For example: the Janitor collects the cards that were beaten, the Hangman punishes those who have wronged, and the King gives orders. If players don&rsquo;t complete their gaming duties, then they can be punished by having to do certain unpleasant tasks. On top of that, the game contains a certain mode of conduct which, if broken, can cause even the King to become a simple servant.&#10;&#10;The expanded version of the game also includes social order cards, the King&rsquo;s Charity cards and the ability to chronicle each player&rsquo;s gaming achievements.

Then an semi-circular marker is placed around the disk to show where it was placed and the disk is removed. The card is now turned around and reveals which quadrant of the board it belongs to. The quadrants are card-sized, and the cards show a cross with the precise location. Afterwards, the disc is put back on top of the cards - it contains concentric rings which mark how far the player was off.

The goal of the game remains the same &ndash; checkmate your opponent. However, your arsenal is no longer limited by the 16 pieces on the board!&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, you can use special cards: mutations, intrigues and maneuvers. Each card introduces a temporary or permanent change into the normal rules of chess. The game strategy becomes much more diversified as it becomes impossible to foretell your opponent&rsquo;s tactic. An element of chance is added to the game (something completely absent from the classic game of chess). The tables can turn at any time, imposing drastic changes on either side. This is why players in extremely dire situations still have a legitimate chance to win.&#10;&#10;In addition to this game set, you will need a chess board with the standard pieces for both sides. You will also at least need to be able to play chess at the most rudimentary level.&#10;&#10;&quot;Chess of chaos&quot; is a card addition to classic chess, the idea was created on the base of the game &quot;Temp&ecirc;te sur l'&eacute;chiquier&quot;. &quot;Chess of chaos&quot; is produced in Russia with the permission of the original authors.&#10;&#10;",

It was expected to be a normal working day when suddenly the upper galleries of the gold and copper mine collapsed, causing the miners to be trapped for months. In this rescue mission game, you and your team must try to overcome all odds in order to rescue these thirty three (33) trapped miners. To be successful, you and your team must meet all the government&rsquo;s mandatory health, safety and environment (HSE) standards, acquire the necessary gears, and endeavor to avoid danger zones. Remember, the perils and rewards are high - just when you think you are about to enter the chamber to rescue a trapped miner, your mission might suffer a setback as the other rescue team progresses. This game is about individual effort, team work, risk, strategy and sacrifice.&#10;&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 - 6. &#10;AGES: 12yrs to adult.&#10;PLAYING TIME: 45-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;YOUR CHALLENGE &#10;Your team&rsquo;s objective is to rescue as many trapped miners as possible. This process is not without its challenges such as: the unavailability of cash to acquire the necessary gears, risky danger zones, overcoming fluctuating gear costs imposed by the Greedy Merchant and the ability to meet the mandatory standards imposed by the government through its agency The Bureau of Standards. Lives are at stake! The longer you wait, the more unlikely it will be that the trapped miners will survive. Can you rise to the challenge? Only time will tell.&#10;&#10;GAME CONTENTS&#10;The game box consists of game rules and instructions, 1 board, 1 dice, 33 tokens (depicting the trapped miners), 6 player pawns, 6 rescue gear kits (or placeholders for the players&rsquo; gears), 42 tokens (depicting the gears), 1 game price chart, 1 debtor sheet, 20 Bank Notes of $5, 30 Bank Notes of $10 and $20 respectively, 6 &lsquo;holding card placeholders, and 2 decks of cards (HSE and Bureau of Standards).

When a player successfully wins an egg, he or she then rolls the white die, which indicates the location of the egg; between your cheek and your shoulder, your chin and the breast, between your knees, etc. When the first person drops an egg, the game ends and the one having the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;The political boardgame, Spread the Wealth Around, exists to train you bitter clingers to practice the art of class warfare, dodge death panels, cheat on your taxes and do your small part to increase our national debt.&#10;&#10;Choose membership in one of four organizations: Public Service, ObamaCare, Big Labor or Wall Street. From your perch atop the ruling class, you&rsquo;ll bankrupt other players, drag them before show trials, carve them up in unnecessary surgery or just get one of your big labor goons to wack &lsquo;em in Rocko Roulette.&#10;&#10;Rather than accumulate wealth in Spread the Wealth Around, you&rsquo;ll rack up mountains of debt just like Obama&rsquo;s America. Scam dead people and collect their Social Security in Public Office. Unplug granny and play the lawsuit lottery in ObamaCare. Gamble and go burnin&rsquo; and lootin&rsquo; with Big Labor. Cut in line for your Wall Street bailout it&rsquo;s all for the children.&#10;&#10;Spread the Wealth Around is the perfect gift to cure that troglodyte Republican friend or conservative relation. No need for sensitivity training or coaching on tax and spend Obamanomics. Put away those teacher&rsquo;s union pamphlets and Mao&rsquo;s little red book. Play the political game that&rsquo;s making the world safe for socialism!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Words of Wisdom: the Game 2-10 players compete against one another to be the first to get rid of all the cards in their hands.  Each player begins with 7 cards from one of the 2 decks and must attempt to play his cards to a community board.  The board is divided into 2 sections, and players must play cards only to their designated spaces on the board, only when adjacent to other placed cards, and only into 1 section per turn.  Players may choose to (or may occasionally be forced to) draw simultaneously from both the Book Deck (which has more of the same cards that were dealt initially) and the Providence Deck (which enables special placements).  Some cards are setbacks when drawn, while others allow opponents to save each other from the setbacks (and benefit themselves in the process.)&#10;&#10;The game can be played in either of 2 ways.  The Standard Version contains a few extra cards which force play to the board and which create blockages on the board that can be removed only through cooperative effort.  This extra layer of complexity provides opportunity for cooperative play and additional strategy which is not available in the much simpler Family Version of the game (which is better suited for children and casual gamers.)  In addition to removing a few cards from the decks, the Family Version allows for a different ending to the game: where the Standard Version is resolved in a Discard Phase that awards victory to the lowest scorer, the Family Version is won simply when any player goes out, having played all their cards on their turn.&#10;&#10;Words of Wisdom: the Game has an overtly Biblical theme.  The numbered board spaces represent the 66 books of the Bible, and the cards in the Book Deck represent individual books of the Bible.  The cards in the Providence Deck channel Bible-based occurrences such as Trials, Miracles, Prophecies, and Parables.  Nevertheless, the theme is as light and non-intrusive as the game play is: the rules state that no familiarity with the Bible is necessary to play, enjoy, or win the game.  Likewise, there are no specific teachings or stories told through the game itself.  If the game attempts anything spiritual, it is only to familiarize the players with the names and order of the books that make up the Bible.&#10;&#10;",

The other player has to guess this code. He gets seven rounds to gather information. At the start of each round, he rolls four dice, then uses some or all of them to create a (partial) code. He then receives feedback on this code, being told how many dice are equal to the corresponding die in the code, how many are higher and how many are lower. When he thinks he has guessed the code, or after he has used up his seven rounds, he makes a guess. If this guess is correct, he scores a number of points, depending on the amount of rounds and dice used.&#10;&#10;After this, the rolls are reveresed, and the other player has to break a code. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

In January 1942, the 11th Indian Division was sent north to contest the Imperial Japanese Army's advance from their landing beaches on the Kra Isthmus.&#10;&#10;However, the Japanese 5th Infantry Division, supported by the 4th Armored Regiment struck first in the early morning hours of January 7th at the Cluny Rubber Plantation and at the town of Trolak, just north of the Slim River. The Allied forces were caught unprepared by the sudden Japanese combined arms offensive, with units scattered along 19 miles of road north of the Slim River, and with little to no weaponry by which to oppose the Japanese armor. Worse still, the Japanese infiltration tactics through jungle terrain the Allied commanders believed to be impenetrable, led to the Allied battalions being repeatedly outflanked and forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;The Japanese success here would eventually take them all the way to Singapore.

Of course, if this item is in the hands of the Host or an infected player, it can be used a little more devlishly.&#10;&#10;1 Sniper Rifle:  This ranged weapon allows players to target Parasites and Players up to 2 rooms away, and thus it is a very powerful weapon to defend yourself or attack another without the need to move to a more dangerous location.&#10;&#10;1 Antidote: this is a one-time use injection. If this card is traded to an infected player, the player will be cured of the infection and be turned back to Human.  This can be very dramatic, since it can give a human team on the brink of defeat a way to fight back.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the beginning of the Eighteenth century, warfare entered a new era. The widespread use of the flintlock musket had transformed the way armies trained and fought.&#10;This period was a golden age for the crowned heads of Europe. They commanded professional troops, gloriously outfitted in splendid uniforms, and fought each other over land, wealth and the succession of their thrones. Some even led their armies on the field of battle. Yet by the end of the century, the real power of kings was gone or greatly eroded parliaments would decide the foreing policy of nations, democracy had taken hold in the New World and the divine right of kings was being questioned everywhere.&#10;These were the last wars fought to protect the succession rights of royalty. These wars were the Last Arguments of Kings.&#10;This supplement for the Black Powder game overviews the main conflicts and armies of this period, and includes army lists and special rules to enable you to refight these wars using the Black Powder rules, as well as scenarios for the most dramatic battles of the time. Featured conflicts include:&#10;The War of the Spanish Succession (The Battle of Blenheim 1704)&#10;The Great Northen War (The Battle of Holowczyn 1708)&#10;The Austro-Turkish Wars (The Battle of Petrovardin 1716)&#10;The War of the Austrian Succession (The Battle of Fontenoy 1745)&#10;The Wars of the English Succession (The '45 Rebellion)&#10;The Seven Years' War (The Battle of Hundorf 1762)&#10;War in the Colonies (The French Indian Wars &amp; The War in India)&#10;Raids and Invasions (Amphibious Warfare in the 18th Century)&#10;&#10;",

Nonetheless, recently discovered material and some oral histories have shown the Allied offensives came close to success. Can you do as well, or better?&#10;&#10;Bloody Hell is designed as a &quot;two-games-in-one&quot; package allowing the players to play either of General Montgomery's operations (securing Caen and then breaking out to support Patton's Operation Cobra). Players can also combine both games into a grand-tactical simulation pitting Montgomery against General Sepp Dietrich and the 1st SS Panzer Corps.&#10;&#10;Game Components&#10;&#10;Each copy of Bloody Hell is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Four &ldquo;11&rdquo; by &ldquo;17&rdquo; map sections&#10;     280 double-sided, unmounted counters&#10;     Two sheets of game tables and charts&#10;     One set of rules&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Along a course marked by pylons in front of a huge grandstand built especially for the event, &ldquo;the Thompson&rdquo; was the greatest aerial contest of its time. Pilots raced to their planes from a starting-gun's signal, flew off from a standing start, and then raced at speeds of hundreds of miles an hour, scores of feet above ground. The roar of the aircraft's engines were hardly drowned-out by that of the crowds as they witnessed aerial duels in which planes and pilots were pushed to their limits and sometimes beyond.&#10;&#10;September's Eagles is a low level, fun to play game on the Thompson Trophy Air Race of 1929-1939. Players use cards to activate their planes and pilots, and to stymie (Trump) the moves of their opponents. Play is very interactive, intense and true to the history.&#10;&#10;The colorful counters represent all of the major aircraft of the period, and pilot cards portray the famous aviators. In more detail, the game includes 36 different planes, from the first race winner (the Travelair R 'Mystery Ship') to the iconic Gee Bee R-1 and Roscoe Turner's 'Gilmore'. Planes are rated for endurance, turning radius, ability to climb or dive and speed. Thirty-three different pilots are represented, including pilots such as Jimmy Doolittle, Steve Wittman and Howard Hughes. Each pilot is rated for his skill level and fatigue. A deck of 54 Action Cards are used by players to move and maneuver their planes as well as rallying their planes and pilots. Players may also play cards on other players to disrupt their game.&#10;&#10;Each game of September's Eagles comes with a full color and extensively illustrated Rules of Play booklet. In it is a comprehensive example of play to assist in learning the game. Along with the Rules of Play booklet comes a Racing Program which allows for the gaming of all the Thompson Trophy Races starting with the first in 1929 through to the final one in 1939.&#10;&#10;",

Hannut was the largest tank battle to yet occur during the Second World War. The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The Allies anticipated the Germans would strike through neutral Belgium as they had in WWI, and planned on confronting them there on the Belgian plain. The first large scale encounter occurred at Hannut, not far from the famous battlefields of Ramillies and Waterloo. Here the 1st and 2nd French Light Mechanized Divisions, heavily armed with tanks, ran into the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions.&#10;&#10;The players, taking on the roles of the commander of the 1st French Army and German Army Group B during the Battle for Belgium.  The French, thinking that this was the main German effort, committed their most modern divisions to this battle.  For the Germans, this was a feint to tie down the French (and destroy their best units) while Army Group A raced through the Ardennes to the English Channel, to encircle the best Allied Armies. Tactically, the French were successful at Hannut.  Strategically, the Germans accomplished their goal of &quot;soaking off&quot; the French armor away from the main effort through the Ardennes, however the French 1st Army survived the campaign and was later instrumental in protecting the Dunkirk pocket, allowing hundreds of thousands of English and French troops to evacuate to England.&#10;&#10;This is the sixth game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series from High Flying Dice Games&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1.5 hours&#10;Hex: 1 miles / 1.61 kilometer&#10;Units: Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 11x17&quot; full color map (in 2 parts)&#10;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&#10;One 8-page rulebook&#10;One Player aid Charts (TEC/CRT)&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&#10;&#10;",
