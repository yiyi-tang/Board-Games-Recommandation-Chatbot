Fighting against the Axis, players use dice to win in battles, answer quiz questions about WW2 and preform various tasks including singing, drawing or even bringing food for the comrades at the table.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a set:&#10;&#10;     one partisan figure&#10;     one white guard tower&#10;     one colored guard tower (red, orange, blue, green) &#10;&#10;&#10;Players start the game by putting their partisan figures on a game board which represents Slovenia occupied by Axis. They choose from 130 towns and places. After they done so, they have to put white guard tower anywhere on the map. When white guard towers are set, players draft their first mission card from general headquarters beginning in 1941. The card tells them where to put their colored guard tower and what is the mission.  Players have to go through 5 years of war (1941-1945). There are 5 stacks of cards - one per year (250 missions).&#10;&#10;Now the game begins. Players throw special dice (D3) and move towards their objective. Other players guard towers represent obstacles and can not be attacked. When a player reaches his objective from General Headquarters card, he must fulfil his/her mission. The player takes 5 battle dice. He has 3 throws to hit the best combination (scale goes from: one pair, two pairs, three of a kind,..., five of the same). After throwing his combination, the player on his right takes a role of &quot;enemy&quot; and tries to throw a combination with bigger value. If player fails in achieving his mission, he must wait for another turn and try again. If he wins, he receive a card from Partisan school.&#10;&#10;The Partisan School has quiz questions about WW2. These cards bring points. After fulfilling his orders from General Headquarters players, move their white guard tower. After a successful attack (again with battle dice), a player receives a &quot;Special Mission&quot; card. These also bring points. Now, after both guard towers are eliminated, the player is ready to step into the next year. He again places his white guard tower on the map, and than drafts the card from year 1942 which tells him where to put his colored guard tower and what his the mission in 1942.&#10;&#10;The player who gathers most points from Partisan School and Special Missions is the winner.&#10;And yes.. you can get a medal!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player has game pieces of one color.&#10;&#10;The playing area consists of hexagonal spaces, each with a hollow in the middle.&#10;&#10;Players alternate taking turns. You move one of your game pieces until you arrive at the edge of the gameboard or at a space occupied by another game piece, but the move has to be at least 2 spaces. After that, you place a new game piece, always with the flat side down.&#10;&#10;If your move is more than 2 spaces, you turn the game piece over after your move so that it is now lying in the hollow with the round side down. This means that this game piece is fixed on this space and may no longer be moved.&#10;&#10;With every turn, there are more and more game pieces on the board, which leaves fewer free spaces and therefore fewer moving possibilities.&#10;&#10;Having to skip a turn does not necessarily mean that you have no chance of moving any more.&#10;Who will make the very last move and thus win the game?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The aim of the game is to discard all the cards first, that is, to remain without cards in hand.&#10;The cards can be discarded by putting each waste in the right dumpster but only if the right dumpster has been put on the table before. There are also some waste cards that can pollute and block a dumpster. In that case, only cards with a 4R (Recycle) process can unblock pollute dumpsters. Some special waste can seriously pollute the environment so that if played they will penalize the player by forcing him to draft three more cards from the deck; as an additional effect, all players should pass a card to the relative player on their left.&#10;&#10;",

By placing cards in front of you, you form cities which consist of temples, houses, and fountains.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are 72 cards, each of which has six terrain squares. At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 15 terrain cards. They then shuffle their cards to form their deck.&#10;&#10;Each round, they simultaneously draw two cards from their deck. They then choose one and place it in front of themselves, and place the other on top of another player's deck face-up. This process is done in real time.&#10;&#10;When you place your card in front of you, you must partially overlap it on an existing card. Both of overlapped squares must have the same terrain.&#10;&#10;If at least one temple, houses, and fountain are surrounded by the forest, they form a city, earning you victory points at end of game depending on the size of the city. Fountains score 3pts each. Temples and houses score more points the more they appear in the city. For each macaw you can see in your forest, you score 1pt at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;As the game nears the end, you might place a card with no chance to score. In that case, you don't place it but turn it over instead for 2 pts. However, cards that have been placed cannot be moved or retrieved to score.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the highest scorer wins the game.

Explore the Talenticity field with your hero, perform, run shows and conquer the city. And meanwhile: watch out for other artists, they want this city too!&#10;&#10;The game starts with random hero and god cards distribution, each player picks a faced down card of a hero and a god.&#10;&#10;The players receive their Hero miniatures and their performance miniatures.&#10;&#10;Each player rolls the dices, the one with the biggest outcome starts the game. Then the order goes in a clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of every day, all players take a piece of the Skies in order and use their God's eye to see the hidden image. The first player to take a piece of the Skies changes in a clockwise direction every new day. The Players should take and put the skies back one by one in a clockwise direction as well. Each player puts the Skies part back anywhere they want and tries to remember that location.&#10;&#10;It is possible to compete in the sky too! Players can follow who saw which sky and take it to change its position on the next day.&#10;&#10;Players' Turn:&#10;&#10;The player takes a show card from the deck at the start of his/her turn. Each player can have only 3 show cards in hand. Each turn player can take a show card from the deck or put one show card back under the deck of shows.&#10;&#10;The player rolls the dices and uses the Action Points*:&#10;&#10;1 AP for movement on the board&#10;2 AP to place a performance mini around the hero miniatures&#10;3 AP to perform a show. &#10;4 AP to knock out another players performance miniature&#10;&#10;     - The Players do not have to use all the action points that they have every turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;The players can offer to trade or sell shows and artifact cards to other players during their turn.&#10;&#10;To perform a show, the player has to have 3 performance miniatures around the picked location. Then the player has to show the other players the piece of the skies that gives the blessing to perform a show in this location. If the player fails to show the correct sky piece, the show is canceled. The player takes back all three performance miniatures around that location and receives no Moneye. If the show is successful, then the player receives that location card + Moneye according to the show card + any combos.&#10;&#10;For placing a performance miniature on the playing field, the player earns 1 Moneye.&#10;&#10;The player doubles double the Moneye earned from a show that matches the player's god.&#10;&#10;The player gets +2 extra Moneye if he or she performs the show in a matching location.&#10;&#10;After performing a show, if unused action points remain, the player can use them.&#10;&#10;To receive an artifact the player must show a combination of 3 Moneye that read the artifact name.&#10;&#10;It is not allowed to combo artifacts in one turn. Each artifact can only be used once in the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the players performs 5 shows (6 shows for 2&amp;3 players).&#10;&#10;The richest player wins the Art-Battle!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are a citizen of the small town, Suemlots, and the mayor is in big trouble.  As the most litigious person in the most litigious city in the most litigious state in the country, he has to keep his dirty dealings under wraps.  The mayor needs distractions and has told the top eight attorneys in his beautiful city to take any case they can get so that he can get the heat off of him.&#10;&#10;WE cards provide or block evidence to back up or refute an accusation. For example, a &ldquo;Security Video Footage&rdquo; may be used to add a Point to the accuser&rsquo;s case, but the defender may cancel that card out with a &ldquo;Blurry Video&rdquo; WE card. To win a case, the accuser must beat the defense by three points.&#10;&#10;With hints from the Crime and Clue cards, players now have the option to Accuse each other of a crime listed in the Suemlots Gazette. Players then try to build a case and take it to court. In court, the prosecution (accuser) always goes first. Randomly turn over a Judge card. Apply Attorney and Judge bonuses or negatives to the case. Explain your case by laying down applicable WE cards and attempt to sway the judge and jury with your witnesses and evidence.&#10;&#10;After the prosecution has laid their case before the judge, the defense now brings their evidence and witnesses to bear. All cards to be played by the defense now come into play and a preponderance of evidence/witnesses will win the day. To use the sample from above, a &ldquo;Security Video Footage&rdquo; may be used to add a point to the accuser&rsquo;s case, but the defender may cancel that card out with a &ldquo;Blurry Video&rdquo; WE card.&#10;&#10;The Accuser wins the case when they have three or more uncontested pieces of evidence/witnesses that the defense is unable to deflect, block, or have thrown out of court.  The Defense wins in any condition where the prosecution team has less than three pieces of evidence that are uncontested. The game ends when an accuser wins their case in court.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

An economic simulation game, it forces negotiations between players and the pursuit of aggressive strategies in the face of constant challenges from news events.&#10;&#10;It gamifies several core economic concepts such as cash and capital, cash flow management, supply and demand, auction (for companies and executive team members), valuation of companies, acquisitions and divestment, synergies, business risks and opportunities, and return on investment and return on equity. Additionally, it alerts players to the importance of news and alternative news in constructing the reality that impacts companies.&#10;&#10;Four Chairmen fight for control over 24 companies and 20 executive team members, while navigating 141 satirical news events that create risks and opportunities for companies. The Chairman with most company value and positive cashflow created during the four quarters of the game wins. The best chairmen increase the initial sum of 30 Merx (for Mercurius) to more than 100 Merx during the game.&#10;&#10;BizLive!&rsquo;s purpose is to mimic real life&rsquo;s never-ending struggle between fate, luck, chance on the one hand, and conscious, rational, strategic management decisions on the other hand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Parrot Pair-it is a cute and easy game that people of any age can enjoy. Each deck contains beautiful artwork of 26 pairs of parrots. Each pair has its own point value based on how common the parrot species is.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play Parrot Pair-it:&#10;&#10;Dexterity&#10;&#10;For those who want a dexterity-based game, five random cards would be spread on the table, face up. Each player draws seven cards from the rest of the deck. The player whose turn it is looks for a pair. If there is on in their hand, easy points, lay them down in front of you. If they have a card in their hand that matches a card the table, they must let the parrot fly down to its mate. Hold the card at least a foot above the table, flip it up and try to get it to land, face up, touching its match. If it does, pick up it and add it to your collected pairs. If not, place it in the discard pile, draw a card, and hope you&rsquo;ll do better the next try.&#10;&#10;Simply Picking Pairs&#10;&#10;Another way to play Parrot Pair-it is the Old Maid method, where players hold a hand of seven cards and either ask if an opponent has a card needed to make a pair, or they may physically remove a card from an opponent&rsquo;s hand. Lay any pairs down to be counted later.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;Cards have a number scale across the bottom that rises from left to right. Some parrots species will only have one pair, while others may have up to five. If a player, for example, has one pair of macaws, which is a five-pair set, it may be worth only five points. But if the player has four of the five macaw pairs, they would have 25 points, and if they have all five, fifty points. Winning the game is when one person reaches a predetermined score, or when all the parrots have been paired with the person with the highest score winning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You must gather your most fierce forces to make the journey because your enemies have the same destiny.&#10;&#10;Divinities Boon: Primordium, pits fantasy races against each other in a battle to a magical relic. Champions command forces as they move forward on the player&rsquo;s game board. Attack your opponent&rsquo;s forces with melee, ranged or siege assaults to move your champion forward, or your enemy backward. Once your champion reaches the Boon, they must fight to retain control of it for three rounds. But victory is fleeting, for the other gods have the power to remove the boon and give their favored champion another chance for greatness.&#10;&#10;Players take turns by playing one or two minions, whose MELEE, RANGED, and SIEGE stats combine. If they beat the opposing player&rsquo;s minions in any of the three attacks, that champion is moved forward a number based on the cards played (attack and ranged), or the opposing champion is moved backward (siege). Champions add powerful bonuses to the minion's attacks and defenses. Boon cards may also be played to give an added edge.&#10;&#10;Once the champion reaches the final destination, they must maintain control of the relic for three, non-consecutive rounds. The winner returns to their homeland with the favor of their god until they take it away to play their game again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

When someone gives you provisions, it makes you more valuable to the group, which matters when the boat finally arrives to whisk your group to safety. But the provisions are tainted with vampire blood....&#10;&#10;On their turn, players send provisions to other players from a face-up deck. The cards are public but the undersides of the cards may have bites on them. Each provision has a low, medium, or high probability of being tainted with vampire blood. The players with the most valuable provisions are thus the most dangerous to the group. Subtle negotiation is required to get the most provisions onto the boat without bringing too many vampires.&#10;&#10;This semi-sequel to GROWL (2019) keeps the primary &quot;card giving&quot; mechanism but removes player elimination and the honor-system aspect.

    "Description": "The Boston experiment with public Tramways began with a series of elevated electric rail companies that slowly spread throughout the city and the surrounding suburbs.  An unreliable power grid meant that these companies produced their own power (at 25 Hz) to ensure the availability of their services.  As time passed, the companies began to merge together until they became the modern Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), only moving onto the public 60Hz grid in the 1980&rsquo;s.&#10;&#10;Your role as one of these early companies is to overcome the difficulty of the limiting nature of the power generators in early Boston as you expand your network to move the citizens of Boston to and from the many historic locations in town.  Don&rsquo;t worry though, the power generators are becoming more efficient every year, and there&rsquo;s always horse drawn tramways to help get people to their final destination&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Now is the time to bring these &ldquo;humans&rdquo; to their knees and show them that their safety, their progress, is illusory.

Your opponents are as powerful as they are socially awkward, master diagnosticians who wield reflex hammers as if they were extensions of their very limbs.  You have always done well on standardized tests, but this will be the greatest challenge of your distinguished career.&#10;&#10;With the eyes of world upon you, you will take turns examining patients with symptoms like weakness, numbness, and eye movement abnormalities. Find the source of these problems, and you will emerge triumphant from this Colosseum of neurological ailments.&#10;&#10;Will you be the first to master the nervous system, find the most lesions, and become Charcot&rsquo;s heir-apparent? Only then will you earn the greatest honor in the history of medicine: to have all future neurologic diseases bear your name.&#10;&#10;The Lesion: Charcot&rsquo;s Tournament is a strategy game based on real human neuroanatomy. Players map neurologic electrical pathways that sense the environment and tell our bodies what to do. Earn points by finding lesions where two or more pathways overlap.
