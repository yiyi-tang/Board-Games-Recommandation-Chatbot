    "Description": "Unicorn Tears is a fast paced card game of strategy and wit. The game was designed and illustrated by a 13 year old entrepreneur with a passion for tabletop games!&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws a Unicorn Tear and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid sudden death by Unicorn Tears by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, shuffling the deck or stopping the Unicorn Tears with the all powerful Anti Depressant card. There is even one unstoppable card called Buddy the Narwhal, Buddy allows you to switch your hand with any player you choose.&#10;&#10;The game gets more and more exciting and dangerous with each card you draw because the less cards that are left in the deck means a bigger chance of drawing a Unicorn Tear and dying an instant terrible death of shame and disappointment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the farthest reaches of space, the boundaries of the Imperium change almost daily as new worlds are discovered and settled and others fall to predations of aliens or rogue factions seeking freedom from of the crushing yoke of Imperial oppression. Open hostility is a common occurrence on such lawless worlds, yet with fewer resources to call upon, many such conflicts are resolved as guerrilla or shadow wars.&#10;&#10;The Sector Fronteris Killzone Environment is an expansion for Kill Team &ndash; in the packed box, you'll find a gameboard, scenery, and exclusive rules that use the unique nature of the Sector Fronteris terrain to introduce dangerous new missions and powerful effects to your games. Included:&#10;&#10;- A double-sided Kill Team gameboard measuring 22&rdquo; x 30&rdquo;, printed on heavy, durable card stock. One side depicts a sand-blasted wilderness, while the other represents a more industrialised border region&#10;- An 8-page booklet describing the sorts of wild frontier worlds that loosely make up the borders of Imperial territory, and where the influence of Terra is seldom felt. &#10;- 12 Sector Fronteris Tactics cards &ndash; these can be used by any Kill Team Faction, with 4 cards providing interactions with the Sector Fronteris scenery and 5 being used specifically by Scout, Comms, Sniper or Medic Specialists&#10;- A Sector Fronteris Environment card, which provides 6 different rules that interact with the scenery&#10;- 4 Sector Fronteris Mission cards &ndash; designed to be used in conjunction with the gameboard and scenery, this is a set of 2 matched play missions and 2 narrative play missions, which are split between attacker and defender&#10;- 4 Ryza-pattern Ruins plastic frames &ndash; including two brand sets of frames that include 2 slot-together walls, raised barricade, 3 armoured window covers, 1 large section of flooring, 3 small sections of ruined floor, and one connector that resembles a light. If you combine these 2 new frames, you can build a complete STC Ryza-Pattern building with a roof. There are also 2 plastic frames of STC Ryza-Pattern Ruins, each containing 3 slot-together walls, 3 ruined wall sections, and an Inquisitorial crate.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This turbulent card game for the whole family is, so to speak, Mau Mau, only cooperative and on time: All players try together in as little as 4 &frac12; minutes as many of the total of 95 cards to play. Unusual, because you have to play so that the following players can possibly create as well. And the time is running - either via a conventional timer (kitchen timer or smartphone) or via the Music.&#10;&#10;Here's how it works: The cards are face-up and the players have to take down cards in turn - as with Mau Mau you can put the same numbers or colors on top of each other. But you have to rethink: Since all have the same goal - namely, that as many as possible cards are stored within 4 &frac12; minutes - you play as possible so that the other players can also serve. But there are two discard piles - this increases the chances. But the time is running - it means keep your nerves and overview.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

In each turn, agents are set out one step at a time across the network of markets to establish horrea (warehouses), negotiate alliances or break them apart, establish a presence in a region or prevent another player from accessing it.&#10;&#10;Trade functions through every market where a player has established a warehouse. The further from Rome, the higher the transport and information costs and the lower the profit. But agents who are connected back to Rome are better informed, and so can get a better return. Fortunes can be made by creating continuous trade routes accessing the wealth of the edges of Empire and the Barbaricum beyond!&#10;&#10;Money is not the only way for a player to grow in prestige; a combination of clever board control and alliances and benefactions allow a player to move up the cursus honorum (prestige ladder) to become Consul! But fate will always play a role, and can upset the most intricate of plans.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "GROWL: Curses + Spells is a double-expansion in one box, and the expansions may be played individually or combined with each other or other expansions.&#10;&#10;&#10;CURSES allows for a more complex, longer game experience. It is recommended for 5+ players. After players have been dealt their initial card (Gold or Bite), shuffle all 14 Curses cards into the main deck. Deal the additional 3 cards to each player, prepare the Night cards, and proceed as usual.&#10;&#10;Icons only negate other icons, not the entire card. For example, if you have a Cursed Charm (adds 1 wound icon and 1 charm icon) and a Hex (negates all your charm icons), the Hex cancels the charm icon but not the wound icon. If you have a Super Salve (adds 2 salve icons) and a Cursed Gold (adds 2 gold icons and a wound icon), then one of the salve icons negates the wound icon, but you still have your gold icons and an extra unused salve icon.&#10;&#10;Holy Water symbol: (Holy Water is bad for werewolves, so if you &ldquo;turn&rdquo; while holding this, you might also find yourself dead!)&#10;&#10;Infinity symbol: (While in your hand, this negates ALL of a specific type of icon. Infection negates salve icons, Hex negates charm icons.)&#10;&#10;&#10;SPELLS adds static (ongoing) abilities, plus effects you can trigger by discarding Gold cards. Recommended for 5+ players.&#10; SETUP: After all players have been dealt their starting hands (but before preparing the Night cards), shuffle 3-5 of these expansion cards into the deck. Then prepare the Night cards, and proceed as usual.&#10;&#10;Cards with a [SPELL] icon in the upper right are called &ldquo;spells&rdquo; and never go to a hand; instead, they are placed face-up in front of the player they are given to. Their effects are either ongoing (like Wolfsbane or Tanglevine), or else may be triggered as described in the text of the card. When a player with one or more           cards in front of them takes their turn, they must FIRST review and resolve their spells in any order, then proceed to draw and give a card as usual for their turn.&#10;&#10;Some spells are triggered at unusual moments, such as after a Night Phase, or at the moment a player dies. If need be, pause the game by calling out &ldquo;Spell!&rdquo; and resolve its effects before proceeding.&#10;&#10;The main text on a spell card is not directed at the player who draws it on their turn, but to the player they give the card to.&#10; Icons in the upper left of your spell cards are considered part of your hand, and may negate (or be negated by) icons on cards in hand.&#10; Some other cards (for example, &ldquo;Silver Bullet&rdquo; and &ldquo;S&eacute;ance&rdquo;) are played as spell cards, and there are some card effects that can move or discard them. If a card effect lets you discard a card with a certain icon, you may discard any card of yours with the icon, including a spell card. If a spell is discarded, publicly remove it from play, just as you would discard a resolved Night card. &#10; TIMING: If a card says &ldquo;once per turn&rdquo; then it should be interpreted to mean &ldquo;on your turn only.&rdquo; Spells usually remain active unless the player dies. If the spells (or the players!) move positions, the spells affect new players instead. If multiple players&rsquo; cards conflict, resolve them logically and thematically. In the rare case of complex timing issues, resolve the cards clockwise from the Start Player (1). Finally, if a single player has conflicting cards, they may resolve them in the order they wish. &#10;                                                                                                                                                            &copy;2019 Joey Vigour&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mix &amp; Mayhem is a fast-paced family battling card game for 2 to 4 players. It can be played in 4 different ways, providing exciting variation and wide age range appeal.  One of the games aimed at young children is a simple mix and match stlye game. One of the other games is a Top Trumps style of selecting a category and the highest value wins. The other two of the game variations are trick taking games that involve trying to create the most powerful creatures and battling them against your opponent.&#10;&#10;The game contains 72 cards, including 60 character cards and 12 special action cards.  The 60 character cards include 20 Head cards, 20 Torso cards, and 20 leg cards.  Combined in the right sequence, these cards create 20 fearsome characters ready to do battle, however, when the cards are mixed with cards from other characters they can create up to 8,000 unique characters each with their own unique name and powers. You will create crazy, scary, funny, unusual and wonderful characters to battle and try to defeat your opponents.&#10;&#10;Mix &amp; Mayhem cards can be played in 4 different ways, You Complete Me, Wipe Them Out, Skirmish, and Bunch of Fives. The rules for each game are described below.&#10;&#10;You Complete Me!&#10;Preparation: Remove all of the Action cards. Shuffle the Character cards and place them in a pile&#10;face down.&#10;Playing the game: Decide who goes first, then each player takes it in turns to take a card from the pile and lay them face up in front of them. As the game progresses each player will be able to mix their cards to create weird and wonderful creatures as the game progresses.&#10;The winner: The aim is to be the first player to create one of the 20 original characters made up of the set of correct 3 cards. If neither player is able to create one of the 20 original characters before the cards are all drawn then the cards are collected, re-shuffled, and drawn again until there is a winner.&#10;&#10;Wipe Them Out!&#10;Preparation: Split the cards into 3 separate piles for Heads, Torsos and Legs (including the Action cards which are also marked on the back of the card as Head, Torso and Legs cards). Shuffle each pile and deal the cards face down to each player so that each player has their own separate piles of Head&#10;cards, Torso cards, and Leg cards. Each player should have the same number of body part cards.&#10;To play the game: Each player picks up the top card of each pile of body parts so they have a complete character, with a Head card, Torso card and Legs card. If they pick up an Action card instead of a character body part they should keep this and draw another card from the top of the pile until they have a character body part. The Action cards that they may have picked up can be used during the game. Players hold the cards facing themselves, so only they can see them. Decide who goes first, then that player will select a category &ndash; either Brains, Strength or Speed. Each player shows their card to reveal the value of the chosen body part. The player with the highest&#10;value wins the battle and the player with the lowest value must discard the body part card that lost. Then the loser must pick up the next top card from their pile of the same category until they have a complete character again. The winner of the battle can keep the same cards in play. However, each card can only be used a maximum of 2 times to win a battle. After an individual body part card has won 2 battles it must be discarded and a new one drawn. Players will take it in turns to select a category. Both players must always have at least 3 cards in play, including a Head card, Torso card and Legs card in addition to any Action cards that have been collected. To create some extra mayhem the Action cards that have been drawn by players during the game can be used when it is their turn at any stage of the game. Once a player uses an Action card it must then be discarded.&#10;The winner: The object of the game is to defeat your opponent by wiping out a pile of their cards so that they are no longer able to make up a full character and therefore unable to continue to battle. When a player is unable to make a complete character they are defeated and their opponent is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Skirmish!&#10;Preparation: Shuffle all of the cards (Character and Action cards) into a single pile.&#10;Playing the game: Each player will take it in turns to draw a card from the top of the pile. The cards are laid face up so they are visible to both players.  When both players have a complete character of a Head card, Torso card and Legs card they are ready for battle. Players can create the character of&#10;their choice to battle with from any of the character cards they have drawn. Each turn, players have the option to challenge their opponent to a battle, or to draw another card to&#10;try and create more powerful characters. Once a challenge to battle has been made by either player, the characters they both have created for the battle must be declared and put side by side. The total character score is calculated by adding together the brains, strength and speed values, and the player&#10;with the highest total character score wins that battle.  If a player is able to create one of the correct 20 unique character sets then their overall character score is increased by an extra 10 bonus points. The player who makes the challenge may think they have the most powerful character because they&#10;can see the values of their opponent&rsquo;s characters, however, their opponent may create mayhem by playing one of their Action cards that they have collected to swing the outcome of the battle. A player can use one or more Action cards at any time. Once a player uses an Action card it must then&#10;be discarded. The players continue to draw further cards and engage in new battles with new characters until all&#10;cards have been drawn and there are no further complete characters in the remaining cards held by both players.&#10;The winner: The player who has won the most individual battles once all the cards have been drawn&#10;wins the game.&#10;&#10;Bunch of Fives!&#10;Preparation: Remove all of the Action cards from the deck and deal all of the remaining character cards into separate Head, Torso and Legs piles. Each player will be dealt 3 Head cards, 3 Torso cards and 3 Legs cards, allowing each player to make up 3 separate characters. The cards are laid face down so they are not visible to the opposing player.  Each player should then privately arrange their cards to create 3 different characters with their own unique name and overall value.&#10;Playing the game: Decide who goes first, then that player will lay down one of their characters to engage in battle with their opponent. The other player must then choose and lay down one of their characters. Whoever has the highest total score (by adding together the brains, strength and speed values) wins that hand. If a player is able to create one of the correct 20 unique character sets then their overall character score is increased by an extra 10 bonus points. Players will take it in turns to lay a character first. Once all 3 characters have battled the players will then be dealt another 3 Head cards, 3 Torso cards and 3 Legs cards for another round of 3 battles.&#10;Following the second round of 3 battles there will be 1 final round of 3 battles, so there will be 3 rounds of 3 battles making a total of 9 battles. &#10;The winner: The first player to win 5 battles is the winner of the game. It is possible therefore to&#10;win the game outright after only 2 rounds without the need for the final round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Road to Bethlehem - Journeys Through Time and Space is a family-weight, Christian-themed, RPG-style, cooperative game where players must work together, guided by a GM, to journey through ancient Palestine to arrive in Bethlehem to witness the Nativity and encounter the newborn infant Jesus.  Players play as modern day travelers who have been spirited away by the Archangel Gabriel (the GM) to partake of this journey.  Players must go through a series of scenarios, drawn randomly, during which they are offered choices by the GM which then dictates what challenges and choices they next face.  Players must conserve equipment and, most importantly, time on their journey, while also working to increase their individual attributes of Authority and Reputation.  The game uses the REAL System - a mechanic where the players do actual, physical interactive challenges at various points as part of the gameplay, the outcomes of which determine their progress in the game (such as identifying objects moved by the GM in a given room, finding commonplace house items within a certain time limit, or dexterity challenges). Once the players have gone through all 8 scenarios, they arrive at Bethlehem where which ending they've achieved is based on how much time they used on their journey.  The GM guides the players using 'The Book of Adventures' which contains step by step instructions for each scenario and narrative text that is read to the players.&#10;&#10;The game is geared primarily towards families and can be played by multiple age levels from age 8 and up, but with the caveat that an adult always play as well and serve as the GM.  The total campaign with all the scenarios takes 4-6 hours to play, but the game can easily be saved between the scenarios, with each scenario taking roughly 30-60 minutes to complete.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Some people do not agree with this vision: the resistance is born. The game stages the confrontation between humans from the Resistance and robots controlled by the I.S.C.&#10;&#10;Escape is a light asymmetric miniatures wargame, taking place in the Eden universe. One player takes control of the I.S.C. and its robots; the other players control the humans from the Resistance. The game system is simple, accessible and fast.&#10;&#10;Each game is played as a separate scenario but several of them may be played as a campaign. The players can win by completing a certain goal, such as escaping, destroying artifacts, or killing enemies. Players activate members of their squads on their turns, who can perform various actions such as move, attack an opponent, hack a security lock, use equipment, etc. Dice rolls determine if actions are successful or not. Each character has characteristics of combat, movement and intelligence, a gauge of life, and special abilities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players choose their Heroes. There are 4 female and 4 male Heroes, each with their unique powers. Heroes are young witches and wizards, entering the School of Magic. A game session spans a semester of their life. Players get the Hero Card and the matching Item- and Spell Cards.&#10;&#10;2. The Game Master (can be teacher, senior student, parent, etc.) assembles the Deck of Exercises. There are cards of 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium and Hard and a certain number must be selected from each category. Subjects include Math, History, Science and general Trivia, with curricula that matches education from age of 10 to 16.&#10;&#10;3. The Game Master selects (or randomly draws) a Boss Monster for the game session. All other game components (Cards, tiles, tokens, sheets, etc.) are placed near the gameboard.&#10;&#10;4. Players can move on the board by either rolling 2s6 (random mode) or use Movement Cards, giving a more strategic angle to the game. As players move on the board (from Field 1 to Field 30), the following steps will happen:&#10;&#10;Depending on the Field they landed on, they either draw a single Exercise Card matching the symbol on the field (Easy, Medium, Hard), or a Fortune Card for every player.&#10;&#10;(a) If it was an Exercise Card, they get 3, 5 or 10 minutes to solve the Easy, Medium or Hard problems. They can use pen and paper, they can talk to each other - they can even ask for help from the Game Master. If they successfully solved the problem, they get rewards. Every player who successfully solved her exercise will get Rune Golds. If at least one player solved it correctly, they get Team Rune Golds. Red (Hard) cards yield Magic Items as well.&#10;&#10;Also, every player with a successful solution can place a Dungeon Tile. Tiles will form the combat grid for the final battle. There are symbols on the tiles indicating that the player can draw an extra Spell or Item card when placing that Tile. And certain Tiles will summon monsters for the final battle.&#10;&#10;(b) If it was a Fortune Card, each player gets one and resolve the effect immediately. There are supporting ones (gain bonuses, draw items, etc) and there are negative ones (lose bonuses, get cursed, etc).&#10;&#10;5. The three corners on the Board (Classroom, Club and Magic Rental) are places where the team must stop, even if they would overstep it.&#10;&#10;(a) Classroom: they can select an Exercise Card of any difficulty to solve&#10;(b) Club: they can either play a minigame (not included in the box, choose anything you like to distract players for a bit), or have a little break&#10;(c) Magic Rental: after completing the mandatory Red Exercise on Field 30, players can spend their Rune Golds on Items and Spell. They are more than encouraged to collaborate and communicate, to figure out some kind of strategy before entering the final combat. The identity of the Boss Monster is revealed at this point.&#10;&#10;6. Once they are well equipped, it's time for the Final Battle! Heroes descend to the Dungeons to defend the school from attacking monsters! Final Battle is a turn-based combat using cards and a d20 dice.&#10;&#10;Heroes and Monsters take their turn, with the order depending on their Movement value. Monsters are controlled by the Game Master, following the behaviour detailed on the corresponding combat sheet.&#10;&#10;(a) Movement: a figure can make a number of steps equal to its Movement value. It can step in any direction on the Grid, it can even overstep friendly figures, but cannot cross walls or hostile squares.&#10;&#10;(b) Use Card: after or before the Movement is completed, Heroes can use a single card each turn. It can be a spell (usually turned face down after use), or a weapon (can be used any number of times in a combat). Ranged attacks must consider line-of-sight with walls and other objects blocking the way.&#10;&#10;Combat lasts until the last survivor, with Heroes getting extra Rune Golds as loot. They can use this during their next game session.&#10;&#10;",

First player spins the spinner and moves his/her boat in the direction indicated. If a torpedo boat moves onto a space occupied by an enemy vessel, that player takes the vessel off the game board and scores the points indicated. If the boat hits a rock, it is moved to the nearest port for repairs and the player misses two turns. If a boat lands on a space occupied by another player's boat, or if the boat travels off the game board, the moving player stays on the original spot and loses one turn. The game is over when all enemy vessels are sunk, or when the play time has elapsed. The winner is the player with the highest score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

There is no second place, unless you count Davy Jones' locker...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They are used by scanning them on the Plinth, just like the Artefacts.

    "Description": "&quot;A party game for horrible Austrian people&quot;&#10;&#10;Play begins with a judge, known as the &quot;Round Boss&quot;, choosing a red fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players. Each player holds a hand of eight white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes more) to the round boss, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The round boss determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent a point, and then the player to the left of the Round Boss becomes the new Boss for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, or until they are thrown out of the pub, at which point the player with the most Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Kampf gegen die Korinthenkacker is the Austrian adaption of Kampf gegen das B&uuml;nzlitum, a Swiss party game by Angela V&ouml;gtli and is a hommage to the popular Cards against Humanity.&#10;&#10;It features all new cards with Austrian celebrities, places and topics of interest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Obviously, this is a two player game.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt ten cards from the deck which contains Attack, Defense, and Special cards (some of these cards allow the player to draw cards while others do not). To determine who goes first, the player quick enough to actually play a card from his/her hand takes the initiative. A player's turn is complete once they make an attack, which allows their opponent the opportunity to play a defensive card, if they want.&#10;&#10;Players start at 0 damage and gradually count upwards as they take hits from their opponent. If a player can no longer play a viable card, or runs out of cards, their opponent will continue taking turns until they run out of attacks.&#10;&#10;Once both players are out of attacks, the round is over and who ever took the least amount of damage wins.&#10;&#10;Play styles include: Best 2 out of 3, TKO-ten rounds continually tallying up damage, and Knockout-the first to reach or pass 100 damage loses.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is a strategic dice rolling game of conquest covering the French and Indian War in North America with a British Player and a French Player. Two players can play a side if desired. Players attempt to conquer locations on the game map. Each location has a corresponding tile which has information on what dice need to be rolled to conquer the tile somewhat similar to Age of Wars. Event cards are played for each player each turn which provide benefits and detriments to the player. There is also a strategic phase where the player can muster some garrisons for key locations making them harder to take. Although there are automatic victory conditions for capture of specified locations, victory is generally achieved by conquering a certain number of locations.&#10;&#10;While the sides are somewhat evenly matched, as the game progresses the British player generally gains in strength and the French player must make defensive attacks and play for position. A special naval die for each side allows for potential naval moves each turn.&#10;&#10;The game contains a 11 x 17 strategic map, 32 Location Tiles, 20 event cards, 32 game counters and 17 icon dice. The game allows  you to re-fight the struggle for North America between the British and the French.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
