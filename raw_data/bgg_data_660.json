This provides greater customization for Skirmish battles and allows players to easily find their allied troops on the field during battle.&#10;&#10;Included in Lords of the River are are three new commanders and three new unit types, all loyal to the leaping trout of House Tully. Lead your troops with Edmure Tully, Brynden &quot;Blackfish&quot; Tully, or Marq Piper, and lay waste to your foes with Tully River Riders, Tully Longbowmen, and the Warriors of Wayfarer&rsquo;s Rest.&#10;&#10;New keywords such as Riverborn and Indirect Fire will give you an edge when fighting near rivers or hindering terrain, representing House Tully&rsquo;s familiarity with fighting in the Riverlands.&#10;&#10;In addition to these new forces, Lords of the River also comes with a rules and battle plan book, new terrain, and House Tully Gambit and Skirmish cards. Lords of the River will also be the first expansion to feature the new Battles of Westeros Premium Banners, replacing the cardboard token banners from the Core Set.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cheddar Challenge is an abstract game of strategy and skill similar to Chess. Imagine simplified Klingon Chess. Each player has three categories of wedges. Sharp Cheddar, Medium Cheddar and Mild Cheddar. There are specific sizes, numbers of, movements and strengths for each category of wedge. Each category of piece has unique movement and strength. (For example the Mild Cheddar has the greatest number of pieces.) The goal of the game is to win by capturing all wedges comprising one of your opponent's three categories of cheddar. A player will lose if they lose one of their categories. The game is played on a rhombus shaped game board made up of triangluar cells. The theme is fun because its based on cheese and the shapes of cheese wedges. And its much easier to learn and less complicated than Chess or Klingon Chess and can be a great introduction to those games later on.&#10;&#10;",

Many cards of the game show that change, from traditional to modern astrology. One of the main reasons, was the discovery of new planets. Until recently, Astrologists weren&rsquo;t aware of the existence of the planets in the far reaches of our solar system. Due to the discovery of Neptune, Uranus,  Pluto and the consolidation of the Sun centered planetary system, astrology had to change. New ruling planets were established for the Zodiac Signs, Houses were shifted and the characteristics of each sign changed in order to be aligned with the new form of our solar system.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards of Astrologica feature these changes, as each player makes the changes available through modern and traditional sign characteristics.&#10;&#10;In few words...&#10;&#10;Cards help you gain extra points, while creating row of cards &#10;with the Proper Signs and Elements might grant you victory at the endgame.&#10;&#10;As for the players, well, they try to put the Zodiacs in order along with the Elements.&#10;&#10;The stars were always there.

Options include cutting lights off in homes, cutting phone lines, trying to fight and kill the victims, as in any slasher film. Of course, when that doesn't go to plan, then you need to decide how to deal with the police, potential survivor types, and other issues. Will you spend a turn rolling to pick up a weapon to help you kill? Or try to rush in and dispatch foes? It's all up to you. This game allows for quite a bit of choice.&#10;&#10;Also included are Evil Points, which you earn, and can use to pull off the sorts of narrow escapes, and horror movie classics like escaping unscathed from gunfire.&#10;&#10;Lastly, like any good slasher, on a certain roll, you have rage.

Only the board game field was given away.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die which indicates how far they are allowed to move down the 42 field track trough Europe. If he lands in a black city (Copenhagen, Cadiz, Bern, Athens) the player has to pause for a round and has to pay a coin into the pot (as a hotel fee). If the player lands on a red City (Berlin, London, Paris, Madrid, Venice) he has to pause for a round, but has the chance to take a shortcut when rolling a one on a D6. If he is allowed to take the short cut (express line) he must pay two coins into the pot.&#10;&#10;The first player who is back in Berlin receives half the pot, the second and third divide the rest.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Miam, players are merchants who are buying food stuffs at market, then selling them for cash, with more goods of the same type bringing a bigger payout. Whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, one player shuffles the 55-card deck &ndash; which consists of eleven categories of food (bread, pasta, cheese, etc.) with four cards in each category, four jokers, and seven special action cards &ndash; then spreads out the cards face down on the table. Each player starts with five money.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player uses special cards (optional), turns two cards face up, keeps one of these cards while flipping the other face down, sells sets of food cards (optional), and auctions cards on hand to other players (optional). The special cards, which are claimed like any other, allow a player to steal one card from an opponent or keep both cards revealed that turn. When a player sells a set of food cards, she receives 2-16 money for selling 2-5 cards of the same type; these cards are then removed from play. A player can auction any number of cards, with opponents bidding in round-robin fashion for the entire lot.&#10;&#10;Once the last card has been claimed from the table, the game lasts three more rounds with players being able to take only the optional actions listed above: using special cards, selling sets, and auctioning cards.&#10;&#10;",

You can use your divine powers to quickly gain followers or deviously attack your competing religions. Priests, Zealots, Prophets, and Avatars are your pawns of strategic influence in a developing city which you must control.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of 9 tiles that are randomly placed at the beginning of the game to represent an ancient city. Each tile consists of a 36 square grid that depicts various special locations within the city. Players start by controlling a single temple that allows them to train either Priests or Zealots. Priests can preach to gain followers based on the population of each spot on the game board; however, they are vulnerable to be assassinated by an opponent's Zealot. Priests can also establish new temples throughout the city, which can also be desecrated and destroyed by an opponent's Zealot. Unit movement is dictated by multiple dice rolls equal to the number of temples you control.&#10;&#10;Players can use divinity cards from their hand to change the outcome of certain scenarios. More powerful units like Prophets and Avatars can only be created by using specific divinity cards. By taking control of special spaces on the board players can also receive additional bonuses.&#10;&#10;To win the game players must carefully choose a win condition to work towards. A player wins the game if they are the first to 1) amass 100 follower tokens or 2) capture all 4 tower spaces or 3) be the only remaining player with a temple.&#10;&#10;",

There is also an individual goal keeper option for some seasons which will allow you to track goal keeper Wins and Losses as well as GAA.&#10;&#10;",

Whether called looters or not, they are still a unit to be reckoned with.&#10;&#10;This scenario set details the history of Snord's Irregulars, profiles the statistics and conditions of it members and the company 'Mechs, and includes 14 scenarios pitting the Irregulars against the wide variety of opponents they have fought throughout their colorful past.

Players roll two dodeca, 12-sided dice colored with 3 different spots, to determine how they may place a piece on the 10&times;10 board. Players can play only on their own color, but the dice roll determines how many friendly or enemy pieces the new piece may be adjacent to.&#10;&#10;The goal is to form 5 quinx. A quinx is an arrangement of 5 pieces in an X shape, as found on the 5 of a standard-pipped six-sided die. This shape is sometimes known as a quincunx, from which the game gets its name.&#10;&#10;The dice thrown by each player are the same as found in Kansil's game Krakatoa. Each player has a pair in their color, and each die has 3 yellow, 4 red, and 5 blue spots.&#10;&#10;Out of print for many years, this is reportedly the hardest Joli Kansil/Xanadu Leisure game to find.&#10;&#10;",
