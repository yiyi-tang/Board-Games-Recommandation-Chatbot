    "Description": "Mirrorwing is a game inspired by Chess but with some interesting twists.  All pieces are, essentially, pawns (&quot;villagers&quot;) at the start, but they can be stacked -- at which time they become a &quot;dragonrider&quot;, with the movement based on the bottom piece (&quot;dragon&quot;) and the attack/capture (which is done without moving to the capture location, unlike Chess) based on the top piece (&quot;rider&quot;).  As an added twist, any piece that moves over the center line of the board flips over, reversing the dragon and rider abilities.  Winner is the last player to have an un-enhanced (villager) piece remaining.&#10;&#10;Full rules: http://www.luchacabra.com/?p=28&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is an abstract strategy game where players are rolling place dice onto a 4x4 chess-board like area.  One player has light dice and the other dark -- and similarly there are light and dark squares on the board.  The player with the highest score in their dice on the opposite toned squares wins.  The trick comes in that the dice are placed with a particular horizontal or vertical orientation, and that when a dice is placed, adjacent dice may be converted if the facing side of the new die is higher in value than the facing side of the original die.  Also, to give a bit more strategic depth, players may store up to 3 dice that they don't like the rolls on -- and may use one of these instead of rolling on any turn.  But, they must use all the stored dice by game end.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Swarm is a turn based abstract strategy game where opponents strive to take over the Hive, or board by eliminating other swarms.  Game pieces move across a number of hexagonal spaces determined by the number of pieces in the stack (called a swarm), and stack and unstack upon landing on specific spaces.&#10;Opponents are eliminated by landing on their spaces, or &quot;stinging&quot; them.  2-player, 3-player, and 6-player boards are currently available.  There are many board variations, but only three are currently in print.  There are also a variety of spaces which have different properties to enhance game strategy.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/swarmplayer/&#10;&#10;",

If neither side can capture all the other side's pieces, and both sides agree to a draw then it is a draw.&#10;&#10;Other possible variations: The size of the board, the number or types of pieces can be different from the International Chess set.

For this reason, it is worth waiting for the player drawing or miming to draw or mime two things or more to make sure of the category being communicated.

    "Description": "Speedy Gonzales is an original race game, where chance has a rather large part, but also tactics are important. The game is played in two phases. In the first phase, the players set their water-gourds - small tokens - along the route. In the second phase, the race itself, each player on his or her turn is confronted with a difficult choice -- either drink one or more water-gourds, and then roll a die for as many gourds drunk (with distribution - 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4) and advance the number indicated, or advance one space without using a water-gourd. Players can collect water-gourds by landing on spaces with them, but cannot carry more than three at the same time. For those not far-sighted enough to plan for the future, some wells are available along the way.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Up A Gum Tree - A game for monkeys!&#10;Throw the dice and move your monkey up the tree. Make use of the creepers, but watch out for the snakes! First to get their monkeys to the top wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is essentially a 3D 'Snakes and Ladders' with a number of subtle changes; each player has two monkeys, both of which must reach the top of the tree to win, each player's section of the tree has two creepers (which are the 'ladders'), but most importantly the pair of snakes on your section of the tree can be moved! Each player races his own pair of monkeys up the tree whilst attempting to avoid the two patrolling snakes, should a monkey and a snake end up on the same space, the monkey falls and has to start the climb over again. On your turn you can roll the dice and either move one of your own monkeys, or any snake (either to clear a route for your own monkeys or attempt to knock an opponents monkey back to the start).&#10;&#10;",

A pool of path tiles, plus Escape and Lost playing pieces are placed face down in the center.  In turn, each player draws a tile from the pool.  The first tile must be a path tile and is placed face up in the center of the table.  After that, drawn path cards must be connected to a path card already played.&#10;&#10;If the Escape tile is turned up, the player instead places one of their character cards on the path.  They are played as a path card but become a dead end.  The Escape tile is returned to the pool and mixed in after use.&#10;&#10;If the Lost tile is turned up, the player instead removes one of their character cards on the path (if they have one) and returns the tile to the pool after use.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of their six pieces wins.  If all paths are blocked before this happens, the player with the most characters used wins.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;34 Playing Pieces&#10;66 Path Cards&#10;&#10;",
