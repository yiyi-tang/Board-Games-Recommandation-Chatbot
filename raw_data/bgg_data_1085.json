    "Description": "Ransom City is no more. What was once a thriving metropolis, turned crime-ridden warzone, is now little more than rubble. A missile strike from an unknown origin preceded the Aftershock&mdash;which is what the aftermath came to be known as. Almost half the city was wiped out by the missile, those that survived emerged from the destruction to be greeted by VANDAL fumes; a chemical-based mutagen that had various effects on its subjects.&#10;&#10;The government has been massively destabilized due to the Kingdom&rsquo;s nefarious activities, and the survivors of Ransom City are left to fend for themselves in their hostile new home. Criminals re-emerged to claim dominance over the remaining resources, while the pharmaceutical giant Parasol Incorporated publicly announced their intention to lead cleanup efforts in Ransom City.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the corporation's interests seem skewed, and since their arrival many things have gotten worse. Including the arrival of strange mutated lab experiments and what could only be described as monsters straight out of horror movies&hellip;&#10;&#10;Aftershock is a deluxe expansion for the Street Masters board game, adding four new fighter decks, four new stage decks, two new enemy decks, new loot cards, and much more! Expanding on the modular nature of Street Masters, Aftershock includes two new ways to customize your play experience: missions and showdowns.&#10;&#10;The mission deck is included to speed up multiplayer games by adding additional ways to support your fellow fighters. Mission cards allow fighters to gain powerful mission tokens, that can in turn be used to assist your fellow fighters during their turn.&#10;&#10;Showdowns are a new type of story deck that can be used in any story mode game, adding a villainous character working in the shadows against the fighters. Each showdown deck introduces a unique story for the associated enemy deck, as well as upgrade cards that will truly test the fighters! Players can also choose to include these enemy upgrade cards in their arcade games to increase difficulty and customize their games even further.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Aftershock comes packed in a massive storage box that is designed to hold all existing Street Masters decks and tokens, as well as room for future content.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this roll-and-move game, each player is attempting to either become the first player to get a job or to be the last player to go bankrupt. On each player's turn they roll the die and move their pawn around the board. Depending on which space they land on, they will most likely draw a card, which will either give them additional qualifications to get a job, interview advice, or contacts. A player can use these cards to move into the Interview Space, and with a little luck and the right cards, the player can win the game. Similarly, players will also collect &quot;Mail&quot; cards during the game, which are bills they must pay periodically. Thus, a player may end up going bankrupt due to their bills before they have a chance to find a job.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Solo Module is designed to slowly reveal an automated plan of battle for the non-player side. The rules determine the command decisions of enemy, non-player generals. They may also be used to automate the decisions of subordinate commanders in one to one game play; adding to uncertainty and unpredictability in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; games.&#10;&#10;The first three sections of the module will generate the non-player&rsquo;s dispositions, orders and battle arrays if the game has been generated by a campaign, or if it is a fictitious battle. Alternatively, if you wish to re-fight a particular battle, you can keep the historical dispositions and go straight to section two and then section three and possibly change the &ldquo;shape&rdquo; and events of the battle by varying the non-players` corps orders and consequently also their battle arrays.&#10;&#10;The non-player will react in response to your grand-tactical movements or to changes in tactical situation. There is also a section which relates to the delegation of orders applying to minor objectives. Section eight, &ldquo;Tactical Systems, Dispositions and Divisional Battle Arrays&rdquo; is reproduced here from Grand Manoeuvre Miniatures Wargames Rules to provide solo players with more useful information on battle arrays, methods and unit formations used by various nations throughout the Napoleonic period.&#10;&#10;Section nine is optional and allows for chance events that may occur in and around the battlefield area that may affect player&rsquo;s and non-player&rsquo;s decisions.&#10;&#10;The module has 106 pages. The text is spaciously laid out and the rules mechanisms are very simple.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Avatars of War: Arena DeathMatch is a 28mm miniatures game that depicts the bloody clash between two or more bands of heroes facing off on the floor of the arena, in front of a raucous crowd that is thirsty for action, violence and death. This deadly contest is known as a deathmatch.&#10;&#10;The most powerful heroes among the mortal races are known as Avatars of War--heroes chosen by the Gods of War themselves. These Avatars, in addition to being fierce combatants, are able to draw upon the silver of divinity within their souls for the power to expand their already awesome combat abilities.&#10;&#10;In Arena DeathMatch, each player controls a band of Avatars of War as they face off on the arena floor in front of a cheering (or jeering) crowd.&#10;&#10;The perils of the Arena stand against you: traps, hazards and even savage beasts stand between you and your opponent. The door to the Arena opens, and the shouting crowd is eager to see their favourite heroes fight to the death. Will they be cheering your victory...or your death? There's only one way to find out!&#10;&#10;DIFFERENCES IN SECOND EDITION (2011) VERSUS FIRST ONE&#10;&#10;The second edition is the result of compiling all the feedback from players and review and refine the first edition rules accordingly, resulting in a  smooth and streamlined set of rules that deliever plenty of action and strategy. In Arena Deathmatch 2nd. ed  you can customize your fighters and game tactics to new levels, choosing from more than 500 different options for their weapons, armor, feats, abilities and spells.   The potential combinations and strategies with the new ruleset are almost limitless.&#10;&#10;DIFFERENCES IN THIRD EDITION (2016) VERSUS SECOND ONE&#10;&#10;The 100% new thing in 3rd are Combat combos: A combat combo consists of performing a succession of combat actions to carry out extremely powerful attacks. Look for the symbol &sect; to know which actions are comboable.&#10;After successfully executing a comboable action, the Avatar can immediately (without the enemy being able to act) perform another action (comboable or not). The combo will end when a non-comboable action is performed, or when performing an action without success (by mistake or by the opponent's counter).&#10;&#10;COMBATE GLADIATORIO FANT&Aacute;STICO&#10;&#10;Arena Deathmatch es un juego de combate de miniaturas.&#10;En Arena Deathmatch cada jugador crea y dirige una banda de Avatares de la Guerra y la enfrenta a la banda de otro jugador en la arena, bajo la mirada de la muchedumbre, sedienta de acci&oacute;n, sangre y violencia.&#10;&#10;El desenlace de una partida de Arena Deathmatch empieza a escribirse mucho antes de saltar al combate, al reclutar y adiestrar a tus campeones de la arena.&#10;Una vez en la arena, deber&aacute;s poner a prueba tu capacidad para pensar r&aacute;pido, usar t&aacute;cticas astutas y utilizar los puntos fuertes de tus luchadores para atacar los puntos d&eacute;biles de los luchadores de tu oponente.&#10;&#10;Pero tu contrincante no es el &uacute;nico obst&aacute;culo hacia la victoria, los peligros de la arena son un reto por s&iacute; solos: pozos de muerte y bestias salvajes se ciernen sobre tu banda.&#10;&#10;Finalmente, no subestimes la importancia de agradar a tus seguidores &iexcl;Tener a la multitud a tu lado marcar&aacute; a menudo la diferencia entre la victoria y la derrota!&#10;&#10;",

Like, does it really mean anything, you know?&#10;&#10;Within days we were backpacking into the mountains of Costa Rica, where we met a man named Ra&uacute;l. The weeks we spent with Ra&uacute;l changed us in ways we can&rsquo;t even begin to describe. When we emerged from the jungle, we brought with us two things: a newly reborn sexual identity and Crabs Adjust Humidity: Volume Seven.&#10;&#10;Ra&uacute;l spoke no English, but by the glow of firelight he taught us things that opened our chakras and brought forth another deck of 112 cards so ethically lacking, they&rsquo;ve truly earned the name Crabs Adjust Humidity.&#10;Includes: 80 white cards, 32 black cards&#10;Part of a complete breakfast.&#10;For recreational use only.&#10; &mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Naja is a genus of venomous snakes known as cobras, and in ancient Egypt they indicated sovereignty, royalty, and even divinity. The gods themselves are depicted crowned with a naja.&#10;&#10;The scarab rolls the sun around to rise each day, and thus ensures renewal and prosperity. As royalty, veritable deities, you send your najas to lay claim to scarabs, ensuring new life for your lineage.&#10;&#10;In the game Naja, players take turns placing cobras on the board trying to surround as many scarabs as possible. But try not to claim bonfires, lest they harm your najas and weaken your reign!&#10;&#10;EQUIPMENT&#10;&#10;This is what you need to play Naja:&#10;&#10;&#10;     9x9 board with a scarab on each cell&#10;     20 white najas (snakes)&#10;     20 black najas (snakes)&#10;     7 bonfires&#10;     40 black baskets&#10;     40 white baskets&#10;&#10;&#10;You can also get the expansion for 3&ndash;4 players:&#10;&#10;&#10;     15 gray najas&#10;     15 purple najas&#10;     30 gray baskets&#10;     30 purple baskets&#10;&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Place the board in the middle of the playing surface. Each player takes all najas and counters of her colour.&#10;&#10;Randomly place 5 or 7 bonfires (not 6) on different spaces of the board, except for the middle space (to avoid symmetric play) and the border spaces (where they pose almost no risk).&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;White starts. Players take turns in clockwise order legally placing a naja of their colour until no legal placement remains, at which point the game ends.&#10;&#10;Najas have 4 segments. Each naja must be placed so that:&#10;&#10;&#10;     All four segments lie on 4 segments of the board.&#10;     They don&rsquo;t overlap.&#10;&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more placements are possible.&#10;&#10;Players then claim areas as follows: The player with more naja segments surrounding an enclosed area must claim it by placing a basket of her colour on each space in the area (except for areas with bonfires on them). If two (or more) players tie in claiming an area, it remains unclaimed. The edge of the board is not a wall, so some areas around the edge might remain unclaimed.&#10;&#10;Each claimed scarab is worth +1 point, but each claimed bonfire is worth &minus;3 points (najas don&rsquo;t like fire!). Ties are possible and are OK: Just play again!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The most authentic roguelike available on the tabletop!&#10;&#10;Long ago, the Known Lands were invaded by the Gone, a savage army of undead warriors. The War lasted for centuries, and the invaders were only defeated through the use of the Relic, a weapon of unimaginable, world-shattering power. After the War was won, the Relic was stored deep in King Boldfoot&rsquo;s vaults, and the Known Lands enjoyed a long period of peace and prosperity.&#10;&#10;Everything changed when the Gone returned and stole the Relic. To assure their own survival, the Gone broke the Relic into four parts and hid its pieces in the Known Lands&rsquo; deepest and most forbidding places. Brave adventurers, you must retrieve the shards of the Relic. The fate of our world is on your shoulders.&#10;&#10;Queen&rsquo;s Quest is a cooperative, dungeon-crawling adventure for 1-5 players. Inspired by classic &ldquo;Roguelike&rdquo; computer games, Queen&rsquo;s Quest features random map generation, 396 different character combinations, 360 different types of standard monsters, multiple levels of difficulty, and secret, &ldquo;unlockable&rdquo; content. Each level of the dungeon takes under one hour to play.&#10;&#10;Do you enter the dungeon (Y/N)?_&#10;&#10;",

If there are already 3 animals (mother, Father, kid) in the area and enough Food, the player wins the &quot;produce&quot; counter (e.g. milk from the cows or eggs from the chicken).&#10;&#10;&#10;When the Five products have been picked up the game ends.

    "Description": "In Daggers High, you play an overworked high school student who will do anything to get into the best university in the nation. Unfortunately, only one student will be accepted. Manage your grades, social life, and influence with teachers to gain resume points. The player with the most resume points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with 4 Freshman event cards, and draft them. In a two-player game, the players will draw 6 Freshman event cards and discard 2 of them. Then, the players take turns playing cards from their hand. The card's event occurs. Then, the player gains a number of action points. Each action point can be spent on one of the five actions. Players can socialize to gain friends that can be used to purchase club leadership, granting an immediate and yearly bonus as well as Resume Points. Players can also study to gain one of four stats that can go towards test correcting a class, another action. Correcting a class to an A provides a teacher influence bonus as well as resume points. A player can also chat with one of eight teachers to gain teacher influence with them. This influence can be spent on a special ability or on gaining a recommendation letter that is worth a significant amount of Resume Points. Finally, players can relax to reduce their stress. This is important because a high amount of stress will cause breakdown, resulting in lower happiness that increases stress at the end of every year, and a detention that causes a loss of Resume Points.&#10;&#10;Players also manage secret goals in the form of Essays. Each player is dealt two Essays at the beginning of the game, and can complete them at any time to draw an additional essay. All essays are worth points at the end of the game. At the start of Junior Year, players may also elect to take the FUN, a standardized test that costs Stats to take. The FUN result is determined by a die roll, and can result in a large resume point bonus, or nothing at all.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The game presents a unique interpretation of the campaign in that the two German commanders are also simultaneously Soviet commanders. The player who runs the &ldquo;German Northern Command&rdquo; also runs the &ldquo;Soviet Sothern Command,&rdquo; and the player who runs the &ldquo;German Southern Command&rdquo; also runs the &ldquo;Soviet Northern Command.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In that way both players &ndash; when in their roles as German field marshals &ndash; are trying to win the game by using their own forces to outdo the competing German player. What matters most is not defeating the Soviets, but accomplishing more than your counterpart German field marshal. In that way you will earn the lion&rsquo;s share of the credit from the Fuehrer. Of course, since you also command the Soviet forces resisting the advance of your counterpart German field marshal&rsquo;s advance, those Red Army units are also helping you to win by frustrating him.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A political game where a player plays as a party in a town called Brige in Europe, 1915. His goal is to attract as many followers to support his party by moving across the map of Brige. The game begins with the overthrow of Major of Brige, and ends in 1918, the end of WW2, when order is brought back to the town and elections take place. The party with the most voters wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is consisted of a main board map (the town of Brige), Personal Board- these boards give information about the party's current stand. Their content is changed along the game as the party is influenced by the player's decisions, and other effects . In addition, there are &quot;Point of Interest&quot; cards that resemble an encounter with a citizen or an event that is happening that requires the party's decision. Whenever a player lands on a Point of Interest, he takes a card from the pile and must act according to the type of event at hand, and organize his position after reading the consequences. The face of the cards is where the information about the event is given, with the available decisions &amp; options at its bottom. On the back of the card is where the decision's effect is shown.&#10;&#10;Along the game, a party may hire citizens that it encounters and turn them into &quot;Agents&quot;. Once this is done, the player places a figure on the board. Agents are the connecting bridge between the players, and allows a party to make contact with other parties. Every agent has its own skill and have specific actions that can be done with them. A Gunman for example, may attack other units on the board, including the party leader that will lose the player's game if is assasinated.&#10;&#10;An important aspect in the game is money. The game currency is called &quot;Brigs&quot;, and is affected by the current information on the player's Personal Board, or throught drawn Point of Interest cards. Without money, an agent can't be paid, some actions can't be made, and the player will most likely have few units on the board, what makes him vulnerable to Gunmans. The player must carefuly plan his campaign in order to make sure he doesn't fall into issues such as this.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Orang Rimba or Anak Dalam tribe is a native resident of Bukit Dua Belas National Park in Jambi. They live harmoniously with nature that provides them resources to live and survive. However, the peace is suddenly broken. Some parts of the forests are massively exploited by irresponsible people, leaving nature prone to destruction and lost of many resources.&#10;&#10;In Orang Rimba: The Forest Keeper, players represent two members of the Orang Rimba tribe. Each turn, they spend action points to move around the forest gathering resources, complete a goal, deliver goods to barter for other goods, and chase away the illegal loggers who irresponsibly exploit the forest resources for their own benefit.&#10;&#10;The game ends after twelve rounds or when one of the players has managed to complete all of their goals.&#10;&#10;",

Tiles are drawn from a central pile and used to make words. Some tiles are &quot;twistable&quot; meaning the tile can be used as two different letters depending on which edge is up. Teams can steal other teams tiles by adding tiles to make a word or rearranging the tiles to make another word.

The player who holds a wooden spider cup throws the dice, and the hunt begins!&#10;&#10;The leader throws the dice in the middle of the flower field and tries to catch the bug that was shown on the dice while the bug is still sitting on the petal. The player that is holding this bug needs to quickly figure out that their bug is about to be caught and straightway pull it away from the petal. The leader throws the dice and tries to catch the right bug until they succeed. When the spider, finally, gets the bug, the player whose bug was caught passes the string tail to the leader and takes the spider cup to become the leader in the next round.&#10;&#10;The game has three rule options, three different levels of difficulty. You can throw one die with colors and hunt for those who sit on the petal of the given color. It's a little harder to react to the die with the colors and shapes of the bugs. And for the advanced Bugsies, there is an option with two dice. Here the task is to combine given colors and shapes.&#10;&#10;The game ends when... in fact, it doesn't have to end. You can take a break when everyone has played enough and every player got a chance to be a spider. Thank each other for the great game, rest a little, and come back to Bugsies.&#10;&#10;",

Player of Fielding team and player of Batting team have their own cards to choose. The cards (usually three different) player can use depend on the situation on the field (ie. how many runners are on the field etc.).&#10;&#10;Depending which action (card) batting team player chooses and which one fielding team player chooses determines the outcome of that particular throw of the ball. Both cards are revealed simultaneously. Batting player might have get called &quot;out&quot; or the players on the field might have been called &quot;out&quot; or batting player succeeded to advance from base to another or even managed to score a run.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Rules stipulate that the game can be played by either two players or two teams of players, but since the tasks of individual team members are not defined any further than that in the rules, this is essentially just a 2-player game.&#10;&#10;Box front carries an endorsement by the then executive director of the Finnish Baseball League, Markku Pullinen.&#10;&#10;Patent pending no. 772736&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The &quot;Stone Age&quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.&#10;&#10;In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.&#10;&#10;Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.&#10;&#10;Stone Age: 10th Anniversary is a new edition of the Stone Age base game that features a double-sided game board (winter and summer), decorative player pieces, a revised rulebook, two mini-expansions (&quot;The Igloos&quot; and &quot;The Wild Animals&quot;), and a &quot;Winter Is Hard!&quot; variant.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seancha&iacute; (bearer of old lore in Gaelic) is a matching/capture card game based on the myths and lore of Ireland.  There are seven regular suits (Warfare, Legends, Landscape, Treasure, Roles, Religion, Stoneworks) which are captured by matching cards of the same suit.  There are two special suits:  Shamrocks and Dark Cards.  Shamrocks are free points and extend a turn.  Dark cards are discards against another player.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an action followed by a discard.  The action can be either capturing a same suited card on the Tableau with a card in a player&rsquo;s hand or flipping over a card.  The flipped card is now the only card that can capture: either a card from the player&rsquo;s hand or one from the Tableau.  Captured cards are moved to a player&rsquo;s point field.  A discard ends the turn which is either a regular suited card on the tableau or a dark card against another player.&#10;&#10;Complexity and strategy is created by determining when to play Shamrocks to extend a turn, when to capture cards that can be effected by Dark cards, saving wild cards or other counter cards to combat a dark card, and strategizing to capture the cards that are part of a sc&eacute;al (story).   &#10; The goal of the game is to amass the highest points after four rounds.  Points are counted on individual cards as well as in combinations of sc&eacute;alta (stories) that are depicted by matching icons.  Dark cards are negative points and have special effects that can target other cards.  Any cards left in a player&rsquo;s hand at the end of a round are counted against them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hey, which do YOU prefer?&#10;&#10;Annecto Punch is a communication game where two opposing teams battle it out to guess what the alien judge likes. Every round, the teams will come up with an answer for what they think the alien likes the most for the chosen topic. The alien then chooses the team whose answer they preferred, and gives them a fist bump to represent their connection. We hope that you will have fun sharing and bonding over the things you like, as the topics that come up while playing this game naturally lead to conversations between the players. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;ve just met for the first time or are a group of close friends; Annecto Punch is a game for everyone.

But, in addition to competing for access to best building and newly discovered technologies, you must negotiate how you will work together with other players to complete the colony or escape via the alien ship.&#10;&#10;Each turn players take a number of actions with their explorers cubes depending on the cards they play. These actions can include: Claiming a part of the colony, which requires a set number of explorers, or claiming an alien technology for which you use your explorer to 'outbid' other players. Colony buildings and ship technologies when claimed are added to your hand of cards, thus increasing your ability to take additional actions in future turns.&#10;&#10;Colony building and actions that repair the alien ship can be done collaboratively--and players can negotiate the completion of a specific building or the repair of a part of the ship to their advantage.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either the colony is completed or the ship is fully repaired. Since players are awarded extra points for correctly forecasting which outcome ends the game, ad hoc alliances are formed as players seek to steer the game to their chosen conclusion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "End fast, but the grudge will last long!&#10;&#10;Kongkang is a party card game based on a traditional card game from Southern Thailand called &quot;Kang&quot;. Players try to get rid of high cards and match those previously played to steal Banana tokens. When someone declares &quot;Kongkang&quot;, everyone reveals their hand, and the player who has the lowest hand wins the pot. After three rounds, the player with the most banana tokens wins!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the first round, deal 5 cards to each player. Everyone places 2 Banana tokens in the center of the table as a pot for the round. On your turn, you must perform one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     Draw a card and play any number of identical cards. If they are special cards, resolve the action for each card.&#10;     Follow the card(s) played by the previous player. First, play any number of cards that match the followed card(s). Then, steal that many Banana tokens from that player. However, if that player also followed the previous player, instead steal from the player who first played the card(s).&#10;     Declare Kongkang. Everyone reveals all cards in their hand and compute their total value (with special card being worth 10). The player with the lowest total wins the round and claims all Banana tokens from the pot, where a tie goes to the one closest to (and including) the declarer in turn order. In addition, if the declarer didn't win, they discard half the Banana tokens to the game box.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player draws the last card from the deck, the next player is forced to declare Kongkang. After the winner is determined, a new round begins with these changes.&#10;&#10;     The winner of the round becomes the first player for the next round. &#10;     Players with the most Banana tokens place 4 tokens in the pot, and those with the fewest Banana tokens place 1 token. Everyone else places 2 tokens as usual.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There are two forces of warriors: those chosen by Gods and those forsaken. Normally the most powerful faction in the chosen force is dominant. However, the forsaken force prevails if they outnumber the chosen force in headcount, in which case the most powerful faction in the forsaken force is dominant.&#10;&#10;Each player initially has four warrior cards, each of which has a color and strength value printed in its face. During your turn, you place one warrior card face-down on either force. One of the other players has two options: accept your decision, or refuse your decision and send the card to the opposite force face-up.&#10;&#10;Each card has partial information about its identity printed on its back, and some cards have a special ability when refused. You should speculate about what card your opponent placed, and whether the opponent wants you to refuse.&#10;&#10;The game ends when each player has one card in hand. Determine the dominating faction in the manner described above. The player who has the strongest card of the dominating faction wins the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#164;&#169;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#130;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#177;&#136;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#231;&#180;&#148;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#229;&#191;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#168;&#177;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#176;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#131;&#133;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#169;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Each time the dragon is found and not matched, it turns the board around, steals your matches and may even win the game.&#10;&#10;There is also a TIME SLIDING ALTERNATIVE PLAY.&#10;&#10;There are myths and rumors that Pythia mastered the mysterious art of time sliding. She drank the foaming waters that spurted from a chasm in the earth to start her slide through time and banish the darkness. Time sliding is when you experience the same events in a loop over and over again. When you die you slide back in time and start again. The loop can only be broken after success in some great challenge. Otherwise you are doomed to slide for eternity! The secret is to set yourself up for success in the next loop by what you do and remember in the loops before. Many do not believe time sliding exists and that it is possible to successfully escape the slide. Are you bold enough to find out yourself?&#10;&#10;Play alone or with as many others as you like. The length of play is timed. Each turn you fail, you replace the tiles so it is easier to remember&#10;the matches. The unmatched tiles and all the tiles you have just collected are placed back onto any open square, before turning them over. Then you start another turn.&#10;&#10;There is also a WORLD WIDE EXPANSION.&#10;&#10;Pythia was renowned all over the world. Nothing was completely hidden from her sight. Your spatial conception is challenged in this fun experience of your favorite places.&#10;&#10;Choose a play area, which may be a room, park, or wherever you want to play. All of the tiles are placed face down, in plain sight, scattered within the defined area of play. Tiles may be on the ground or different objects such as plants may be used to make it interesting to search for the tiles.&#10;&#10;Time sliding and the world wide expansion can be played together for a unique experience.&#10;&#10;THOLOS IS ONLY AVAILABLE AS PART OF THE ANCIENT WORLD MULTI GAME SYSTEM FROM PLAYFORD GAMES&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Obsidian was extremely valuable and used to make razor sharp weapons and farm tools. The nearly lifeless island attracted explorers searching for the valuable rocks containing obsidian. They landed their boats next to the beaches and moved inland, where they mined the rock. They pushed the rocks to the beaches and then into their boats for transport overseas.&#10;&#10;Choose your tiles carefully, so that together they overcome the resistance of the rocks and opponents.

    "Description": "The Wall, based on the television show of the same name, is played with two teams, with each team trying to earn more money than the other by game's end. One player on the team drops balls into different channels of the wall, with the balls ending up in troughs that are worth varying amounts of money. This player's partner attempts to answer trivia questions, without seeing how much money the ball-dropper has earned. After eleven questions, the player behind the wall has to decide whether to accept the guaranteed amount or to take a chance that the sum won through questions is higher.&#10;&#10;",

Main characters are Prime Minister Juha Sipil&auml; and Minister of Education Sanni Grahn-Laasonen.&#10;&#10;Players start with a certain number of students and teachers (wooden bits) which they assign to different schools (from primary to university). During the game, cutback after cutback (different event cards) force players to fire teachers or do some other unpleasant action which leads to student alienation. Players may struggle against the cutbacks (eg. reassign teachers), but eventually they can't save everybody.
