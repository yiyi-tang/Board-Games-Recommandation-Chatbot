    "Description": "Wise Guys is a quick-to-learn, cutthroat, area-control board game in which you play as one of four rival gangs seeking to strike it rich as &quot;Rum Runners&quot; on the rough streets of Chicago at the height of the roaring 20s.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players wheel, deal, talk, and fight to control locations where they buy and sell alcohol, help politicians get elected, and get help in return or double-cross rival gangs. Negotiate, threaten, and ally with rival gangs when it serves your needs, but be wary of the inevitable knife in the back...&#10;&#10;Over six rounds, players take turns driving to locations in the city represented by the grid of cards at the center of the board. Different locations provide access to materials, cash, or clout that the player's gang members can &quot;acquire&quot; through trade, earning profit from property within their territory or by exploiting parts of the city under the control of a rival gang. All players must maintain a certain discretion as selling too much in one round will draw unwanted attention or else saturate the city in liquor &mdash; and your fellow mafioso won't be too happy about lost profits.&#10;&#10;The gang with the most cash at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

The brief but brutal war in 1982 began after the Argentines unexpectedly seized Stanley, the capital of the Falklands, and the island of South Georgia from small garrisons of British Royal Marines. The British government responded by sending a large naval task force to the South Atlantic to reclaim the disputed islands. Here, the fierce ground combat that occurred during the war is depicted as only the immersive squad-level Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series can.&#10;&#10;The 13 scenarios Heroes of the Falklands feature the Argentine seizures of Stanley and South Georgia and all of the major land battles, from the British Paras&rsquo; costly but morale-boosting assaults on Darwin Hill and Goose Green, to the daring commando raid on Top Malo House, across East Falkland to the climatic battles for the ring of hills around Stanley. Two what-if scenarios depict Argentine opposition to the British landing at San Carlos and a last-ditch fight for control of Stanley. Put on your cold-weather combat gear and bring along a pair of night-vision goggles: the fate of the islands is at stake!&#10;&#10;It's not just squad combat it's Lock 'n Load Tactical&#10;&#10;UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

    "Description": "Ranger is a tactical, role-playing simulation of a Ranger patrol on a combat mission. The game places the player in the role of the patrol&rsquo;s leader. It allows the player to experience some of the decisions that face a Ranger patrol leader.&#10;&#10;From the Designer's Notes: &quot;In designing Ranger, I have attempted to do two things. First, I wanted to give the wargamer a realistic simulation of Ranger operations. Second, I felt the need to keep the game playable. Most tactical games have hundreds of complicated rules to memorize, but bear no relation to actual field maneuvers . . . Patrolling suits solitaire gaming fairly well. While conventional operations are the result of the efforts of numerous commanders and staff officers, patrols generally depend entirely on the patrol leader's actions . . . I made every attempt to present the tactical situations as the patrol leader would experience them. I wanted the game system to avoid excessive administrative bookkeeping and rules memorization . . . I tried to simulate patrolling from my own experiences and not be tied to more standard wargame conventions . . . The element of chance throughout Ranger is by design. No patrol leader can control his environment. He can only plan for as many possibilities as he has time and be alert and prepared to implement these contingency plans if necessary. Even the most experienced player making all the correct decisions will occasionally be destroyed. Combat is always dangerous, but even more so when forward of friendly lines.&quot;&#10;&#10;Components: Rules of Play booklet, Patrolling Tactics booklet, Tactical Events booklet, laminated game map, laminated Patrol Record Log, plastic Tactical Template, Glossary folder, Combat Results Card, Tactical Reference Card, Extended Patrolling Card, 18 Mission Cards, 2 six-sided dice, China marker pencil.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Avalanche Press website:)&#10;&#10;Third Reich interweaves not only the land, naval and air struggles, but also the equally important economic and political battles. Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.&#10;&#10;Players take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.&#10;&#10;The currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).&#10;&#10;Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.&#10;&#10;Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.&#10;&#10;&#10;As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.&#10;&#10;There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.&#10;&#10;Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).&#10;&#10;",

Trouble adds a new event card to the deck: hunger, paperwork, glitches, accidents, leaks, power failure &mdash; whatever can go wrong will go wrong, then whenever the deck is shuffled, you can prepare for all those events once again.&#10;&#10;Players can add cards to the shared deck, too, whether perks that are only for you or developments that affect all players.&#10;&#10;The game lasts until one player's moon colony has no people remaining, or until the players reach the bottom of the event deck.

They tow them into the best position as this is decisive for the success or disappointment of the market day. Only those embarkation points are profitable where enough boats are huddled around, the rest goes away empty-handed. But not only the market days are decisive for the merchants&rsquo;  success, the final scoring of the stock will be important as well. The player who settled his main focus only on some goods will come off especially well, the collection of all sorts of goods is not preferable for the final score.&#10;&#10;Players place boats on the board, trying to take the best places. When a scoring round occurs filled up squares can be scored. After scoring players have to remove a boat which they can take in stock. The stock will be scored at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Then the players make one lap around the Training Track of the gameboard with each of their horses. Here the players collect advantage and disadvantage cards to be used in the race. Also on the Training Track, the players gain or lose money that can be bet on the race. Once the players have circumnavigated the Training Track, the gameboard is flipped to reveal the Race Track.&#10;&#10;The players may enter only 3 horses into the race. The players may bet on any horse to win. After the betting is over the race begins. The players roll one die and move their horses in turn, utilizing the cards earned during the first half of the game whenever it is felt to be advantageous. The players who bet on the winning horse divide the money bet on the race minus ten percent (that goes to the Bookmaker).&#10;&#10;",

Feed your citizens, protect them from invaders, and secure their places in the afterlife!&#10;&#10;IUNU is a card game for 2 to 4 players lasting about 30 minutes, with the game lasting eight rounds (with 2 or 4 players) and nine rounds (with 3 players). To set up, divide the cards into two decks &mdash; citizens cards and afterlife cards &mdash; shuffling each and placing them face down as draw decks. One player, selected to be the starting player, takes the starting player card with the (1) icon oriented up, rolls the three four-sided dice, and sets them in front of all the players along with the Bread and Deben counters. The starting player then deals an initial hand of cards &mdash; 2 players: 6 cards, 3 or 4 players: 5 cards &mdash; to each player, as well as 9 Debens worth of tokens.&#10;&#10;Each round of game play has two phases:&#10;&#10;&bull; Dynasty Phase: In turn, beginning with the starting player, each player plays one, or a set of, citizen cards of the same type in front of them to their &quot;Dynasty&quot;. For each additional card played beyond the first, the player must pay 1 Deben per card [Exception: The Scribe]. The player may then use the special ability of that card type as applicable. Note: You only use the Special Ability once when laying down sets of cards within a turn, i.e., even if you play a set of three Priest cards together in one turn, you only look at the afterlife deck once. Citizen cards have three numbered icons on their lefthand side:&#10;&#10;1. Victory points (VP) that this card will score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;2. If a player has a clear majority of a type of citizen card (ties do not count) at game end, they gain this additional number of VP. This number may be further multiplied by an afterlife card. This number is also the total number of cards of that type in the deck.&#10;    &#10;3. Bread: A player gains additional VP if the Baker feeds that citizen with bread (see: The Baker).&#10;&#10;&bull; Discard Phase: After each player has played one or a set of cards, all players must discard down to one card in their hand. The citizen discard and draw decks are then shuffled together and players draw back to their initial hand size. The starting player passes the starting player card to the next player to the left and it is rotated clockwise to the next round number. Lastly, the new starting player again rolls the three four-sided dice and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;After the required number of rounds &mdash; or if a player cannot draw the required number of cards back from the draw deck at the end of any round &mdash; the game ends. Count victory points to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;&bull; Total the number of victory points listed on each citizen card&#10;&bull; Add victory points for a majority of each citizen card type (no points awarded for ties). This value may be multiplied by an Afterlife Card. Multiple Afterlife Cards may be used but only one afterlife card per one majority may be used&#10;&bull; Add victory points for all Bread-fed citizens&#10;&bull; Every 3 Deben coins are worth one additional VP each&#10;&#10;In the case of a tie the player with the most Deben coins wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Birds of Prey - Air Combat in the Jet Age is a revolutionary jet dogfighting game, simulating flight with unprecedented precision and engrossing play. &#10;The Birds of Prey flight mechanics allow freedom in three dimensions without requiring special maneuver rules. Physics-based systems model aircraft performance differences correctly and simply through the use of only two elegant playaids; graphical computers known as nomograms. Missiles fly out towards their targets without player intervention, using proper kinematics from launch and flowing seamlessly into the underlying flight engine. The core of Birds of Prey is the PHAD - the Pitch, Heading, and Attitude Display, a simple tool allowing players to track their the orientation of an aircraft in three dimensions. The PHAD makes it trivial to find the relative position (bearings) and relative motion between maneuvering aircraft. It also makes figuring blind spots where you can't sight other aircraft a trivial exercise, regardless of whether the aircraft is flying straight and level, has its nose pointing straight up, or is in the middle of a wingover.&#10;&#10;The lavishly illustrated Birds of Prey tutorial guides you through learning the game solo, while the rulebook is a reference for rules questions only. The play aids are built to keep the rulebook in the box during play. Laminated play-aids use a system of hints that lead players through flight and eases return to play. Full-color box-miniatures are placed on tilt-blocks and stacking tiles showing altitude, pitch, roll and heading and bringing the three-dimensional fight to life.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Book of Rituals is a book full of puzzles set in the universe known from the Escape Tales series of games. While solving the tasks presented in the book, players assume the role of discoverers of secret knowledge. Each subsequent task will reveal the secrets of the elements and alchemical ingredients, to finally allow them to perform various magical rituals. In total, 45 tasks of various formulas and types await players &mdash; from less complex puzzles to complex, multi-stage riddles.&#10;&#10;The topics covered in the book refer directly to the events of the Escape Tales series. Although knowledge of games is not necessary to solve riddles, experienced players will find flavors and references to the series' stories here. Important characters from the games, such as Samuel from The Awakening or heroes from Children of Wyrmwoods. These characters become secondary heroes in The Book of Rituals, who, just like the players, have delved into the book's secrets. For better or for worse...&#10;&#10;Solving riddles is done with the help of a free application that does not require installation on devices and works on both mobile devices and computers. It is primarily used to check answers but also provides hints for riddles. What is characteristic of the Escape Tales products is that players are not judged or punished for using the hints. The overall goal is player satisfaction, so the application is designed to help them, not judge them.&#10;&#10;The Book of Rituals is a breath of fresh air in the mystery book market. It stands out from the competition with a formula that encourages and sometimes forces the book's exploration in the order that is convenient for players &mdash; it does not have a single path from puzzle to puzzle. The mechanics have been prepared in such a way that players who get stuck on one of the tasks can freely solve others and return to it with fresh ideas or use the hints without the feeling of losing. Thanks to the creative use of the application, the book can also surprise players.&#10;&#10;",

The game is won when either all 12 gods in an entire pantheon is wiped out, or when Asgard or Mt. Olympus is destroyed. Players draw five cards every turn and then are allowed 3 actions. These actions can include Invoking a god, Moving, Attacking, playing a Divine Power card, using a god's Special Ability or Acquiring a dropped bonus chip. Red chips are stacked under each character to represent that characters health. Modifiers such as Attack Bonus, Armor, or Disabled are also represented by different colored chips. No two gods are alike, and their actions and abilities closely correlate to the mythology they were derived from. The luck of the cards you draw forces you to change your strategy from game to game. There is no reshuffling when you are out of cards, so once a god is dead, they're dead. Game play takes about a half an hour to an hour, depending on the players' skill, luck of the draw and the strategies used.&#10;&#10;Created by award-winning video game industry veteran Ryan Lesser (Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Beatles:Rock Band, Dance Central...), High Heavens is a 2-player, expandable board game that utilizes lessons learned from 15 years of video game creation and a lifetime of playing board games.&#10;&#10;",

Join the Soul Raiders.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Soul Raiders is a story-driven cooperative game, created by best-selling author Marc Andr&#195;&#169; (Splendor) and a team of talented artists, such as Guillaume Tavernier (De Architectura) or Magali Villeneuve (Magic The Gathering).&nbsp;&#10;&#10;In this fast-paced narrative game, the players become powerful heroes.

Each chapter depicts a specific setting in which players will complete quests, collect information and increase their power to progress through the overarching story.&nbsp;&#10;    Soul Raiders&nbsp;will spread on several chapters, woving an epic tale around the players and their characters from one book to the next.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;A fast-paced and cinematic game system&#10;    The game system features a fast-paced and streamlined gameplay', entirely geared towards the experience of a story-driven, cinematic and cooperative adventure.&#10;    The players act simultaneously to explore their surroundings. Without turn order, they can progress together or split the party as they see fit to hop from one scene to the next.&#10;    Each setting is composed of a set of tiles, places where the heroes can interact with their environment. Taking a variety of actions while battling the forces pitted against them, they jump from one tile to another as the story unfolds, sometimes spread out on different scenes, always focusing on the heart of the action.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Building cooperative tension&#10;    The heroes live and die as one. Their health points is a common pool, tracked on the side of the board: each time a player takes damage, the marker progresses. If it goes too far, the whole party fail at completing the chapter.&#10;    Even if they manage to stay safe, time runs out fast... The Threat track is another timer that brings the heroes to their demise. It progresses as they encounter new creatures and events, leading to their capture if they stay idle for too long.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Narrative story with a strong replay value&#10;    If they cooperate efficiently, any path can lead to the completion of the current chapter, as the players do not have to follow a specific set of events, but try to achieve independent and interwoven quests.&nbsp;&#10;    If the party fails, it can still move onto the next chapter, triggering a unique setback. Only the final chapter of the story needs to be completed successfully &mdash; or else they will go back to the beginning of the tome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10;    This non-linear approach to a narrative system, combined to the time pressure and the possibility to push the story further,&nbsp; ensure a very good replay value to the gaming experience.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Soul Raiders offers you:&#10;    More than 1000 cards illustrated by a team of talented artists, such as Guillaume Tavernier (De Architectura) or Magali Villeneuve (Magic The Gathering),&#10;    Innovative story-driven cooperative game,&#10;    Streamlined and fast-paced system,&#10;    Strong narrative elements with good replay value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.&#10;&#10;The game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as &quot;Improved Bridge Building Techniques&quot; that allow players to build across estuaries or &quot;Sheep Boom Goes Bust&quot; which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.&#10;&#10;During the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.&#10;&#10;If all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.&#10;&#10;",

But when an ominous force invades the world, Bethel Woods becomes a distant memory, lost inside the thickets of the forest.&#10;&#10;Now a group of young people, wearing the crest of the orphanage, return to finish the work that was started long ago. They must work diligently, however, to repair and restore the machines scattered throughout the forest, before the ominous force finds the technology and destroys the only chance the world has in surviving.&#10;&#10;The cooperative game Bethel Woods is set in the universe of &quot;Hours&quot;, created by author, Jessy Ribordy (Falling Up/The River Empires) and uses a mancala-like mechanism. Players first pick up all the Workers from any one of the 6 Machines surrounding the Orphanage, then move either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the board, dropping one worker on each Machine and fixing Malfunctions as they go. There are 4 Malfunction types, each with a matching Worker type to fix it. All Malfunctions that players fix are added to their personal supply as &quot;Knowledge&quot;.&#10;&#10;To win, players need to send 6 of the 12 Workers into Bethel Woods Orphanage with increasing amounts of Knowledge to construct the &quot;Daydreamer&quot; (a machine that will rescue the orphanage's inhabitants from the impending downfall). The first Worker needs just 1 Knowledge of their type, the second 2, the third 3, and so on.&#10;&#10;Players also need to use their acquired Knowledge to uncover spies, hidden within each of the Machines. Players may uncover 1 Spy only on the last Machine they place a Worker on each turn.&#10;&#10;After each turn, three random Malfunctions are drawn and added to the various Machines. If a Machine has more than 3 Malfunctions and/or Spies, it goes into the critical state. These all make the task of maintaining the Machines and constructing the Daydreamer that much harder. Also, any round where at least one Machine goes critical, results in a Spy being placed.&#10;&#10;Players lose the game if at the end of a player's turn, there are 4 critical Machines. They can also lose immediately if there are ever 6 Spies on the board or not enough Malfunctions when placing them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Invasion: America is a &quot;mini-monster&quot; wargame designed by Jim Dunnigan and published by SPI in 1976. It depicts a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist Coalition (ESC) staging their invasion from Cuba, the South American Union (SAU) invading from Columbia, and the Pan Asiatic League (PAL) invading along the Pacific coast. Defending North America is a coalition of the United States and Canada, with Central America and Mexico having been annexed earlier in the alternate history timeline. It can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map of North America in which each 'hex' is approximately 130 kilometers (81 mi) from side to side. Distinctive color and symbology is used to represent which of the nine different terrain types dominates the hex. There is additional symbology for ports, supply sources, resource centers and amphibious landing zones. There are also map features along the hexsides including rivers, borders, and and other boundaries. Both movement and combat are affected by terrain.&#10;&#10;There are 400 (7 are blank) 1/2-inch cardboard pieces (unit counters) representing the land, air, and naval military and logistics units of each combatant. The unit counters have numerical combat and movement ratings. Land and Air units are double-sided with their actual combat values on one side, and a question mark on the other side to indicate the unit's &quot;untried&quot; status, making it the first game to have this feature. Units are initially deployed as untried, and only when they are committed to combat is their true strength revealed.&#10;&#10;On each turn players may move all, some or none of their units through a number of hexes equal to or less than its movement rating allows. After movement is completed units that are adjacent to enemy units may engage in combat. Combat strengths are totaled for all participating units on each side and the relative strengths are expressed as a simplified odds ratio. A 6-sided die is rolled and the appropriate odds column is consulted to determine the combat result. Combat may result in retreats and/or losses to attacker, defender or both.&#10;&#10;Invasion: America includes six different scenarios lasting 8 turns and a campaign game of 60 turns. Each turn of the game represents one month. Scenario instructions define each side's order of battle and initial deployment, their unit replacement rates and victory conditions. Victory is determined by control of urban, supply and resource hexes that yield victory points.&#10;&#10;Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a larger, more complicated sequel in 1978, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Murus Gallicus is a two-player breakthrough game in which players try to create impenetrable walls of stone reminiscent of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s Gallic Wars.&#10;&#10;The object of the Murus Gallicus is to reach your opponent's home row or to stalemate your opponent.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a rectangular board consisting of an 8x7 array of cells. Each player starts with a set of 16 tokens referred to as stones; one light set and one dark set. The board is placed between players so that there are seven rows and eight columns. To start the game, each player takes a set of stones and stacks two stones on each of their eight home cells; their nearest row. The Roman player uses the light set and goes first. The Gaul player uses the dark set. Players alternate turns.&#10;&#10;The basic units of the game are towers and walls. A tower consists of two like-colored stones in a cell. A wall is a single stone in a cell. Only towers move. The main function of walls is to block the opponent's movement and secondarily they act as stepping stones which can be used later on to create new towers. Towers move by sowing as in Mancala with a stacking limit of two and only like-colored stones may be stacked. Each of the destination cells must be empty or contain a friendly wall. Tower stones can be used to remove adjacent opponent walls. This is done by sacrifice! Material remains equal throughout the game but slowly erodes for both players as players defuse threats. A player is stalemated if unable to move/sow or sacrifice at the start of his or her turn. Going flat out (stalemating yourself) in order to stalemate your opponent can be very satisfying.&#10;&#10;Murus Gallicus is a game of balance, space and timing. Players must balance defense and offense. By controlling the board's center, a player can gain mobility. Players must wait for the right moment to squeeze through the opponent's defense. The endgame can be very tense thanks to the balance in material.&#10;&#10;There are several useful structures players can employ. The Gallic Wall consisting of orthogonally connected walls (and sometimes towers) requires the opponent to go around the wall or blast his or her way thorough using a sacrificed stone. The Chariot consists of a tower, wall and empty space aligned. By sowing the towers stones in the direction of the wall, the two-celled formation glides forward. The battering ram consists of two towers and an opponent wall aligned. By sacrificing a tower stone, the opponent's wall can be removed. The remaining chariot formation can then move through the breach on the player's next turn. Lastly, a siege tower is a tower sitting within striking distance of the opponent's home row. Such a tower can tie up many of your opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;The true excitement of the game is in the playing. A sneak attack that squeezes through a breach or a well-timed all out assault can be quite satisfying.&#10;&#10;",

Warriors from lands both known and unknown perform upon the sands for the chance at freedom, riches, and eternal glory. Many choose this life, some are condemned to it -- they will face men, beasts, and creatures of myth, all for the favor of the crowd.&#10;&#10;Arena Rex is a table-top miniatures game of gladiatorial combat.  Battles of 3 to 8 combatants per side are recommended, and take approximately 30 to 40 minutes to play. Simple, intuitive rules offer myriad tactical possibilities.  Maneuver and arena terrain play key roles in the game along with a fatigue-based activation system that twists a traditional round structure in new and exciting ways.&#10;&#10;Arena Rex is a world inspired by the most exciting eras of antiquity.  The myth, hearsay, and superstition that riddles accounts of these periods is pervasive, and key historical changes lead to a setting that is both familiar and incredible.  The Roman Republic endures, as does the Gallo-Roman Empire.  The kingdom of Aegyptus is a tributary of the Roman Republic and ruled directly by an Antonian king and Ptolemaic queen. The Atlantic is not the barrier it once was, and men from the twilight lands of the north and natives of the far west join in commerce and warfare.  The year is 1253 AUC and this is not the world you know.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shadow Throne takes place in the Aclysmian empire, where the kingdom and royal family are torn apart in a bitter civil war. King Kyros clings on to power by any means necessary; his estranged Queen Eleftheria has joined a rebellion of conquered people; and their daughter, Princess Beatus, has rejected both of her parents to fight alongside the church.&#10;&#10;The players, as members of a secret society, wield great influence over the destiny of Aclysmia, but their job is not to set things right. They just want be on the winning side when the fighting ends. By weaving Machiavellian alliances and determining the outcome of crucial battles, they accrue influence for when the war finally resolves.&#10;&#10;Shadow Throne is played over the course of several battles. To start each battle, players gain control over characters from the warring factions by drafting a hand of cards. Next, players simultaneously play cards from their hands to determine which faction wins the battle. Players can freely switch alliances, playing cards from any faction. After the battle is fought, the faction with the most power wins, and players who played cards from that faction collect influence points. Once one player has collected enough influence, the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Decision Games' website)&#10;&#10;ON 6 JUNE 1944 the greatest armada the world has ever seen approached northern France. That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germany&rsquo;s veteran Wehrmacht.&#10;&#10;ATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg&rsquo;s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.&#10;&#10;There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.&#10;&#10;This is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set that&rsquo;s been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games. In addition to the basic rules, Atlantic Wall includes a set of exclusive rules to cover the special requirements of the amphibious and airborne landings and the logistical system required to support the armies coming ashore.&#10;&#10;",

You can choose to play either a single round for a quick game (20-30 min) or a complete game in which you'll tally scores over three rounds (60-90 min)&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt two sets of 10 cards at the start of a round. You'll pick up one set, this is called a hand. The second set, called a cache, remains face down on the table until you've played all of the cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;You'll take turns drawing, playing, and discarding cards as you work on creating your own collections and sabotaging the collections that belong to other players.&#10;&#10;Collections consist of Antiquity and Treasure cards. The six suits of Antiquity cards represent six ancient civilizations. Treasures are their own suit and are more rare and valuable. The more challenging a collection is to create. the more it's worth.&#10;&#10;A round ends once a player has completed at least five collections and played through all of the cards in their hand and cache. That player earns a bonus for going out first. Every other player takes on last turn and then scores are tallied.&#10;&#10;Your score at the end of each round is the combination of bonus points from going out first, points for completing collections ,and points for the cards you play. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Here's what to expect in this bold and exciting set collection game:&#10;&#10;     You'll strive to create collections of Antiquities and Treasures.&#10;     The more challenging a collection is to create, the more it's worth.&#10;     Beware! Your competitors can, and will seek to sabotage your efforts.&#10;     Careful planning, brilliant strategy, and a stroke of luck will bring you success!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s a delicate balancing act where every tile counts. Build your warren, forming burrows of three different colors. Complete a burrow of a particular color that is longer than the current shortest burrow in that color, and the gopher living there moves into the new one; it stays there until it gets lured away again by an even bigger burrow! There is one less gopher of each color than there are players, so not everyone will be able to host all three gopher types at once.&#10;&#10;Every once in a while the tour bus will arrive, and the tourists will be most excited to see the types of gophers promised to them by their tour schedule. If your ranch is missing those particular gophers, you&rsquo;ll get complaints from the tourists. At the end of the tourist season, the rancher with the fewest complaints wins!&#10;&#10;",

So, even a high-valued card may be worth to take as long as you believe it will be discarded. This also ensures a high level of interaction between the players. Will you leave a card on top of the discard pile that will help the next player discarding a whole row?&#10;The game is played over several rounds until one player has at least 100 points.

Travel to exotic locations and brave difficult terrain to take that perfect shot; win prestigious awards, and complete secret assignments for Snapshot Magazine to become Wildlife Photographer of the Year.&#10;&#10;Crammed with beautiful wildlife photography, Snapshot is easy to learn but filled with exciting tactical decisions and difficult choices.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Snapshot combines dice-management with set collection and a touch of push-your-luck. Each turn, players attempt to find and then photograph the most prestigious animals by following these 3 stages:&#10;&#10;Stage 1: Research&#10;&#10;So, you thought you could just rock up with your camera and take a photo, eh? Well, first you need to do your homework!&#10;Turn over new animal cards to increase your options and gain tracking tokens to boost your rolls... but be careful - if you draw too many cards, the animals will get spooked, ending your turn.&#10;&#10;To avoid spooking animals, you can reserve animal cards and roll for them later. However, you have a hand limit of two reserved cards at a time so be careful not to clog up your hand with animals you don't want.&#10;&#10;Other players can also reserve animals on your turn so they will be keeping their eyes peeled for the animals they need!&#10;&#10;Stage 2: Prepare&#10;&#10;Now that you know which animals are available this turn, you must choose your destinations and subjects, represented by placing dice on the animals you plan to photograph and their habitats. The rarer the animals, and the more difficult its habitat, the higher the prestige for photographing it.&#10;&#10;You can photograph as many animals in as many habitats as you have dice for... Be careful, though &ndash; go for too many difficult animals and you could end up with none, so allocate your dice wisely. You only have six dice to roll so you&rsquo;ll need to decide how best to allocate them; do you go cautious and allocate them all to one animal or spread them out and roll for more? You&rsquo;re in control of the odds so, do you feel lucky?&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;t forget that you also need to use dice to explore the habitat. You only need to roll for each habitat once, so going for more than one animal in the same location can be a great tactic.&#10;&#10;You can also spend tracking tokens to increase your chances: do you use them now or save them for that crucial roll later on?&#10;&#10;Stage 3: Photograph&#10;&#10;At last! It's time to get out into nature, click the shutter and hope for the best...&#10;First, roll the dice on each habitat to explore it. (Tokens can be used to re-roll habitat dice.) If you fail, your chosen animals are spooked and run away!&#10;&#10;Then, if you explored the habitat successfully, you may roll to photograph your chosen animals!&#10;&#10;If you manage to photograph 3 animals from the same habitat, or one from each habitat, you can collect the corresponding photography award. The earlier you get them, the more they are worth!&#10;&#10;If you failed to get any photographs, don't worry - you learn from the experience and gain 3 tracking tokens to improve your chances next turn&hellip;&#10;&#10;Game End&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has taken a set amount of photographs and everyone then gets to tally up their score.&#10;&#10;Each player also has a secret Assignment card which bestows bonus prestige for photographing specific animals and characteristics.&#10;&#10;Simply total the prestige on all your animal photographs, Photography Awards and Assignment card to see who becomes Photographer of the Year!&#10;&#10;Snapshot is fun, fast and simple to learn and is well-suited for families while also offering enough depth and tactical opportunities to keep advanced players engaged.&#10;&#10;",

Faced by an elusive foe, the French were forced into advancing ever deeper into Russia and all the way to Moscow itself, even though their logistic system was falling apart under the strain. &#10;The infamous retreat back from Moscow was the culmination of the campaign and the turning point of the Napoleonic Wars.

The latter is the original &quot;Cantaloop&quot; experience, where all the text you shouldn't see from the beginning is covered with colored scramble text. As a result you will need to use a red foil to read the text --- and your printer is probably going to request new color cartridges afterwards.&#10;&#10;There is also &quot;clear text&quot; version.

Dice indicate the type of actions that players can perform: move, attach, draw new cards, etc. The fist player to align the dice to his interest will yell &ldquo;Waaagh!&rdquo; and everybody else need to make do with the results they have on the table at that moment. Regarding attacks, players won&rsquo;t know for sure if the cards they have at hand are good enough for their intended action. Players hold the cards in their hand in such a way that they will not be able to see the relevant side of their hands (while the rest of the players can actually see the fire power of the rest of the opponents).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the XVI century Italy was the scene of wars and dynastic quarrels. In the Papal States, Pope Paul III knew he could rely on the strength of the powerful Orsini family to oppose the power of his enemies. In 1542 Pierfrancesco II Orsini, called Vicino, inherited the fief of Bomarzo, which elected to his residence, along with the fiefs of Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero and Mompeo. In 1547 Vicino Orsini wanted to celebrate the grandeur of his family, by commissioning one of the greatest architectural wonders of Italy. Within a natural amphitheater were masterfully carved huge mythological figures, whose sublime beauty enchants and terrifies those who are in their presence. Even today the park is shrouded in mystery: is it a Sacred Grove in which to bring votive offerings to the gods or a Park of Monsters made to scare poor people? It's rumored that Vicino Orsini owed his own fortune to the devotion shown to the gods and to the offers that he brought to them.&#10;&#10;In Bomarzo, you will have to delve into the mystery of the park, to propitiate the gods and obtain their favor. You&rsquo;ll play the role of one of the feudal lords of the Orsini and you&rsquo;ll manage one of four minor feuds, Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero or Mompeo, trying to earn the esteem of your lord. If you&rsquo;ll develop your feud in the best way you will manage to prevail over your rivals. Do not forget the supernatural forces that dwell in Bomarzo: your existence and your achievement will be influenced by how you manage to turn in your advantage the will of the monsters of the park.&#10;&#10;Bomarzo is a game of deep strategy for 2-4 players, the short duration of which gives to the players' choices even more decisive importance. The careful management of resources will allow you to easily take advantage of the power of the monstrous deity of the park. Each turn you will be able to perform various operations in your fief and also you will have to choose which god ingratiate, through workers placement bound by auction. But beware: each divinity of the park requires a very specific offer to concede his favor otherwise unleash his monstrous fury on unwary visitors! To triumph in Bomarzo you not only need the best development but mostly to have tied your for-tunes to the most powerful and prestigious deity.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The classic card game Nana has been introduced to a fantastic Christmas specification. The package card design is Christmas specifications, and includes rules for the Christmas version. This is a new classic card game that will be a hit at Christmas or other parties. What is Nana: This game aims to &quot;put 3 cards of the same number.&quot; When your turn is turned, reveal the cards and all three are the same number, then challenge successfully. If a different number is released, it will be a challenge failure. The play method is the same as the &quot;nervous&quot; playing card game, but the feeling of playing is completely different. Neurodepression is a game of flipping the place card, but Nana will reveal someone's hand. In addition, your hand can only be published with the largest number or the smallest number. In that rule, the first person who purchased three challenges wins the game. Basically, you will find 3 identical cards, but you will see many things in the process. For example, if a person's largest number is 8. Numbers are only 1 to 12 so you know that your hand is just a small number. If you have 2 &quot;1&quot; cards in your hand, you may be able to reveal those &quot;people who seem to have a small number.&quot; (Of course, it is not necessary...) Nana is the interesting point of being able to enjoy reasoning thoughts even though it is a very simple rule.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher's blurb:&#10;&#10;Red Dragon Rising: The Coming War With China (RDR), is a strategic-level investigation, with operational undertones, of the possibilities inherent in the first 30-or-so days of a hypothetical war between the Peoples Republic of China and a US-led counter-alliance. The time frame is the not-too-distant future, roughly between now and the end of 2014. On the Chinese side, the viewpoint of the player is that of Peking's top-rung national leadership. On the US side, the opposing player represents the top-rung military commander in the Western Pacific theater. The game is easily adaptable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;The system &ndash; given we're dealing with events that haven't happened and therefore can't be studied in detail after the fact &ndash; has been crafted to present the war as a unitary vision rather than a strictly sequenced process. The action can alternately telescope or expand, sometimes moving ahead in whip snake lunges, at other times decelerating to dream-like slow motion. The system is more quantum mechanics than Newtonian, more Escher than Rockwell. Its presents a time-space inter-flow that can only be grasped in totality by the human mind once play is over and the entire war can be looked back on and chronicled in a reconstructed linear fashion (much like day-to-day reality).&#10;&#10;Three initial assumptions are as follows. First, the Chinese are cast &ndash; not unreasonably, we think &ndash; as the aggressors. Put in terms as politically correct as possible: they're the &quot;revisionist power&quot; here, the nation wanting to overturn the present-day status quo in the Western Pacific: they're conducting a strategic  offensive. Second, the war inevitably starts over Taiwan, as that island is the unavoidably the first strategic block Peking must neutralize on the way to becoming East Asia's hegemon. Third, the war will not begin with a nuclear attack; though the danger of that kind of escalation may not be far off.&#10;&#10;Most ground units in the game represent brigades (&quot;brigade combat teams&quot; or &quot;BCT&quot; for the US). The exceptions are: 1) the Singaporean army is entirely represented by just one unit-counter; and 2) the Taiwanese and Philippine armies are represented by their corps components.&#10;&#10;Aircraft units are mostly represented by mixed-type combat wing formations, though only one aircraft type &ndash; the predominant one for each such wing &ndash; is shown on each counter. Long range bombers have their own mono-type units that can't combine operations with the other tactical air wings in the game.&#10;&#10;Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groupings of vessels (Surface Action Groups). Aircraft carriers and cruise missile attack submarines each represent just one such vessel of those types. Other submarines are represented in groups called &quot;Subrons.&quot; On the area map, each inch equals approximately 100 miles.&#10;&#10;",

Life as we know it struggles to endure on the Abaddon. Once the home of a mysterious, non-human civilization, the planet is now a desolate wasteland bearing one immensely precious resource: Feronium power crystals. The unimaginable energy contained within the crystals is coveted by two groups of humans: the Satellite City-States and the Commonwealth Alliance. Using Links &ndash; giant bio-mech suits made from modified military vehicles and alien technology &ndash; the warring factions fight a weary battle for territorial control of the Abaddon.&#10;&#10;At your disposal in Abaddon is a 28&quot; x 19&quot; battlefield game board with 32 highly-detailed mech figurines, 18 free-standing landscape terrain features, over 100 game-changing Wild Fire and Weapon System cards, dozens of tokens, battle dice and a Battle Manual containing over 15 mission scenarios. Choose your allegiance and lead your army in non-stop excitement as you forge through unforgiving terrain, fight to overcome random and bizarre technological glitches, and battle your enemies in never-ending war.&#10;&#10;Abaddon is a furious, two-to-four-player game of futuristic combat. Each scenario is laid out on the customizable battlefield game board with each side using a varying number of units. The game is played in turns during which a player rolls his Activation Dice, allowing him to &quot;activate&quot; certain units and move them. These mechanical units &ndash; Links &ndash; are powered by Feronium power crystals, and as they take damage these crystals are depleted. A unit that runs out of crystals is unable to continue functioning and is considered destroyed.&#10;&#10;Combat is card- and dice-based. The attacker lays out his Weapon System cards, targeting defending enemy units. Once the attacker has laid out all of his planned attacks, the defender may defend with his own Weapon System cards. These cards can modify the dice rolls that are used to determine the results of the combat. Additionally, due to the experimental nature of the Links and the mysterious happenings in the Abaddon region, things can, and often will, go wrong. These malfunctions and odd happenings are represented by Wild Fire cards, the drawing of which can result in anything from possible shutdowns to anti-gravity surges.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined based on stipulations presented by the chosen mission scenarios. Typically, victory is achieved by damaging and destroying your opponent's units by way of their power crystals. Each destroyed enemy crystal is worth one victory point, which players must collect in order to win.&#10;&#10;",

Still, the Soviets put together a strong counter-attack early in the campaign, but their advantages in numbers of tanks committed could not overcome the German's superiority of skill when employing their veteran panzer units. The Axis forces advanced eastward to the Dnieper River and south toward Odessa, but as the front kept expanding, forces were spread thinner to cover the front line.&#10;&#10;Objective: Kiev is a new historical board game from renowned game designer Frank Chadwick, iterating the classic Battle for Moscow game system used in The Arduous Beginning, combining ease of learning and design elegance with the kind of dramatic gameplay that Frank has long been famous for. Featuring countless opportunities and variations, Objective: Kiev presents an endlessly fascinating series of puzzles and is a game that you're going to want to play again and again.&#10;&#10;Published in C3i magazine #26.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 - 2 weeks&#10;Hex: 31 miles / 50 kilometers&#10;Units: Corps to Army&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 11 x 17&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (40 1/2&quot; game counters - 28)&#10;One 6-page Objective Kiev foldout rules booklet&#10;One single-side printed Play Aid card&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the website:&#10;&#10;Pulp Alley captures the fast-paced excitement of classic cliffhanger serials and pulp magazines to more modern action/adventure stories. Designed primarily as a multi-player miniatures game, each Pulp Alley scenario is jammed full of villains, unexpected perils, and plenty of two-fisted action.&#10;&#10;Pulp Alley&rsquo;s unique and innovative rules offer players a thrill-packed and engaging experience &ndash;&#10;&bull; Pulp Alley plays at the pulse-pounding pace of your favorite pulps and serials.&#10;&bull; Characters are easy to create and customize, making each league unique.&#10;&bull; Players never need to consult charts during a scenario. The action is on the tabletop &ndash; not in a rulebook.&#10;&bull; Control of the Initiative is based on events as they occur during the scenario rather than an arbitrary die-roll.&#10;&bull; Fights are fast-paced and simultaneously dangerous for both characters, instead of the old I-shoot-then-you-shoot sequence.&#10;&bull; Perils and challenges are unpredictable and offer multiple paths to success.&#10;&bull; Scenarios are plot-driven, encouraging action, and offering an array of different rewards.&#10;&bull; Through campaigns and experience your characters can increase their skills and develop new abilities.&#10;&#10;",
