The playing pieces consist of a starting piece  (a crossroads with 4 roads leading from it and attached spinner) and 24 domino-like tiles with 2 vehicles on each of varying types and colors. To start the game each player is dealt an equal number of the vehicle tiles and the crossroads is placed in the centre of the table. The players then take turns spinning the spinner, and must attempt to place one of their tiles on whichever of the roads is pointed to. Tiles placed must match either the color or type of the vehicle currently at the end of this road. The winner is the first player to get rid of all of their tiles. Some strategy is provided by one of the tiles being a police car which can be placed at any time and permanently blocks off the road it is player on.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a Hokkien gambling game played in South-east Asia. Lien Poh literally translates as 'turning treasure'. The cube is the Poh or 'treasure' and the metal box is the Poh Kam or 'treasure cover'.&#10;&#10;Most Poh have the same face on all sides, with the functional part being the red and white colouring/marking. The red portion is a stylized Chinese character, Tong, and the white portion is another character, Ying. However, there are examples where the design is completely abstract and sides may have different designs.&#10;&#10;There are known instances where the characters are &#229;&#175;&#182; and &#233;&#128;&#154; (bao and tong).&#10;&#10;In order to play the game, a betting diagram is roughly drawn on paper - a square sheet is divided into four triangular areas by two diagonal lines. Punters bet on which area the red side will end up facing.&#10;&#10;The person operating the game puts the Poh into the Poh Kam, leaving a bit of room for the Poh to be rattled around inside. It then settles into the smaller part of the metal container and the Poh Kam is closed all the way. The whole block is then spun. When it comes to rest, the block is placed in the centre of the diagram so that each side lines up with one of the 4 areas. The cover is lifted and the red side will be facing one of the 4 areas - punters who bet in that area win their bet.&#10;&#10;The game is described in C.T. Dobree's book, Gambling Games of Malaya (q.v.) and it mentions that the name of the game in Kelantan is 'Ewok'. There's also a description of how operators of the game could cheat at it.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is also described in Stewart Culin's book &quot;Chinese Games with Dice and Dominoes&quot; on pages 507-508. He writes:&#10;&#10;The po tsz', or covered die, is not, properly, a die game at all.  It consists of a small wooden cube, which is placed in a square receptacle in the top of a brass prism, over which a brass cover fits very closely.  A specimen exhibited by His Highness, the Sultan of Johore in the section of games at the Columbian Exposition consisted of a wooden cube about one-half an inch square, having one-half of each face painted red and one-half white.  The prism in which the cube fitted was slightly convex on the bottom, and, when placed upon a smooth surface, could be twirled rapidly.  The game is played by placing the box containing the po in the center of a square crossed by diagonal lines, which is drawn upon a mat.  One of the four divisions of the square is painted red.  One of the four divisions of the square is painted red.  The players lay their bets upon the other divisions and the box is spun rapidly by the gamekeeper, who repeats the operation until it comes to rest squarely with the corners corresponding with the indersecting lines.  The cover is then lifted, and those who have staked opposite the red side of the die win.  The banker wins when the red side comes opposite the side of the square painted red.  There is said to be a current notion, amounting to a superstition among the Chinese in Johore, that if a player stops the box as it is spinning the luck will surely go against him.&#10;&#10;Another specimen in the Sultan's collection, called at Johore, kong poh (Chinese t'ung po), &quot;current treasure,&quot; furnishes an explanation of the name po.  It consists of a wooden die, with a face 1 3/8 inches square, and three-forths inch thick, which fits into a brass box with a broad base.  A wooden cover fits over the box.  This die is not spun, but is concealed in a bag which accompanies it, and there adjusted by the gamekeeper.  The face of the wooden die is carved with the characters t'ung po, on one side in the ordinary, and on the reverse in seal characters, the character t'ung being painted red, and po white.  The inscription t'ung po &quot;current treasure,&quot; occurs on the face of all modern Chinese coins, and the common name of the game is evidently derived from the character po, which occurs on this block.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that when Culin refers to &quot;po tsz'&quot; he most likely means &quot;t&oacute;u zi&quot; (&#233;&#170;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#144;) which is usually translated as just &quot;dice&quot; and not &quot;covered die.&quot;  When he refers to the die with the characters &quot;t'ung po&quot; written upon it, he is refering to t&#197;&#141;ng b&#199;&#142;o (&#233;&#128;&#154;&#229;&#175;&#182;) which means &quot;open treasure&quot; not &quot;current treasure.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'Hollywood Casting' is a face building game. The young lady in the frame is a drama student who dreams of becoming a hollywood starlet, so the story goes. &#10;'Hollywood Casting' is about quick decision-making and risk taking. The aim of the game is to create the tallest possible face by selecting and assembling different face tiles. When it is their turn, players roll the dice and select a face tile corresponding to the colour or part of the face shown on the dice, and add it to their face under construction. When a player has completed a face, there may still be room to improve it before everyone else has finished theirs, and the game is over. However, the first player to complete a face on an entirely red background or a 'rainbow' face where each tile has a different background colour, wins immediately.&#10;&#10;",

This game focuses on this aspect of the period, which though less violent than certain contemporary events was not entirely without conflicts of its own.&#10;&#10;The game consists of the exploration of an island, building settlements there and aquiring power and glory by winning legal disputes at the Althing &ndash; coincidentally corresponding to the three ages of Icelandic history between the Norse discovery of the island in the 9th century and the country's submission to the Norwegian crown in 1262: Landn&aacute;ma&ouml;ld, S&ouml;gu&ouml;ld and Sturlunga&ouml;ld.&#10;&#10;Though sharing core mechanics with the Catan range of games, the overall flow of the game differ markedly from each of these.&#10;&#10;The game&#039;s home page contains a fuller description, including the rules and downloadable PDF files for the components.&#10;&#10;",

Such occurrences are not uncommon in the Warhammer world. However, not all important battles take places between two massive armies clashing over a sweeping battlefield. Some of the most crucial skirmishes are fought on an entirely different scale, one that may never be recorded in history, but are no less meaningful in the grand scheme of things.&quot;&#10;&#10;For some reason Warhammer Skirmish was never released outside of the USA and Canada.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most hands wins.&#10;&#10;Playing the game: &#10;The players choose at random who deals first. This player deals the cards based on the number of players and places the deck of remaining cards face down on the table. The player cuts the deck to determine the trump colour which is the highest ranking suit. The player then places the trump reminder card face up on the table for all to see. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left goes first. The first player lays one card face up on the table. Each player takes turns playing a card of the same colour as the colour requested. If a player does not have a card of the colour requested, he or she may play a trump colour, a card of a different colour or a Lettro TM card. The player with the highest card wins the hand. Then the winner of the hand plays the first card, and so on.&#10;&#10;If more than one Lettro card is played in a round, the last player to play a Lettro card wins the hand. When a player plays a Lettro card, he or she can change the trump immediately, but players who have not yet completed&#10;the round must play cards of the colour originally requested. After all the cards have been played, enter each player&rsquo;s number of hands won. Then change dealers.&#10;&#10;Components: &#10;26 red cards from A to Z, 26 blue cards from A to Z, 26 yellow cards from A to Z, 26 green cards from A to Z, 4 Lettro cards, 2 trump, reminder cards, Game rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On the Ides of March (15 March) 44BC, ruler of Rome, Gaius Julius Caesar was assassinated in the Senate house by a small group of disaffected senators.  After a brief period of confusion, three factions began to emerge to fill the vacuum left by Caesar&rsquo;s death.  The Tyrannicides led by Marcus Junius Brutus and assisted by Gaius Cassius Longinus left Rome and took provinces in the East to govern, there to bide their time, gather strength, and hopefully complete the restoration of the Republic.  A second faction under Marcus Antonius, Senior Consul and Caesar&rsquo;s chief lieutenant, and supported by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, initially attempted to come to an accommodation with the Tyrannicides with the intent securing a power-base in Cisalpine Gaul and subsequently to seize control in Rome.  The third faction under Gaius Octavius, Caesar&rsquo;s nephew and adopted son, was intent upon claiming his inheritance and assuming the position that was Caesar&rsquo;s in the state.  Initially making common cause with Decimus Brutus (a tyrannicide) and the Senate, he attempted to check Antony&rsquo;s ambitions whilst pursuing a dual agenda of avenging Caesar and assuming primacy in the state.  By 30BC, Octavius (later Augustus Caesar) had eliminated all competition and become the undisputed Leader of Rome.&#10;&#10;Ides of March is a three-player simulation representing the end of the Roman Republic, with each faction vying for control of the state through both political and military means.  As the Leader of one of the three major factions, you control the Leaders, forces, and political resources of your faction in a struggle to win personal control of the machinery of state and thus become &ldquo;Princeps&rdquo;, or undeclared Emperor of the Roman World.  Rules to play the game with two-players are found at the end of this rulebook.&#10;&#10;A shorter Rubicon Module simulates the earlier struggle between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great who was backed by the Senate that ultimately led to Caesar&rsquo;s victory and assumption of the position of Dictator-for-Life.  Each separate game shares a common set of Strategy Cards, with cards specific to period of civil war added the common deck for the play of that module.  Players share a force pool of land  and special Units, as well as factional naval forces and major Leaders/generals.&#10;&#10;",

Sounds nutty, but it&rsquo;s true.  Anyway, WoW is a game; any hints of simulation are just that, hints, although everything in the game is based on what actually happened.  It&rsquo;s a bit of a hoot, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long to play &ndash; about 90 minutes - and is much in the spirit of what the game industry calls &ldquo;Euros&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The game may be played by one or two players.&#10;&#10;CAVEAT&hellip; and a Word on WoW&rsquo;s  Genesis&#10;&#10;No game designer in his right mind would ever think of doing a game on this subject. I, to be sure, am not of the Right-Minded tribe.  The origins of this game arise from a statement I made on Consimworld that there is no subject about which one cannot design a game. Consimworld being what it is, it took about 38 seconds before a half dozen &ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo;  Prove it!&rdquo; statements followed. The result was a folder entitled &ldquo;The Richard Berg Game Design Challenge&rdquo;, wherein dozens of titles were suggested. These were narrowed down to a half dozen Prime Time Possibilities by a panel of judges who, from that half dozen, chose this subject as &ldquo;ungameable&rdquo;. Me? I would have thought The Children&rsquo;s Crusade would be a lot more difficult.  But I have accepted that challenge, and this is what comes from such public foolishness.&#10;&#10;",

The logo printed on the tower matches the Jenga logo on the rest of the series.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 25 dice-like black cubes, each with blue, green, and red faces.  The cubes stack nicely inside a Plexiglas tower that has slots cut out on alternating sides at each level (24 on the tower and 1 dislodged cube).  It is possible to carefully push out cubes leaving the above cubes in place by ensuring that that the remaining cube supports the ones above.&#10;&#10;The rules of the game differ from those of the traditional Jenga in which, the players will each be assigned a color (by way of rolling one of the dice) and will try to make one of the faces of the tower all of their color (e.g. orange player will try to make one of the faces of the tower orange).&#10;&#10;Every turn the player will roll the dislodged cube, and take the color face-up and push it against in the tower (using any side) until a cube on the opposite side falls out. If it is not possible to push that color, the dice is re-rolled.&#10;&#10; Note: if the cube that comes up lands with the face-up of your color, you get another turn (no limit on turns as long as your color keeps coming up).&#10;&#10;",

How to get ahead when the primary method of gaining points is by improving other player's positions?&#10;&#10;'Ohana Proa was developed publicly via a blog on BGDF.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;IntroductionThe societies of the South Pacific were characterized by gift economies in which wealth and status were defined by what was given to others rather than personal accumulation. In Ohana Proa players will compete for prestige via gift-giving and thus improving the other player's positions.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game players will explore and claim routes among the islands. The number of routes a player may explore and claim each turn is limited by the number of explorers the player has (maximum 2).&#10;&#10;Players will also join markets among the islands by moving them along 'claimed routes and in doing so attempt to gather them into groups. A group of three, four or five markets (player choice) is &quot;satisfied&quot; and is removed from the game. The number of routes that a player may move a market over during a delivery is limited by the player's proas (boats, maximum 7).&#10;&#10;By delivering markets through islands where they have network presence players will receive fish or shells. Fish and shells may be used to gain an additional explorer, to acquire more proas or kahunas, to bid for turn order, to claim explored routes and to make and enhance kula items. Kula items are gifts that may be given to other players in order to gain prestige (but give the recipient points).&#10;&#10;Fish rot quickly and are lost if not spent quickly enough. Shells rot more slowly and kula items decay. Kula items can be enhanced with fish or shells to increase their value when given.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of one colour of market has been delivered, a player reaches 33 prestige or the players reach deadlock. The player(s) with the lowest prestige score are eliminated from the game and do not score. The remaining players receive additional points for their prestige scores. The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Ohana Proa supports 3 through 5 players, is particularly recommended for 4 players and plays in around 150 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For a brief period, Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin's giant floating cylinders seemed poised to play a major role in naval warfare. But just as the technology matured, high-performance aircraft, a spectacular accident caught on film and the Great Depression combined to bring an end to military and most civilian use of the rigid airship.&#10;&#10;Airships is a supplement for our Great War at Sea series of games, building on the popular Zeppelins to take a further look at lighter than air operations. There are ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on missions that took place or could have taken place. All are by Ernie Wheeler and Doug McNair.&#10;&#10;This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of our Zeppelins supplement and Jutland and Mediterranean games to play most of the scenarios, and our U.S. Navy Plan Gold game and Sea of Troubles and Dreadnoughts supplements to play all of them. Each scenario has its own card in a spiral-bound booklet.&#10;&#10;",

This deck is not mixed with the deck of the base game, Potion-Making: Practice, but rather placed next to it. Each of your turns will now consist of three phases in which you can take cards from either deck and play them. For example, you can draw two cards and make a potion, or you can place a card on the table as an element and use this element for a new potion immediately. Thanks to the new rules, it's possible to make different sophisticated combinations.&#10;&#10;Four &quot;Lesser Talismans&quot; give players certain bonuses; for example, the Lesser Talisman of Usefulness gives you 1 point for any card you play as an element, even if the desk already holds that element. The special artifact &quot;Scruple of Conscience&quot; can be passed to any player who has more points than you; he must add the card to his hand and lose 5 points &ndash; but be careful as this card can boomerang back to you. The new &quot;Haste&quot; spell let you play two cards in a row, while &quot;Magic Vortex&quot; places all ingredient cards of all completed formulas on the desk of elements. Now you'll have a huge choice of elements!&#10;&#10;The expansion Potion-Making: Guild of Alchemists can also be combined with University Course, which means three separate decks would be in play.&#10;&#10;",
