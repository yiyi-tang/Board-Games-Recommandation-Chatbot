Plus, it's endless and ever changing!&#10;&#10;The game starts soon after the Chief Inspector ends writing the premises of the case on the Case File by rolling dice several times and writing down the results took from the rulebook's tables.&#10;&#10;At this point, all the players try to solve the case, building up a story which should include and bring to light all the elements, especially the missing ones, of the crimes scene, getting to a final solution, in order to close the case.&#10;&#10;Detectives discuss their ideas and perceptions of the crime scene in its whole and try to figure out a possible solution, finding a meeting point that could explain the murder.&#10;&#10;Investigation can vary in duration, based on the ability of the detectives to deal with the fundamental six questions every detective is asked to answer to close any case: How? What? When? Where? Why? Who?&#10;&#10;While the investigation goes on, detectives should try to enrich their reconstruction of the case with more and more detailed elements.&#10;&#10;Discussion and interpretation are fundamental, during this part of the game. Only with discussion, deduction and compromises they'll be able to meet a point where everyone is satisfied with the story.&#10;&#10;When all involved players are pleased with the reconstruction they inform the Chief Inspector which writes down the story, closing the investigation, solving the case and, ultimately, ending the game.&#10;&#10;It goes without saying that if players can&lsquo;t build up a story encasing all the elements of the crimes scene and get to a final solution, they can agree to archive the case. In this case players might want to try and solve the case another time, considering it a cold case.&#10;&#10;To play this game no investigation knowledge or improvisation skills are necessary. Players debate the case, evidences and dice results by combining all the elements to create the most convincing and entertaining solution for the case.&#10;&#10;Also, the crime scene is the main attraction of microCrime and the game gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in it. After players select an area to play in (it might be the bedroom, the kitchen or any other space they want, like the courtyard, the garage or anything else) they can consider that space like a real crime scene by exploring it and simply by walking and looking around.&#10;&#10;Moving through the crime scene and looking carefully at its peculiarities could prove to be really useful and interesting.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Cats are relaxing around. When the time goes by slowly, one of the staff whispered, &quot;Who is most liked by them?&quot;&#10;&#10;You do everything to the cats. Of course, to be the most favorite of the cats in this shop.&#10;&#10;--from the publisher&#10;&#10;Each round, the staff of this cat caf&eacute; must try and guess what the cat is going to want from them. You'll know which of the four cat decks is going to be drawn from next, and if you've been paying attention, you should have an idea of the cards left in that deck. You'll play one of your four prediction cards, and either gain or lose the cat's favorability.&#10;&#10;But be careful which prediction card you play, because you only have one of each! You can play your 'Leave Me Alone' card to avoid losing favorability, and to return all your cards back to your hand.&#10;&#10;You also have a 'Full Power' card you can use when you're really confident in your prediction. If you guessed right, you can get a favorability bonus - either +5, +15, x3, or even x4 - depending on where you are on the scoring track. But the 'Full Power' card has to rest for a while before it can be used again, so choose wisely!&#10;&#10;The staff member who the cats like best wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Then the dreams overtook me. I conversed with the thousand poets long dead, they who trod the roads weaving toward eternity and never returned. In the morning&rsquo;s warm embrace, my limbs felt their old vigor and the undeniable desire to travel. To seize the horizon. To behold hidden wonders. To exhume the words that will give life to my LAST HAIKU.&#10;&#10;Last Haiku is a one-player adventure card game with a dose of creative writing. You are the latest in a long line of poets feeling your age, and you know you are not long for this world. Yet you also feel the call of distant, uncanny, and wondrous places where you might seek the inspiration to write one last haiku to leave to the ages to inspire future generations of poets, who may themselves discover stranger, more distant places to spark the words of their own haiku.&#10;&#10;This is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that the game starts with a few index cards and a pen. Each game will add new cards, either maps of locations or haiku your poet composed. The rules provide all the guidance you need for creating new cards and selecting the game&rsquo;s thematic elements, which makes every copy of Last Haiku an evolving, unique world. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games. There is no limit to the places you can visit and the poetry you can compose.&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game involves playing cards of the appropriate distance. If the card was created in a previous game, your poet travels deeper into the frontier. If you cannot play an existing card, you create a new site on a card and your poet is inspired to write a line of haiku, these lines recorded on a separate card. The game ends when you have written each of three lines forming your poet&rsquo;s last haiku, and your score equals the total of the distances of the new sites visited. Each new site and your haiku then enter the deck permanently.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you can draw a domino from the boneyard (i.e., the supply of dominoes) or place a domino at the end of an active line as long as you can match the number at the end of the line; the starting station can have two lines built off of the starting domino. If you place a double domino, take another turn immediately.&#10;&#10;The starting station indicates that five dominoes must be placed in a line before a new station is opened. If you place the fifth domino in a line, draw a random station from the deck, then place it at the end of the line and mark it with one of your tokens. Each station has two lines off of it, with a starting domino half on each line and a length the line must reach before a new station is built on that line.&#10;&#10;Players continue to take turns until either one player has emptied their hand of dominoes or the fifth station has been put into play. At the time, players score, earning 1 point for each station they started and losing 1 point for each domino still in hand.&#10;&#10;Each city edition of Metro Domino appears to have identical gameplay, but with differing station lengths and values.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the spring of 1942, the Japanese contemplated invading the British-held island of Ceylon. From there they could strike many strategic targets around the Indian Ocean basin, none of these more vital than the southern outlet of the Red Sea, controlling the sea route to the Suez Canal and on to Europe. Far more important to the Axis cause than Midway Island, Japanese control of the chokepoint at the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb would have broken British communications with India, Australia and New Zealand except for the lengthy and difficult route around the Cape of Good Hope, and made the entire campaign in North Africa superfluous.&#10;&#10;Eastern Fleet: Gulf of Aden is a Campaign Study in the same format as Midway: Rising Sun 1940 or Coral Sea: Defending Australia, with 14 scenarios depicting a Japanese campaign in Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea opposed by the British Eastern Fleet, heavily reinforced to defend this vital maritime crossroads. To play these scenarios, you&rsquo;ll need Eastern Fleet, Horn of Africa, Midway Deluxe and Bismarck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If a player already has 2 tokens or chooses not to tame one, he may move his meeple equal to the checksum of the prime number it occupies. &#10;Whenever a meeple gets on a number that can be divided by 11 (black spaces), it gets set back by the product of both digits. The 11 only counts as a prime number.&#10;The first player to exactly reach space 100 wins the game.&#10;&#10;Knight's move:&#10;Each player gets 4 meeples which start at spaces 1, 2, 18 and 19. The meeples are moved in turns according to the knight's move in chess. All numbers that can be divided by 11 (black spaces) may not be occupied. The first player to get all his 4 meeples on space 100 wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Secret Cardinals is a &lsquo;take that&rsquo; player elimination game of Vice, Virtues, and hidden Roles within Roles. Eliminate political opponents and survive the power struggle from within the 15th century church through deception, sabotage, and calculated choices. For each turn, clever players will need to strategize their actions wisely to deduce who their political rivals are, acquire gold for its power, or gamble their advantage on the role of the dice. Use gold to purchase indulgences, gain virtues by giving charity, or pay a bribe to find rivals guilty of vice. Each turn brings unexpected dangers and new ways to win.&#10;&#10;Rome, 1418. The Papal standoff that had split the church for decades has just concluded, but tensions still linger from when three rival popes simultaneously claimed to be the one true pope. Each claimant was backed by a competing power of Europe: Rome, Pisan, and Avignon. Driven by politics rather than theological disagreement, the church was thrown into turmoil. To find a compromise, a fourth Pope was chosen to succeed as the legitimate head of the church. As a result, the other three claimants were deposed, jailed for heresy, or excommunicated for their disobedience. In order to maintain a delicate network of alliances among the ruling powers, the new Pope has secretly named his choice for a new Cardinal from among these powers to honor this player&rsquo;s service while keeping them safe from the political machinations of the competing Kingdoms.&#10;&#10;Adversaries with hidden agendas and hidden roles are looking to eliminate their opponents and win the game. An upstart with an agenda wants to be acknowledged as the Secret Cardinal and is looking to eliminate the competition. A rival Roman Cardinal is not keen to recognize the influence of the new Pope and the fanaticism of their Devoted Follower creates a dangerous situation for anyone trying to upset the status quo. No one is safe from the Heretic infiltrators, as they work to limit the growing influence of the church, even as the are being hunted by the an overzealous Inquisitor who is determined to root out anyone suspected of heresy. Lastly, interlopers associated with the neighboring monarchy have not forgotten their candidate for Pope was excommunicated and have sent a Royal Spy from Avignon to cause trouble.&#10;&#10;Players will see similarities to Bang and One Night Ultimate Werewolf, with unexpected action cards and new ways to win with roles within roles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It is played with miniatures or counters on a table top or board consisting of squares to regulate movement and distances and to speed up play by avoiding interaction and measurement issues. The system places less emphasis on weapons and more on training, quality and morale. Several historical battle scenarios are provided but, as usual in table top gaming players can also select their own armies and play 'random' battles such as Sumerian v 100 Years War French. The game is intended for experienced players and assumes that they know how to collect, paint and base figures and provide their own playing equipment such as dice, terrain and so on.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Using a customized deck of skills, spells, will, and other actionable cards, players battle in an arena-like fashion to knock out each others champions and become victorious.&#10;&#10;Based on the recommendations of the Seer of Sanctuary, Azara, Monarchs can choose up to 3 ancient champions to take into battle. These champions from the past all hail from different realms within the world of Limsia where they once were revered by their respective species. Players take turns controlling their champions and use actionable cards that can cool down to be used again and the first player to deplete the HP of all of their opponents' champions is the winner.&#10;&#10;As this is a strategy-heavy game, players can best strategize gameplay by using weapons and potions from their inventory to influence survivability and any attacks that are relevant to their champions of choice. New cards are released monthly so players can build as many unique and versatile decks as possible to vary their gameplay and avoid being locked in to specific play styles. With the number of champions growing, every battle provides a new ground for players of all skill levels to show off their customizations and strategies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Select one of five thematic and asymmetric factions consisting of multiple tiered units including: common, elite, specialist, general, and a mighty avatar unit class. Throughout the game, players will destroy each others&rsquo; units and accumulate their &ldquo;essence&rdquo; as well as fight over control points, known as Essence Wells. Harnessed essence is used to activate unique, faction-specific abilities. &#10;With enough essence, your god will be able to manifest in the physical realm in the form of a massive avatar. Empowered avatars gain access to once-per-game Act of God abilities to swing the tide of battle in your favor. If you destroy the enemy&rsquo;s avatar, you are victorious!&#10;&#10;Gameplay is turn-based and consists of several phases. First, each player rolls an Essence Storm die to determine which way the Essence Storm will blow and which variable effect it will take on during that game round. Next, player one will take their turn. During a player turn consists of two phases, the movement phase and the activation phase. The movement phase allows your entire army to move up to their maximum speed stat. The activation phase allows up to two units to attack and use the active special abilities of those units. Thus, interesting situations arise where some units get into position for future turns, contest Essence Wells from opponents, or keep your options open on the fly.&#10;&#10;However, because only two of your units can attack each turn, you must carefully plan not only your current turn, but think about how future turns might play out. Players roll unique-faced dice to simplify gameplay and avoid having to memorize combat tables. Additionally, most powerful units have access to faction-specific Divine Dice, providing a boost to damage, defense or annoying tricks. Additionally, players have the option to complete their turn phases in either order they wish, opening up further tactical options as needed! After players have taken their turns, a new game round begins, repeating this process until one side defeats the enemy avatar!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The math never gets bigger than adding up to twelve, which is good, because math is terrible.&#10;&#10;THE BOARD GAME WE ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY&#10;When we designed this game, we made it for players like us. We wanted it to be easy to learn, simple to play and challenging enough that we would want to play again.&#10;&#10;With a lot of effort and fine-tuning, we arrived at a game that we would have loved if it had existed when we were 14. Does that mean you'll love it? We hope so. If you're looking for a complicated, intricate and punishing game, this probably isn't the game you're looking for. If you want a retro roll to resolve adventure with a compelling story that is simple to learn and play, this is the game for you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The image of the friar-knight has in its way shaped the history of the Palmela castle throughout the centuries. The monks who inhabited said castle lived periods in which a call-to-arms would make knights out of them. In this game, this duality is present in the split value of cards and the twofold way they can be played: either facing up or down.&#10;&#10;Each round, players will play character cards. Simultaneously, they will try to guess the sum of the score of all currently played character cards. The goal is to find out whether the friar&rsquo;s value or the knight&rsquo;s value is equal or greater than the history value of the castle card being contested in the current round.&#10;&#10;The game is over when the 12 rounds are finished and the players count the points in the Castles cards. The winner is the player with the most victory points.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Confederate general Beauregard was able to reinforce with Johnston&rsquo;s army from the valley by rail. Many expected this to be the only battle needed to put down the rebellion. Instead, panic gripped both armies of green troops as they closed for combat. This quickly escalated into a full on rout all the way back to Washington, becoming known as &ldquo;The Great Skedaddle&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;&bull; Huge map (38&rdquo; x 24&rdquo;) covers the extended area, so you can explore many different possible strategies to the battle. &#10;&bull; This map also covers the area fought over in Second Bull Run, to allow for a Add-On, expansion scenario. &#10;&bull; Hardwood, Kriegsspiel style blocks for Fog-of-War.&#10;&bull; Fast play time. &#10;&bull; Tremendous Replayability. &#10;&bull; Excellent for Solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Instead of giving players complete control of their units and perfect intell, this system focuses on realistic command and logistical limitations.  In this chaotic and uncertain environment, you must learn to adapt your plans to accomplish your objectives.&#10;&#10;This highly acclaimed rules system is based on real combat data, officer experience and training principles from the era:  Kriegsspiel.  It is used to train officers in the US military and in military academies around the world.&#10;&#10;Yvonne Sparrowsmith is the developer.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The Joker silently reads the card to themselves.&#10;     The Joker then tells the group who they are going to target. The Target is the person they are trying to get to laugh.&#10;     The Joker now has 30 seconds to do whatever is on the card, doing their best to make the Target laugh. Everyone else (including the Joker) is allowed to laugh.&#10;     If the Target laughs, they drink and the Joker keeps the card and gets a point. If the Target doesn&rsquo;t laugh, the Joker drinks and the Target keeps the card and gets a point.&#10;     The person to the Joker&rsquo;s left now becomes the new Joker. The new Joker draws a new card and picks a new Target.

The villains rush towards the center of the board while the superheroes use their powers to hold them back and defeat them.  There are 16 superheroes and 4 villain groups to choose from.  Each superhero has a unique set of powers, and each villain group has a unique mix of abilities.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a hand of energy cards which they use to activate their hero's powers.  They must use the cards efficiently to have enough power to stop the villains.  There are also stunt cards which can be used to change how a power works.&#10;&#10;Each superhero has a different set of powers.  Some superheroes are similar to each other and others are very different.  Playing each requires figuring out their strengths and weaknesses and devising tactics that work for them.&#10;&#10;The villain groups are giant insects, zombies, ninjas, and robots.  Each has a different balance of movement and strength, requiring different tactics to defeat them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players will use Gardeners to gather resources like water and compost and then will play cards ranging from dill to strawberries to butternut squash. The player who has scored the most points through growing their garden and collecting Harvest cards wins the game. But this is a community garden, so you&rsquo;ll be helping your fellow players acquire the resources they need to make their plots prosper as well.&#10;&#10;Community Garden is played over 7 rounds, in which players are aiming to collect resources - water, compost, trowels, and seedlings - in order to play Garden cards, such as oregano, collard greens, and shishito pepper. On their turn, players will place one Gardener on the board to gain resources, gain Garden cards, or to use Tool cards.&#10;&#10;Players will also be collecting Green Thumbs, which are then spent in order to join other players in busy garden spaces. Green Thumbs also have another benefit: they often allow you to activate Tool cards. Each Tool card has a unique effect, and when you place a Gardener on a tool, you use the effect listed on the card. This might help you gain a number of resources at once, take an extra turn, or create other combinations of effects.&#10;&#10;Players also use their Gardeners to draw cards from the Garden beds, strategically adding new Garden Cards to their hand that will give them points and helpful bonuses.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, after they've placed a gardener, they'll be able to spend resources they've collected to plant (play) Garden cards from their hand. They'll then place the Garden card they've just played in collections in front of them into plots of the same color. And any time a player completes a pair of the same color of Garden cards (such as two brown Garden cards) or a row of all the colors (brown, pink, silver, and red), they will draw bonus Harvest cards. Each Harvest card is randomly worth anywhere from 1 to 3 points.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds, the player who has scored the most points through planting Garden cards and collecting Harvest cards, wins the game!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Green spaces are blanks, but white spaces provide some positive or negative quality or trait: &quot;Patriotism,&quot; &quot;Firmness,&quot; &quot;Hypocrisy,&quot; &quot;Duplicity,&quot; and so on. An accompanying rulebook provides instructions for most of these spaces, which usually involve advancing or retreating to another space or losing a certain number of turns.&#10;&#10;Colored counters (discs) and an 8-sided teetotum are also included.&#10;&#10;",

On 24 February, the National Convention decreed the mass draft of 300,000 men to defend the eastern borders. Throughout the country, revolts broke out against this conscription, everywhere they were brutally repressed with success. However, an insurgent territory, called the &quot;Vend&eacute;e Militaire&quot; resisted. Determined to engage in a trial of strength with the new revolutionary regime, the Vend&eacute;ens gradually organised themselves until they formed a &quot;Catholic and Royal Army&quot;.&#10;&#10;Vend&eacute;e 93, a card driven two player wargame, takes you back to this particularly epic period in the French history, which pitted the young French Republic against the Royalist insurgents from March to October 1793.&#10;&#10;&quot;White&quot; or &quot;Blue&quot;, choose your cause and take command of your troops!&#10;&quot;White&quot;: you will have to take the advantage quickly at the risk of seeing the Republican forces inexorably strengthen, forcing you into a sinister &quot;Vir&eacute;e de Galerne&quot;.&#10;&quot;Blues&quot;: time is on your side, resist the first assaults of the &quot;brigands&quot; to then be able to face the hell of the bocage in order to definitively extinguish the insurrection.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
