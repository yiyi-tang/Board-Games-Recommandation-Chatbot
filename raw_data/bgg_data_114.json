Between 1665 and his death in 1680, Riquet was completely anbsorbed by the planning, financing and construction of his canal system.  Sections of it, including the Canal de Garonne, remained unfinished until the 19th century.&#10;&#10;You can relive the adventure of building the canal, section by section, between Grisolles and Valence d'Agen in the heart of the Tarn-et-Garonne. Each player is an engineer who must use their best workers to build the greatest length of the Arriala (cannal in the Occitan language of southern France). You can move all workers, but only those on your team will gain you fame points for completing sections. The placement of your workers when construction is completed is critical.  Your aim is to have the most workers on a stretch of canal when it is completed.  Ties are broken in favour of the player placed third. It is also possible to build locks to alter sections of the canal and create new ones. However, the number of points awarded depends on the length of the section: a lock may win you a majority, but at what price?&#10;&#10;Points can also be scored for building structures, though this sacrifices a worker (five maximum per player) for the rest of the game. What's more, your expertise also extends to cultivating the  vines that make this region famous and will bring you valuable points when the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

In Chili Mafia, you will find existing Chili Peppers from around the world that are the main characters of the game. Just to mention a few, such well-known Chilies as the Jalape&ntilde;o, the Tabasco or the Carolina Reaper clash with each other. To reflect hierarchy, each pepper carries points that are in proportion to the respective Chili Pepper's strength on the Scoville scale. Moreover, the game includes various action and attack cards (inspired by Mafia jargon) that will not necessarily serve your interest. To win, score the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;[CLASSIFIED INFORMATION]&#10;&#10;Things are heating up in the world. Chili peppers are splitting into factions, leading to organized crime and unrest. The Chili Mafia reigns supreme.&#10;The Ministry of International Chili Security has hired you&mdash;a group of agents&mdash;to work undercover and round up the most wanted chili pepper mafiosi from around the globe. Your goal is to bring them to Mexico for a peace summit.  As you arrive in the Chihuahuan desert, the spicy criminals jump out of your luggage. It&rsquo;s obvious they have no interest in peace. Instead, they want a showdown. You and your fellow agents have no choice but to seize control of the Chili Mafia. But to gain their respect, you must fight amongst yourselves to determine who will be the most powerful mafia boss. Once you control the peppers, what will you do next?&#10;&#10;Players draw and play cards to form gangs and perform actions.  When a player draws the last card from the draw pile, they may complete their turn. Then every player (including the one that drew the last card) may take 1 more turn. After the last round, players calculate their scores.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The basic game is played as follows:&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the first player places the neutral Moeraki-ball on one of the nine central intersections of the board. After that, the players take turns placing one of their own pieces on the board. When a square is on the board is completely enclosed by pieces, the player who has the majority (normally 3:1, but it can be 2:1 or 3:0 next to the edge or the neutral Moeraki-ball) claims the field and places a tribe marker on it.&#10;&#10;The game can be won in one of four ways:&#10;1. Tahuna (beach): A player wins if he has enclosed a field with four of his own pieces.&#10;2. Awa (river): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the intersections on one of the diagonal lines from one edge to another edge.&#10;3. Ara (road): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the four intersections on one edge.&#10;4. Marae (holy ground): When all the fields in the center have been claimed, players count the number of tribal markers they have got on the board (markers that are on the edge and that have been claimed with a 2:1 majority count only half). The player with the most markers wins the game.&#10;&#10;The players win several matches, until one of them has won the pre-determined amount of matches.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version of the game, both players receive a Maori-Tane (warrior). Once during the game, a player may place the Tane on the board instead of a tribal marker. When he does so, all he chooses a direction. Any fields between the Tane and the edge in that direction cannot be claimed; any markers already present are removed.&#10;&#10;",

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!&#10;&#10;To this basic game, Ocean Labyrinth adds an underwater theme and a twist: some tiles have special rules on their backsides. When a tile of this  type is pushed out, a special rule is used for the next turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Pufferfish: the current player is so scared from this fish that they lose their movement for the current turn.&#10;    Diving scooter: you move more quickly: take an additional turn&#10;    Oxygen tank: you don't have enough oxygen, so you must return your pawn to a freely chosen start tile.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the creator of The Resistance and Avalon, Abandon Planet is a new game about escaping the meteor apocalypse. It's an experience of survival, betrayal, and fragile alliances in the moments before Earth is annihilated. Anyone who doesn't want to die on the soon-to-be-burning rock will have to team up with a partner to outfit their janky rocket transport for the interplanetary jump. But everyone's looking out for number one, and alliances can change at any time.&#10;&#10;Every turn, each player secretly decides which direction to send their rocket. They reveal their choices simultaneously, then take turns collecting resources from the board, or stealing them from each other. This would all be safe and pleasant if it weren't for the deadly meteor that will strike at the end of the round, drastically altering the map and damaging any rockets in its path. One player knows in advance where the meteor will hit, but depending on who they choose to share that information with &hellip; well, friends tend to come and go during the meteor apocalypse.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you and one other player will both need to acquire enough resources to launch, prep your rocket, then survive for one more round without getting stolen from or blown up. There's no limit on the number of teams that can pull this off &ndash; it's even possible for everyone (or almost everyone) to win, as long as everyone plays nice. But once the first wave of rockets launch, anybody left on the planet is stuck. The players who made it to space win; everyone else is obliterated by meteors.&#10;&#10;",

Gallery in English).&#10;&#10;The flow of the game and the goal of the players stay the same: Keep at least one of your ducks alive longer than your opponents, while they swim on an idyllic pond and are an easy prey for ruthless hunters and the like.&#10;&#10;Major differences from the older game include:&#10;- Almost twice as many action cards (100 vs. 52) and lots of new action types, too, e.g.:&#10;a) Moby Duck: is placed in front of a player for one round. Only this player's ducks may be shot at in this round.&#10;b) Bird flu: kills all ducks on the pond at once.&#10;c) Frank-ent-stein (pun in German: Ente = duck): kill three adjacent ducks and bring one of your killed ducks back into play (built from the mortal remains of the former???)&#10;d) Featherbrain: played on another player with a duck in the crosshairs. If that player has a fire card, he has to shoot his own duck.&#10;e) Shot in the dark: Kills the topmost duck on the draw deck.&#10;f) etc.&#10;&#10;- There are three duckling cards shuffled together with the other ducks and the water cards. While one of them crosses the pond, no shooting is allowed (no violence in front of minors). Then, the duckling leaves the game.&#10;&#10;- The German version now also has a gameboard and cardboard crosshairs (just like the old American version)&#10;&#10;- The colors of the 6 duck families are completely new, so the game should be combinable with the old game for an up-to 12-player experience (not tested, nor recommended by the publisher)&#10;&#10;",

These wizards cater to rich adventurers looking to trade their hard-won spoils for magical gear to make themselves more powerful. Each wizard owns a magic shop in which they display the fruits of their labor for gold-laden adventurers to come in and purchase. However, the adventurers' funds are finite. The wizards are competing to make their shops the most famous so that the adventurers will stop there first. And the best way to make a shop famous is to have the most impressive selection of useful and powerful magical gear. Whichever player's store obtains the most Prestige (victory points) will attract the customers and make the sales. May the craftiest wizard win!&#10;&#10;Manaforge is played over nine rounds. At the beginning of each round, six cards representing the items that can be created that round are placed on the center board. Each player rolls their own handful of dice, the symbols on which represent the types of mana that they have to spend this round. Then in player order, each player spends that mana to construct one of the items in the center, taking its card and adding it to their collection. Some cards have an instantaneous effect and are then discarded, while other cards stay in play and grant the player benefits such as additional mana each turn or the ability to turn mana into Prestige. Beware, though: time is short! Each player may create only one item each round, so a player can only ever get nine cards in total.&#10;&#10;A game of Manaforge takes an hour on average, depending on the number of players and their level of skill. Manaforge is intended for players ages 13 and up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the dawn of a new year. The old king has just died childless, and the new succession must be decided before the end of this year. You are a local baron or countess with as good a claim as anyone else, so now is the time to grab the throne. Your peers understand only force, and your subjects understand only gold. Gather your men, pay your knights, and assert your claim. Everyone will recognize the strongest and richest as the rightful monarch.&#10;&#10;In Melee you want to be the first person to capture an opposing castle (at which point the game ends immediately) or to have the most land and gold at the end of the year. Money is tight, and gold is used in the game both to build new units and to attack. The more gold you have and spend on your troops, the more motivated they will be and the higher your probability of success.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a Castle, one unit of foot soldiers, and 15 gold coins. The game begins with a drafting session in which you purchase units (soldiers, knights, camps and catapults) and bid on special abilities that will enhance your income, attack, or other options in the game.&#10;&#10;The game is then played over four turns (seasons), and in each turn players simultaneously choose one of three potential actions: (a) tax, (b) build new units, or (c) move and attack. Each turn ends with players collecting income.&#10;&#10;To attack, you move your unit into an occupied area, then secretly decide how much gold you will spend to motivate your troops. The defender then has to guess how much you have spent. If the defender guesses wrong, the attack succeeds; if the defender is correct, the attack fails and you lose your unit. Regardless of success you have spent your gold, so the tight trade-off that players have to assess is whether to be cheap with your men so that you can conserve gold for future builds and attacks, or be generous to increase your chances now but limit future options.&#10;&#10;The different abilities available in each game make for varied strategies and strong replayability as no two games are alike. After the initial strategic planning stage, Melee is fast and highly interactive. Beware as the game can end suddenly with a bold attack on an inadequately defended castle, making for a game that can be very nasty, brutish and short.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fist of Dragonstones: Tavern Edition is a closed-fist, bidding game. Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. The powers from those characters help collect valuable Dragonstones, lend their magical powers, help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.&#10;&#10;For each character card, players choose the number of coins they want to bid by placing them in a closed fist. All players reveal their bets at the same time, and the winner of the auction gains control of the card's powers. Depending on the card, you may win additional coins or Dragonstones, gain powers, place spells on other players, or score points.&#10;&#10;The rules of Fist of Dragonstones: Tavern Edition have been updated from the original Fist of Dragonstones to improve gameplay, including the introduction of the King's Favor, which speeds up play. The game includes more than 70 special character cards in the game, compared to 25 special characters in the original game. Some of these special characters can be saved for later use in the game. Thematically and artistically, the game has been re-imagined into The Dragon &amp; Flagon universe.&#10;&#10;The Legend:&#10;Many, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.&#10;&#10;Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to Adventurers who could bring them the Dragonstones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures &mdash; all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.&#10;&#10;This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend, yet at a cozy inn known as The Dragon &amp; Flagon, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the Adventurers that frequent the tavern. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade the Adventurers to recount some of the ancient tales. And if they take a particular liking to you, those Adventurers may bring out their own collection of magic coins and challenge you to a simple game of skill and luck, giving you a chance to have your own Fist of Dragonstones.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Portal of Morth is a competitive board game inspired by tower defense video games. During the game, the players have a team of heroes with which they will fight against an ever increasing amount of powerful enemies. As a general rule, the game has a duration of five rounds, with one wave per player each round. Each wave is divided in four phases:&#10;&#10;1. Lord Morth's phase: The starting player rolls the enemy dice into the portal board to determine in which path the enemies enter the boards. To do this, the player rolls as many enemy dice as indicated on the turn track, and a 12-sided die to determine the exact position of the portal. Also, the players receive cards to trump their opponent's strategies.&#10;&#10;2. Portal phase: The players may pay gold to turn the portal, modifying the initial enemy distribution. In turn order, each player may pay as much gold as they want to move the portal in any direction. Once all players have moved the portal or have passed their turn, they take the enemy dice that ended the phase in their zones of the portal board, placing them in the corresponding paths.&#10;&#10;3. Heroes' phase: Players move and attack with their team of characters, trying to eliminate all threats from their boards.&#10;&#10;4. Assault phase: Enemies advance, trying to exit the player's boards. The starting player rolls a three-sided die, and each player has to add the resulting number to the initial movement value of each enemy. If an enemy escapes a player's board, the player takes damage.&#10;&#10;Once all rounds are finished, the game ends and the player who has the fewest damage points wins!&#10;&#10;",

With an injunction in place to keep the guests from leaving, Moss has only a short window of opportunity to investigate and question the suspects. Can he eliminate the innocent and arrest the culprit before the injunction expires?&#10;&#10;In this game, you get to play as Inspector Moss, exploring a 25-room house consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you roll 7 white dice and 1 colored &quot;time&quot; die up to 3 times. You may then use up to 6 of the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). After performing any actions, you must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action.&#10;&#10;There are 10 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 9 of them, you must arrest the remaining suspect and escort him/her to the waiting police car. If you can do all of this before time runs out, you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game will also include 1 double-sided play mat, 24 specialty dice, 4 status counters, and a full-color rulebook. Completely compatible with all current Monsterpocalypse series.&#10;&#10;--&#10;Kakaris Maelstrom adds:&#10;Voltron: Defender of the Universe is a standalone game in the Monsterpocalypse game world, targeted at gamers who were hoping to see more &quot;name brand&quot; monsters in the game. The Voltron box offers players an excellent (and complete) way to get into the game but with some characters you're likely already familiar with. The game is also fully compatiable with other Monsterpocalypse miniatures and maps, so you'll no doubt start to see Terra Kahn vs. Voltron and such.&#10;&#10;Voltron (and his nemesis Lo-Tron) are morphers, a type of monster whose Alpha form is made up of a series of unit-sized pieces. Voltron is unique in that previous morpher's Alpha forms were made up of 4 units, whereas Voltron and Lo-Tron are both 5 units.  In addition, the battles are fought in space rather than on a traditional Monsterpocalypse city block.&#10;&#10;Monsterpocalypse is a unexpectedly strategic CMG. Based in the world of kaiju (loosely translated from Japanese as &lsquo;giant monster&rsquo;), you'll control a monster and a legion of support units. You'll vie for control of critical board positions as you try to optimize your die pools. Then unleash your fury against your opponent's monster using a variety of power attacks, destroying a city block or two along the way.&#10;&#10;",

Players claim Rental Properties by entering sums of qualifying dice. The values entered must increase from left to right, and the first player to claim all Rental Properties in a row gets to open a Business for a big bonus (which all other players immediately cross out). Most rows have room for two Businesses of decreasing value, while others only contain one, leading players to compete for them before they are gone.

The Axis and Allied players each have their own card decks, reflecting the relative strengths and weaknesses of both sides. Each player will have the chance to be the aggressor and defender trying to win the game by the time they have cycled through their card deck for the last time. Victory is achieved by having accumulated the required amount of victory points by capturing victory locations.&#10;&#10;As the decks are cycled, the Allied player adds some better quality cards, with the Russians and Americans entering play during the 1st and 2nd reshuffle. The Axis player adds will burn through his early game quality cards, becoming weaker as his resources dwindle. The underlying game mechanism is one of &quot;deck destruction&quot; rather than the more normal deck-building.&#10;&#10;Cards have multiple uses and can be recycled if used one way but during the course of the game you have to decide which cards are going to be permanently sacrificed from your deck cycle to allow you to build units.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;Mounted Game Board&#10;2 - Decks of 60+ cards&#10;3/4&quot; counters&#10;Rules &#10;Box&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

And there is always another city.&#10;It&rsquo;s all in the name of profit.&#10;&#10;Axon Protocol is a for 2-6 players and features a unique game mechanic called &ldquo;Shared worker control&rdquo;.&#10;Every single character in the city has their own routine and skills. Each character can be hacked and controlled by every player.&#10;But they will follow their own behavior again the moment no one is hacking them. The Rockstar might give a concert in the city plaza, until a terrorist blows it up, and the corporate rescue team can only save one of the victims.&#10;The game features 6 types of resources: augments, data, drugs, products, scandals and violence. Each corporation profits from two of these resources.&#10;With over 40 unique characters and 6 different corporations each with their own unique special ability, every game of Axon Protocol will tell its own story.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

During the game, you recruit generals and admirals from the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) and the War of the Austrian Succession, and send other military forces to take colonies by force, with colonies producing exports to aid your economy. Your units roll dice in combat against enemy forces, and you can modify those results by playing historic event cards to turn the tide of battle, modifying dice rolls and destroying enemy cards at critical moments. You'll also engage in political efforts to persuade other world powers to enter the conflict on your side and bring their resources to the fight.&#10;&#10;Your final score is decided by the number of colonies you have captured, countries you have gotten to join your cause, and enemy leaders you've taken as prisoners.

    "Description": "Napoleonic 20 #17&#10;&#10;When the capture of Vienna failed to bring the Austrians to the bargaining table, Napoleon sought more direct means of ending the War of the Fifth Coalition. His first attempt was a nearly impromptu effort to force a crossing of the Danube, then in full spring flood, with the handful of forces that were immediately available. Almost predictably, the resulting battle of Aspern-Essling resulted in a crushing French defeat. Stung by the setback, Napoleon then spent the next month and a half preparing for another assault at the same site, this time concentrating all available troops to ensure his success.&#10;In the ensuing battle of Wagram, the second largest engagement of the Napoleonic era, Napoleon managed to defeat the Austrians but failed to achieve the decisive result he'd hoped for, forcing him to acknowledge that his foes were &quot;no longer the enemy of old.&quot;&#10;&#10;Danube 20 features in a Twin game combo games both the battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram, allowing players to examine this pair of critical battles fought just across the Danube from Vienna. Featuring low unit density (twenty or fewer pieces) and modest complexity, the game focuses on dramatic, fast-playing turns and creating a strong historical narrative. The use of &quot;story-driven&quot; random event cards and the tracking of army morale provide for operational pauses and the &quot;friction of war&quot; to give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 5 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex about 1200 meters, and each turn roughly 3.5 daylight hours (8 hours at night).&#10;&#10;",

Move your force through the urban area facing an unknown number of insurgents coming from you at all angles.

You start with two basic vineyards and your goal is to grow your businesses into a world-class winery. The player with the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;The game covers a period of 6 years in 6 rounds, each year consisting of 5 seasons. Multiple actions are available in every season; players begin by selecting their preferences and this decision determines the course of the entire round (year).&#10;&#10;The round progresses from season to season. You will optimize grape production to improve quality and meet the demand, and use a special process to blend your wines and create high-quality cuv&eacute;es.  To be successful, you must prepare for the forces of nature, introduced by weather cards, and do your best to mitigate damages by preventive measures. You can also expand your facilities: enlarge your cellar, build and run wine houses, restaurants or guesthouses, and make sure they are supplied with enough wine and that the workers are paid.&#10;You will sell your wines on the local and international markets at a price based on quality and demand, and you can participate in annual wine-rating contests, as award-winning wines sell for a higher price. You may also trade with wholesalers, or utilize the options offered by various event cards, such as a loan, a grant, promotion, and much more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;A Cuv&eacute;e kiemelked&#197;&#145;en tematikus, akci&oacute;v&aacute;laszt&oacute; strat&eacute;giai j&aacute;t&eacute;k, mely hasonl&oacute; feladatok el&eacute; &aacute;ll&iacute;tja a j&aacute;t&eacute;kost, mint egy val&oacute;di bor&aacute;szat &uuml;zemeltet&eacute;se eset&eacute;ben.

Arrange the tiles in a rectangle six spaces wide and four deep, with a space of each color in the row closest to you. Place 12 of your 16 pieces on the two rows closest to you, with the remaining pieces going into a reserve. Each piece shows three different colors or one color twice and a second color a single time. Once you've done this, reveal your set-up and place your tiles against the opponent's to create a board eight rows deep.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you have two options:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Swap: Swap one of your pieces on the board for a piece in your reserve.&#10;    Move: Move one of your pieces on the board 1-3 spaces, with moves being orthogonal or diagonal. The spaces that you move on must match the colors of that piece, and you can land on a color only as many times as the number of times that color appears on the piece. You can move onto a space occupied by your own piece, but you can't end your move there. If you land on an opponent's piece, place that piece in the opponent's reserve and end your movement.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you land one of your pieces in the row closest to the opponent, you win.&#10;&#10;",

Razor-wielding gangsters rule the streets, presided over by rival crime queens Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh.&#10;&#10;But you, the police, have not been idle. The holding cells are overflowing and now you must work as a team to bring together the evidence needed to convict each suspect.

Each player fans their cards so that they can see one set of icons but the other players see the other set. On their turn, a player selects one card and the other players arrange their hands to indicate which of their own cards feature the icons that they can see on the back of that card. The player must then deduce what icon or icons are on the reverse of their card, taking into account that what they see in other players' hands is not exactly what those players themselves can see. If they deduce correctly then the evidence may be enough to convict a suspect. But if they guess wrong then that suspect is acquitted. To win the game, players must together convict ten suspects without acquitting too many.&#10;&#10;The cards feature historical mugshots of real suspects arrested in Sydney, Australia, during the 1920s razor gang era.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(From the publisher)&#10;The war for minds and souls had been raging for ten destructive years when the vaunted, virtually undefeated Catholic army of the Hapsburg emperor and his allied German states looked across the gentle valley of Breitenfeld directly into the blinding rays of the dawn of modern warfare. By the end of the day, Tilly's lumbering army lay smashed beyond redemption, the victim of rapid-firing artillery, fast-moving infantry and hard-charging cavalry. The prediction had come true: Breitenfeld signaled the ascendancy of Gustavus II Adolphus, King of Sweden, the Lion of the North.&#10;&#10;Lion of the North is the third volume in GMT's heralded Great Battles of History (GBoH) Series. The Thirty Years' War signaled the dawn of modern warfare ... a return to the supremacy of linear tactics, drill and discipline, to what some historians call &quot;the return of the legion.&quot; Lion of the North represents two of the most famous battles of that period:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Breitenfeld, 1631&#10;    Lutzen, 1632&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;Time = 30 minutes per turn&#10;Map = 100 yards per hex&#10;Unit = 100 men per strength point&#10;&#10;&#10;This is in the line of GBOH games which include Alexander, SPQR, Caesar: The Civil Wars, Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, and Cataphract.

Gather enough &quot;Rep&quot; points to work your way from Bounty Hunter all the way to Marshall. Better hurry, you are not the only one after the job!&#10;&#10;The game includes over 100 game cards, 10 General Store cards &amp; 6 custom shooter dice. On each player's turn, they flip over a card to hunt for a wanted bandit.  Each bandit has a sequence of suit symbols (heart, diamond, spade &amp; club).  The tougher the bandit the more suit symbols will appear.  The player can roll and re-roll the 6 dice up to 3 times to try to capture the bandit by matching these symbol.  Jokers are wild and can be used as any suit. Skulls, if rolled, render the die out of play.  Once captured you can stop &amp; collect the bandit by moving them into you jail, or you may press your luck &amp; try to grab more bandits.  If you decide to continue on your hunt you get to re-roll all of your dice, minus any skulls previously rolled, for three more chances to capture the new bandit.  Lose any bandit on your turn &amp; you lose ALL the bandits collected this round!&#10;&#10;Each bandit has a reward amount for their capture as well as 1 to 2 reputation points to put towards your promotions. Higher ranks gain the ability to re-roll a certain number of skull dice.&#10;&#10;Reward money can be traded in for General Store cards which can help you on your journey or played to hinder another player's. But choose wisely, spending your reward money will sacrifice the Rep you have gained for those bandits!&#10;&#10;The game deck also contains event cards.  Some events award you with General Store cards by completing a rolling task. Other events may cause you to lose the bandits you are wrangling, or have your previously captured bandits escape from your jail!&#10;&#10;Be the first player to be promoted to Marshall to win!&#10;&#10;Think you have what it takes to win the west?

The board is used for tracking the levels of ten prepared ingredients in the kitchen. To prepare more ingredients, players spend dice in different combinations. All players are in charge of different tasks and all must work simultaneously because the timer is running!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players pool their money and invest in different options to grow their business: acquire new recipes, upgrade preparation cards, or send out coupons to get more customers. The players must have a certain level of profit by the last round to keep the restaurant open and win!&#10;&#10;The third edition of Wok Star contains new gameplay wrinkles: You can re-roll dice by &quot;washing dishes&quot; and modify dice by using &quot;hustle&quot;. Fortune cubes limit how often you can share dice, and you now have daily goals that you must reach each round or else you lose immediately.&#10;&#10;",

Lay out the four types of tools, then lay out ten product cards in a face-up display; the products are separated into two types, with the easiest to acquire coming into play first. On a turn, you must draw a face-down commodity card from the deck, then you take an action or pass, then you discard down to your hand limit, which starts at six cards. When you take an action, you can:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Discard two commodity cards in hand to take one of the face-up commodity cards.&#10;    Discard hand cards for a product card from the display, adding that card to your hand (if it's a hut, canoe, or stoneware) or placing it in front of you.&#10;    Discard a set of commodity cards to acquire a tool card, which you place in front of you; tools increase your hand limit, use fish as jokers, draw two cards at the start of your turn, and draw from the face-up commodity cards instead of the deck.&#10;    Discard one or more commodity or product cards to an appropriate store placed in front of you.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the commodity deck runs out, shuffle the discards to create a new deck. When you can no longer fill the product display to have ten cards available, each player takes one final turn, then the game ends. Players then tally the points on their product cards, tool cards, and commodities and products laid at stores, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Meanwhile, in the mountains of Pakistan, bearded men in secure caves are determined to stand up to this increased Coalition presence. By mules, motorcycles and camels, weapons and ammunition make their way into Zurmat. This will not be a quiet year&hellip;&#10;&#10;Zurmat is a two-player (Coalition versus the Taliban) game played across month-long turns with players trying to achieve their commander&rsquo;s objectives while always trying to gain control of the peoples' hearts and minds. Each month/turn begins with a random event, then the Coalition player takes their turn, followed by the Taliban player. Each turn you will take an action and play cards. The game ends when winter arrives. Since winter cards are part of the deck of random events, the exact ending of the game may not be known until perhaps even the last turn of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The crews venture into the Rocky Mountains, exploring new hexes and drawing their discoveries in crayon. A player needs to manage their crew in trapping, hunting, dangers, movement, exploration, encounters, and more. While the beaver pelt is prized, further money can be made in exploration, discoveries, and finding routes to the Great Salt Lake and mapping the Colorado River.&#10;&#10;Rocky Mountain Man is played either solitaire or against another player. If 2 players, both will play in a kind of simultaneous solitaire fashion.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns, a turn comprising several phases. After a turn is conducted another begins, continuing until either the time limit is complete, the goal is achieved, or the Trading Post is built (if playing a campaign), or if all crews have been killed.&#10;&#10;In a two-player game, each player goes as fast or as patiently as they prefer. Each player may be in a completely different part of a phase than another. One player may complete several more turns than another, depending on their speed.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in timed sessions, by achievement of goals, or as a campaign.&#10;&#10;Victory is based on the kind of play. In s two-player game Victory Points determine the win. In solitaire, achieving a goal will provide victory.&#10;&#10;Rocky Mountain Man is based on the Source of the Nile (1978) game system. While there are many of the same game rules, some have been adjusted and others added. For players familiar with Source of the Nile, it is good to know the general pattern of that game, but do not assume a rule will be exactly the same.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A rising wave of fascism is now sweeping across the galaxy, threatening to throw the Galactic Alliance under auto-ratic rule. To help grow their power, the fascist group known as The Rat Pack has been pinning the galaxy&rsquo;s problems on cats. Now, these fuzzy creatures could be forced into exile all together.&#10;&#10;That is unless a band of rebellious felines, led by Rocket (the freedom fighter), CJ (the medic), Pepper (the pouncer), and Ophelia (the smuggler) can stop these fascist forces from seizing power - all while building a new galaxy where all species are free together.&#10;&#10;Space Cats Fight Fascism is a cooperative game where you play as a band of rebel cats trying to stop fascists from seizing control of the galaxy. In Space Cats Fight Fascism, you&rsquo;ll hop from planet to planet, scratching away at fascist forces and freeing animals pinned under the fascists&rsquo; claws.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to liberate four planets before the fascists take control of the Galactic Alliance. You&rsquo;ll have three actions on your turn, and each player will use cards from their hand to build up the Animal Resistance on the twelve different home worlds. Cards and other basic actions will allow you to teleport across the galaxy, restock on supplies, as well as adopt new paw-ers as the game goes on - making each game unique.&#10;&#10;Once the Resistance has at least four liberation tokens on a planet, you will place a Liberated flag there! When four planets have become liberated, the fascists have been defeated by the Resistance, and the animals of the galaxy rejoice! But watch out, because the fascists are always right on your tail! With cards like Anti-Cat Propaganda and The Fascists Use Laser Pointers to Distract Us!, they&rsquo;ll try to wrestle back control of liberated planets from you while occupying even more planets to cement their power. The Fascists can win the game in one of three ways: by placing three Occupied flags on the board, by getting every single fascist onto the board, or by gaining too much power on the Fascism Scale.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
