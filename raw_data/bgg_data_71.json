    "Description": "Who are you in Mascarade? Whoever you want to be...at least until someone else calls you out on it! Each character receives a face-down role card at the start of the game, and in a game with 4-5 players some role cards are placed in the center of the table. On a turn, you take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;1) Announce your character: Claim the power of a certain character and take the associated action. You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal.&#10;&#10;2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself. You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark.&#10;&#10;3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins &mdash; or until a player has lost all of their coins, in which case the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Mascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game. The rules suggest that you use certain characters in your first games, but once you know the game, you can try many other distributions.&#10;&#10;Note that this second edition of Mascarade includes 17 role cards, with these cards being a mix of roles from the original base game and the 2014 expansion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tarock is a general term for the many 2 to 5 player, point trick taking games of central Europe that use a 54-card Tarock deck.  Common to these games is a round of bidding followed by a round of announcements indicating bonuses that will be attempted during the round of play, and doublings of the game, or any of the announced bonuses. The deck consists of 4 suits (usually clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds), and a permanent trump suit (Tarock) of 22 cards.&#10;&#10;There are variants of tarock for 2 to 5 players.&#10;&#10;Straw man tarock is a variant for 2 players where each players hand is augmented by cards dealt out into piles in front of him/her at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Tapp tarock is a variant for 3 players that does away with the bid to 'call a king'.&#10;&#10;K&ouml;nigrufen is a variant for 4 active players (with 5 one player deals and sits out that round) who are dealt 12 cards and 6 for the talon, bidding indicates how many cards will be used from the talon with the remaining cards being split by the other players. The declarer calls a trump (XIX) or one of the kings to indicate a partner (the partner does not indicate this fact though), after which players can make bonus announcements and doublings. During the play, suit must be followed and trump must be played if you are out of the suit. Points are counted after each round and the declarer, generally, needs to take more than half in order to fulfill the contract.&#10;&#10;",

It is, however, your job to keep them apart - to avoid brawling bulls and potential injury (to themselves or anyone else for that matter).&#10;&nbsp;&#10;This is my take on a 'roll and write' game.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;A number of bulls are randomly placed in a field.&#10;You build fences (draw straight lines) across the field in order to enclose and separate the bulls in it.&#10;Possible starting and finishing points (fence posts) are chosen from the dice you roll.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;As well as working out where best to build your fence, you'll also need to think ahead and plan for the next ones.There is also an element of push your luck - do you risk losing a life (mallet) by going for that final fence to complete the Field or move on to the next Field and score less points?&#10;&#10;The game features 4 fields of increasing difficulty.&#10;&#10;There's just 1 page to print out and 1 page of rules.&#10;There's also a low ink (black) version available.&#10;You'll also need 3 regular dice, a pen or pencil and something to draw a straight line with.&#10;&#10;Raging Bulls was an entry for the 2017 Solitaire PnP Design Contest&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dark Vengeance contains 48 miniatures, Dark Angels and the Chaos Space Marines of the Crimson Slaughter - all of which are snap-fit plastic models - this means that glue is optional. It contains enough miniatures to start a Dark Angels army, including: a Company Master armed with bolt pistol, power sword and combi-weapon; Librarian Turmiel, who carries a bolt pistol and force sword; Veteran Sergeant Raphael and his Tactical Squad; Deathwing Terminator Squad Barachiel; Sergeant Arion and a Ravenwing Bike Squadron that comes equipped with twin-linked boltguns. All are resplendent in the iconography of the Dark Angels. From the finely crafted purity seals to studded power fists, to the Librarian with codex, keys and ornate sword, through to the Bikes with angel-wing panels, they are among the most sublime Space Marines ever sculpted.&#10;&#10;Ranged against the Dark Angels is the Crimson Slaughter. These Chaos Space Marine models contain attributes that will leave you slack-jawed in awe. Warp distress shows through on every detail of armour on the models. Horrific maws can be seen on swords, armour and guns. Faces emerge from flesh, as bones jut outward. Dozens of miniature eyes of Chaos peer outwards; jagged or ribbed horns curl in all manner of directions. There are macabre brain-like surfaces, grills, chains and skulls, and even more textures. The full Crimson Slaughter line-up includes: Kranon the Relentless, Chaos Lord - armed with power sword and plasma pistol; Mortis Metalikus: Helbrute, armed with multi-melta and power fist; and Draznicht's Ravagers: Chosen. They stand alongside Chaos Cultists made up of Sect Anarkus, which carries close combat weapons, and Sect Tetchvar, which carries ranged weapons such as autoguns. Both units are garbed in sinister-looking cloaks, masks and hoods.&#10;&#10;As if these models weren't enough, Dark Vengeance comes with a full-colour 168-page mini Warhammer 40,000 Rulebook 6th edition; a complete Assembly Guide; a quick-play reference guide; an army roster sheet; dice, templates and a how-to-play booklet including six scenarios to enact on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;Dark Vengeance is, quite simply, astonishing value for money. Whether you want to start a Dark Angels or Chaos Space Marines army, wish to add to your existing collection of models, or simply gape at beautiful miniatures, then this is an essential purchase.&#10;&#10;",

You play the White government of Rhodesia, besieged by a Black guerilla army, using your potent armed forces to hold it back while you try to persuade your colonialist voters to compromise and move to a system of Black majority rule. The balance of military and political factors makes for an intriguing and very different sort of game; you'll fight guerillas, fight elections, and even pass bills with the same level of tension! Advancing generous policy positions, to win over African public opinion, can endanger you with the European voters you depend on for power. At the same time, you have to persuade foreign states that your reforms are moving forward -- they have different visions for Rhodesia than you do, and they can bring you down with economic sanctions or military strikes. And looming over you are the unstable Portuguese, whose empire in Mozambique is vital to your strategic safety! Your aim is to build a government based on justice and equality, while holding off extremists on every side using all your military and political tools.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

INTRODUCTION&#10;With the hero's success in destroying the Black Knight's plan in Dawn, it took longer for him to organise his minions. But the time has come at last, the Great War has begun! Backed up by a very strong Dark Magic, he commands a huge army of Greenskins including the fierce  Goblorcs, unnatural Beasts, and now the Ice Monsters and even the Undeads have joined his army. The worst part is the Light Sword's new power -- the Black Knight now can heal his minions around him, including himself, in seconds!&#10;&#10;Approaching from the west , in a very short time three castles have fallen to his hands, and his armies are swiftly heading to the capital of D. Once again everything seems hopeless and the King of D has called the 18 legendary heroes to gather in the Dungeon of D, deep in the Forest of D to the south, where legend says that centuries ago the Great Wizard of D hid the Amulet of D'eugor. It is believed that only the legendary Amulet of D'eugor can nullify the Light Sword&rsquo;s power. Unfortunately, the Black Knight knew about this too, so he placed a very strong magical barrier on the entrance to keep anyone from entering.&#10;&#10;Luckily, the King has also summoned Daryn and Derek. They can combine their magical abilities to open the barrier for a very short time, allowing just one person to enter the dungeon. But even with their combined power, they can only do this once every three hours. So, one by one the 18 heroes enter the dungeon, hoping to find the Amulet of D'eugor and survive to exit the dungeon. So far no one has returned&hellip; and you are hero number 18, the last person to enter the dungeon. Daryn looks into your eyes before you enter the crack in the barrier. &quot;Please, you are our last hope&hellip;&quot; You nod a little, then jump in&hellip;.&#10;&#10;2. THE MISSION&#10;Get out of the dungeon alive as rich as you can.

Noshin is a monk who can communicate with the Kamis and has a special preference for&hellip; sak&eacute;! Tikku is a young fisherman (at that time) who wishes to become a monk by the guidance of Noshin. The four of them are on a mission after Tikku&rsquo;s request to help him find his kidnapped sister. This quest will lead the four of them to situations and places far from what they had ever imagined&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Heroes in OKKO Chronicles will have a character card with characteristics and talents. They will also come with Power Cards which will represent the Hero&rsquo;s special abilities, secret techniques and other unique skills.&#10;&#10;This latest addition to the Chronicles family will plunge you into the heart of a dark and fantastic incarnation of medieval Japan. Journey to the four corners of the war-torn kingdom of Pajan as you join the ronin monster-slayer, Okko, and his brave companions as they hunt down a variety of fearsome supernatural foes.&#10;&#10;Whether you choose to harness the devastating power of fickle Elementals or rely on the cold surety of ancestral steel; you must combine your martial prowess with all your cunning if you are to uncover and destroy the demon in your midst.&#10;&#10;Developed from those used for Guardians' Chronicles, OKKO&rsquo;S CHRONICLES introduces completely new mechanics. Still easy to learn and fun to play, these rules have their own unique flavor and specific features that allow you to become totally immersed in this fascinating universe. These developments include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Weapon, Armor and Item cards with which to equip your Heroes, allowing you to tailor them to the situations they face.&#10;     A unique investigation system to enable the Heroes to unmask the terrible Oni hidden among the occupants of the daimyo&rsquo;s palace.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Grandma and Grandpa will pitch in, too, but the guests might show up at any time. Try to quickly tidy up more stuff than anyone else. Can each family member finish straightening up, and get ready to receive the guests with out any mishaps?&#10;&#10;In Before the Guests Arrive, you do your best to tidy up a messy house for a party. To set up the game, shuffle the guests card into a small pack of cards and place it on the bottom of the deck. Lay out 10-13 cards in an interlocking series of rows and columns. On a turn, choose a row or column, and take all cards in it, adding them to your collection; if at most three cards are in the display, first refill the display, then choose a row or column.&#10;&#10;After taking cards, you can tidy up with one member of the family. The Mom, Dad, Girl, and Boy can each tidy up two types of stuff at a time, whereas Baby, Grandma, and Grandpa can each tidy up only one type. Stuff comes in five colors, and each color has three types of stuff, e.g., baby stuff (yellow) has blocks, bears, and lollipops. Yellow stuff can be tidied only by Baby, Grandma, and Grandpa, whereas red stuff can be tidied only by the Girl or Grandma. When tidying up a type of stuff, you can tidy as much of that type of stuff (i.e., stuff with the same illustration) as you like, so it's useful to get a bunch of the same stuff and tidy it all up together.&#10;&#10;When refilling the house, if the guest card appears, then the game ends, with everyone having one final chance to tidy up or discard a single card. Players then score points for the stars on what they've tidied, then lose points for stuff not tidied and family members not used. Whoever scores the most wins!&#10;&#10;",

The ultimate goal is to score five &ldquo;puzzle&rdquo; Clue cards in order to piece together the Big Picture, before running out of time or mental stability.&#10;&#10;Each newly shuffled deck is the start of a unique challenge, with adjustable difficulty levels to accomodate all level players. In &ldquo;Infinite Gulfs of Darkness&rdquo; Howard Lovecraft investigates events based on the stories &ldquo;From Beyond&rdquo; (1920), &ldquo;Nyarlathotep&rdquo; (1920), &ldquo;The Haunter of the Dark&rdquo; (1935), and Robert Bloch&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Shadow from the Steeple&rdquo; (1950).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Heights of Courage: The Battle for the Golan Heights, October 1973, is a game covering the Golan Heights portion during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.&#10;&#10;In October, 1973, Syria and her allies lead a surprise attack to recapture the Golan Heights in conjunction with an Egyptian assault across the Suez Canal into the Sinai.&#10;&#10;For a little over two weeks, massed Syrian armor tried to swamp the Israeli defenders who were buying time to allow mobilized reserves to arrive.  They succeeded and managed to turn the tide launching their own offensive toward Damascus.&#10;&#10;Heights of Courage is the 16th game in the award winning Standard Combat Series. It complements the 1995 CSR award winning game Yom Kippur (which covers the fighting in the Sinai). It uses the same 8 page standard series rulebook applicable to all the other games.&#10;&#10;Because both sides have offensive and defensive phases of the battle to enjoy, victory is determined by comparing the best Syrian performance in their early offensive to the Israeli offensive results at the end of the game. This forces both sides to fight tooth and nail on both the offense and defense with enormous time pressure on perform rapidly.&#10;&#10;The game captures all the sizzle of the fast-paced armored battle with enough steak to give the game the appropriate level of depth. For example, it uses an innovative two tempo operational speed, to both players as the battle goes beyond the endurance of the forces involved.  Each player can select to go &ldquo;fast&rdquo; in order to fight more or &ldquo;slow&rdquo; in order to get more replacements.&#10;&#10;While Heights of Courage cannot be directly linked to Yom Kippur, the game provides rules to allow players to play both games in tandem so as to play the &ldquo;whole war.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Four scenarios allow different looks at the 17 turn campaign (turn length varies based on when a cease-fire occurs).&#10;4.1 The Historical Battle for the Golan Heights (17 turn long version)&#10;4.2 The Historical Battle for the Golan Heights (10 turn short version)&#10;4.3 Operation Badhr (6 turn look at the initial Syrian offensive)&#10;4.4 Operation Al-Owda (Original Syrian plan - which can be played in the 6, 10 or 17 turn versions)&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: Half day to 3 days (depending on game turn)&#10;Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers&#10;Units: Platoon/Task Force/Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Heights of Courage rulebook&#10;One 8-page Standard Combat Series ver 1.7 rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you take a Megalith &mdash; a piece formed by two cubes joined together &mdash; from the common reserve, and place it on the board in a standing position. The turn passes to your opponent if he is willing to tip over the Megalith or if the Megalith cannot be tipped over.&#10;&#10;A player owns a square if it is covered by a Megalith showing his color on the upper face. A Dolmen is a group of at least three adjacent squares belonging to the same player. The game is won by the player with the most Dolmens; in case of a tie, the player with the largest Dolmen wins.&#10;&#10;All Megaliths are the same: three faces (one square and two opposed rectangular ones) of one color and the other three faces of the other color. The two main aspects of the game are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Your move often is also determined by your opponent's choice.&#10;    Having a lot of Megaliths with your own color showing on the upper face is not always a good thing as you might end up with merely one giant Dolmen. The basic aim of the game is building many Dolmens and keeping them separated, while trying to connect your opponent's Dolmens to each other.&#10;&#10;&#10;It is possible to play Carnac on different board sizes, leading to the use of different strategies to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;",

Over nine rounds, each player dispatches family members to attend parties, give gifts, brag about their achievements, engage in spurious gossip, and muscle their way through crowds to get some valuable face-time with the Medici. The chief resource in Florence is time: As the Carnevale moves into full swing and the streets fill with revelers, they will become harder to navigate, and you will need to be cautious of which actions you ask your various scions to complete.&#10;&#10;But by ensuring that your family is at the front of each queue and the most talked about (by meeting conditions of various &quot;brag&quot; cards), you gain valuable points to elevate your family's status. Each Medici is impressed only by a specific approach, and as the night goes on, they become harder to impress &mdash; which scores you more points for increasingly harder objectives should you do so.&#10;&#10;Florence includes a solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Here's a short description from Aaron:&#10;&#10;It's still trick-taker-like. Works sort of in the opposite manner than Why I Otter. In Why I Otter you score your tricks from public conditions. In An Otter Won you have personal conditions in the cards you've taken into your den that play off public otter cards in the river. It's a bit more thinky/gamerly. It also does away with rock/paper/scissors. It uses a neutral setup card per trick that may help determine if the high or the low card wins the round. The winner assigns those 3 cards (neutral yours and opponents) to which goes to which location.

Reward is in the form of build points, which can be used to build towns, castles, and wage combat against Mordred.

    "Description": "Statis Pro Football is an in-depth, simulation-first football game that uses the AH Fast Action Card system. Individual players are rated for their ability to throw, catch, run, block, rush the passer, etc. Players are the coach for their team, and choose from a selection of offensive or defensive moves (Inside Run, Short Pass or Blitz, Run No Key as examples) which affect the outcome, and then flip a deck of cards to work out the result. So if I call the right pass defense against your pass, it becomes harder to complete the pass, or a Run defense means your Run gets less yardage. But if I get it wrong, my defense may have no effect or even greatly increase your chances.  The game rules also cover kickoffs, punts, turnovers, penalties, etc.&#10;&#10;The basic game comes with stats cards for every player in every team. Avalon Hill produced several years worth of cards for use with the game, which you could buy separately. A strong team will usually overwhelm a weaker team, though good playcalling and some luck with the cards can mitigate that advantage. But by picking evenly-matched teams, it does require some forethought to work your team to a score. The game includes optional endurance rules, which mean that some players must 'rest' before you can re-direct a play to them. This means cycling players and dealing with injuries makes tricky decisions for the players.&#10;&#10;",

Players must choose to either bond (pair) their selected card with another Element Card or set it alone (possibly to form an ionic bond at a later time). Throughout the game, players gain additional points for building specific compounds which are listed on the Compound Goal Cards and have available a set of Action Tiles which award them additional moves throughout the game. Players score points based upon the quantity and type of neutrally balanced compounds they construct and noble gas sets they collect. After three rounds, players add their total scores from each round, subtract points from Action Tiles used, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The RabbitZ!, a fearful horde of mutant zombie rabbits, come out of their burrow with only one goal... EAT! The Orchard and the vegetable people are in danger... But this time we are ready!&#10;&#10;Using the technology of the Ancients, we have created great machines that are powered by the energy of the Orchard. Piloted by the brave Guardians of the Orchard, these powerful robots are our last hope.&#10;&#10;Rabbitz &amp; Robots is a tower defense card game for 1 to 5 players in which players will become the Guardians of the Orchard, a group of brave vegetables who pilot combat robots and defend the Orchard from the invasion of the RabbitZ.&#10;&#10;Starting with the player who has the highest value RabbitZ in their path, the game will be played in turns and clockwise. Each player&rsquo;s turn is divided into two phases:&#10;&#10;In phase 1: Take the top card of the Burrow deck and place it at the start of your path (next to the Burrow deck) with the RabbitZ side up. If there are already other RabbitZ on your path, they will move in the direction of your Robot to make room for the new RabbitZ. The paths have a maximum of three spaces, this means that if there are already three RabbitZ in a path and a fourth one enters, it will push the others and the closest RabbitZ to the Robot will sneak into the player&rsquo;s Garden, counting as a negative score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In phase 2: Choose an action between: Super Attack, Charge Robot, Use weapons or Pass turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the Burrow deck ends and there are no RabbitZs left in front of the players.&#10;&#10;The player with the fewest negative points (RabbitZ value) in his Orchard wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;A&Ntilde;O 30175&#10;Desde hace miles de a&ntilde;os, la destrucci&oacute;n de ecosistemas naturales y la contaminaci&oacute;n han convertido el planeta en un lugar desolado y pr&aacute;cticamente inhabitable.&#10;&#10;Mientras que las especies menos afortunadas se han extinguido, otras nos adaptamos y evolucionamos en uni&oacute;n con la Huerta, el &uacute;ltimo pulm&oacute;n verde, nuestro hogar.&#10;&#10;Aqu&iacute;, hortalizas de todos los colores convivimos y trabajamos unidas para proteger la tierra que nos da la vida.

You will play the game above the painting that he made. You will start as Peasants, sowing the ground and selling your crop along the Via Francigena. If you will save enough florins you will be more comfortably off, trading in cloth and spices throughout Tuscany. But your dream is bigger: to enter the Council of the Nine, the town&rsquo;s government. Therefore you will have to change into Bankers and use your money to obtain the Senesi&rsquo;s consent: will you finance the artists of that time or contribute towards the construction of the new Torre del Mangia? Be careful, the florins that you have saved could not be enough! Behind every corner of the town other players&rsquo; pitfalls hide themselves: beggars, thieves, pretty women inside the inn... &#10;Be prepared for a unique game experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the world of the unseen!&#10;&#10;Armies of angels and demons clash in an epic battle over a human soul. While the forces of heaven try to influence for good, the demonic fallen angels strive to draw the soul into darkness and despair. In the realm of the spirital world, mighty angel warriors try to hold their positions against onstorming demons and tormentors, by seeking to break their defenses, or by taking control of valuable crystals and living water fountains to slowly turn the tide of war to their advantage. The mighty and mysterious 6-winged seraphs summon new angels to gain a foothold on the enemy&acute;s flank. Meanwhile the archangels, God&acute;s chosen messengers, move like lightning over the battlefield, commanding their forces, and bringing fear to the hosts of evil. The archdemons, false gods of the ancient world, no less cunning, rise up to meet them in battle. They all know the victory belongs to the wisest leader. Are you that leader?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Take control of the forces of good or the hordes of evil. Command mighty seraphs or fierce tormentors. Each player begins with a starting deck customized by a unique general - either an archangel or archdemon. Each turn, you will use your Command markers to move troops or initiate battles and then use the cards in your hand to modify those movements or battles - or build your turn around an epic Tactics card that provides even more value! You can use your resources to deploy more units, increase your handsize, or gain more Command markers! At the end of your turn, you&rsquo;ll gain more resources if you control certain Areas - or even 1 Soul Point if you control the Human Soul. When either the good or evil side has 7 Soul Points - the game is over and the soul has been claimed!&#10;&#10;",

Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.&#10;Players select a squadron of pilots before each campaign.  Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions. &#10;This installment covers all the historical and some hypothetical wars involving Israel from 1948 through to year 2020.  The game features historically accurate aircraft and weapons for each war.&#10;&#10;",

Work on the Brisingamen and Freya rewards you with Free Action tokens that you can use for extra actions or for victory points. Ability cards let your dwarfs move faster, whisk jewels out of the mine, block other player's dwarfs or steal jewels.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;In the far future, Earth is a distant myth. When mankind gained the means to transit the vastness of space safely and quickly, a great human wave extended across the galaxy, and humans soon inhabited thousands of worlds.&#10;&#10;Communities of worlds formed alliances; alliances became federations, and eventually a galactic empire was born. That empire existed for millennia, growing and consolidating, bringing most of the inhabited worlds under its control.&#10;&#10;Despite its size and apparent success, though, all is not well in the Galactic Empire. There are rebels, usurpers, those who want to create empires of their own, and aliens of every imaginable form. Over the long millennia, even the form of man is taking a new shape with genetic engineering.&#10;&#10;Struggle for the Galactic Empire is a solitaire science fiction game. You assume leadership of the forces of the Galactic Empire as it strives to maintain and expand its dominion while fighting off the forces of chaos that seek to destroy it. You make all the military, political, social and economic decisions to deal with the threats that arise, keep the far-flung empire stable, and still expand and bring new glory through discovery, colonization and conquest.&#10;&#10;The map shows the entire galaxy divided into sectors of star systems. Production is carried out by nano-assemblers to create starships and world-sized weapons. Units include combat and colonization ships, control groups and leaders. Units have two types of combat values: weapons and morphogenetic systems. Weapons destroy the enemy, while morphogenetic systems change them into friends. Loyalties switch back and forth depending on the situation.&#10;&#10;Threats are generated by over 100 randomly drawn chaos markers. They include: rebels, usurpers, independent empires, invaders and alien forces, as well as technological, economic, social, political and military events. You can also launch expeditions to attempt to gain new knowledge and technology. Other rules allow you to use psycho-social warfare and propaganda to repress rebellions.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;    352 Die cut counters&#10;    1 34&quot; x 22&quot; Map &#10;    1 Rule booklet &#10;    Player Aids&#10;    Storage bags&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;ll take careful planning to achieve all your travel goals while staying under budget.&#10;&#10;Each round, three Destination cards are revealed. Each player simultaneously selects one Destination and adds it to one of their three trips by drawing the travel route on their own globe. The globe stands have a built-in circular ruler to measure the distance (and cost) of each flight. The further you fly, the more expensive the trip.&#10;&#10;Players score by accomplishing the objectives on their Bucket List cards. In addition, each player has shared Travel Buddy Goals with each neighboring player. Coordinate plans with your travel buddies to meet up in the same place at the same time to score. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete the Global Objectives. The player who checks off the most travel goals wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once one of the players enters the home stretch of the scoring track, players can chose to move the leaders back a space instead of moving themselves up, but the winner is the player who crosses the finish line first.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1991.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Rival Networks is a standalone two-player version of The Networks. Much of the original's gameplay is preserved, but streamlined so that it plays in 30-45 minutes. You and your opponent each have a display of 3 Timeslots, and at the start of the game, they show your starting 3 (terrible) Shows. There is also a Goal Card showing for the current Season, with 3 Goals available to hit (like winning a particular Timeslot, or having more Stars on your Shows than your opponent).&#10;&#10;On your turn, you will pick one new Show from a display of 3, and use it to replace one of your existing Shows, which moves to your Reruns. You'll score Ratings Points for the new Show, scoring higher ratings if you put the show in its correct timeslot.&#10;&#10;Next, you select one Star and one Ad from their corresponding display. Stars and Ads are displayed as pairs, so when you take one, you must take its matching pair. These go into your Green Room.&#10;&#10;Then, you may attach as many Stars as you want onto a single Show (usually the Show you got this turn, but not always), as long as the Star has an icon matching the Genre of the Show. Stars add to your Show's Ratings.&#10;&#10;You'll track Ratings for each of the three Timeslots independently. There are various points on each Ratings track with Viewer icons (usually between 3-5 Ratings Points). Every time you pass one of these Viewer icons, you'll score a Viewer by placing a chip into your secret bank.&#10;&#10;Ads are worth money depending on various situations - usually whether you're leading at a given Timeslot. You'll pay the Ads in order to buy Network Cards (which are now marked with costs). Network Cards are one-time use power cards, similar to the Network Cards in the original game.&#10;&#10;If you ever get at least 3 Shows of the same Genre between your Lineup and your Reruns, you'll score a Genre Bonus. Genre Bonuses are different for each Genre, but usually get you Stars or Ratings Points.&#10;&#10;The deck of Shows has one Genre of each Show per Season. Once these are all out, you'll see an &quot;End of Season&quot; card. A player may take this card on their turn to trigger the end of the Season when their turn is over. They won't get a Show, but they'll still get a full turn otherwise (taking a Star and an Ad, placing Stars on Shows, and buying Network Cards with Ads).&#10;&#10;At the end of a Season, the player leading in more Timeslots scores 1 Viewer for each Timeslot they're leading in; the other player draws 1 random Star. Then you'll look at the current season's Goals. The winner of each Goal gets Viewers or Stars depending on the goal.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 3 Seasons. The player with more cards in their Green Room scores 1 Viewer. Then, the player with the most Viewers wins.&#10;&#10;",

All money is collected in the holding company and every couple of turns a company round commences where the players have to decide how much money they will pay out to the shareholders and how much will be kept in the holding company for better trains, more stations, and track building.&#10;&#10;In stock rounds players can invest in other players' companies or in the Stadtbahn, which can also be used by the various tramway lines to exercise special powers.&#10;&#10;1840 uses the basic concept of all 18xx games, but offers quite a few innovations, like all-Diesel trains from the beginning on, that do not become obsolete, but have reduced income as they grow older.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player also receives five bonus points and one pawn, which is placed on the track.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns with some elements being similar to Burkhardt's own Kupferkessel Co. At the start of his turn, the player rolls the die and moves his pawn forward on the track as many spaces as the number rolled. By expending bonus points, the player may move his pawn further. Then, the player must place one building block on the board in the column or row corresponding to the space on the track where his pawn is located. If he now has the building blocks needed to support one of his platforms, he may place that platform on top of the building blocks. If he does so, he gains an amount of money (Casa Grande Lire) based on the size of the platform and the level at which it was built.&#10;&#10;After a platform has been added, building blocks may be added on top of the platform. If another player builds on top of your platform, you gain a number of bonus points. You also gain bonus points if your pawn ends its move on a corner (in which you don't get to place a building block). If a player accumulates nine or more bonus points, he receives nine Casa Grande Lire, but loses the bonus points.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the round in which a player has placed his last building block. The player who has collected the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zero Leader is based on the Corsair Leader game, with some significant changes. The game focuses on commanding and managing a Japanese aerial squadron in the Pacific in World War Two, with aircraft including the A6M2 Zero, KI-84 Frank, KI-43 Oscar, G4M Betty, and G3M Nell, covering the major campaigns throughout the war from 1941 to 1945.&#10;&#10;You will need to select the right mix of aircraft under your command in order to successfully carry out the different types of missions. Each aircraft has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, a fighter like the Zero is very maneuverable and deadly to enemy Bandits, but it has limited ability to attack naval and ground targets, whereas a bomber like the Betty can carry a lot of munitions, but are susceptible to enemy bandit and anti-aircraft attacks.&#10;&#10;This game also includes additional aspects of Japanese operations such as mechanical and maintenance challenges, invoking samurai spirit, as well as the ability to deploy the deadly Ohka kamikaze aircraft-bombs. There is also an air combat system which gives you more tactical options when dogfighting with enemy aircraft, including manuevering for position, increasing pilot aggression and being affected by the robustness of the aircraft.&#10;&#10;Like the other games in the &quot;Leader&quot; series, Zero Leader is a solitaire game. Included in the core box:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 x Mounted Display 20&quot;x15&quot;&#10;     1 x Mounted Dogfight Chart&#10;     11 x Counter Sheets (88 counters per sheet)&#10;     15 x Campaign Sheets&#10;     4 x Player Help Sheets&#10;         2 x single-sided sheets&#10;         2 x double-sided sheets&#10;    &#10;    386 x Cards (2.5&rdquo; x 3.5&rdquo;)&#10;         18 x Frank aircraft cards&#10;         36 x Zero aircraft cards&#10;         36 x Zeke aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Kate aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Jill aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Val aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Emily aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Jack aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Tojo aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Sonia aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Tony aircraft cards&#10;         18 x George aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Oscar aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Betty aircraft cards&#10;         18 x Nell aircraft cards&#10;         5 x Frank &quot;Trainee&quot; aircraft cards&#10;         30 x Event cards&#10;         45 x Target cards&#10;    &#10;     2 x 10-sided Dice&#10;     1 x Player Log Sheet&#10;     1 x Rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Along cracks in the ocean floor, plumes of black and white superheated water pump relentlessly into the depths. They provide precious heat to the near freezing abyssal waters of the deep as well as a bounty of minerals. Microscopic archaea and other extremophiles live off the heat and minerals to form the base of a unique food chain that hosts a variety of exotic deep sea creatures.&#10;&#10;In Deep Vents, players each control their own hydrothermal ecosystem to which they add new life and geological features each turn, competing to survive in the unforgiving depths by being efficient and preying on nearby systems with a host of strange and deadly predators.&#10;&#10;Start each turn by drafting a tile from the five on display &mdash; placing one archaeon, the currency of the game &mdash; on each tile you skip. Place this tile adjacent to each other tile in your ecosystem, then either grow or trigger each tile in your ecosystem, moving through them from top to bottom, left to right, and growing or triggering them individually as you like. When you grow a tile, you place archaea on it, whether a set amount or a varying number depending on other tiles in your ecosystem; when you trigger a tile, you remove archaea from it to carry out its unique effect: attacking opponents, gaining shells to defend against attacks, moving archaea to your personal supply, and decimating tiles, which leaves them as nothing but a heat source for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;If you ever need to discard archaea due to an attack and cannot do so, you must take a shortfall token and ten archaea, then discard archaea as needed. On your turn, you can pay ten archaea to remove a shortfall token &mdash; which you want to do because as long as you have one, you can draft only the first tile on display. If you end your turn with two shortfall tokens, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends if only one player remains in play (with that player winning) or after eight rounds, with players scoring points for archaea and shells in reserve and archaea on tiles. In this case, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Similar to Magic: The Gathering in many ways, except there are no &quot;lands&quot; or similar methods of generating magical power.  Instead, players siphon power from their Magi or their monsters to perform attacks or put cards into play, thus controlling just how many powerful cards a player can attempt to unleash in a single turn. (in essence, you must sacrifice your own creatures to fuel more powerful attacks and techniques).  The game was meant to target an audience of those that felt Pokemon was too much a kids game, but not ready to jump into the highly competitive (and 'older' target audience) of Magic: The Gathering.  The concept also spawned a not-so-successful cartoon series and Game Boy Color video game.  Starter decks include all the required counters, a six-sided die, quick reference player aids, and a play mat.&#10;&#10;",

Everything points to an accident, but Kaiser is sure there is more to it. As private detectives, you all investigate a real crime case together!&#10;&#10;One thing is clear: this calls for true pros. To find the murderer, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.&#10;&#10;As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone with which you can receive text messages. It is also helpful (but not absolutely necessary) if you have a laptop or tablet at hand. Mobile phones are also allowed!&#10;&#10;You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day.&#10;You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another.

They try to attract new customers, making sure they can serve them in time, increasing their fortune and fame at the same time.&#10;&#10;Of course, this is easier said than done as many things can go wrong while trying to serve a customer: People change their minds, orders go wrong and restaurant owners try to sabotage each other.&#10;&#10;Can you become the most successful Greek restaurant owner?&#10;&#10;Souvlaki Wars is a light family card game for 2-4 players. Players draft new customers and try to serve them with food cards they draw at the beginning of each turn. This way they earn the money and the reputation each customer represents. However, before they have a chance to do so, cards with &quot;Unforeseen Events&quot; are played by every player, affecting the game in many different ways like altering the order in lines, adding more customers, decreasing the opponent's reputation etc. And of course, each player has to take into consideration that the customers are served on a first-come basis. If someone's order can't be fulfilled, everyone behind him will have to wait another turn...&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a certain level of money and reputation is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is going to be published by the Greek company &quot;Kaissa Chess &amp; Games&quot; during 2011. It is going to be bilingual, having text both in Greek and English. Its international debut will be at the 2011 Spiel Essen fair.&#10;&#10;- Winner of BGG's Greek Guild's 1st Game Design Contest in the category: &quot;Best Game&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(While this game is sometimes called by the same name, it is not to be confused with Chinese Poker.)&#10;&#10;There is a family of card games known as climbing games.  There are climbing games with many variants throughout the world and known by many names(Choh Dai Di, Chinese Poker, Kings and Asses, Scum, President, Dilbert's Corporate Shuffle, etc.).  Big Two is one popular variant.  Each player starts with a hand of cards and the object is to be the first to get rid of all your cards by playing combinations.  The game consists of playing combinations of cards: single cards, pairs, three of a kind, and traditional poker hands (straights, flushes, etc.).  When a player plays a combination, only a combination of that type can beat it - you must play a pair to beat a pair for instance.  Big Two has a sizable luck element but there is room for skillful play as the players learn how to best manage the cards they are dealt. Best with four players, but still fun with two and three.&#10;&#10;",

A clear and concise summary of each expansion does not currently exist that points out duplication.&#10;&#10;",

If you capture enough, you will reach the rank of gods' chosen One! But beware for Charon the terrible roams and will by all means try to make you take a one way trip to Hell!&#10;&#10;During the game, the players must bluff in order to win the Amphora cards which represent the most interesting creatures. When your turn comes, offer an Amphora card to another player. They can accept it, or refuse it by offering it to another player. Collect Amphora cards in order to be the first to reach the number of points required. But be careful, if you get three Charon cards, you lose the round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;Players start each round with 5 cards in their hands.&#10;The game takes place in a undetermined number of rounds, until one of the three game-end conditions is met.&#10;The player who has the first player pawn chooses a card in her hand of cards and offers it by putting it face down in front of another player of her choice.&#10;If the card offered is a Creature card, she must say out loud the number of the card without lying.&#10;If the card offered is a Charon card, she can (and should) lie by saying out loud any number she wishes.&#10;The player who gets the card has 3 choices:&#10;- He accepts the card before looking at it, and then places it face up in front of him.&#10;- He refuses the card without looking at it. It returns to the player who offered it, and she places it face up in front of herself.&#10;- He adds a card from his hand, face down, and offers the two cards to another player. He is only allowed to lie about the Charon cards by announcing the number he chooses.&#10;In this third case, the player who receives the two cards has the same choices. &#10;Cards cannot be offered to a player who has already been offered cards in this round, nor to the player with the First player pawn. The last player must either accept or refuse the cards offered.&#10;Then a new round starts, the first player pawn moves to the left and players draw cards from the deck to refill their hands to 5 cards.&#10;Having a 1 card, a 2 card and a 3 card in front of you gives you 10 bonus points (=16 points).&#10;Players who have three Charon cards in front of them are sent to Hell and are eliminated from the game.&#10;The player whose Creature cards reaches or exceeds the number of points required, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Owner's Choice is an economic game in which the players must look to manipulate the stocks of four companies whilst trying to buy low and sell high. The player that owns the most stock in a company assumes the role of the President, with other players assuming the role of investors.&#10;&#10;The game's length and which company may have the opportunity to progress each turn is dictated by a pawn that moves around the board. The players have some control over how many spaces the pawn can move in each turn, and the kind of space it lands on allows for a variety of things to happen. Most commonly one of the companies is selected, at which point the president may either contribute to the communal Fund in order to roll the company's die, potentially paying dividends to all stock-holders or changing the company's stock price, or may instead choose to raid the Fund for personal gain but with the potential to reduce the company's stock price.&#10;&#10;Owners have greater control over the fortunes of their companies' stock and they can make great profits, however prices can go down as well as up! The companies have different characters, represented by a different mix of faces on the company die that is rolled when the company is selected on a turn and the President contributes to the Fund. As the game unfolds the players must decide how best to make money and potentially undermine some companies to reduce the fortunes of their competition.&#10;&#10;Once the pawn reaches the Goal square, all stocks are cashed in for their current prices and then the player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Join this expedition, and you will have the unforgettable opportunity to explore Sumatra, from the top of its majestic volcanoes to the depths of its tropical rainforest. Find the most exotic animals and the most exuberant flowers, and discover the endless variety of cultures that coexist on the largest island in Indonesia. Your expedition sets out with the mission of writing a travel notebook that will help raise awareness of one of the richest ecosystems in the world. Whoever makes the best contribution to this exciting mission will win.&#10;&#10;In Sumatra, players move around the island to explore its multiple landscapes. On a turn, your possible actions depend on where you're located in relation to the travel notebook token that starts the game in base camp with all the players:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If you're one space behind the token, you move to the notebook's space and end your turn.&#10;    If you're on the same location as the token, either you move ahead one space or you stay put, take a tile from the pool of &quot;available information&quot; tiles, and add it to your personal notebook.&#10;    If you're one space ahead of the token, you move the token to your space, move all the &quot;available information&quot; tiles to the &quot;known information&quot; pool, draw tiles from the bag equal to the number shown at your location, add those tiles to the pool of &quot;available information&quot;, then take one of these new tiles and add it to your notebook.&#10;&#10;&#10;Thus, you're catching up with the group, researching with the group to add info to your notebook, moving ahead, or digging into new tiles ahead of everyone else.&#10;&#10;Tiles score and have effects in various ways, for example, with players gaining or losing points for meeting the most or fewest inhabitants. Flora and fauna tiles score only if you have a pair in a column, but only the highest-valued of this pair scores. Villages score only if you have more pairs of reception and GPS tiles than the number of villages, while the reception and GPS pairs net you no points, but allow you to get a tile from the pool of &quot;known information&quot;. Equipment makes it safe to explore volcanoes on the island, and if you don't have enough equipment, you might lose other tiles you've collected.&#10;&#10;Sumatra also includes badges that players can collect. Be the first to collect, say, three flora tiles or a combination of two inhabitant and two craft tiles, and you can claim the badge for this, which is worth 3 points at game's end. You can also claim one diversity badge for having at least one tile in at least six rows of your notebook. The more rows you have a presence in, the higher the value of the diversity badge, but you can claim at most one during the game &mdash; and if someone else claims the six-row badge, then you'll need to have a tile in at least seven rows for the next one...&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&Uacute;nete a esta expedici&oacute;n y descubre Sumatra desde la cima de sus majestuosos volcanes hasta las profundidades de su selva. Encuentra los animales m&aacute;s ex&oacute;ticos, las flores m&aacute;s exuberantes y conoce la interminable variedad de culturas que conviven en la isla m&aacute;s grande de Indonesia. La expedici&oacute;n parte con la misi&oacute;n de escribir un cuaderno de viaje que ayude a dar a conocer uno de los ecosistemas m&aacute;s ricos del mundo. Aquel que contribuya en mayor medida a esta apasionante misi&oacute;n se alzar&aacute; con la victoria.&#10;&#10;En Sumatra, los jugadores se ir&aacute;n desplazando por la isla para explorar sus m&uacute;ltiples parajes.

    "Description": "Divinus is a competitive, legacy, tile-laying, digital hybrid game in which you play as a demigod seeking to gain the favor of the Gods and ascend to a new pantheon. Players embark on a twelve-scenario campaign that will see them exploring lands, completing quests, interacting with Gods, and impacting the outcome of the epic clash between Greek and Norse pantheons.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each campaign scenario, players open a sealed box of new quests, components, stickers, Gods, gameplay mechanisms, and more. The Divinus app provides a narrative for players and sets the stakes for what is to come. Each turn, players spend dice from their pool to explore new tiles from the world board. Laying tiles into their demigod map, they must place tiles adjacent to one another and with matching features while working towards overall quest and God goals.&#10;&#10;Throughout the campaign, players make permanent changes to their demigods by collecting powerful artifacts, forging their dice by altering their faces, and earning titles for the feats they achieve. Players will also permanently change the game world by altering tiles and placing new locations, heroes, and monsters onto the map tiles. When players complete quests or other significant goals, they can make pivotal decisions through the Divinus app.&#10;&#10;Players will decide the outcome of dilemmas such as choosing which side is victorious in battle, building or destroying a holy site, and choosing whether a God lives or dies. Whichever outcome the player chooses, the game components may be changed and the Divinus app will remember and present contextual options in the future that are impacted by the decision. Returning to a fort that you helped the Norse Gods build could see you praised, while demigods favored by the Greek pantheon could be shunned.&#10;&#10;The Divinus campaign is ideally played over several game sessions due to the persistent and changing world. The rulebook grows with each scenario as new rules and content are unlocked. Once the campaign is complete, players can replay their unique copy of Divinus with a post-campaign Infinite Replayability mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players work together to survive in a remote cabin, at the center of the board, against waves of the undead that close in from the edges of the board. If the players can hold out, survivors bring pieces of the radio needed to call for rescue. Once rescue arrives, it's up to each player to leave the safety of the cabin and make it out alive!&#10;&#10;To fight the zombies, players use cabin cards, some of which are weapons that help players attack zombies at a distance or in hand-to-hand combat. If characters take too many injuries during combat, they die and return to the game as a zombie with customized rules as a member of the undead! Other cabin cards are items, which give the players various benefits and a better chance at survival. The supply of items and weapons is limited, however. Once the cabin deck is exhausted, it is not reshuffled. A separate deck of cards, called event cards, allow the zombies to have their turn. This deck not only brings a variety of zombies into play but each card also has a special effect when drawn.&#10;&#10;Can you survive Dead Panic?&#10;&#10;",

Bonus reputation points can also be earned by building relationships with specific fences.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, the player with the highest reputation is the new crime lord of the town.&#10;&#10;",

You've made your mournful public statement (&quot;tragic day,&quot; etc), and now you're ready to hatch your devious plot to steal the newly vacant Supreme Seat and claim Absolute Power for yourself. You only need to outmaneuver your fellow ministers - but they're a heap of low-watt gizmos, how hard could that be? Let the machinations begin!&#10;&#10;Power Vacuum is a 1-5 player trick-taking game with some treacherous twists. The game is played over several rounds, and in each round players use tricks to adjust the Power levels of other players to work toward their hidden Agenda cards. Power is gained by winning tricks with the highest number of the led suit, but it is also gained, lost, and exchanged between players through shrewd use of the Control Board, which is manipulated by the player of the lowest card of ANY suit. If at the round's end you have fulfilled your Agenda card, successfully picking the players with the most and/or least amount of Power, you get a large bonus payout. End-of-round points are exchanged for pieces of a great statue you are building to yourself. The first player to complete their statue becomes the next Supreme Appliance!&#10;&#10;Power Vacuum is not about winning every trick, but choosing the right card at the right time to engineer the rise or fall of your opponents in the short term so that you can profit the most in the long term. Additionally, each card's suit is visible on the back side, reducing the need to count your opponent's cards, so you can focus instead on the most cunning move - but watch out for Spies, the fifth suit hiding amongst the other four which will trump the trump suit. In this game, timing is everything.&#10;&#10;Power abhors a vacuum - will you plug it?!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
