The opportunity is here: it&rsquo;s time for you to run this town, but you aren&rsquo;t the only one trying to do so. If you keep yourself safe and your enemies at bay, the city will be yours&hellip;&#10;&#10;Crimewave is a 2-6 player card game played in a series of rounds, each representing an instance of an ongoing turf war in Denton City.&#10;&#10;In each round, players earn points by using the abilities of their cards or by having the card with the highest value once the draw deck is empty. On their turn, players draw a card and discard a card, resolving the card's effect as necessary.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player has accumulated enough points, that player is declared Crime Lord of the city, allowing them to bask in the glory of their underworld power. We expect a full game of Crimewave to take 15 minutes per player, but players can also play to a higher point limit or even to a time limit instead.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Get ready to set sail!&#10;&#10;Gundalow Kids is a simpler (but no less enjoyable) version of the Gundalow board game.  Kids and parents will sail back into historical New England as captains of their own gundalows - flat-bottomed sailboats historically used for transporting cargo.&#10;&#10;Players start the game in one of six towns in the Seacoast region near Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Each town has its own unique market of available and wanted goods, drawn from a deck of market cards.  Players load goods onto their gundalows and then roll a die to sail to other towns.  Event cards come into play when players land on the event squares on the game board. Event cards offer new challenges, opportunities, and rewards to players, as well as potential changes to the town markets.&#10;&#10;Players earn money by successfully delivering goods to the towns before the other players.  Exotic goods, such as spices and cotton, are worth more than locally-produced goods, but players need to make the long journey downriver to Portsmouth to access the more valuable commodities.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is for the players to deliver the goods needed by each town, and the game will end when each of the wanted goods spaces in the town markets is filled.  The player who earns the most money wins the game!&#10;&#10;For advanced players, the game also includes variants, including an option that provides honorary titles to the players who deliver the most of each good.  With the rich variety of market and event cards, each game of Gundalow Kids is unique.  The game provides an enjoyable window into the rich history of the Seacoast region.&#10;&#10;",

Now, a magical wave of greed controls your mind and the only thing that matters is getting the gnome's pot of gold at any cost, so you must guide yourself from the correct signs on the way to get it.&#10;&#10;Play different signal cards on the correct path when the time is right and if it pairs with another matching card, you get them all. This will cause you to have a lot of cards in your play area (a lot, and it feels strange and satisfying!), but you will need even more to be able to complete the positive sets and avoid the negative ones, and then save those cards in the only safe place where no one can take them away: your chest. But be careful, you should also be aware of the right time to save them, because bad things can happen if you save too soon, if you miss the perfect opportunity or if you accidentally complete negative sets, if you run out of coins or if someone uses magic cards against you ... And if the latter happens, don't worry ... maybe you can get revenge sooner than you think and with twice the strength.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are two decks of cards: Bug Cards (bacteria and syndromes) and Drug Cards (antibiotics). Each player uses Drug Cards to slay Bug Cards which slowly fill up a 3 x 3 playing area. If you successfully match an effective Drug to a susceptible Bug you get to keep matching and killing more. If you fail, play moves on to the next player, and the Bug Card may become more resistant. Each drug has its own side effects and flora costs, though, so choose your Drug Cards wisely. Guess wrong too many times and the 3 x 3 playing area will be overwhelmed. If that happens you lose a life. Game ends when either the players survive the Bug Card onslaught and complete the Bug Card deck or all players lose all their lives.&#10;&#10;Solo and versus modes, varying levels of difficulty, and expert scoring options are also available.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

During the month, bosses can hire workers or build obedient robots.

There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States has collapsed &mdash; and now, thirty years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control of the ruined country, try to establish a new order, try to control others and create a new country, a new state: the 51st state.&#10;&#10;In this card game, players control one of the four powers &mdash; Mutants, Traders, New Yorkers and Appalachians &mdash; and try to build their own new country. Players put new locations into the game, hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills.&#10;&#10;Every card in 51st State can be put into play three ways: you can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill. One card, three possibilities. Lots of decisions and choices that matter.&#10;&#10;The Gamefound edition also comes with all of the mini-expansions and promos released prior to 2022, component upgrades, and a fictional story set in the Neuroshima world. In more detail, with this edition, you have eight factions available for play instead of four, a dedicated neoprene playmat for the No Man's Land expansion, engraved wooden markers, and many promos that expand the game even more.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players place 6 tiles (1-6) white side up on the lower row of their tableau. Then the players take turns rolling the die. After each roll the player may take the white tile with the rolled number from the tableau of his right neighbor and places it red side up on the upper row of his own tableau if he has the complimentary white tile on his lower row. If not he places it white side up on his lower row. If a player already has both tiles, the new tile is placed white side up on his own white tile. Red tiles are safe and may never be taken.&#10;&#10;If A player has at least 4 red tiles he may take white tiles from any player. If a player has only one white tile left, and has not the corresponding red tile he may place the tile red side up on his upper row without rolling a die.&#10;&#10;The first player with 6 red tiles wins the game.&#10;&#10;Rule printed inside box cover.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For many centuries there was peace in the four great kingdoms and life in the lands was simple and carefree. One day, however, unfriendly and warlike tribes appeared from the lands beyond the horizon and brought danger to the four kingdoms. The four rulers decided together to protect the people from the evil invaders and bring them into the cities. However, because the cities were too small and unsafe, they were first to be enlarged and expanded. Defensive towers, churches and a city wall were to be built around the stately palace, which was also to be newly erected. And so the great builders of the world were commissioned to plan and implement the buildings for the kingdom of the mountain lands in the north, the kingdom of the sun in the east, the desert kingdom in the south and the kingdom of the forest peoples in the west. In order to get all this done in time before a possible attack by the enemy tribes, the builders gather people from all walks of life - from peasants to princes - to help and cooperate from the lands. Each person is given his or her task, which must be completed exactly according to plan and order.&#10;&#10;You and your fellow players slip into the role of these master builders. Everyone tries to place all their cards with the helping citizens on the building sites before all the other players. Act wisely and strategically as a master builder and you may become the greatest master builder of the four kingdoms...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, you draw two cards - and history repeats.&#10;&#10;Deeldoes must start with a base, end with a head, and have at least a body part in it. There is no limit to the Deeldo composition - more the colors, more the fun, after all - but remember that there are combos that can bring you more points. Vibrating and studded Deeldoes give you more points, just like color-matching toys.&#10;&#10;When a player has completed their 3rd Deeldo, or when cards are finished, the game is over. The player with the highest score wins, and gets the chance to start the following match. The one with the lower score, instead, wears the Crown of the Loser.

Between one and eight players work together to defeat the Foreverot before it can unleash untold suffering upon the Spiral of Worlds. The players win or lose as one--there are no victory points to tally or secret agendas to work towards.&#10;&#10;Each player will have a Role Card that gives them special abilities to aid in their efforts, and each world has a limited number of enigmatic guardian dragons that might be employed to help fend off Warlords and Obliviates.&#10;&#10;Players will travel from world to world gathering resources and making occasional forays into Nur to discard Rot Tokens until all eight of those tokens have been discarded and the heroes emerge victorious. But things are never quite that easy, are they? Gathering resources is made more difficult by the presence of maniacal Warlords that seek to destroy key locations on each world and malevolent Obliviates--scouts for the Foreverot--that block the heroes' efforts wherever they can. The same resources that are used to stop the Rot must also be used to vanquish Warlords and Obliviates, making for tough choices in each and every round of play. And the clock is always against you.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round of play, the current First Player will roll a die in a grim responsibility we call the Foreverot Roll. This die will determine whether or not the Rot advances in its own schemes, wreaking havoc across the game. If those schemes advance too far--if all of the Foreverot Cards on Nur are played--the Rot will win. But even if the die roll is kind and a new Foreverot Card is not played, damage will be visited upon worlds and Warlords will continue in their inexorable march, bringing ruin to whatever lies in their path.&#10;&#10;In about an hour, the fate of the 8 worlds can be decided... but in the quest to forge the Spiralchain, almost anything can happen!&#10;&#10;",

Ultimately, the family with the most social status, wealth, popularity, and provincial control is declared the winner. To gain supremacy you must ensure that statesmen affiliated with your family wage successful military campaigns, govern prosperous provinces, control key industries, and implement effective political reforms.&#10;&#10;Julii is a 2-4 player game that starts in 264 BC at the outbreak of the 1st Punic War and ends with the turmoil and civil wars of the late 1st Century BC. A full game is played over 10 turns, with each turn representing approximately 20-25 years. Several scenarios are included introducing shorter game duration and modified winning conditions.&#10;&#10;",
