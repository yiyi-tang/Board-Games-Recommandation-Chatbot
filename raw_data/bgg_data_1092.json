Gameplay is easy to pick up, as players perform one action on their turn before play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Spells are cast by focusing on the elements (playing an element card on the table in front of the player) and then playing a spell card.  Focusing on an element counts as the player's action for that turn.  Spells which affect the field of play are drawn throughout the course of the game.&#10;&#10;The first player to cast 2 Master Spells will be crowned champion and win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to be the first Crook to get into a specified number of Prisons.  But it&rsquo;s not as easy as you might think!  To get into Prison, you have to get arrested by a Policeman and then sentenced by a Judge.  To get arrested, be on a Crime Square at the same time as a Policeman.   When arrested, you will be sent to THE CELLS, ready for trial by the next Judge who comes round the Circuit.&#10;&#10;If you are found Guilty, you will generally be sent to Prison.  But which one you&rsquo;re sent to depends on the Crime and the Judge who tries you.  You stay in Prison until you have served your sentence and get to Released! or Remission, or you escape, or are let out because of something another player does.  Sometimes, of course, you are found Not Guilty, or are put on Probation, or sent for Re-Trial (probably by a different Judge).&#10;&#10;Actions by other players can upset your careful plans, though.

    "Description": "Field of Victory is a unique game in so much as it has trimmed off much of that which leads up to a battle and left the battle itself.   Rather than maneuvering into an engagement, units maneuver within the engagement.  The game makes no attempt to simulate the myriad minutiae of a Napoleonic battle but rather focuses on a compact nucleus of primary details essential to the period.  This gives the game flavor without overwhelming the main ingredient, fun.&#10;&#10;The battlefield consists of a series of terrain cards upon which either randomly selected or purchased units maneuver and fight.&#10;&#10;Commanders may be chosen from a historically rated list or randomly created.&#10;&#10;A wide variety of unit types have their own combat ratings that are representative of the parent nation.  Stats for France, Britain, Russia, Prussia and Austria are included.&#10;&#10;Each game assumes the starting point of 2 armies which have made contact.  To win, simply clear the enemy from one of three separate lanes. Numerous modifiers reward support and combined arms among other things.&#10;&#10;Combat is based on a 2D10/100 percentile engine that first determines if you hit and then determines the effect which can include: disorder, rout, or elimination.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include random events and more.&#10;&#10;With less than 6 pages of rules and a readily graspable system, you will be commanding an army in no time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nova Solis... The legendary home of the Ancients...&#10;&#10;A tiny pocket reality containing untold treasures untouched since the Ancients&rsquo; departure from our universe.&#10;&#10;When a functioning gate was first discovered it became a race for the great races of the galaxy to be the first to mount an expedition and claim the riches of Nova Solis. In our greed we did not stop to consider why the Ancients abandoned Nova Solis until we encountered the Entity...&#10;&#10;Its attacks came from out of nowhere and decimated our defenses... Great fleets of ships made from shadow pouring out of enormous tears in the fabric of space.&#10;&#10;Its power is growing and the black hole is becoming more active... Even worse, many of the stars near the Nova Solis gate are becoming unstable... We have to get out of here but we can&rsquo;t let this thing enter into our universe... Our only hope is to recover the ancient knowledge and to seal it inside!&#10;&#10;&#10;Nova Solis is a 4X (eXpand, eXplore, eXploit, eXterminate) space and resource management game for 1 to 6 players. The game is a hybrid blend of thematic gameplay with Euro mechanics and may be played in the following modes:&#10;&#10;Survival - Where the players must work together to flee the entity or be destroyed.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Standard - The player who gains the most victory points is the overall winner.&#10;     Co-Op - Players work together as a group and no player combat is allowed.&#10;     Solo - A single player controlling 2-6 races against the entity.&#10;&#10;&#10;Exploration - Where the players compete against each another to claim the most victory points&#10;&#10;Players choose 1 of 6 asymmetrical empires to lead their expedition each with their own unique technology focuses and secret objectives. During the game the players will scan and explore stars placing them onto the modular board to obtain empire bonuses and strategic resources. These in turn are used to power the various technologies.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the players will be attacked by the AI controlled Entity which grows stronger as the game proceeds. Left unchecked it will eventually consume the players in a supernova explosion. To defeat the Entity, the players must obtain enough victory points and ancient artifacts while combating its forces.  Combat makes use of a highly strategic dice face-building mechanic allowing players to customize their forces over time.&#10;&#10;Because in survival games each player accumulates their own set of victory points while contributing to the overall total required to defeat the Entity, Nova Solis gives each player a reason to play independently of the group-think that plagues other games with cooperative mechanics. Of course the players can still play cooperatively if desired or settle into exploration mode for a more standard 4X romp.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;&#10;     Finalist at UKGE 2018 Wyvern's lair competition&#10;     Finalist Board Game Design Lab - Design Challenge!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A single woolf might be beatable but together they form a howling pack. Before you know it, you are dragged into a world of choices, chance, speed, agility and above all: lots of fun!&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;The goal of the game is simple: The player who has the least blood alcohol content (bac) points when the game ends, wins. The game ends when all cards are face up.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;STEP 1: Gather some friends and take a seat. Clear the table.&#10;STEP 2: Make sure everyone has a glass and fill this glass with a drink of choice.&#10;STEP 3: Spread all cards on the table face down.&#10;The youngest player starts the game by turning a card of choice face up. Turns go clockwise until all cards are face up.&#10;Watch out here comes the pack!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Conga Mummies is a simple grid movement game for one to four players.  Each player controls a &quot;mummy&quot; token that moves about the board, square-by-square, as desired.  The gridded board is laid out roughly to approximate a humanoid form.  Players start in the &quot;head&quot; grid and then move to specific squares in each &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;foot&quot; to collect canopic jars containing organs.  All four embalmed organs (stomach, intestines, liver, and lungs) are required for the mummy to reach the afterlife.  The first player to recover all four of the needed organs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each grid square has a random chance (25%) of containing a beast; this is determined when the first character moves into the square.  Beasts, if encountered, must be defeated to proceed.  Individual mummies can take damage and be destroyed (the player loses and drops out of the game).&#10;&#10;The primary innovation of the game involves player movement.  Players must move in a &quot;conga line&quot; pattern, following exactly in the leader's footsteps, but one to three squares behind (depending on how many players there are).  The line leader makes all decisions and performs all combat.  If desired, the line leader can yield their position (when low on health, for example) and move to the back of the line.  Alternately, each player can cast three &quot;compel&quot; spells during the game.  Each &quot;compel&quot; spell forces the leader to move to the back of the line.&#10;&#10;The basic strategy is to remain at the back of the line (in safety) through the first three organ collections then to move (and remain) in the lead position for the final organ collection (thus, winning).&#10;&#10;The game supports single-player play, though this becomes simply an exercise of trying to move and survive to the end, rather than managing the &quot;conga line&quot; strategy.&#10;&#10;The game is provided as a four-page, print-and-play PDF document containing the rules and the game board.  It was distributed for free from various online sites.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

SUMMONED is a party card game that contains a full back-story that puts the players into the game themselves. All players will start with a set of Curse Cards that players will use throughout the whole game. These cards contain Dares that the &ldquo;Victims&rdquo; (non-active players) can choose to complete or pass on.

That starts out with a drunken friend who decided to wander off into a friend&rsquo;s house. They find an Ouija board with etched words written on it. While they try to read these words they accidentally summons a Devil. The Devil was not a fan of being awoken, so he gave the drunken friend a curse that starts turning them into a Demon. To make things worse the only way to get rid of this curse is to get another person to perform actions from cards. Those were provided to the friend by the Devil himself. Players are able to bring their Demon characters to life while they are the active player. Being the active player you will use your Cards to pick off your Victims one by one. Trying to reduce the number of cards they have in their hand. Victim players in turn, will try their best to successfully complete these actions on the cards.

    "Description": "Neolithic: Warfare Before the Beginning of Time is a very simple wargame designed for small numbers (six to ten per side) of opposing units using non-metallic and simple weapons and armors.  Units are either various types of humans or animals.  Each unit typically has some specific single quality (e.g., a Spearman has a very high morale level, etc.).  The game is limited to two opposing forces; players alternate taking turns.  Checks in the game (morale, hit, etc.) are made using one or two ten-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Units represent single combatants.  Morale checks are made for each unit under several circumstances; failed checks lead first to degraded morale, then to rout.  Movement is given in inches, and units may walk, run, or charge.  Rout (flee) movement is given in random inches.  During a turn, missile fire precedes m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and effects take place immediately (this gives considerable advantage to the player that moves first in the game).  Units sustaining damage can be killed or captured.&#10;&#10;The game does not use scale and any &quot;small&quot; figures (generally, miniatures or tokens) may be used.&#10;&#10;A player loses when all of their units are killed, captured, or routed.  Alternately, the players can agree upon victory conditions prior to the game (typically capturing specific units or routing a certain number of units to represent area control).&#10;&#10;The game was provided as a downloadable PDF document, and at one time also was hosted online in HTML format.&#10;&#10;&mdash;User Summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Unsolved Mysteries: El Ancora de Fuego is an adventure, survival, mistery and terror game for 1 or 2 players that takes place in Japan in 1902.&#10;&#10;It's 2018. William Carter is a Brooklyn detective who reopens and investigates unsolved cases, whose evidence was sinister and inconclusive or potentially supernatural. In his current case several mental patients escaped from an asylum and subsequently disappeared without a trace. Everything becomes darker as the investigation goes deeper and he finds evidence that the Y&ouml;kai, demonic spirits and shadows, live amongst us. The players will be the protagonists of Carter's 1902 unsolved case and will join him on his journey through the darkness to discover the truth.&#10;&#10;All the decisions made throughout the adventure will influence the development and the end of it. The game is designed to be played several times, since in a single game you can&rsquo;t discover all its content. The players will choose two characters at the beggining from the three initials, being the story different according to who they play it with and unlocking other characters as the story goes on.&#10;&#10;Each chapter of Unsolved Mysteries: El Ancora de Fuego is played on a board, using cards to represent places, interactions, objects and Y&ouml;kai, and six special dices whose result when thrown will determine the possible options to be made, each of them will be read in the adventure book. During their turn, players can explore and interact with their surroundings, move to other locations, use objects and defend themselves or flee from the Y&ouml;kai that will appear. Players should keep in mind their mental state, because the darkness lurks and they may fall into a nightmarish state in which their true personality is revealed. And when death comes, they can use the scarce Destiny Markers to avoid it ... temporarily.&#10;&#10;The story goes through several chapters, some of them optional and secret, more than five endings, more than 300 different interactions and more than 50 different proofs to find.&#10;&#10;Come and confront your fears in Unsolved Mysteries: El Ancora de Fuego!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you want to be the first compiling and building your program, you will need big doses of caffeine, some undocumented shortcuts and maybe a few pokes. Obfuscate the code by hardcoding not-easy-to-remove constants and try to distract your peer with pizza... But, what if your program does not &quot;exactly&quot; fits the requirements? Well, let's see if we can sell this little bug as a brand new feature.&#10;&#10;Peer Programming is an anti-cooperative game of software development for two players. &#10;The players take the role of software developers who want to write a pretty simple code which just prints a sequence of 6 characters on console. The source code is shared by both players but the requirements are different for each. The players take actions to modify the shared code towards meeting their requirements. The first player to make the shared code print the character sequence in his requirements wins the game.&#10;&#10;The shared code is built using a tile placement mechanic based on the logic of code statements such as FOR loops, IF and PRINT. A player can draw motivation cards each time the shared code gets closer to meet his requirements (in the &quot;compile&quot; phase). These cards give one-turn special powers breaking the risk of stalemate and adding a fun thematic variation (distracting your opponent with pizza, asking for help in Stack Overflow, obfuscating the code...).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Experience? LOOT?&#10;Players take on one of the 6 elemental playstyles. The Martial Knight, The Holy Priest, the Nature Druid, the Clockwork Gunslinger, the Shadow Necromancer, or the Arcane Mage are playable characters in the base game. And don't let that stop you from playing the way you want to play! Earn access to other classes through XP gain and continue to defeat wave after wave of enemy.&#10;&#10;The game is a tactical exploration adventure where the players play cards to attack monsters. Each card played goes into a cooldown row to be used later, or the player can burn their highly coveted bits to cool them down faster. Through exploration, the players will reveal monster spawner tiles in search of the exit tile. Once the players decide to exit the dungeon they must face the second level, full of harder monsters and better loot. After exiting that level, the dungeon's boss must be defeated if the players wish to keep the loot they've gained thus far. If the players die at any time, they lose their gear and can try again.&#10;&#10;The base game comes with (at least) two dungeons that are different each time you play. Completing a dungeon will allow you to purchase more gear for another run.&#10;&#10;Honestly, we're still playtesting the hell out of this game, so everything here is subject to wild changes. Including the theme. I'm not 100% sold on fantasy.&#10;&#10;",

The main objective is to get rid of your own cards.&#10;&#10;Blindsight is easy to learn as the basics are all about playing adjacent numbers and alternating the colours. You have to continue playing until there are no more cards to play, unless you can find a way to end your turn early. Which helps as you are trying to empty your own hand. When playing Blindsight in a group you will immediately notice there are always an extra pairs of eyes monitoring your every move, this give the game a cooperative feel.&#10;&#10;There are four types of special cards in the game; they all have their own unique and usually quite surprising effect on the game. Cards that might help you the first time; can turn against you the next time you play them.&#10;&#10;With the regular game play there are three additional variations to play. You can increase the difficulty by bringing the symbols found on the cards into play. Or you can play a last man standing variation in which you are trying to get rid of the opponents' cards instead of your own. Or combine both variations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
