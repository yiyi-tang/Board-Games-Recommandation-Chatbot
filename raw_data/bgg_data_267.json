    "Description": "From Rick Thornquist (BoardGameNews.com)&#10;&#10;This is a card game where players are promoting musical acts.&#10;&#10;There are seven cards representing seven musical acts which are arranged in a column on the table. You get a hand of cards and each card corresponds to one of the acts. You start with one card face down in front of you. There is also a face-up pool of cards plus a draw pile.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you turn up your face down card and play it beside the corresponding act. You then take on card from the pool and one from the deck. Finally, you place a card face down (which will be played on your next turn).&#10;&#10;When one act gets three cards beside it, play stops for the 'Hit Parade'. Starting from top to bottom, each act moves up a number of spaces equal to the cards played beside it (this can push acts it passes down the column). The cards played are put into the pool and play continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck runs out. You get points for the cards left in your hand - if you have cards for the act at the top of the column you get five points each, for each card for the second act you get four points, etc. Whoever has the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Not to be confused with Campaign, the identically named game produced by Wills and Hepworth in the 1940's.&#10;&#10;&quot;An exciting strategy game in which each player can become a Napoleon or a Wellington leading his army across Europe.  Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;&#10;&#10;Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.&#10;&#10;The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.&#10;&#10;Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.&#10;&#10;There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.&#10;&#10;The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.&#10;&#10;Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.&#10;&#10;Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.&#10;&#10;The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.&#10;&#10;A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.&#10;&#10;The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.&#10;&#10;Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.&#10;&#10;from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles. Alliances are made and broken and complex manoevers bring victory or defeat&quot;&#10;&#10;",

This game was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #153, along with Zama.&#10;&#10;Operation Felix is a &quot;what if...&quot; game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41, shortly after the fall of France. Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.&#10;&#10;Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies). Optional rules for SS reinforcements and greater German amphibious capacity.&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;hex scale = 250 meters/hex side to side &#10;time = one day per game turn &#10;strength = platoon/company/battalion sized units&#10;&#10;",

Beer flows freely, but not even the cellars of Byggvir, the God of Beer, could quench the thirst of Nordland's greatest warriors. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Not a single step back is allowed to the warrior who wishes to enter Valhalla. One single thought in everyone's mind: may Fenrir eat the sun, that beer will be mine! All vikings laugh at the thought of death, draw their war axes, joining the fight at the call of &quot;OOOODIIIIIIIIIIN!&quot;&#10;&#10;In Beer &amp; Vikings you are a fierce and thirsty viking warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of beer. The winner is the most drunk viking &ndash; in game terms, the player who has collected the most beer drink counters &ndash; at the end of the sudden death round.&#10;&#10;Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the war axe. Each drink of beer prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the beer you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much beer, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the cup is empty and the sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Loki, the thirsty god of evil, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their beer. Raise your glasses (and your axes)!&#10;&#10;Beer &amp; Vikings introduces 112 brand new cards! including a new type of cards called &quot;Valhalla&quot; which provide you a strong ability during the match &ndash; but to obtain them you need to kill an opponent. Thus, to gain this power you must generate a vengeful spirit first. Be careful when you follow the Valhalla way...&#10;&#10;Beer &amp; Vikings, a board game for 3-8 players about war axes, blood and beer, is both a standalone game and an expansion for Sake &amp; Samurai.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Sake & Samurai&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadge:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this anti-smoking game, the players try to accumulate money while avoiding addiction to cigarettes.  At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.&#10;&#10;Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Drinkers Wild&#10;    Lovers Wild&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But, you&rsquo;re also being paid off by one of the captains to load his tea back onto his ship. It&rsquo;s hard to say what your number-one priority is; sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to toss everyone else&rsquo;s tea into the harbor instead of rescuing the tea belonging to the Captain that bribed you...or maybe it is just easier to eliminate the competition by squishing them between the crates...&#10;&#10;With art by The Fraim Brothers (of Knights of the Dinner Table Illustrated fame), this BOX game will be produced on high-quality chipboard for both the board and the 80 pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, a player rolls the die, which shows six different symbols. Each field on the board also shows one of these symbols. After rolling, the player may move one of his pawns to the next field bearing that symbol. If another pawn is already on that field, that pawn is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;When a player rolls the Yakari (or blume in DMusL) symbol, he may move a pawn from off the board to his start field. After rolling a Yakari (blume) symbol, a player takes another turn.&#10;&#10;A player whose pawns are all off-board or on the destination field may roll the die three times to try to obtain a Yakari symbol and get a pawn on the board.&#10;&#10;The first player who manages to get all four of his pawns on his destination wins.&#10;&#10;",

This does end your turn.)&#10;&#10;Every time you play a pair you skip the next player in turn.

The supports are then removed, so that the compartments support each other in a free-standing arch.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to place 50 playing pieces of various colors and shapes into the color-coded compartments, without knocking the arch over. On a player's turn, they roll the two dice--one of which tells how many pieces they must place, and the second die tells the color of the compartment into which the pieces must be placed. When 'Arch Rival' is rolled on the color die, one of the player's opponents is allowed to select the color of the required compartment. Players continue placing pieces in turn, until the point where arch can no longer support itself and collapses. The player who causes this to happen loses the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players must ally together to survive, but at some point they must betray that trust. Only the strongest and smartest will make it out alive, and only one player will be pronounced the victor.&#10;&#10;Game Components: &#10;&#10;     Four playable characters: the Rogue, the Warrior, the Cleric, and the Explorer. &#10;     Over 150 explorable cards such as paths, enemies, traps, treasures, and mysteries. &#10;     Over 20 unique items such as weapons, armor, scrolls, and potions. &#10;     Player tokens, a die, reference sheets, and everything else needed to start your epic journey!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rive is a territory game for two players, Black and White. It is played on the cells of a small hexagonal grid with an odd number of cells, and the goal is to have the most stones on the board when it is full. The board is initially empty. Rive was invented by Mark Steere in 2010.&#10;&#10;Definitions:&#10;A cluster is a connected set of stones in any combination of colors (only white, only black or both).&#10;&#10;There are three kinds of placement, all of which consist in placing exactly one stone of your color on an empty cell:&#10;You plant when you place adjacent to no clusters.&#10;You grow when you place adjacent to only one cluster.&#10;You merge when you place adjacent to multiple clusters.&#10;&#10;The only other kind of action is to shrink a cluster, which is to remove stones from it without splitting it into multiple clusters. This action will sometimes involve removing multiple stones, which may be of any combination of colors.&#10;&#10;The basic structure of a turn is this:&#10;You must plant if you can, otherwise you may grow or merge. If you merge, you must also shrink, then move again. This means that you may not end your turn before you have made a non-merging placement.&#10;&#10;Restriction on growing and merging:&#10;If you cannot plant (and therefore must grow or merge), you must choose a move such that the largest cluster you place adjacent to is as small as possible. This means that you cannot always choose freely between growing and merging, even though you aren't obligated to plant.&#10;&#10;Restriction on shrinking:&#10;The cluster resulting from the merging placement must be shrinked down to a cluster of size one more than the biggest cluster that was merged.&#10;&#10;",

More specifically, the judge draws a card for the round and reads the prompt to everyone else, e.g., &quot;Find the best #selfie&quot; or &quot;Show the last photo you took&quot; or &quot;Find the weirdest Google Image search result for your name&quot;. Everyone finds something on their phones and shows the judge, who then chooses a winner for that round. The first player to win ten rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to get one of each color (green, orange and purple) of your game pieces (one player is cubes and one player is pyramids) in a row (vertically or horizontally) on the matching colors of the board strips. The board strips are shuffled and dealt out 6 to each player. The first player lays one of their board strips and places one of their game pieces on one of the squares. Game pieces MUST be played on squares of the same color of the game piece. The next player may then either place one of their game pieces on the same board or lay down another board next to the first one long sides touching and places one of their game pieces on the board strip just played. After all 6 of a player's game pieces have been played, they may move any of their game pieces to a new position, either on a board that has already been placed or on a new board. After all of a player's board strips have been placed, they are limited to placing their game pieces on the boards already in play. So ...&#10;&#10;&#10;    You may ONLY play your pieces on a square that is the same color as that piece. (e.g. a purple piece can only be played on a purple square.)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    You may only place your board strips LONG sides touching with all squares aligned.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If you lay a board strip down you MUST play a game piece on that board.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If you choose not to lay down a new board strip on your turn, you MUST play a game piece on an existing board strip.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The winning row of 3 game pieces may be all on 1 board or lengthwise over 3 boards, but it may not be diagonal.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Only one game piece may be played on each square.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    You can ONLY move the position of your game pieces on the board after ALL of your pieces have been placed.&#10;&#10;&#10;This is a 2-player game for ages 10 and over.&#10;&#10;",

Life in a city flourishes for the inhabitants only when the magical ring is there.  Unfortunately, the ring never stays long in one place.  A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.  The Quest begins...&#10;&#10;Each player tries to find the ring and transport it to the cities.  As a reward, they receive the seals of these cities.  Collect three different seals to win.  Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.&#10;&#10;This is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra &quot;lives&quot; and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.  The end game can drag a bit as all the other players coordinate their efforts against the leader.&#10;&#10;",

Cowtown cards are always played on the table immediately in order to give the little dogies a place to settle.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you play a card from your hand onto a stack on the table. The card you play must be one higher than the top card on a stack. (Cowtown cards are effectively numbered 0.) If you can play multiple cards in numerical order &ndash; a Horn-to-Tail Sequence &ndash; you can do so; in addition (or alternatively) you can play multiple cards with the same number &ndash; a Stampede &ndash; onto different stacks when those stacks have the same lower number. Playing a three-card Horn-to-Tail Sequence or a Stampede is worth 1 &quot;scorecow&quot;.&#10;&#10;Whenever you play a card of matching color onto a stack, you're safe, but if you play at least one card of a different color &ndash; a bullish play &ndash; then you must draw and discard the top card of the deck. If that card shows a red bull's eye, then you've been kicked and must draw a card. Lay a 10 on a stack and you close that barn, getting to take another turn or pass one of your cards to another player.&#10;&#10;The round ends as soon as one player is out of cards or the deck runs out. The player with the fewest cards earns 4 scorecows, the player with the next fewest 2 scorecows, and everyone other than the player with the most cards earns 1 scorecow. After four rounds, whoever holds the most scorecows wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player begins the game as an indentured servant, who must first earn his or her freedom, then collect a list of required items for day to day life. Items are obtained from various shops and are also bought and sold in the marketplace, in exchange for shillings or in trade for other items.  Along the way, various events in history shake things up.  Players visit the many different buildings in a colonial American town (tavern, inn, jail, church, etc.) and find ways to strip other players of their belongings and negotiate trade.  When one player collects all the items on his or her list and ends the game, the player with the most assets becomes the winner.&#10;&#10;Rules contain 3 different levels of difficulty so that the game can be tailored to different age groups (Ages 8 and up, Ages 10 and up, and Ages 12 and up).

By means of committing burglary you can get trophies and gadgets that are essential to win the game.

Players bet the result on a special even/odd table and a number table (1-36). The probability of failure is small &ndash; only 25% - and can be further  reduced  by means of some gadgets. The esthetic wooden roulette is attached to the game.&#10; In order to smooth down certain randomness that accompanies burglaries, shoots and duels, so called task cards were introduced to the game. There is a different task for each round and after accomplishing it a player receives prize in the form of trophies and gadgets. Fulfilling the task depends solely on player&rsquo;s behavior.&#10; The game board is based on a tile system. Players arrange it themselves and each time they compose a different district in which the game takes place.&#10; Abetto game provides large interaction between players and a great deal of emotions.

But if he's not yet in Dreamland, now he gets the turn to strike back, or does he find a new target?  Plenty of warping effects on these easy-to-explain rules and interesting flavor are added by cards such as the roundhouse, whiskey bottle, flying through the window, beer barrel, piano player, Oopsadaisy and the dreaded bartender (he comes with a club).  Players gradually get knocked out until there is only one brawler left standing, the winner.&#10;&#10;Components include 6 Schl&auml;ger [&quot;Brawler&quot;] cards (one for each player), 54 Saloon cards (24 Attack cards, 8 Item cards, 6 Hit cards, 3 Help cards, 8 Defense cards, 5 Event cards).&#10;&#10;",

Here's more about the two characters in this game from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum...you don't want to mess with this chum. The Giant can crush his foes with his enormous strength, and he has his Magic Hen on his side, as well. But sly Snow White is no longer her sweet self, and she has some tricks up her sleeve, including the assistance of her Seven Dwarfs. Will the kingdom thrive under the rule of either of these challengers? A battle of enormous proportions awaits!&quot;&#10;&#10;The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&#10;&#10;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.&#10;&#10;",

Each stack is shuffled separately, then the stack with the lower value mission cards (queen's deck, values 1-3) is placed on top of the other (king's deck, values 4-6).&#10;&#10;Mission cards equal to the number of players are laid out, face up.&#10;&#10;The card dealer shuffles the 42 paladin cards and hands out 4-6 (depending on the number of players) cards to each player. Paladin cards have values from 0-9.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;Each player, beginning with the start player, puts one of his/her paladin cards next to one of the mission cards, face down, and marks it with one of his/her player tokens. This paladin is called the leading paladin. When each mission card has a leading paladin, players continue playing cards clockwise until each player has placed a card beside each mission.&#10;Before placing a card, players may look at one of the cards another player has already placed. Each player can only play one paladin per mission. &#10;When each player has only one card left, the paladin cards are resolved, starting with the first mission and the first card that was placed there. Each player has the following options:&#10;&#10;     Beat the leading paladin if your card has a higher value (or in case they are equal, if it is a red number).&#10;     Take the face-down paladin card back on your hand.&#10;     Discard the face-down paladin card.&#10;&#10;&#10;This continues until all cards at the first mission have been dealt with. The player whose card is the last to stay wins the mission and places it, together with the winning paladin card, in front of him/herself. The same is done for the other mission cards.&#10;&#10;The player with the fewest honour points is the dealer of the next round and hands out paladin cards until everyone has the same number of cards as in the first round. The dealer then lays out new mission cards and determines a start player.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are not enough mission cards left for another round. Each player counts the honour points from the missions he/she won and adds bonus points for all paladin cards with red numbers that the/she has in front of him/herself.

Your job is to visit them and pick up a monkey (1 at a time) and bring them back to start where they are caged.  You carry tranquilizer darts and it is permissible to shoot your fellow researchers to keep them from getting back with monkeys or to steal their monkeys.  When you get a monkey they will usually help you with a power but they also come with nasty traits that if you fail a monkey roll can mess things up for you.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Power Monkeys&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The cards are illustrated with black and white ogre cartoons, and the instructions on the cards are in &quot;ogre-speak.&quot;&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Ogre Bash is based on that time-honored Ogre tradition of standing around in a circle bashing each other on the head with clubs.&#10;&#10;The Ogre Bash card game is just like that, except for the bashing each other on the head part.&#10;&#10;When you play Ogre Bash, you're trying to get five cards either of the same kind or in one of the special winning sequences.  The catch is, you need to have it at the start of your turn.  Almost every time a card is played, you need to trade a card with another player, so although you may have a winning hand now, it may not be there when your turn comes around.&#10;&#10;Just kind of makes you want to bash an Ogre on the head, doesn't it?&#10;&#10;",
