    "Description": "Lingo is a boardless word game played with Scrabble tiles, for two or more players. It's like a relaxed version of Scrabble with free-flowing moves and high scores.&#10;&#10;Equipment: Lingo requires a set of Scrabble tiles (with the two blanks removed), a flat surface about the size of a game board, and some method for keeping track of players' scores.&#10;&#10;Start: Four tiles are chosen at random and placed into a pool shared by all players. Pool tiles are placed face up so that all players can see them. After each turn, new tiles are randomly selected to replenish the pool so that it always contains four tiles.&#10;&#10;Moving: The opening player starts by taking any number of tiles from the pool and making a valid word. Thereafter, players take turns forming new words by taking any number of tiles from the pool and placing them adjacent to or on top of existing tiles. Words can be made forwards, backwards, upwards or downwards. No tile can be placed to cover the same letter.&#10;&#10;All tiles placed per turn (if more than one) must form part of the same valid word. There are no other restrictions on placement; new tiles do not have to form valid words with tiles they are placed next to, but will score more points if they do.&#10;&#10;If no new word can be made, then a single tile can be played for 0 pts. Players may not pass.&#10;&#10;Scoring: After placing the tiles, new words formed that turn are counted to score points. Only the highest-valued word passing through each new tile along each axis (vertical and horizontal) is scored.&#10;&#10;Word-length multiplier: The score for each new word is given by (total letter value) x (word length - 1).&#10;&#10;Word-count multiplier: If more than one new word is formed, then the total word score is multiplied by the number of new words.&#10;&#10;Winning: The game ends when there are no more tiles to play. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Gamerz (turn-based, play by email or play by web)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Jerome Park Steeplechase is a very early game from McLoughlin Brothers and was produced circa 1885. Jerome Park itself was located in the Fordham section of the Bronx and staged races from the late 1860's to around 1890.&#10;&#10;The game; Players decide before the game begins what wagers the game would be played for. Each horse would cost a player some pre-determined amount of money. After casting lots with dice to decide what order each player would move in, each player would roll the dice and then place their horse on the number rolled. Each player could take several horses but the cost to have more than one would increase. Having a second horse in the race would cost the owner one and a half times the fee for the initial horse.&#10;&#10;There were bad spots on the board. The #10 spot forced a player to lose his next turn and spots 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 forced players to go back to their previous position on the board. Spots 16,33,48 &amp; 68 were places where hedges were located. If one rolled a number that would place ones horse on any of these numbers one had to pay a fine of the entrance fee for the horse and then return to the place one started this turn from. As one gets closer to the finish line the number of dice one throws decreases so players in the rear have an opportunity to catch up. First player to reach spot number 100 wins and collects whatever wagers were involved in the game. If you rolled more than 100 then, on subsequent turns, you would roll the die and go backwards or forward whatever number you rolled until you reached the 100 square exactly.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to complete a &quot;book&quot; of cards (all four numbered cards of a given letter) by collecting the necessary cards from opponents.&#10;&#10;Simple games are played like Go Fish where a player asks for a card by letter and number from any other player.&#10;&#10;Players can play more challenging games using biblical quotes at the bottom of each card. Before a card is surrendered, the quote is read and the active player must state the book of the bible from which the quotation comes.&#10;&#10;There are also topics at the bottom of the cards allowing for play similar to the Game of Authors.&#10;&#10;The cards feature black and white illustrations by world renowned artists (and even some world renowned paintings) such as DaVinci's Last Supper and Hoffmann's ubiquitous version of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane.&#10;&#10;Also includes works by Dor&eacute;, Bougereau, Plockhorst, Portaels, Le Rolle, Muller, Godall, Benz, Mengelberg, Zimmermann, Cornicelius, Richter, Kirkbuck, Murillo, Rubens, Grieger, Munkacsy, Herriach, Raphael, Reni, Schonherr, and Coletti.&#10;&#10;",

A set of PB consists of 250 flat wooden pieces in geometric shapes: hex, square, parallelogram, triangle, diamond, trapezoid.  The shapes are all the same scale and based on a fundamental angle of 30 degrees - like a super Tangram set.&#10;&#10;The supporting bits include a protractor, a very nice spinner for selecting one of the PB shapes, three d6 (one 'regular', one with the six PB piece colors, and one with angles in 30 degree increments), Tangram and 'mandala' cue cards, and four sturdy game boards.  This equipment (and a PB set) lets you play the five games described in the rules.  The games are a mix of non-competitive pattern-making games, and races to be first to make specific shapes or patterns.  All are well thought out to teach basic geometric principles and/or excite the imagination (as if geometry wasn't exciting enough).&#10;&#10;The pieces are well-made and are totally conducive to creating new games, the spinner and dice especially.  The skills being taught by the five supplied games are grade school level, but as games I think one or two of these could challenge many adults.  I'm tempted to order a PB set just to try some of them - and of course make beautiful designs in my spare time.  Building blocks of any kind are good clean fun.&#10;&#10;",

Each player begins the game with a hand of 6-7 cards depending on the number of players, and one card is laid face up on the table as a starting card.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player lays one card from hand onto the end of a card on the table, covering one or two sections of that card with one or two matching sections on the played card. If the player covers one section, they draw one card, then end their turn; if they cover two sections, they can play again immediately, still drawing one card and ending their turn whenever they play something that covers only one section or can't find another play. (A player can optionally choose to draw cards at the start of their turn.) If a player can't make a legal play, they must draw cards from the deck until they can make a play.&#10;&#10;The first player to play all their cards wins the hand. If no further plays are possible, the player with the lowest pip count wins the hand. In either case, the winner scores the pip count of cards in hand from the pip count of each opponent, then scores the sum of these values. To determine the overall winner, you can play to a particular point total or play a certain number of rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Our main objective was to write a set of rules that would allow a fast, yet as realistic as possible wargame.&#10;&#10;In order to keep the actual number of pages as low as possible, we have opted for a system that may be compared with &quot;Lego&quot;. You may have a huge pile of Lego blocks at hand, yet to build a house, you will only use the ones you need. In our system, the &quot;unit cards&quot; stand for the Lego blocks: there is a huge choice of different units for each nation, yet you will only need those you have units for in the game.&#10;&#10;The number of COMMAND CARDS is similar to the other games. So far, we have finished the D-Day to Berlin units for Germany and the USA.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "DESIGNER'S NOTES:&#10;This is the third set in my card driven wargame rules, and although still loosely inspired by the Battle Cry &amp; Memoir '44 games by Richard Borg, the game no longer has a battlefield divided in 3 sections. Battlefield sections are great for ACW and WWII, but spreading a (smaller) imperial force across the battlefield would not always be realistic or playable, since in most colonial battles a smaller well armed imperial army faces hordes of natives. The left-center-right wing Battle Cry/Memoir '44 principle has here been replaced by color-coding the units red, green and blue (activated by cards of the same color) thus enabling the imperialist player to concentrate his units anywhere on the battlefield if he wishes to. Also, compared to ACW or WWII, there was a much bigger difference in quality of weapons used by imperialists and natives. Therefore the symbols on the dice are no longer representing the targets but rather the type of ammo/weapon used, whereby the more modern weapons have a better chance of scoring hits than outdated ones (see rules).&#10;&#10;Since many colonial games are played in &quot;Darkest Africa&quot;, an (optional) set of &quot;event cards&quot; is added in order to spice up the &quot;adventure&quot; type games. When using the fast play variant, games with 20-30 native units (and about half of that number of imperial forces) can be concluded in 90-120 minutes (ideal for a club night). In order to have a balanced game, the number of victory points to be scored by imperialist armies should be around 1.5 times higher than for native forces.&#10;&#10;",

A topic of ancient lore for historians to explore and subject of horror stories told to the young children of a hundreds of civilizations for thousands of years.&#10;&#10;But the Quo-Ti are indeed real. Originally bioengineered by the great Ucharian Republic to help them confront their many powerful enemies back at the dawn of known history. The Tygernians, Empire of Froth, Gra-Nari Emporium, the Darks, the Old Ones; one and all, none could defeat the Quo-Ti. At least until the day the Quo-Ti Queen led her people in revolt against their Ucharian masters. The ensuing conflict nearly bought the Ucharian republic to its knees and led to the near extinction of the Quo-Ti as a race.&#10;&#10;Over a hundred thousand years have passed. The Quo-Ti, once exiled from the Milky Way and hunted across the Universe, have risen to dominance. They have multiplied and spread out among a dozen galaxies, gaining dominion wherever they go. Now a single Clan has led its people back to its origins and established itself along the outer rim of the Alpha Quadrant. Are any of the humanoid races safe? Will the long forgotten Ucharians resurface once more to confront their greatest nemesis?&#10;&#10;This 5 page PDF includes the spaceships, fighters and Pods belonging to the Quo-Ti Clans.

    "Description": "(from publisher)&#10;The next in DGA's critically acclaimed Battlecards: World Conflict series, Six Days of Destiny captures all the action, political maneuvers, and intrigue of the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict. While little is taught in today's classrooms about the war, this modern day David and Goliath story is still forming the world we live in.&#10;&#10;In May of 1967, after a 10 year buildup of Arab military force in Sinai, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser amassed the armies of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan on the borders of Israel. By the end of that same month, Egypt engaged in the first official military action of the 6-day war by declaring a naval blockade against the nation of Israel. After concentrating an enormous Arab amphibious assault force just 17km from the coast of Israel, Nasser ominously proclaimed, &quot;The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel...to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not declarations.&quot;&#10;&#10;Echoing these sentiments, the Iraqi President Abdur Rahman Aref boldly declared, &quot;The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy that has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear: 'to wipe Israel off the map'.&quot;&#10;&#10;But Israel refused to go quietly into the night. On June 5th, 1967, the Israeli Air Force launched a pre-emptive attack against Egyptian airfields full of bombers, poised for the assault. One of the shortest, yet most influential wars since World War II had begun in earnest, and almost 40 years later, the world is still sorting out the aftermath.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning and after each point, the &quot;serving&quot; player rolls the white Serve-die. Every following throw is done with one of the other dice - at player's choice.&#10;&#10;The neutral results mostly mean, that the ball is played well and that the opponent must return. The exception for this is the Serve-die: a &quot;net&quot; (1x on the die) simply voids the throw, an &quot;out&quot; (2x on the die) is a little dangerous, because it can result in a double-fault.&#10;&#10;",

A player rolls his die and moves the number of spaces as indicated on the die (again just like snakes and ladders). He then moves the T-Rex backwards or forwards the same number of squares as he wishes. If the T-Rex is moved to the same spot as another player, that player falls back 12 spaces.&#10;In this way, turn by turn, players try to advance to the end while at the same time try to use the T-Rex to stomp on their opponents and make them fall back.&#10;The first player who reaches the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Fourth place gets 400 points. Fifth place gets 200 points. Dividing the number of points for each company by the total number of shares claimed for each company provides the share value for each share of that company.
