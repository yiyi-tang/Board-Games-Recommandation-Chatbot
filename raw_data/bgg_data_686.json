Blood Country also introduces innovative abilities for your wounds, creating new effects beyond those just on the card!&#10;&#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn. Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents' decks and end the game with the fewest wounds in your deck. But beware: The more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&#10;&#10;Blood Country is an expansion and requires Nightfall or Nightfall: Martial Law in order to play.&#10;&#10;",

Objects inside the saloon such as tables and the bar also represented which serve as movement obstacles to the players. There are a total of three maps included with the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has 50 points which are allocated to the six men either as strength points or dexterity points before the fight begins. Fighting is carried out in order of descending dexterity (highest dexterity goes first). The men can be hurt, knocked unconscious, stunned, or killed and the game provides counters to indicate their status during the fight. The fight is initiated between two randomly chosen men who must throw the first punch at each other before any other characters can join in.&#10;&#10;The game includes counters for townsfolk such as piano players, saloon girls, and the bartender, each of whom has strength and dexterity characteristics and may get involved in the fight. The game turns are timed based on the camera cuts of old Western movies.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes several characters from each faction and includes scenarios for large group battles and man-to-man fights.&#10;&#10;The game uses a points system to buy characters with. Players have 40 points to spend on their heroes and villains in order to build the best group. The game follows the core rules of the other Steel and Glory games but adds new rules to accommodate the new Steampunk fighting techniques.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.&#10;&#10;",

Well this were it's at The game is a 3-5 players co-op where players work together to get back to their home dimension (Earth Prime). To do so they must split their forces between completing missions for/against historical figures encountered in alternate worlds and repairing the Navigator, a device that may lead them home... at least before it's out of power.&#10;&#10;Introduction:&#10;&hellip;You just woke up... the last thing you remember is being on that late night bus, slipping in and out of consciousness, rocked by the vibrations of the almost retired vehicle. Then you&rsquo;re here, wherever that may be, everything looks strange but familiar, like looking through a cracked mirror. The other passengers are here too, and they found a device they say can take you all home. How do they know? Who knows indeed? It&rsquo;s worth a shot, anyway you&rsquo;re not liking the sounds of whatever is approaching.&#10;&#10;You and the others have fallen through the dimensions that make the multiverse, an infinity of alternate realities where the best utopias and the worst nightmares can be found. The strange device you found, this &quot;Navigator&quot;, seems to be the key to get home. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem in good shape. Was it damaged before, is it the cause of your being here, is it some sort of test? All you know is that the batteries are fading fast and you and your fellow multiverse castaways better fix it and find your home dimension before you stay stranded forever...&#10;&#10;Aim of the game:&#10;Players must work together to complete the missions set by the Navigator on each world they land and repair the Navigator along the way to ensure that they make it back to their home dimension: Earth Prime. Each turn, the players will encounter a historical figure in a new dimension where things are different and must somehow be righted: a ruthless Benjamin Franklin has sided with the machines to destroy mankind and must be stopped, a benevolent Genghis Khan needs help surviving in a dying world... those are but a few of the thousands of possible missions the players will have to complete before going home.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player receives a character card, indicating their strengths and weaknesses along five stats (Status, Fight, Intellect, Stealth and Tech). Each turn, by revealing one of each Alternate World, Target and Mission cards, the players get to face one of over 25000 challenges. As a group, they decide who will attempt the mission and pool their relevant stats to form the mission dice pool. Scoring more successes than the target in the contest set by the Mission card will allow the other players to repair the Navigator device. It's up to the players to assess their chances against various challenges and decide when to use the precious power left in the Navigator until they reveal the Earth Prime card hidden among 29 Alternate World cards to win the game. However the players can lose the game if the Navigator runs out of power or if they run out of World cards.&#10;&#10;",

In addition, pieces start off the board in a reserve, and enter the board through a player's a home space, as game progresses.  Besides this, when pieces are hit, they are sent back to the reserve area, rather than a bar (L-Gammon doesn't utilize a bar).  A player only bears off pieces when they have none in their reserve.&#10;&#10;The game has the feel of regular backgammon, but the 2 dimensions adds increased tactical considerations.&#10;&#10;",

The player represents the Human Empire who must defeat all enemy units from the alien worlds: Chaos, Eldar, Tyranids, Orks, Necrons, and Tau. There is also 1 Internal Foe: Rebel Worlds.&#10;&#10;Each turn in the game contains 10 phases. In these phases, new enemies are spawned, random events happen, new tech is built, and battles are fought. Battles are fought by rolling a D10 and applying any modifiers from built technology. A modified roll of 6+ is a hit for both the enemy aliens and the Human Empire. The player has a supply of Empire Points which grow throughout the game. These points can be used to absorb hits when no Empire Units are left on the battlefield. The Empire Points aslo affect the number of new units that the player can recruit each round.&#10;&#10;To win, the player must eliminate all enemy unit. The final score is the number of turns it took to eliminate them. The game is lost if the player loses all Empire Points before eliminating the enemies.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is still world domination, battle resolutions are based on the luck of dice, and the theme remains vaguely Napoleonic.  However, there are significant and interesting differences.  Most important is the use of simultaneous planning and execution of attacks.  Players write down their plans, and once revealed, battles are resolved in a prescribed fashion.  Also of note is the addition of several territories and connection points, changing the values of continents and making them more difficult to hold; yes, gone are the days of establishing an easy bastion in Australia.  The dice rules are significantly different, using 12-sided dice of various strength.  And still, there are other alterations that change the nature of the game, yet it retains the flavor of Risk.  Simply put, you are still playing Risk, but you no longer have to wait an hour between turns before you can play again; now it is always your turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hexteroyd is an abstract strategy game for 2 players with a background theme of Asteroid Mining. It plays in approximately 20 minutes.&#10;Players take turn placing and removing pawns (the Colonies) on an hexagonal board (the Asteroid belt) with 5 hexagonal cells (the Asteroids) per side.&#10;Playing the Colonies allow to have the controls of the cells through double-sided discs (the Mines).&#10;Aim of the game is having control of the most valuable group of Mines (a Chain): the value of a Chain is given by the sum of the values of the adjacent Colonies.&#10;&#10;The game will participate in an Abstract Strategy Game Design Contest in the mathematics festival &quot;Tutto &egrave; Numero&quot; in Cald&egrave; (Italy) at the end of July 2011&#10;&#10;What's so special about Hexteroyd ?&#10;&#10;Hexteroyd is a kind of connection game but with several twists:&#10; - First and foremost, you don't need to connect distant parts of the board. You must connect points to... gain points !&#10; - The pawns you use are shared between the players and have a double role: they allow the players to make actions and they are the points themselves: positive if you connect them on the board, negative if you keep them in your hand.&#10; - You don't directly place the connecting pieces on the board: they come into play as a consequence of your playing a pawn, whether you place it on, or remove it from, the board.&#10; - Connecting pieces (the discs) aren't fix, they have a certain degree of variability as the result of players' actions: once they are on the board, they remain on their cell, but they change owner, therefore changing the connected pawns.&#10; Thanks to these characteristics, some parts of the board (usually the peripheral ones) are constantly subject to subtle but meaningful changes and the victory is somewhat uncertain till the end.&#10;&#10;The strategic aspect of Hexteroyd originates in the different ways in which you can use pawns: if you tend to empty your hand, you will have more territory control but less mobility; if you keep them in hand you risk to lose points in the end if you can't get rid of them.&#10;&#10;",

The two players White and Black each have twelve pieces.&#10;&#10;PLACEMENT PHASE:&#10;Beginning with White, the players alternate placing one of  their twelve pieces on one of the 37 crossing points on the board.&#10;Once all pieces have been placed, the movement phase begins.  A piece can be captured during this phase (see below).&#10;&#10;MOVEMENT PHASE:&#10;The players alternate moving one of their pieces to an adjacent and empty crossing point.  A piece can be captured during this phase (see below).  If a player has only 4 remaining pieces, they are allowed to move their piece to any empty crossing point.&#10;&#10;QUADRATES:&#10;A quadrate occurs when a piece is placed such that the 4 corners of a square are occupied by that player's pieces.  Quadrates come in 6 different sizes.  To form a quadrate, a player must have their pieces on all 4 corners of a square composed of either 2,4,8,16,18, or 32 triangles.&#10;&#10;The table below indicates the number of possible quadrates composed of a given number of triangles:&#10;&#10;No. of Triangles/No. of Quadrates&#10;2 - 24&#10;4 - 12&#10;8 - 13&#10;16 - 5&#10;18 - 4&#10;32 - 1&#10;&#10;For any of the larger quadrates (8,16,18,32), the quadrate is invalid if there is an opposing piece on any position along the side.Only friendly or empty positions are allowed along the edges (sides) of a quadrate.&#10;&#10;CAPTURE:&#10;If after placing a piece, a quadrate is formed, the player can remove an opponent piece which does not itself form a quadrate with 3 other pieces.&#10;&#10;Once a player has only 3 remaining pieces, they lose the game.  If the same position occurs 3 times, then the game is declared a draw.&#10;&#10;Notes:&#10;o In rare cases, all of a player's pieces may be trapped thus requiring the player to pass.&#10;o Danish Quarto has some similiarities to the Morris family of European board games, but also shares important features of a Chinese game named `Fang`&#10;&#10;",

'Werewolf', 'Hobgoblin', 'Manticore') along with five statistics: intelligence, strength, speed, weakness and point value (a total of the other categories), plus two Wild Cards.&#10;&#10;After the deck is dealt out, each player turns over their top card.  A die is rolled to determine which category is being assessed (rolling a 6 is 'you pick') and players compare cards.  The player with the highest value in the chosen category wins the cards in play and puts them at the bottom of their pile.  Ties are resolved by playing another round, with the eventual winner collecting all of the acumulated cards.  Wild Cards win a round automatically.&#10;&#10;After each round the die is passed along and rounds are played until one player has won all of the other cards.&#10;&#10;The game came packaged with two Monster in My Pocket collectible figures ('The Beast' and 'Witch').&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the year of 1787, Brazil was still a colony of Portugal.&#10;&#10;The Portuguese empire imposed high taxes (called &quot;Derrama&quot;) upon the wealthy ones, trying to get as much gold as possible. Under pressure, influential Brazilians gather to organize a liberty movement by writing articles, poems and manifests,  spreading freedom ideas taken from USA's recent act of independence and from the French Revolution.&#10;&#10;A group of conspirators, called Inconfidentes, gathered on the state of Minas Gerais, a place that concentrated a lot of gold and valuable gems.&#10;&#10;There are six characters on the game, five of them are Inconfidentes: the poet, the farmer, the bachelor, the soldier and the priest, each of them with a unique power. The last one is an imperial guard.&#10;&#10;On each round, players choose and move the Inconfidentes, however more than one play may select the same character. Whenever this happens, they must blind bid to decide who will be the leader of that character.&#10;&#10;Players vie to spread the ideas through publishing texts (tiles) and hide them around the city, Ouro Preto, formerly named as Vila Rica, and get the population's approval, supporting the struggle to make Minas Gerais free from Portugal. These conspirators also made part of Freemasonry's secret association, and they try to build the first Freemasonry's secret house to support their fight.&#10;&#10;When they publish their own texts and get the texts from the others, players make &quot;inconfid&ecirc;ncia&quot; points (victory points). Furthermore, a character may become a Freemason. If a player manages to get to the 33rd. degree of Freemasonry (all five characters become Freemasons), he becomes a Master Freemason. This gives an alternative ending to the game by finishing the game earlier, and changes Brazilian history! setting Minas Gerais free from Portugal.&#10;&#10;If no one gets to be a Master Freemason until 1789, the year of the ninth and last round, everyone goes to jail. &#10;The player with more points (tiles) from texts published by other players, gold retrieved and Freemasonry degrees is the &quot;inconfid&ecirc;ncia&quot; martyr and the winner.&#10;&#10;Not to forget that the historic martyr, Tiradentes, became widely famous afterwords, although was unfortunately killed, hanged for treason by Portugal.&#10;&#10;",

Designed by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Elder Sign), Season of the Witch is a single-scenario expansion that sends players on a tense and terrifying race against the clock.&#10;&#10;There are no new mechanics added in this expansion; it is purely an additional scenario for the base game that will use the modular board setup from Mansions of Madness.  The setup of this scenario will be dictated by the included event cards and reference sheets.&#10;&#10;In this macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players, each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.&#10; (Note: variations in printing mean that cards from Print on Demand expansions will be subtly different in appearance and texture from base game cards. Therefore, any necessary base game cards (such as the &ldquo;nothing of interest&rdquo; Exploration cards) will be reprinted in each expansion, to retain a consistent appearance when shuffled.)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game attempts to capture the feel of a Horror Movie in a Board Game.  Players start off as survivors of an airplane crash, they know that something is wrong but not what.  They must first leave the safety of the abandoned village and collect clues from other island locations.  Once they have collected enough clues a Horror themed Goal is revealed that usually requires gathering certain objects and bringing them to a given location (eg. To escape from the island you must take the motor from the docks and repair it in the workshop, and return with the keys and gasoline to escape).&#10;&#10;As the players move about the island they will come under attack from the Peril Deck.  The hand of cards each player holds represents the energy they have to escape from the attacks, attacks chip away at your hand (the Action Deck also represents how much daylight is left).  If you ever run out of cards in your hand after an attack you die... but the player can always return to the village to grab another survivor to wander off to find out what is going on.&#10;&#10;The game contains a few horror themed cards including &quot;I know what to do&quot;, &quot;it's now or never&quot;, and my favorite for twist endings &quot;It's not what you think&quot; all balanced to bring a horror movie to your tabletop in about half-an-hour.&#10;&#10;NOTE: All files necessary to play the game are located in the files section below :-)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The 7th Armored brigade's charge on Hafid ridge during Operation Battleaxe, 15-16 June 1941&#10;&#10;A small introductory game set in the desert in 1941 where a British tank charge against a well defended hill, Hafid Ridge, came to a bloody and quick end.&#10;&#10;Hafid Ridge is a standalone game that is small, plays fast (a few hours), and focuses on tactical level combat and maneuver during Operation Battleaxe prior to the Crusader operation that lifted the seige of Tobruk.&#10;&#10;The rules are modeled around the Seven Battlefield Operating Systems which helps make them easier to understand.&#10;&#10;This battle will provide a challenge to both players.  The British will find that they need to be very aggressive to push through the anti-tank defense.  The Germans have to simply hang on.  Either way it's a cliff hanger.  Obstacle play is important and significant.&#10;&#10;Game play is excellent for solitaire play and moves along very quickly.  The game is specifically designed to play in an evening or afternoon.&#10;&#10;The Commonwealth forces drove straight into the anti-tank screen.  They were suckered into advancing into the anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns of the Germans behind the ridge and took heavy losses.  By the time they were making some headway the 5th Panzer Regiment was on the scene and forced the British 7th Armored Brigade to break contact and run back to the Egyptian border.&#10;&#10;This game focuses on company / platoon combat and combined arms use. The time scale is either 1 or 2 hours per turn and each hex is 330 meters, depending on the game.&#10;&#10;This game comes with:&#10;&#10;    (2) 11 x 17 Color Map Sections&#10;    (1) Color Order of Battle Card&#10;     approximately 200 Double-sided and Die Cut Counters&#10;&#10;&#10;(from box and publisher's website)&#10;&#10;",

Conquer the islands and increase your wealth so you can be a powerful admiral.&#10;&#10;Have you found a section of ocean where there are several islands that are not under the power of any kingdom or country and it is your duty to land on them and claim its riches for you. Be careful as other pirates have been established on nearby islands and are in search of new domains, you will fight them, showing who is the most powerful captain, using your ships to take out your opponents.&#10;&#10;Have fun, managing your ships, conquering islands landing in their ports, increase your wealth,  and if necessary destroy your opponents by blowing up your traps. Who will be the most successful captain?&#10;&#10;The board represents a section of ocean with several islands, each with its port and wealth. Each island has a number that represents wealth and every time you take possession of an island, its richness is added to the total wealth of the player.&#10;&#10;Each turn each player can make up to six actions that can be: Build, move or disembark. Additionally, the player may attack one or more opponents or blow up one of his traps.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to end the game:&#10;&#10;1 - Time limit: At the beginning of the game  a limit of time is proposed. Upon completion of the time the winner is determined by the number of ships that the player have on the board and the wealth earned.&#10;&#10;2 - Total Victory: The game ends when one player remains on the board or when a player takes possession of all shipyards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Del editor:&#10;&#10;Conviertete en un poderoso capit&aacute;n acumulando riquezas y dominios.&#10;&#10;Eres un joven capit&aacute;n a cargo de tu propia flota de barcos, buscando fama y fortuna. Debes conquistar la mayor cantidad de islas, aumentando tu riqueza para que seas un poderoso almirante.&#10;&#10;Has encontrado un sector del oc&eacute;ano donde se encuentran varias islas que no est&aacute;n bajo el poder de ning&uacute;n reinado o pa&iacute;s y es tu deber desembarcar en ellas y reclamar sus riquezas para ti. Ten cuidado, ya que otros corsarios se han establecido en islas cercanas y se encuentran en la b&uacute;squeda de nuevos dominios; deber&aacute;s enfrentarte a ellos, demostrando quien es el mas poderoso capit&aacute;n, utilizando tus barcos para eliminar a tus oponentes.&#10;&#10;Divi&eacute;rtete, manejando tus naves; conquista islas desembarcando en sus puertos, aumenta tus riquezas, enfrenta a tus oponentes y si es necesario destruyelos haciendo explotar tus trampas. &iquest;Qui&eacute;n ser&aacute; el capit&aacute;n mas exitoso?&#10;&#10;El tablero representa un sector del oc&eacute;ano con varias islas, cada una con su puerto y riquezas. Cada isla tiene un n&uacute;mero que representa su riqueza y cada vez que se toma posesi&oacute;n de una isla, su riqueza se suma al total de las riquezas del jugador.&#10;&#10;En cada turno cada jugador puede realizar hasta seis acciones que pueden ser: Construir, mover o desembarcar. Adicionalmente el jugador puede atacar a uno &oacute; mas oponentes o hacer explotar una de sus trampas.&#10;&#10;Hay dos formas de terminar el juego:&#10;&#10;1- L&iacute;mite de tiempo: Al comienzo del juego se propone un l&iacute;mite de tiempo determinado. Al terminarse el tiempo establecido de juego se decide el ganador seg&uacute;n los barcos que se tengan en el tablero y la riqueza ganada.&#10;&#10;2- Victoria Total: El juego termina, cuando queda un solo jugador en el tablero o cuando un jugador se apodera de todos los astilleros.&#10;&#10;",

(Their capital letters, not mine).&#10;The deck is shuffled and each player gets 10 cards. The remaining undealt cards form a face-down draw pile. A player may, in turn, play one card in the middle of the board as in dominoes. Then the player replenishes his hand by drawing a card from the pool. The winner is the player who has the colour of the last card played when the pool is exhausted. The rules give a strategy tip - do not play cards of your own colour until victory looms. This will give you a good chance to play for a win.&#10;Betting is suggested as an option, even onlookers are encouraged to bet on who will win.&#10;&#10;",

Cards can be humans, zombies, infected humans, cops or bombs. On each turn a player has to draw a card and then play a card.&#10;&#10;Human cards (with values 1 to 5) are played in front of them and represent the people they have saved.&#10;&#10;Zombies are played so that other player has to discard some of their human cards (which ones and how many depend on the zombie played).&#10;&#10;Infected humans are very bad cards to have in your hand because they eat two human cards from the same player.&#10;&#10;Cops can act as heroes and sacrifice themselves to save humans when attacked by zombies.&#10;&#10;Finally bomb cards have 2 uses. They can be used to stop a zombie attack, or they can be used in any turn to gain an additional card to your hand. Either way a bomb would have exploded in &quot;La Moneda&quot;.&#10;&#10;When the sixth bomb explodes the game will end and the player with more humans saved will win the game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Editorial Tabula Rasa presenta &quot;Zombies en La Moneda: Juego de Cartas&quot;, producto basado en el exitoso c&oacute;mic chileno hom&oacute;nimo de Mythica Ediciones.&#10;&#10;ZeLM:JdC es un juego de cartas no coleccionables &aacute;gil, entretenido y r&aacute;pido de aprender, para disfrutar de 2 a 6 jugadores.

Pero no todo ser&aacute; tan f&aacute;cil, porque el rescate de cada persona podr&aacute; verse interrumpido por los zombies sedientos de&#10;cerebros que vagan por la ciudad.&#10;&#10;Objetivo Primario: Elimina la amenaza zombie.

Rescata a la mayor cantidad de personas posible y evita que sean v&iacute;ctimas de ataques zombies. Debes tener mucho cuidado porque hay personas que han sido infectadas y en cualquier momento pueden convertirse y atacar a tu propio grupo.

    "Description": "You are a modern day shaman and supernatural champion. Waging your secret war against dark forces intent on reshaping the universe, you also face off against destiny in the wake of an uncertain prophecy that foretells destruction but gives the promise of hope. Across the world, the infant Queens of Fate are being reincarnated into the world. Can you find them before the dark powers get to them?&#10;&#10;--&#10;These are the complete instructions on how to play a solitaire game called Queens of Fate, using only a deck of tarot cards and a large playing surface. I made up this game as a tool to help me learn to use and interpret the multi-faceted meaning of the tarot cards in different ways, and soon found both the game and its story to be quite addictive.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of turning over cards from the deck, one at a time and resolving them.  Depending on the type of card (classified in the game as Opposition, Arcana, Source, or Court), you will either play it into your play area, confront it in a challenge, or compare it to the previous card drawn. You have a set of Arcana cards and Source cards to use in battles, but each can only be used once.&#10;&#10;The strategy of the game involves using (discarding) cards you have in play when an Opposition card comes up, or deciding whether not to confront at all and deal with the consequences.  Playing cards in certain combinations allows you to &quot;resurrect&quot; cards from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;The goal is to play the four Queens, and place one in each suite-themed play area.  If you run out of cards before this happens, you lose the game.  The Queens can be lost through losing battles to Obstacle cards, which may attack your Court cards or random cards from your deck.&#10;&#10;",

In it, players attempt to reduce 6 dice that are rolled to a single die on the board, with value of 6 on top.  As players move dice, they reduce in value.  As players merge dice, the new dice on the space merged equals the sum of the two dice merging.  Players are not permitted to combine dice to a value greater than six, and each die is permitted to only move in a line, one or more spaces.&#10;&#10;Quick rules:&#10;&#10;     Roll the six dice, and then place them on the board so they get reduced to a single die with a six on it.&#10;     As a die moves into another die, the value of the die moved into is increased by the current value of the die moving, and the die moving is removed from the board.&#10;     A single move for a die consists of moving in a straight line vertically, horizontally or diagonally, like a queen in chess.  For each empty space a die moves into, it decreases its value by 1.  A die may not be reduced to less than one doing this.&#10;     Each die can perform, at most, one move per puzzle.&#10;&#10;&#10;",
