The cards contain board game attributes such as theme, component, or designer. There are two play styles: expert and family.&#10;&#10;For the family game, the game flow is similar to 20 questions. Each player, except the leader, has a hand of ten cards. The leader thinks of a game, then the players use their cards to narrow down the title. The person who guesses correctly wins the round.&#10;&#10;For the expert game style, players are dealt a hand of cards, then each play one card. Players then try to come up with games that fit the criteria described by the cards in play.&#10;&#10;",

The game is published in Japanese but is language free in gameplay.&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing a card on the table to form a four-column grid. When a pair of cards of the same color are connected, orthogonally or diagonally, that player takes these cards and scores points, and the taken spaces are filled by existing cards in a certain rule. If another pair is made, that player takes them and scores again, which is called chaining. Repeat the process until no pairs are made.&#10;&#10;There are several game modes. In one mode, you just draw a card and place it, and you should take as many cards as possible. In another mode, you choose one from your hand of two cards, and you score negative points if a single pair is made in a turn; only chainings are counted positive.&#10;&#10;In another game, special cards may be added to change the rules slightly.&#10;&#10;Depending on the game mode, the player with the most positive points or the least negative points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;User summary&#10;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#230;&#168;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#230;&#150;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#143;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#226;&#153;&#170; &#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#138;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&hellip; &#10;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#229;&#177;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#226;&#153;&#170;&#10;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#147;10&#227;&#128;&#156;15&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#149;&#176;2&#227;&#128;&#156;10&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#139; &#229;&#159;&#186;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;2&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#130; &#10;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#153;&#186;&#229;&#177;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#162;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130; &#10;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#229;&#160;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#172;&#172;1&#228;&#189;&#156;&#231;&#155;&#174; &#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They sluggishly move back and forth, sometimes running across one another. When that happens, they battle to the death.&quot;&#10;&#10;User description&#10;Each player places a trio of hydra tokens (Majoritei, Arakure, and Fushigi) on marked spaces along the edge of the board.  A turn then consists of the following steps: Multiplying the Majoritei, moving a hydra, and possibly removing opposing hydra pieces.&#10;&#10;Players start by taking a Majoritei hydra from their supply and placing it next to another one already on the board. They then choose one of their hydra to move. Finally, if they've surrounded an opponent's hydra and at least one of their surrounding hyrda is on a nest of evil spirits, they capture their opponent's piece and return their piece from the nest to their supply.&#10;&#10;These steps are repeated until one player can either form a line using six of their hydra, or until all of a player's hydra are captured.&#10;&#10;",

Will you risk betting only one answer...?&#10;&nbsp;&#10;The game was published as part of the social and educational campaign &quot;Native - add to favorites&quot;, run by the National Center for Culture since 2012. Its aim is to shape the linguistic awareness of Poles and to promote care for the correctness of the Polish language.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pestka, drops, cukierek is a kid's journey to the world of economics. The game presents the basic mechanisms of demand and supply in an accessible way, and at the same time it tells an extraordinary story of a mysterious land hidden in Julek's pocket. The evil king forbids everything that gives joy, health and happiness! Your task is to make the magical land be vibrant again. But you must hurry - the evil king raises funds to pay for the army, which is to punish the rebel residents. The fate of the kingdom is in your hands!&#10;&#10;The game was created on the basis of a book by one of the most valued Polish writers for children - Grzegorz Kasdepke.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;There are 7 action fields on the board. In your turn, you can move to any field in a clockwise direction (Players themselves choose how many squares they will move their pawn. But the consequence of this quick free access to various actions is the increasing frequency of paying tribute to the king.) On the action field, a player can perform the appropriate action: draw resources, change them into &quot;goods&quot; (for example a pencil into a picture), sell &quot;goods&quot; to inhabitants of gray houses or exchange resources. After each action, active player asks others if they want to pay him 1 coin to do the same action in a limited way.&#10;&#10;The game may end in two ways: When the number of gray houses is smaller than the number of players - then the player with the most coins is the winner; When the royal treasury is full, then everybody lose.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In between protesting, marching, and crying into your pillow--why not laugh too? DisgRace To The White House provides catharsis and the roadmap to resistance during these trying, rights-depleted, tiny-hands times. Players brush up on America's horribly archaic Electoral College system as well as DJT's certifiably insane Tweets, as they navigate the election in a race to the White House.&#10;&#10;While battling for electoral votes, players impersonate Trump's &quot;unique&quot; form of verbal diarrhea, quote mind-bending Tweets, and pick up &quot;Disaster&quot; Cards, all in the name of winning the oval office through alternative facts. Interactive, team-building and generally outrageous, players shriek, squeal, and laugh--all at the same time. Gameplay constantly shifts until a winner is crowned (poor choice of words). You're never assured of victory until the bitter end (sorry &quot;Haters and Losers!&quot;). A perfect gift--play it around the trashcan fire when the Trumpocalypse finally comes!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

You know exactly who he is and how far he'd go to put a smile on your face.&#10;&#10;Whether by way of award-winning films like &quot;The Dark Knight,&quot; Emmy-winning animated programs like &quot;Batman: The Animated Series,&quot; video game appearances such as the record-breaking &quot;Batman: Arkham Asylum,&quot; or the countless comics stacking comic book shelves and digital libraries, the Joker stands unquestionably as the most recognizable and popular comic book villain in pop culture history. Unpredictable, violent and incredibly dangerous, he is chaos personified and has taken on everyone from his archenemy Batman to even the Man of Steel.&#10;&#10;But Gotham remains his primary home and Batman his biggest adversary, and no hero is perhaps better suited as in many ways, the Joker is the polar opposite of the Dark Knight. Both were created by a great tragedy, but Batman has since vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent similar incidents, the Joker revels in creating chaos and destroying lives, believing that life&rsquo;s a big joke and psychotically demonstrating that in a moment, it can all change.&#10;&#10;Not much is known about his past, but his acts during the present are what define the Joker as one of the greatest threats to our heroes and the people they've sworn to protect.

    "Description": "Superheroes aren't the answer to every problem. Sometimes, extreme situations require extreme measures&hellip;or extreme individuals. The sort of individuals who call the infamous Belle Reve Prison home&mdash;super-villains.&#10;&#10;Of course, no one will officially admit to any of this. That's the charm of Task Force X, perhaps better known by its nickname: the Suicide Squad. This team of super-villains, assembled by their director Amanda &ldquo;The Wall&rdquo; Waller, undertakes high-risk covert operations and in exchange receive commuted prison sentences. And we do mean high-risk. Regardless of abilities and talent, every member of the Squad is expendable&mdash;it&rsquo;s expected that many will not return. As expendable assets, all members are fitted with an explosive device in their neck to assure obedience. If Squad members try to escape while on a mission...well, escape isn't an option. Runaway and its BOOM!&#10;&#10;Given the rigorous requirements of the job, the Suicide Squad lineup is always in flux. The roster has included Deadshot, a precise marksman and assassin; Harley Quinn, a peppy but psychotic villain; Captain Boomerang, the man who turns boomerangs into lethal weapons; Enchantress, a powerful sorceress who can wield magical energy; and their sometimes field leader Rick Flag, an elite soldier who is one of the only members who isn&rsquo;t a super-villain.&#10;&#10;A group of super-villains who have a license to take drastic action in the name of serving a mission? There's no way that could end badly.&#10;&#10;Bat-Boxes are the ultimate way to jump into the action of the Batman Miniature Game!

    "Description": "Riddle us this: what cerebral criminal with an affinity for purple and green loves challenging the Dark Knight with cleverly calculated crimes and puzzling plots?&#10;&#10;One of the Dark Knight's most infamous villains, Edward Nygma enjoys flaunting his intellectual superiority by conducting crimes and leaving clues for Batman to piece together. While this habit constantly leads to the aptly named Riddler failing in his criminal endeavours, his puzzle-problem actually stems not only from his own narcissism and ego, but also from a deep-seeded psychological compulsion. Because of this, the Riddler often finds himself a resident of Arkham Asylum following his inevitable capture.&#10;&#10;Possessing a genius-level intellect, the Riddler creates elaborate, sometimes Rube Goldberg-esque traps, and is even willing to use innocent civilians as bait. Although not physically imposing, the Riddler's brilliance, neurosis and lack of empathy make him an incredibly dangerous foe. He cares very little&mdash;if at all&mdash;about the lives of those he uses in his plots and instead only sees them as disposable pawns in his continuing intellectual battle against Batman.&#10;&#10;Bat-Boxes are the ultimate way to jump into the action of the Batman Miniature Game!

    "Description": "Dark Knight. Caped Crusader. World&rsquo;s Greatest Detective. Whatever you know him as, wherever you know him from&mdash;the blockbuster movies, TV shows, video games, cartoons, or millions of comics&mdash;Batman is proof you don&rsquo;t need superpowers to be a superhero&hellip; and the poster boy for what a bad childhood can do to you.&#10;&#10;Millionaire Bruce Wayne was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City. The crime would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world&rsquo;s greatest weapon against crime&mdash;the Batman.&#10;&#10;Forget his Batarangs, Batmobile, or Utility Belt filled with high-tech weapons. Batman is the most feared superhero of all because he&rsquo;s pushed himself to the absolute pinnacle of human achievement. He&rsquo;s a brilliant detective who&rsquo;s mastered fighting techniques the world&rsquo;s barely heard of. An Olympic-caliber athlete with a plan for every occasion, Batman&rsquo;s seemingly always five steps ahead of his foes. But in his crusade against injustice, two questions always loom: How far will he go to protect the innocent, and will he sacrifice his humanity along the way?&#10;&#10;2019 will be the 80th birthday for the caped crusader since his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 from 1939. So what better way to celebrate than with a new version of Batman. The 80th Anniversary miniature sees the Dark Knight leaping into action, surrounded by a cloud of bats, to instil fear into the hearts of his foes.&#10;&#10;Happy birthday, Bruce. Here&rsquo;s to another Bat-Tastic 80 years!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now, with the DC Universe Miniature Game, the stories of these epic battles between superhumans, gods and monsters is at Your fingertips...&#10;&#10;In the DC Universe Miniature Game, You and Your friends collect a set of beautiful miniatures of your favourite DC heroes and villains, bring them to life by painting them, and then using them as playing pieces in an exciting multi-faceted, three dimensional tactical game. Every model in the DC Universe Miniature Games is supplied with a character card, which tracks a model's actions and health during a game. Most importantly, the character card keeps track of a model's Power Counters, which are used to fuel powers and abilities, from flight and teleportation, to heat vision and magical spells.&#10;&#10;Picking models to battle in the DC Universe Miniature Game is really easy, and the game is designed to offer total flexibility in how You assemble Your teams. Firstly You need to decide if Your team is predominantly Heroes or Villains. You can choose any model of the same 'alignment' to join Your team. Some models have a Neutral alignment, which means the can join either team.&#10;&#10;The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play&#10;&#10;Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually up to the character&rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.&#10;     Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &ndash; you might go first this round, but end up going last in the next.&#10;     Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act have done so.&#10;     Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &lsquo;tidying up&rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.&#10;&#10;&#10;Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "These aliens are the most basic of all xenomorph hive creatures, similar to a worker bee. Also referred to as Drones, they are responsible for the construction of alien hives by using a strong resin-like material they secrete. Spawned from human hosts, they stand roughly seven feet tall and sport smooth, elongated heads. As they age and mature, the smooth carapace sloughs off, revealing the ridged structures that adult Warriors have. Another job the Drones have is to procure captives for the hive to birth more xenomorphs. In combat, they are able to wield their long tails with deadly accuracy, the bladed tips able to punch through marine combat armour.&#10;&#10;Like several other evolutions, they too are able to spit acid at their enemies and can do so with great ability. They also have enormous strength and they are able to easily subdue an adult human, or even fight a yautja head on. Drones often work alone, using stealth and waiting in ambushes to attack their prey. Their jet-black exo-skeleton allows them to blend into their environments; curiously well among the pipes and shrouded alcoves of starships. When they work together, a pack of them will often force their quarry directly into an ambush by chasing it around. Fear makes for a wonderful weapon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Predators, also known as yautja, are an alien race that is best known for their hunting of the most dangerous prey in the galaxy, including humans and xenomorphs. These Hunts, as they are known, are done for honor, sport, and as a rite of passage for young Predators looking to become adults in their own right.&#10;&#10;They are a sentient race that is humanoid in appearance, but larger than most actual humans in size, standing well  over  seven  feet  tall  and  weighing  300  lbs  or  more  in  many  cases.  They  breathe  an  atmosphere  that  is  similar to Earth&rsquo;s, though with a higher degree of nitrogen. Their faces have been seen to have quill-like hair on their brows, cheeks, and chins. Their mouths have four mandibles they use to help communicate or to show emotion,  several  sharp  teeth  used  to  tear  flesh,  and  a  small,  thin,  snake-like  tongue.  Their  elongated  heads  have a crown of thick bone and end in a mass of long appendages that have been nicknamed dreadlocks.&#10;&#10;As  with  humans,  their  skin  color  can  vary  from  light  to  dark  hues,  as  well  as  striped  and  mottled  patterns.&#10;While  primitive  and  tribal  in  appearance,  their  technology  is  extremely  advanced.  Their  armor  and  weapons  &#10;are made from an alloy that is resistant to even the corrosive effects of a xenomorphs acid blood. Most of them &#10;mount a plasma caster on their shoulder; a powerful energy cannon able to kill most of their enemies in a single &#10;shot that utilizes a high-tech, triple targeting laser to track their foes. Other weapons include combi-sticks, which are collapsible spears, and smart-disks that can eliminate multiple enemies in a single throw.&#10;&#10;On their left arm, each yautja wears a wrist-gauntlet which allows them to access many different systems. It controls their cloaking ability, access and remote piloting control of their ships, local terrain layouts, and even contains  a  miniature  nuclear  explosive  to  ensure  that  their  technology  doesn&rsquo;t  fall  into  their  enemy&rsquo;s  hands.  &#10;Some more evolved Predators even incorporate a second set of wrist-blades or even more weaponry packed into them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They look at the numbers, then place one under each safe to represent its combination.&#10;&#10;At the start of the round, the active player reveals one more number card than the number of players. Each player in turn gives one of these cards to their left or right neighbor. The person receiving the card places it to the right of all their safes if the number on the card matches one of their combinations; otherwise this player places the card in front of one of their safes if the card is higher than that safe's combination and behind the safe if it's lower.&#10;&#10;After everyone has finished the first phase, each player can attempt to guess the value of an opponent's combination. They must ante some gold, then identify a safe and a number. If they're wrong, the owner of the safe keeps their ante; if they're right, then the safe owner hands over all the gold in that safe to the active player. If all your safes have been cracked, you're out of the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game Intro. &quot;Let&rsquo;s face it. You don&rsquo;t really want to be here. You don&rsquo;t really want to talk to any of these people. You don&rsquo;t really even want to play this game. But you came here for a reason, and you&rsquo;re not going to get it unless you&rsquo;re prepared to engage in a little small talk, the occasional social lubricant, and some generous nodding and smiling. If you play your cards right&mdash;literally in this case&mdash;you might just walk out of here a new person... yeah, who are we kidding, you&rsquo;ll just be happy if you get through the evening with your dignity intact.&quot;&#10;&#10;Awkward Party is a thematic card game, with party game elements, that pokes fun at the bizarre traditions and anxieties that define awkward social gatherings. At the start of the game, each player receives a hand of seven Awkward Party cards (hand limit 7), three Why Am I Even Here? Cards (hand limit), and sets their individual Awkwardness meter to 5. The Party Interest meter is put in the middle of the table and also set to 5. The Awkward Party cards are the main cards that the players play throughout the game with varying effects. They come in a number of categories such as Conversation, Venue, Money, Role, Drink, Support, Romantic Encounter, Rejection, and Something Interesting. The Conversation cards also have their own subjects such as Weather, Movies, Sports, Religion, Politics, and Sex.&#10;&#10;The Why Am I Even Here? cards are the secret objectives each player is trying to complete. They also vary considerably from having a Conversation with all other players to receiving Money from two other players to acquiring the &quot;Someone's Dog&quot; card. Once one of their objectives has been completed, the player must reveal the corresponding Why Am I Even Here? card. In most cases, the winner of the game is the player who has revealed the most Why Am I Even Here? cards. There are a few exceptions such as the &quot;Go Home&quot; and the &quot;Street Cred&quot; Why Am I Even Here? cards, which are only completed and revealed when a particular game-ending event is triggered, even if it is not on the player's turn. If the event is triggered, the player holding the corresponding Why Am I Even Here? card wins the game regardless of how many revealed Why Am I Even Here? cards other players have. The game ends immediately when any one of the following events occurs:&#10;&#10;     A player reveals three completed Why Am I Even Here? cards. &#10;     A player's Awkwardness meter exceeds 10 (and they are forced to leave the party).&#10;     Party Interest drops below 1.&#10;     Party Interest exceeds 10 for the third time and the cops arrive to shut it down.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game-play itself is turn-based. Each player turn has four phases: &#10;&#10;     Play 0-2 Awkward Party cards. &#10;     Discard any number of Awkward Party and/or unrevealed Why Am I Even Here? cards. &#10;     Draw Awkward Party and/or Why Am I Even Here? cards up to the hand limit (revealed Why Am I Even Here? cards still count).&#10;     Reduce Party Interest by 1.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player plays a conversation card on another player, any player may play another card to join the conversation if their awkwardness is low enough and they have a matching subject. With the exception of Conversation, Rejection, Money, and Support cards, turns can be stolen by other players by playing a card in the same category as the card just played. This card counts as the first card played by the player that just stole the turn. Turn-stealing can be chained, one card at a time, so long as players continue playing cards from the same category.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Enlist in the help of magical seahorses that give you extra victory points and encounter scuba divers that allow you to alter the board.&#10;&#10;Fight the incoming tide every three turns while you alternate moves in this highly strategic duel game. Sometimes the tide carries in diamonds, requiring you to decide when and where to focus the most attention. Earn the most seashells and win the favor of the inhabitants of the Gem Islands!&#10;&#10;Your turn is simple. You will place one of your gems on an open space of one of the islands available. The island you are sent to depends on where the previous gem was placed. Picture each island as a representation of the whole 3x3 board. Whichever of the nine spaces are chosen is the island that the next gem must be placed. For instance, the blue gem is placed on the middle right space of the island. This means that the next gem will be played on the middle right island. This will continue until all 27 gems have been placed.&#10;&#10;Battle it out with your rival islander to complete patterns, control each of the islands and recruit seahorses.&#10;&#10;Every game is different! With 14 islands to choose from, no two games will ever be the same. Seahorse cards score in two different ways from the orientation of the player, meaning any one card has different value for both players!&#10;&#10;Tide cards dictate the flow of the game, either flooding an island or revealing diamonds that can lead to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;        Cardboard Edison Runner-Up 2022&#10;        LUCI Award Finalist 2022&#10;        Board Game Design Lab Challenge Runner-Up 2019&#10;        Note: This game is completely changed from its 2019 iteration.  While using some mechanics from the old version, Island of Gems in its current state has been adapted for 2 players with fundamental scoring changes and differences in components, component count and presentation.  For the purpose of BGG, this is still considered related to its old version but the similarities are very minimal.  The videos on the BGG page reflect its old iteration and not the new one.  This is a complete rehaul.  The game was an attempted KS that I cancelled and no copies of this game have been sold as this game is still looking for a publisher.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",
