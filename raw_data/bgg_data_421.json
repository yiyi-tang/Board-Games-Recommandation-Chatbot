    "Description": "Ranged Fun is a simple game of vehicular urban shootyness.&#10;&#10;The core of the game is based around the four statistics which each unit has. These are reduced as the unit is damaged, so they gradually loose effectiveness before being destroyed. This means there is some bookkeeping involved, but it means the rules a great for quick skirmish games.&#10;&#10;The statistics themselves are generalized: each is the combination of many factors the unit may have. For example, all the guns, ammo, rate of fire, targeting efficiency and range are represented by a single number. As the number is reduced through damage, it can represent individual guns being disabled, hampered aiming, ammo destroyed etc.&#10;&#10;This may not be that realistic but it speeds gameplay and reduces bookkeeping. This is after all a game of fun - at different ranges&#10;&#10;",

An arena/maze is prepared where a violent criminal is put into along with less harmful people and the main actors of the game the hunters.&#10;&#10;The latters are taken over by the players and their object is to hunt down the so called fox, while collecting points for various actions, like &quot;killing the fox&quot;, &quot;dying a noble death&quot; or &quot;witty statement&quot;. Maybe you know the film &quot;Running Man&quot;? That's it. Not 100% but very close.&#10;&#10;The whole spectacle is run by a referee, who plays the fox, awards points and comments on the players actions. He is the one who keeps the game running.&#10;&#10;So its a &quot;classic&quot; death match game, where action and fast gaming are the most important ideas.&#10;&#10;Every player has to create a character, buy equipment to go hunting (weapons and armor) and maybe tell a short story about the person the represent. Even at this point you can score points for a great introduction of your character.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns, in which a player could take two of these actions: Movement, Use Skill, Aiming, Reloading a Bow, Attack. Actions are taken by initiative and Combat is run by an extra combat sequence.&#10;&#10;The material:&#10;&#10;THE HUNT comes as a simple booklet with the rules and counters to be copied and cut out. All very simple and black/white. No fancy artwork  or mounted boards, just plain paper. The maze is as simple as the rest, simple squares printed on plain paper.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Overtime&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The attacking player roll one time the 5 dice and have to place all for all the black sides coming up. He places on the grid of the player of his choice and follow the same placement rules.

From December 1740 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe.&#10;&#10;SOK is a two or three-player operational study. One player is the French, one is the Allies, and a third may play the Prussians (under French control in a two-player game). The Allied army includes contingents from Britain, Hanover, Holland, Austria, Hesse, and Denmark. Saxony is a potential ally, but could join the Franco-Prussians instead. Under French command are Bavarian and Pfalz troops. The forces of the Empire are available to the side that can demonstrate the greater strength.&#10;&#10;The game system is essentially the same as CoE. A number of important changes have been made to deal with the fact that there are three sides. Map scale is still 8.5 miles per hex. The counters are brigades. Units are rated for Strength (in battalions), Effectiveness (a combination of morale and training), and Movement. Turns are equivalent to months. Each turn is broken down into several phases - supply, operations, admin, etc. There are scenarios for the 1st and 2nd Silesian Wars, the Austro-Bavarian War, and the Dettingen campaign, plus a huge Campaign Game covering the entire period.&#10;&#10;",

The idea of the game is to first make one to three claims, register them at the Bank/Registry Office, then pan for some nuggets of gold and sell them - and any claims that have not run dry yet - to the bank, to reach a sum agreed before the start of the game (eg. 20,000 marks). Each time a player visits the Registry they must also visit the saloon and play a Blackjack-like dice game for at least half of their money. The first player to reach the agreed sum wins. When moving on the map, the players may encounter some events which are usually negative.&#10;&#10;The gold nuggets are called according to the old gold prospectors slang: Lifeless, Nit, Louse, Bedbug, Nugget, from smallest to biggest.&#10;&#10;",

Points can also be gained from buying equipment and events (buying Original Greek New Testaments gives a Theology bonus each turn for example).&#10;These equipment and events can also be used to increase the size of the church (Church barbecues, Harvest Festivals, Bible Weeks etc)or to make your current members happier (doughnuts, china cups, quality tea, comfy chairs).&#10;&#10;Make sure the church can afford to pay the rent of the pub meeting room it is meeting in and look for bigger and better buildings to rent and buy that are on the market!&#10;&#10;However church life isn't always fun and roses, watch out for the potentially damaging &quot;Event Cards&quot;.

    "Description": "El Tablero de Jesus (pronounced 'Heh-soose') is a simple gambling game played on a 7&times;7 board with a pair of standard dice.  Originally presented to the SCA (recreational medievalist) as a historic game from the 15th century, further research has found this to be a hoax.   No evidence shows the game to have existed before 1971. The game briefly fell out of favor in the late 1990's, but was popularized once again by a notorious hosting camp at the Pennsic war in 2006.&#10;&#10;Players each roll two dice, with the high roller choosing who goes first.  The first player places a single coin in the center of the board, and both players place coins in the three left-most columns of their back row.  The first player then rolls both dice and moves any two coins up or down a column the exact number rolled.  When a player gets two or more coins in adjacent columns on the same row (other then either home row) he may choose to take those coins and end his turn or continue rolling.  If he takes the coins, then his opponent fills in the now empty columns with new coins on his home row and starts his turn.  At any point if a player rolls 7, 11 or 12 their turn is over and the dice pass to their opponent.  Also if you roll a pair of numbers that can not be moved (roll a 6 and none of the coins are in a home row) your turn is over.  If at the start of your turn there are adjacent coins on the board, you may take them and pass the dice back.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is out of money (or is no longer willing to lose more).&#10;&#10;The game is most often played with alcohol instead of coins (if it ever was played with coins) -- filling shot glasses with beer or wine and moving those about instead. This can shorten the game, since the &quot;currency&quot; being exchanged is consumed as it is won. It can also balance the game, since the better one plays, the drunker he/she gets from drinking his opponent's brew, self-imposing a handicap. In this version of the game, &quot;Tablero&quot; may be declared only when there are 6-7 shot glasses lined up horizontally, or 7 lined up diagonally, and the player who lined them up MUST consume at least half of the shots so claimed. The balance may be assigned to their opponent, themself, or anyone at the table of legal drinking age.&#10;&#10;Many SCA-events run Tablero tournaments, in which there is usually a table limit of 2 beers (or 24-oz) set to keep the tournament moving (and the participants capable of competing). In the drinking version of the game, there is the addition of the Queen's number. A lady at the table rolls two dice and this number becomes the Queen's number for that game. Upon rolling the Queen's number, the player who rolled it should take a shot glass from the board, raise a toast to the Queen, and then put the shot glass back on their opponent's fill line (the back row). If the player who rolls the Queen's number fails to make such a toast, his opponent may declare &quot;Treason to the Queen&quot;, take a shot from the board, drink it, and then require his opponent to fill it on HIS fill line. The player who rolled the Queen's number then retains the dice and play continues (unless the Queen's number is a passing number, ie: 7,11, or 12)&#10;&#10;Honest Mistakes- If a player makes a mistake, any mistake, in the moving of the shot glasses, in the handling of their stake of beer, etc, their opponent can point out that they made an &quot;honest mistake&quot;, describe the nature of that mistake, and then be rewarded with a shot from the table and control of the dice.  If they FAIL to notice their opponent's &quot;honest mistake&quot;, once the dice are rolled again the mistake becomes part of the on going game, all wrongs are forgiven, and no amount of complaining later on can reverse it NO MATTER WHAT THE MISTAKE WAS. It is prudent to pay close attention to your opponent throughout the game, because &quot;honest mistakes&quot; happen. If you are caught making an honest mistake, you are obliged to acknowledge the truth and suffer the consequences.&#10;&#10;In all versions of the game, house rules are as rampant and as varied as can be, as no &quot;definitive&quot; rule set exists for the game. When playing, make sure to agree to a rule set with your opponent beforehand. In ALL versions of the game, leaving the table to go to the bathroom or ANY instances of vomiting are grounds for disqualification. Players should only play as many games as their biology can actually stand&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "According to the game box:&#10;&quot;As everyone knows, a slot machine is a mechanical device that consumes coins at a rapid rate. It's a game of pure chance...simply put in a coin, pull the lever and hope that the spinning symbols stop at the right combination. different combinations pay off at different odds. Charles Fey, a mechanic from San Francisco invented the slot machine. He made the first one (called &quot;Liberty Bell&quot;) in 1895 and rented it to a saloon for 50% of its profits. Mr Fey obviously understood the motivation that causes people to enjoy losing.&#10;Spot dice - the dice used in America's favorite game of chance, &quot;Craps&quot;, can be traced back as far as 1573 B.C., back to the crude sticks, bones and shells used by primitive man.&#10;Classic Games has taken these two basic gambling devices and combined them into a modern classic - &quot; Slots n' Spots&quot;. A game in wich the outrageous chances of the &quot;slots&quot; are paired with the predictable(?) roll of the dice.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game box contain:&#10;- a dice cup&#10;- 3 special dice&#10;- 2 regular dice&#10;- score pad&#10;- Instructions&#10;&#10;",

Either way Keno became a fast and furious gambling game in the &quot;dives&quot; and &quot;joints&quot; that abounded in New Orleans around the mid 1800's.

    "Description": "Destini Productions presents the first collector card/game to bridge the gap between Fantasy Art collectors, Literary Enthusiasts and Gamers.  All this in one product called, &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot;.  The core set will consist of 90 cards divided into three subsets: Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror.  Each subset of 30 cards will bring forth an intense story line on the backs of these cards.  Corresponding with the storyline will be a specially designed game concept never before seen in this format.  All the art work for the core set of 90 cards has been exclusively produced by internationally known Game Illustrator, Ed Beard, Jr.  Ed began this May of 1992.  All work on the 90 card core set has been painstakingly created to the exact specifications of the storyline.  This is the first and only &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot; Collector card set and Game of its kind.  March 1992&#10;&#10;This never before seen concept will appeal to the traditional role playing gamer due to the highly realistic and detailed fantasy art work, as well as the graphic novel like backs to the cards.  In addition the game has a fresh new approach that allows the player to engage in a quick and fierce battle based on the storyline concept.  There are a variety of alternative ways to play depending on which you prefer.  Uniquely designed random elements decide the games fate to assure fair play.  Destini Productions is most proud to be able to guarantee that in each box of &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot; the customer is rewarded with not one, not two but three complete core sets.  We have gone to great extremes to collate this product this way for an affordable product.  That means three different game themes times three complete sets, all for the price of a traditional fantasy card set.&#10;&#10;- From the &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot; promo sheet&#10;&#10;Set contents:&#10;30 Fantasy themed cards (numbered 1-30)&#10;30 Horror themed cards (numbered 1-30)&#10;30 Science Fiction themed cards (numbered 1-30)&#10;2 Checklist cards&#10;3 Rules cards&#10;10 Puzzle cards (9 puzzle pieces and 1 overview card)&#10;12 Gallery cards&#10;3 special insert cards (1 bonus Rule card and 2 signed Gallery cards)&#10;7 promo cards (5 bonus Rule cards and 2 promotional cards)&#10;&#10;An unnamed expansion set, bolstering the character roster and adding official multiplayer support alongside more supplemental rules, was planned but never published.&#10;&#10;",

When taking a turn a player moves her piece one space, then draws a card from the appropriate deck. Some of the cards have immediate effects, with others the players must roll the &quot;smiley die&quot; to determine whether the action taken/incident has a positive result or not.&#10;&#10;The first player to get through the restaurant succesfully is considered to &quot;have scored&quot;, and wins the game. In the last two decks it's also possible to &quot;score&quot; immediately through a card result.&#10;&#10;The game is entirely luck based, and other players' game cannot be affected in any way.&#10;&#10;",

One player takes the 10 chickens and three dice and throws them on the table. The sum of the two red dice, minus the number rolled on the blue die, is the target number. If the target number is greater than 0, the players grab the chopsticks and try to pick up as many chickens as the target number demands. The player who manages to do this first, scores that number. If the target number is less than 1, grabbing the chopsticks gives the player 1 negative point. The next round starts with the player who lost this round throwing dice and chickens.&#10;&#10;Components: 10 grilled chickens, 2 pairs of chopsticks, 2 red dice, 1 blue die&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Grab a color...but don't touch the sides!&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a simple electronic dexterity game for all ages.  &#10;Twenty-eight plastic, chrome-plated rods are placed in holes through a conductive play field. The holes are about a quarter-inch wider than the diameter of the rods, and there are holes under the holes to keep the rods centered and vertical.  A handle with conductive, spring-loaded, plier-like pincher is wired to the base unit.  When the circuit is completed between the play field and the pincers, a loudish explosion sound goes off and a small light goes on.  The top of the rods are slightly flattened and have a piece of tape on the flat sides.&#10;&#10;The game consists of rolling a big die marked with the three colors, and then using the pliers to pull out a rod of that color without touching the edge of the play field hole, ala Operation.  The instructions instruct players to grab the rods by the edges (non-taped) of the flattened top, I suppose to ensure a solid contact between the rod and pincher.&#10;&#10;It's not that easy.  You have to watch carefully that you're pulling the rods out exactly vertical, and there's little &quot;feel&quot; using the pliers to judge the force you're using.  The circuit is very sensitive and doesn't let you get away with much.  The explosion sound was surprisingly loud the first time I tried the game, not at all like the Operation buzzer - startled the crap out of me.  Same thing apparently happened to the kid pictured on the box...  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The winners blast off for Earth below, the loser doesn't get to go.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game consists of a circular molded plastic gameboard about 12&quot; diameter which resembles the lunar surface and is raised on 'legs'.  There are four craters in the surface, one for each player.  The center is dominated by a plastic rocket which locks into the gameboard mechanism, effectively creating a platform beneath each crater.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with the full complement of five plastic astronauts of their selected color.  Players place one of their astronauts on the platform in the nearest crater.&#10;&#10;A marble is spun around the rim of the circular gameboard; when it loses velocity it drops into one of a series of colored depressions which circle the board just inside the marble track.  The player controlling the astronauts corresponding to the colored depression that the marble stops in must quickly grab the central rocket &amp; remove it from the board.  This causes the platforms beneath the craters to move aside and the astronauts to fall through the board. Players must attempt to catch their astronauts before they fall.&#10;&#10;Any astronauts that fall through the board are given to the player who removed the rocket.  The winner is the first player to get ten astronauts.&#10;&#10;Interesting game in that four (and only four) players are required.&#10;&#10;",

This allows players make normally illegal moves. Like a knight's leap with a pawn or a pawn's capture with a knight. After each move the opposing player may or may not call BS (short for bluffing style) in that case the moving piece is revealed, and a penalty is given to moving player if they cheated or to the calling player if the move was legal.&#10;&#10;One other big change to chess is that the players pieces start in stacks along the back row of the board. This allows for a bit of meta gaming and reduces the number of choices each round even though a standard 16 man chess army is used.&#10;&#10;",
