    "Description": "I think some of the best games have a number of characteristics in common: they have simple rules, they are quick and they have a high replayability factor. The Stonehenge games are a good example of this. With this in mind, I recalled a number of these games and all of a sudden, there was the idea of creating a game of my own; a quick racing game with easy rules and a high replayability factor: Stonerush.&#10;&#10;Number of players: 3&ndash;5&#10;&#10;Object of the game: The players are druids who come home to Stonehenge after a hard days work. As part of their daily ritual (or just having fun), they try to be the first to run around the great stone circle. The player whose druid arrives first on case 30 of the outer ring is the winner.&#10;Getting Started&#10;&#10;Equipment: - The board&#10;- The number cards: you will need all the cards, except the &quot;night&quot;-cards from 13 to 30.&#10;- The trilithon cards&#10;- The 5 figures, also called druids (even with 3 or 4 players!)&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;When a figure reaches case 30 of the outer ring, the players reveal their trilithon card. The player whose color matches that of the figure that reached case 30 is the winner. If this color belongs to no-one (for example in a 3-player game), the winner is the player who has advanced the most.&#10;&#10;Variant: for a quicker game, use the bluestones as the racing track.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After developing Raiding Stonehenge, it became apparent the game was best suited for 4-5 players. This meant the initial 2-3 players planned for the gamer were dropped and put into the unrecommended category. Seeing that Raiding Stonehenge was a good game, and feeling a need to come up with more 2 player Euro-style games, I decided to adapt Raiding Stonehenge to two players. Raiding Duel is the result.&#10;&#10;Number of players: 2&#10;&#10;Object of the game: The object of the game is to score the most points after two rounds of play. Players score 10 points for each complete set of disks they collect at end of game. A set normally contains one disk of each color: White, red, green, blue, yellow. Players LOSE one point for each disk not in a set.&#10;Getting Started&#10;&#10;Equipment: Deck of 60 cards, excluding the Trilithon cards. 50 disks, 10 per color. Each disk type represents a different item type from Camelot. 1 gray figure (to indicate start player). A way to track score.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;After the second round is over, the game ends. At that point, game is over, and players total up their points for both rounds. The player with the most points wins. In event of a tie, players keep playing two cards from their hand, as they have done prior. until they are down to only two cards. The player with the highest card in their hand wins. If both players tie, they each look for the next highest card in their hand. If, after that, the players are still tied, the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We were working on a Stonehenge game of our own when we came across the anthology box. Not surprisingly, the board and pieces were very similar to those that we had developed, so it was fairly simple to transfer most of our ideas to match those provided. Our game links Stonehenge to the magical powers of the Earth and other elements and is basically a battle for magical supremacy.&#10;&#10;Number of players: 3&ndash;5&#10;&#10;Object of the game: The object of the game is to use your magical powers (represented by the cards) to convince the local clans (represented by disks on the bluestones) and spirits (represented by bars on the outer ring) that you are the druid most able to carry out the solstice rituals. Building trilithons and preparing the altar stone may assist along the way and it is vital that you keep up with the necessary preparations to avoid offending the spirits.&#10;Getting Started&#10;&#10;Equipment: First Druid uses all of the pieces provided in the basic game box. Each player uses the pieces of one colour (along with the trilithon card of his or her colour), so if there are less than five players some colours will not be used.&#10;&#10;Throughout these rules, the plastic figures are referred to as 'druids'.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;When the first player has moved his druid all the way around the ring, the game is at an end. Merely streaking ahead is not enough to secure victory, however; it is the support and alleigances secured along the way that decide which druid is the First Druid!&#10;&#10;Each player has as many points as the number his druid piece is on at the end, plus additional points for allied tribes and spirits. Tribes and Spirits count 1 point for the first in a run, 2 for the second, 3 for the third etc.&#10;&#10;So, the game is a complex balance of using your magical powers to race ahead and gaining allies. In addition, trilothon stones enhance your supply of magic, and dressing the alter stone may move you ahead or even move your rivals backwards!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Meets &amp; Bounds is intended as a fast-playing game which has players attempting to optimize their score while managing the uncertainty of what opportunities chance will offer.&#10;&#10;Number of players: 2&ndash;5&#10;&#10;Object of the game: In Meets &amp; Bounds players vie to control as many spaces as possible. Each player will attempt to establish a sector of his own while thwarting his opponent's efforts. Each player will be rewarded for the size of his sector, as well as the number of groups and bounded disks he can contain within his sector. Some players may even form more than one sector. The player with the most victory points will win the game.&#10;Getting Started&#10;&#10;Equipment: Board&#10;All cards&#10;5-10 disks per player&#10;&#10;For 2 players use 10 disks per player.&#10;For 3 players use 7 disks per player.&#10;For 4 players use 6 disks per player.&#10;For 5 players use 5 disks per player.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for holding sectors. A sector is a range of numbered spaces with no disks of an opponent within, and bounded by 2 of the player&rsquo;s disks. Players also score victory points for friendly disks within their sectors. Finally, players score points for groups of 2 or more of their own playing pieces in contiguous spaces.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Sectors: Score 1 point for each numbered space of the range. A range is always the largest possible area bounded by the pieces of a single color.&#10;&#10;Bounded Pieces: Score 1 point for each interior disk within a sector. Bounded pieces never define a range.&#10;&#10;Groups of 2: 1 point per piece. The two pieces must be contiguous.&#10;&#10;Groups of 3 or more: 2 points per piece. Groups must be contiguous.&#10;&#10;Scoring Example: White has pieces in 6 night, 7 day, 9 day, 12 day, 13 night. There are no pieces belonging to opponents in any spaces between 6-13. White will score 8 points for their sector. White will score 3 points for Bounded Pieces (7, 9, 12). White will score 2 points for the group of two pieces that are contiguous (12 day &amp; 13 night). Note that 6 night and 7 day are not contiguous, and therefore do not score as a group. White scores a total of 13 points.&#10;&#10;",

Besides making you dizzy, you would have to deal with wind, rain, and perhaps huge monolithic rocks magicly moved in your way by powerful wizards. The Olympic Games of ancient Greece came to mind. Granted we still have Olympic Games, but they are much tamer than the win or die type games of the original Olympics. What if the Celts also had a version of these games. Stonehenge would make a perfect field for such a competition. Start by running along the tops of the outer ring while trying to keep your balance, especially in strong winds. Just looking at it I couldn't help but think of it as one big obstacle course that has been waiting for thousands of years to be used again. This game is the safer version of that idea.&#10;&#10;Number of players: 3&ndash;5&#10;&#10;Object of the game: You are a druid competing in the games. You will have to balance yourself on the outer ring, race between the two rings, hurdle the inner ring, and then push yourself to the breaking point in an attempt to be the first one to the alter.&#10;&#10;Equipment: Druid Olympics uses the board, the deck, one figure for each player, one disk and one bar for each player, the trilithons, and one disk of each color.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player reaches the alter stone. This player is the Grand Champion and is celebrated as a hero. The rest are sacrificed.&#10;&#10;",

If two or more of a player's colors are tied, that player picks one to discard. The player with the most awards left after discarding his or her best color, wins.&#10;&#10;",

Die Spieler k&ouml;nnen w&auml;hlen, ob sie die Stadt im Auto oder mit dem Fahrrad erkunden wollen (andere Wege sind m&ouml;glich). Ein sehr einfaches und leider wenig anspruchsvolles Spiel.&#10;&#10;",

The draw pile is also face up so players can have a rough idea what their opponent's hand is - and then they have to guess &quot;Will they bluff?&quot;.  As in traditional War, the players reveal a card, with the larger card revealed capturing the smaller.  The alterations in Wilcox War changes the game into a small bluffing/strategy game.&#10;&#10;Base rules are for playing with two decks once through, but includes rule adjustments for playing until one person has all cards, and for single-deck games.&#10;&#10;",

These visions so troubled the Primus that she created the Explorer Corps, a division of ComStar dedicated to probing the Deep Periphery, to hunt down the threat she had foreseen.&#10;&#10;A century later, the Clan invasion made the nightmare come true - and gave the Explorer Corps a vital role in the Inner Sphere's survival. With the backing of the Draconis Combine, the Explorer Corps has expanded its operations and embarked on a massive hunt for the Clan homeworlds. Small mercenary units from all over the Inner Sphere are joining the search, hired by the Explorer Corps for secret missions into the Deep Periphery - missions from which few return...&#10;&#10;The Explorer Corps sourcebook describes the Explorer Corps' history and structure, including key personalities, operational procedures, and the Corps' efforts to locate the Clan homeworlds before the Truce of Tukayyid expires. Also included is background material on life aboard a 31st-century spacecraft and descriptions of various colonies and Clan bases in the Deep Periphery and other inhabitants of that little-known region of space. Special game rules for BattleTech, MechWarrior, and BattleSpace are designed to enhance campaigns involving space travel or planetary exploration; new material includes rules for creating new solar systems and planets to explore, as well as new types of vehicles and 'Mechs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This new board game offers a innovative approach to teaching relationship skills - one that&rsquo;s highly informative, research based and great fun. The game uses role playing and realistic scenarios to help players experience the dynamics of their life choices. With a toss of the dice, players move around the board, facing options about money, education, work, romantic and sexual activity, lifestyles, children and more! Just as in real life, each decision carries consequences which affect emotional and financial well-being all based on independent research. Winning is determined by how many good relationship decisions are made in the game, not by luck or money.&#10;&#10;",

The system is a derivation of the one used in Head to Head tennis (TCS), but without cards for each single player.&#10;Basically, after tossing a coin to decide who's to serve, roll a percentage dice on the service value of the player involved, and if the result is in the correct range, he wins the game. Otherwise, the chance to win the game passes to the opponent, that rolls on his Return value. If both players fails, game goes checking other values, until one player wins the game.&#10;There are special rules for tie-break and a random event table, that may strongly modify the result of a game, a set or even the entire match.&#10;&#10;The game comes as a pdf of 28 pages and it is sold directly by Roberto Chiavini (pumaye@gmail.com to contact&#10;&#10;",

Each player has six swimmer cards, three &quot;rascals&quot; who want to cannonball other swimmers and three divers. The pool is seeded with one swimmer during set-up.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player chooses one swimmer card and decides whether to take a normal jump or a special jump. For the normal jump, the player stands, holds the card at eye level, then drops it onto the playing area. A diver scores points if it touches no other swimmer cards, with more points being awarded if the diver jumps later in the game. A rascal must try to &quot;splash&quot; a swimmer identified by the player's left-hand neighbor. If the rascal doesn't touch this card, the player scores no points; if it does, the player scores 1-3 points depending on how successful the splash is.&#10;&#10;For a special jump, the player must hold the card over the head (for a diver) or toss the card while sitting (for a rascal). If a swimmer card touches the edge of the pool or falls completely outside the pool, the player loses 1-2 points.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after everyone's had a turn in the pool wins.&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of several generations, those in power change. Players try to influence succession and match their House's resources to the interests of the True Power in the land (often not the actual monarch). By adding new family branches, using carefully arranged marriages, and managing grants players raise their prestige in the hopes of seizing power after the inevitable downfall of the monarchy.&#10;&#10;Basic Play&#10;Each player has a house display representing their larger political family. BRANCHES make up that family, beginning the game with a same number of small family branches. Each branch is represented by a card with a branch name and spaces for GRANTS. Grants represent offices, industries, resources, contacts and so on which that part of the family has control of. There are six kinds of grants: Influence (INFL) which generates the currency for play and the five areas of control: Activism (ACT), Intellectual (INT), Religion (REL), Society (SOC) and Warfare (WAR). Grants, represented by tiles, can move around throughout the game. Some branches may also have special abilities which allow special actions or modify the values of the grants attached to them.&#10;&#10;During each turn, players may add a new branch to their House Display. Since they only may have five branches at a time, they will eventually have to Marry or merge two of those houses, creating a new branch. Each turn players gain currency in the form of influence, bid to add a branch, support those in power, and take actions. Some actions can always be taken, while others require the use of particular grant types. At the end of the turn, players check to see which Royal currently holds sway in the realm. Players score VPs based on the interests of that Royal and how well their various branches and grants match those.&#10;&#10;",

After two and a half centuries of devastating interstellar warfare, the Inner Sphere is poised on the brink of a new age, as signaled by the recent alliance between Davion and House Steiner's Lyran Commonwealth. The Davions and Steiners have powerful enemies, though, all of whom have grouped together in a desperate attempt to prevent an irretrievable tile in the balance of power...&#10;&#10;This ComStar casebook covers the history of the Federated Suns and its ruling family, its military forces, government, economy, culture and daily life, along with dozens of full-color illustrations.

It doesn't provide any new rules, but it does provide useful background for all three games, particularly the stellar atlas of the Federated Suns, showing all of the planets under House Davion control in 3025, and a complete breakdown of military units by location together with detail on a number of units to allow them to be easily generated for BattleForce campaigns.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;&quot;The Star League  was the greatest achievement of mankind, a golden age of prosperity and advancement the likes of which had never been seen. Led by the noble Cameron family, the League united all of humanity under one banner for the first time.&#10;&#10;But the League also had its dark side. Not everyone wanted to be a part of such an undertaking. The rulers of the League were forced to use their military might to bring the nations of the Periphery into the fold. Many resented the League for this action and it would eventually lead to the League's downfall.&#10;&#10;For wicked men plot the League's demise. Stefan Amaris, cursed forever after as one of the greatest villains in history, wants the destroy the League from within and has corrupted the young First Lord. He is opposed by Aleksandr Kerensky, General of the Star League's armies, who is willing to do whatever it takes to defeat the Usurper.&#10;&#10;In this sourcebook, ComStar presents the history and the tragedy of the Star League.&quot;&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;This sourcebook contains more detail on the Star League than any other BattleTech publication, and hasn't been reprinted. Although rules for Star League equipment and 'Mechs were detailed in the Technical Readout: 2750, this book provides a wealth of background detail on the Star League, and is one of a very small number of publications to include an atlas and map of the Star League and the Terran Hegemony. Some of the detail from this book relating to the Star League Defence Force was later reprinted in the German edition of the Technical Readout: 2750.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;&quot;When Morgan and Patrick Kell first formed the mercenary Kell Hounds in 3010, few thought they'd survive for long. When Katrina Steiner gave them a contract, the Hounds wasted no time becoming one of the most feared and respected merc units in the Inner Sphere.&#10;&#10;It was not the first or last time that the fate of the Kells would become intricately bound up with House Steiner. Morgan Kell helped to save Katrina's life during an assassination plot even before she became Archon. Then it was an inheritance from Katrina's husband Arthur, a cousin of the Kells, that permitted the brothers to finance their dream of founding a merc unit. Much later, Patrick Kell gave his life to rescue Melissa Steiner, heir to the Lyran throne and Hanse Davion's fiancee, when she was kidnapped by agents of the Draconis Combine.&#10;&#10;The Kell Hounds played key roles in Davion history, too. They were there when Yorinaga Kurita killed Ian Davion on Mallory's World. They held off the Second Sword of Light long enough for Davion forces to recover the Prince's body, but Kurita escaped.&#10;&#10;From that day, Yorinaga Kurita and the Kell Hounds were destined to face one another in a series of climactic battles. When Morgan and Yorinaga dueled in one of these, a legend was born. The mystical nature of that battle left Morgan so shaken that he disbanded most of his regiment and joined a monastery.&#10;&#10;The Kell Hounds survived under the leadership of Patrick Kell. After Yorinaga killed Patrick on Styx, Morgan Kell came out of exile to rebuild his unit. He knew it was only a matter of time before he and Yorinaga would meet again on a day of final reckoning.&#10;&#10;The Kell Hounds is a scenario pack containing 11 BattleTech, 2 BattleForce, and 2 MechWarrior scenarios. It also provides personality profiles on the principal members of the Kell Hounds, a unit roster, and a history of the unit.&quot;&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;These scnearios cover the period in time between the formation of the Kell Hounds and the opening of the Fourth Succession War. It also contains more scenarios than preceeding scenario packs, despite being only 63 pages long.&#10;&#10;",

Orders of battle are given in terms of the popular DBA/DBM miniatures rules, though there is enough information given for adapting the battles to other rules systems as desired.  While DBA usually focuses on armies composed of exactly 12 elements, the scenarios included vary in size depending on the numbers of combatants.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll the dice in an effort to increase their fortunes and build their &quot;budding&quot; business. But in this game, danger awaits you at every turn and getting busted is just a roll of the dice away. Each player rolls two numbered dice (1-6) and one event dice with the event die determining what the numbers stand for, where even numbers equal good results and odd numbers equal bad results. The game contains two numbered dice, one event die, 100 chips and a rules card. Each player starts with 10 chips (their stash) with the remaining chips forming the pot, and the one with the biggest stash when the pot runs out wins.&#10;&#10;",

At the suggestion of General Kerensky they appointed Jerome Blake as Minister of Communications and charged him with repairing the damaged HPG network. This would prove a momentous decision.&#10;&#10;Within a few short years after Kerensky's Exodus, Blake and his followers had seized control of Terra and declared themselves neutral in the coming conflicts. The newly-named ComStar evolved into a pseudo-religious organization, with Blake as its divine founder, that positioned itself as the keeper of technology and the preserver of humanity's future.&#10;&#10;For nearly 300 years, ComStar watched as the Succession Wars ripped apart the Inner Sphere and technology was lost, waiting for the day when they would step in to save humanity from a new dark age. But the 31st century changed all of that.&#10;&#10;This sourcebook presents the history and inner workings of ComStar, including the devastating schism that struck the sect in the days following their victory over the Clans at Tukayyid.&quot;&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;This sourcebook is largely background detail provided in much the same format as the earlier background books such as House Steiner: The Lyran Commonwealth or The Periphery although it runs up to 3055 rather than 3025. This sourcebook includes details of the Nexus, Raijin and Grand Crusader 'Mechs, which were reprinted in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The main objective of the game is to collect seven of one type of victory card. Players must balance their play between researching technologies, expanding cities and building units. Having only a limited number of actions per turn, it is important for players to consider their activities carefully so that they maximize their ability to collect cards. The first player to collect seven of one type of victory card wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is based on hex-grid map boards and players can choose which sections of the map to assemble. Currently there are maps of Europe and the Caribbean, although plans for future maps will cover the entire world. Players lay tiles down to form cities and can build military units to protect them or attack others. Cities create the wealth that a player needs to further their empire.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to perform their moves, building their empire up while keeping a close eye on their neighbors to prevent them beating them to the end. Open play allows players to watch other players activities, and manage resources in way that can stop other players winning while not hindering their own advancement.&#10;&#10;The game has been designed to give flexibility to the rules so that players can develop in-house versions of the rules without breaking the game. One popular alteration is in the collection of cards. Players can change the speed and dynamic of the game by changing how many and of which types of card need to be collected.&#10;&#10;The game is fully customizable allowing players to design their own versions including army units, maps, technologies and rules.

    "Description": "75 well-known authors and one work each is known for is the basis of this Bingo-type 'educational' game. Each player gets one of 40 'GRAFO' cards, a 5 by 5 grid where each square has an author number, an author's name, and his or her image. The caller randomly pulls from the stock of 75 tokens, and reads aloud the column letter (G, R, A, F, or O) and title of a play, book, poem, or short story and optionally the author number. If the author of that work is on his or her card, a player marks that square with a translucent disk, hoping to be the first to get five in a row. Can be played in three difficulty levels:&#10;&#10;1) Playing by the numbers. The caller reads the column letter, title, and author number. This makes the game no harder than Bingo with some trivia thrown in.&#10;&#10;2) Playing by the book. The caller omits the author number, but players have access to a &quot;Bio/graphics&quot; booklet in which they can find the author of the named work.&#10;&#10;3) Playing for mastery. Players no longer have access to the book and have to recall from memory the author of the named work.&#10;&#10;A player calls &quot;Grafo&quot; when he or she covers five squares in a row on his or her card, and once verified is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

You will throw dice to determine what goods will be on offer at each planet. Available goods will vary from turn to turn, so buy low and sell high while the market is friendly to you. But if luck abandons you, you may be driven to Bankruptcy by greedy Pirates and zealous Customs controls (if you dare to smuggle any illegal goods).&#10;The game ends when you turn over the last unexplored card on the Galactic Chart, or when you run out of money.&#10;&#10;This game is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License - that means you can use and modify the game for free, but you can't sell it or claim it as your own.&#10;&#10;",

All of the fish are assigned different values. &#10;The winner is the player with the most 'fish points' at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game:&#10;&#10;Deal five action cards to each player.&#10;Pile the remaining Action Cards, Lure Cards and Location Cards at the side of the table.&#10;&#10;There are three simple phases that make up a player's turn:&#10;&#10;Draw Phase: Draw one card from the game deck&#10;Action Phase: You may play an Action Card if you want. Simply follow th einstructions on the Action Card. Limit one per turn.&#10;Fish Phase: On this phase a player may do ONE of three things:&#10;&#10;Move to a location- Take a location card and place in front of you.&#10;Put on a lure- Take a lure card from your tackle box and place in front of you.&#10;Catch a fish- Take a fish from your hand that matches the correct lure and correct location you are in.&#10;&#10;Afteryour fishing phase is over the next player goes.&#10;&#10;Winning:&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player has caught their limit of ten fish. At this point the winner is determined by the player with the most points. Therefore the player who caught ten fish may not necessarily be the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

They nearly killed the heir to the throne.&#10;&#10;This ComStar document details the history and development of Clan Jade Falcon from their beginnings in the chaos of the Exodus Civil War to the battlefields of Tukayyid. Contains a complete roster of the invading Jade Falcon forces, along with personality profiles of prominent officers.&quot;&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;Providing a counterpoint to the BattleTech: Wolf Clan sourcebook, the Jade Falcon sourcebook gives a crusader-faction viewpoint on some events before delving into the Jade Falcon part in the invasion of the Inner Sphere. Largely useful for background reference in use in MechWarrior, or in forming campaign scnearios for BattleTech/BattleForce. It also provided profiles for four new BattleMechs - the Baboon, Hellhound, Kraken and Vixen, which were reprinted in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3055 Upgrade a decade later.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hilarious party game for 5-10 adult players. No matter what the truth is Revelations will reveal the sins, but exactly who the sinners are will remain stricly private! You should expect to have some hilarious and lively discussions as you try to work out how many of your friends have, for example, been caught shoplifting.&#10;&#10;The object of this game is to guess the number of your fellow players who have commited each &quot;sin&quot; but exactly who has commited the sin will remain a secret! This game is not really suitable for children as some of the questions are a little on the risky side....but it will provide hours of amusing fun for groups of open minded adults and is a superb party game!&#10;&#10;",
