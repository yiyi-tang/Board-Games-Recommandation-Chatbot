Three sides depict numbers that you can use the dice in place of that numbered card. One side is a Skip-Bo you can use as a wild.

    "Description": "The WFF games (Shake-a-WFF and Count-a-WFF) are the first two in a series of 21 games called WFF 'N Proof. The two WFF games are concerned with the construction of WFFs (well formed formulas). A WFF (pronounced &quot;woof&quot;) is a expression in a system of mathematical logic that is roughly equivalent to a sentence in English prose. In the WFF games, certain sequences of letters are considered WFFs, and players attempt to arrange an increasing number of letter dice to create ever-longer true sentences, or WFFs.&#10;&#10;In Shake-a-WFF, the two players practice recognition and construction of WFFs. Players use six capital-letter dice, six small-letter dice, and a Shake-a-WFF playing mat (one mat each). Each player begins with three dice, and seeks to create a WFF using the letters they've rolled. Each round, players add or subtract a die from their shaking set according to whether they successfully created a WFF in the previous round or not. The first player to create a WFF with eight dice wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Count-a-WFF, two or more players simultaneously view the same set of rolled dice to try to create the longest single WFF from the letters rolled. Each player attempts to maximize their score for a specified number of plays; the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The game includes 12 special lettered dice, 2 Shake-a-WFF player mats, and a 78-page rules and examples manual.&#10;&#10;",

But we all could use a little kokua in learning new Hawaiian huaolelo or brushing up on our vocab. Hulo! is a fast, fun, and easy way to practice your Hawaiian vocabulary. Whether you know five Hawaiian words or five hundred, you can enjoy learning with friends and family as you race to complete your Hawaiian crossword.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Hulo! is themed after the old Hawaiian nupepa, or newspapers, which didn&rsquo;t have diacritics. So you can play without worrying about okina and kahako markings.    &#10;     Wondering if you can use people or place names? Hiki no! Go right ahead. So even if you don&rsquo;t know many Hawaiian words, you probably know a lot of names of people, streets, cities, and other places.&#10;     Two-letter huaolelo are okay.&#10;     You can use the same word twice.&#10;     Going over the pronunciation and definitions at the end is one of the funnest parts of the game. See how many new huaolelo you can learn from the other players.&#10;     Instructions are included inside the box.&#10;&#10;&#10;You'll find a few pieces that aren't letters.&#10;&#10;Watch out for the Ewalu piece! If someone draws it and plays it on you, aue! Aloha no! That means your crossword has to have at least one eight-letter huaolelo. Laki maikai!&#10;&#10;Need some different letters to spell a huaolelo? If you draw an Akau piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the akau, right.&#10;&#10;If you draw a Hema piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the hema, left.&#10;&#10;The Ku! piece is like a wildcard, so you can use it as any letter of your choosing. Or, if someone is winning and you want to stop their momentum, yell out &quot;Ku!&quot; to stop gameplay. You can then take one of their letters, replace it with the Ku! piece, and designate the Ku! piece as a different letter. Ho ke kolohe! What this means for your opponent is probably a lot of crossword rearranging! Minamina no hoi!&#10;&#10;The Ea piece is the one everybody wants to have. It means you have ea, or sovereignty, so nobody can mess with your crossword. In other words, you're free to make your own huaolelo without being affected by special pieces like Ewalu, Akau, Hema, and Ku. You are kuokoa--independent!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

A huge monstrosity held in its tomb only by the walls of the ancient cellar.  Did it come from another world, the depths of the earth or is it the Counts long forgotten father?  Either way the only thing keeping from breaking out and devouring the world is feeding  it plenty of sewer Critters.  And what unlucky fool gets this job you ask?  Why you of course!  One of the dozens of hapless servants that work under the Counts rule.&#10;&#10;Feed the Beast is a simple and fast-paced dice game of gambling and luck.  Players compete against each other to fumble in the sewers for Critters and then feed the gigantic Beast in a Medieval setting.&#10;&#10;On a players turn they roll dice to move, search for critters or feed the Beast. Play continues until one player manages to give the beast his fill of Critters, that player is then the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Agoraphobia is an abstract strategy game for two players in which each player seeks to push their opponents pieces into large groups.  Each turn, a player places one agoraphobe on a hexagonal grid.  When it is places, each agoraphobe pushes all adjacent pieces away by either one or two spaces, depending on the size of the piece that was played.  An agoraphobe may only be placed if it pushes at least one piece away, leaving it sufficient breathing room.  The game ends when one player can not place any of their remaining pieces.  The player who ends the game with the largest group of adjacent pieces is the loser.&#10;&#10;",

Players do this by choosing either a &quot;Hunt for Food&quot; card or a &quot;Search for Jewels&quot; card. The &quot;Hunt for Food&quot; cards include various animals worth a number of stripes. Monkeys let you add one stripe to your tiger, snakes add two, deer add three and boars add four. However, this deck contains several &quot;Give One Stripe to Any Tiger&quot; cards, so don't push your luck too far.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, players may choose a &quot;Search for Jewels&quot; card. These cards contain various numbers of jewels worth one point each. These add directly to your score. This deck also includes some &quot;Take a Jewel Card from Another Tiger&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;When a tiger gains all ten of its stripes, the game is over. Players count up how many points they have from jewels, then subtract two points for each missing stripe. The player with the highest score wins. Tiger Stripes enhances basic math skills in a fun and engaging way.&#10;&#10;",

They know their nuke will wipe out all traces of their crimes when the Countdown ends, but what of the small chance that a survivor escapes with the Hermit and his Intel?&#10;&#10;Enter the MBI Black Ops squad, a team of 5 deadly Soldiers under the command of the ruthless Chrissy. Will they pick off any lucky survivors before the Countdown wipes out the rest of them? Or will they fall victim to the heroes much like the horde of Undead surrounding them all?&#10;&#10;Introducing a new playable character, CHRISSY: the fair-haired Controller of the Black Ops squad. Ant was once his greatest student until Chrissy's thirst for innocent blood turned the young soldier against his team and into a life of isolation. Now armed with an even deadlier group of 5 Black Ops Soldiers, Chrissy has been sent into the heart of Zombie-infested Endicott with a simple mission from the heads of MBI: kill everyone and everything before it can escape the end of the Nuclear Countdown.&#10;&#10;Hidden within the play deck amongst the flesh-craving Undead are the five Black Ops Soldiers. Uncover one, and become marked for execution. Try to fend off the Soldier with all your might until the sneaky assassins slither back into hiding within the remainder of the deck. Beware, once you are marked you run the risk of being executed sooner than you think! Take a breather from combating the Undead in order to attempt to remove the marks; but don't spend too much time to yourself - every attempt to remove a mark, whether successful or not, will cost you some of your slain Zombies.&#10;&#10;When the time comes, Chrissy will send out the command to his Soldiers to EXECUTE! Roll the die when the command is drawn; the matching marks are instantly executed and players take damage (potentially fatal, if you have a hard time removing your marks). But that's not all - sometimes the Execute commands will allow more than one Soldier to execute their marks, spelling certain doom for any players who have unwillingly collected a variety of marks from several different Soldiers. If you fall victim to one of the Soldiers, respawning is no longer an option. You are instantly killed and any Cure cards you were holding become compromised with the Solders' evil decoy-deception. Now your allies must roll a successful Cure Retrieval value TWICE before they can take the Cure card and win the game.&#10;&#10;Despite their advantages in both stealth and strength, the Black Ops Soldiers are still only human. If you can manage to do so, killing one will reward you dearly - not in points and not in monetary value, but with the knowledge that you and your comrades can walk the desolate streets of an apocalyptic Endicott with a bit more safety. But beware - the Zombies still run amok, and they LOVE adrenaline-pumped prey!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;18 Game Cards &#10;88 5/8&quot; Chits &#10; 7 Game Mats&#10; 1 Full Color 2-sided rules sheet&#10;&#10;",

In the base game, players move their magnetized figures across a game board in order to claim symbols, but a metal ball is attached to their figure underneath the board; if they try to pass through a hidden wall in the labyrinth under the board, they lose their marble and return to their starting corner. Remember where the hidden walls lie underneath the game board, and you'll graduate from being an apprentice magician in no time.&#10;&#10;Das magische Labyrinth: Erweiterung adds only a handful of elements to the base game: eight magic walls (that can replace up to eight walls from the basic game) along with four magic wands, magic potions and nightcaps, with each player receiving one of each of these objects.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can use the power of one of these objects, then remove it from the game: The nightcap covers another player, costing her a turn; the potion lets you move as far as you would like, until you hit the target symbol or a wall; and the wand lets you replace the symbol you are currently searching for with a new one from the bag before moving.&#10;&#10;As for the magic walls, they allow movement through a section of the labyrinth in only one direction. Approach from one direction, and the wall will fold over and let you pass. Approach the other way, however, and *snap* there goes your marble. It's back to start for you, Merlin...&#10;&#10;",

Walker, of 600 men, left Ft. Laramie.

They cover specifically the mythical world, Middle Earth, created by Professor J. R. R. Tolkien in his books The Hobbit, and trilogy, Lord of the Rings. Originating from a set of notes hastily written, these rules are the final result of the best part of a years research and playtesting.&#10;&#10;Most sets of rules designed to cover this facet of wargaming published previously have been modified from the Ancient Period. However these have been written exclusively for the Middle Earth wargamer. This is why they include an extensive section on morale and a unique and totally new system for the working of magic. The rules are for 20mm scale battles fought between the West and the forces of Mordor. Elements such as Saruman, Balrogs and Dragons have been omitted because they are superfluous for this type of battle and would only lengthen the rules.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Era Report: 3052 describes the state of the Inner Sphere and the Clans at a pivotal period in BattleTech history: the early years of the Clan Invasion. Presented as a general overview of the period, rather than a focused report on a single conflict, this book includes descriptions of every major Inner Sphere and Clan faction. Notable personalities, military forces, and an overview of the technological capabilities of the Inner Sphere and Clan powers of this critical era in history are also provided, along with special advanced-level rules for campaigns set in this era, whether played using the Total Warfare core rules or those found in A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;For three hundred years, the nations of the Inner Sphere waged war in the name of the fallen Star League, sending armies of MechWarriors into battle for glory and power. Yet even as BattleMechs clashed over the forgotten ruins of humanity&rsquo;s Golden Age, the descendants of the long-lost Star League Defense Force gathered their might among distant stars.&#10;Then, in 3048, amid reports of a technological renaissance in the Sphere, the leaders of Kerensky&rsquo;s children decided the time for invasion had come. The Clan Invasion would transform the face of warfare and the fate of nations across the Inner Sphere, marking an all new era for all of humankind.&#10;&#10;",

They each pick 3 (or more) of their gladiators and send them into the arena trying to kill their opponents Gladiators.  Then the next group of Gladiators are sent in, until they have all fought.  Lastly, all the surviving Gladiators are returned to the arena for a final battle.&#10;&#10;This game uses a move action/attack action allotment with a counterattack element.  It was based on an Abstract theme at first, then a minor coin-flipping mechanic was added later on.&#10;&#10;This game was produced for the One Full-Sheet Label contest.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Boundaries Baseball helps children understand and respect boundaries.  Boundaries are essential for positive relationships with peers and adults; children who act out are often asking for the security of clear boundaries and the skills needed to respect them.&#10;&#10;Boundaries Baseball utilizes a baseball diamond format as a visual reminder for not going out of bounds.  As part of the action of the play, students will also have opportunities to toss a &ldquo;ball&rdquo; so that it stays within the boundaries of a &ldquo;strike zone.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Game cards teach four kinds of boundaries: &#10;(1) Saying and accepting &ldquo;No,&rdquo;.&#10;(2) Managing strong emotions (called feelings in the game).&#10;(3) Respecting personal space and property.&#10;(4) Relationship/communication limits.&#10;&#10;Players use a special spinner to see what happens for each pitch.  For example, they could get a strike, a ball, a single, or a pop fly out. Players move their pawns, counterclockwise around the diamond. Their pawns are baseball players (see photo). The players then advance according to the instructions on the spinner and pick and answer cards that match the color of the space landed on. For example, a strike results in going back one space, a ball advances the player three spaces, and a single brings the player to the next base.  The four decks of cards correspond to the four categories of boundaries mentioned above.  When players reach home plate, they add one to their score on the scoreboard.&#10;&#10;",

The game teaches seven specific skills that have been proven in the research literature to help impulsive children control their impulses, make good decisions, and avoid actions that are detrimental to themselves and others.&#10;&#10;The skills learned in the game are:&#10;-Accepting delayed gratification&#10;-Reading social cues&#10;-Understanding the benefits of impulse control&#10;-Developing positive self talk&#10;-Improving problem solving skills&#10;-Understanding the consequences of impulsive actions&#10;-Improving the ability to stop a behavior&#10;&#10;In the game, players drive their cars, making their way through a maze of roads. At each intersection they have to make a decision regarding the best path. Some paths are shorter, but contain various hazards that are represented by road signs. In order to do well in the game, players are forced to delay decisions until the facts and consequences have been considered and to plan ahead. Players have a great time as they learn these impulse control skills and use them to plan and find the best route to their destination.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem during childhood and adolescence. The recommended treatment approach for anxiety is overwhelmingly Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). Bridge Over Worried Waters is essentially a CBT program in a box that incorporates all of these techniques.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players place a Worried Waters raging river sheet in front of them. Then they choose a Problem card that describes an anxiety-producing situation. Players then decide on an appropriate Solution card to use as a positive strategy to address the anxiety in the situation. Solution cards include: Self-Talk Cards challenge self-defeating thoughts by replacing negative thoughts with positive,optimistic thoughts. Relaxation Cards calm down by using deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and meditation. Coping Cards distract by diverting attention away from anxious feelings to fun or effortful activities. When the problem has been successfully solved with one of the Solution cards, the player then tosses the Situation card into the Worried Waters, and the Solution card is used to create the foundation or top of a bridge. The object of the game is to build a bridge that carries the player across the Worried Waters to the safety of the other bank.&#10;&#10;There are both competitive and cooperative versions&#10;&#10;",

Once a player manages to fit all his tiles in one structure, the assembly stops and points are scored, with one point for each full circle in a player's structure and negative points for unused tiles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kriegspiel (the card game) is the worlds fastest (and easiest to learn) war game.  The game teaches anyone the basics of card war game tactics in a way that is fast and fun.&#10;&#10;     The game modifies Rock-Paper-Scissors to Infantry-Cavalry-Artillery and adds the basics of the old card game, &quot;War&quot; to the concept. Players each play one card, facedown, at a time, and the winner takes the trick.  The player with the most tricks at the end of the game is the winner.  Due to game construction, there is always a winner, never a tie.&#10; Kriegspiel, the card game, is the latest in the Warcoach Games &quot;10 Minute War Game&quot; series.&#10;&#10;",

Like many players, I felt the 1-3 player experience felt like tacked on, where each player just plays the role of 2 or more people.&#10;&#10;To rectify this situation, I made a new board designed for a 1-3 player experience (similar to the idea of using a different board for smaller games in Small World). I dubbed the ship Little Duckling. Simply print and mount the board (on the back of the Sitting Duck if you really like it).&#10;&#10;The rules (with examples and clear diagrams) and a complete set of missions (from tutorials through simulations to missions) are included in the Little Duckling handbook.&#10;&#10;This has been play tested and I hope produces a balanced and fun 1-3 player experience for you as well.&#10;&#10;Released in the File Section of Space Alert, this expansion has had its graphics updated by paulmond.&#10;&#10;",

Eventually someone will be accused of lying.  In the case of a lie, the &quot;seller&quot; removes an article of clothing as directed by the sixth die, while in the case of the truth it's the accuser who does so.&#10;&#10;",

All other players then simultaneously try to answer the question by secretly placing one of their four answers cards (A,B,C or D) face down on the table. Each player with the correct answer then progresses his meeple on a linear track, according to the predetermined difficulty rating of the question.&#10;&#10;The questions are divided into the categories Science, History, Sport, Culture, People and Local. Some are simple and some are very tricky. For example, one can score if one knows that the local museum houses the original death mask of William Shakespeare, that the 1990 world-championship in solar racing was won by students of the city's university, that &quot;Kn&auml;&auml;rze&quot; is local slang for the end piece of a bread, or the country were the 2009 world championship in amateur boxing had been won by a local boxer.&#10;&#10;The game is of standard quality for a German boardgame with 6 classical wooden meeples and a full-color thick cardboard board. Each of the 165 full-sized double-sided question cards features a color photo or picture in relation to its question.&#10;&#10;",

The plague of brain-chomping quasi-dead, previously discounted and denied, have &#10;become a genuine menace in several major cities. Every government has its own notions of how to deal with it, major corporations seek to &#10;manipulate the crisis, military leaders push against the limits of civilian control, and the zombies simply&hellip;hunger.&#10;&#10;&#10;Zombie War is a 2-4 player game that takes the zombie threat to a global level. Each player has two hidden victory conditions and has to reach them using a rotating selection of roles, each with different powers and ways to gain victory points. In one turn you might be playing as the zombies, the next the government, the next the military, and finally the corporations. Yet, your victory conditions--for example, to infect three major capitals, or protect trade centers-- remain the same. The decisions you make as one role affect the other players, but may also affect you when you take on a different role in the next round. It is multiplayer mayhem on a strategic level.&#10;&#10; &#10;Zombie War takes about 60-90 minutes to play, is recommended for two to four players ages 14 and up, and includes:&#10; &#10;        1 x 22&quot; x 17&quot; richly-colored map of the world.&#10;        70 die-cut counters representing hordes of zombies, the medical personnel assigned to contain them, and the soldiers assigned to kill them.&#10;        18 victory condition, faction, and player aid cards.&#10;        Full-color rule book.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

The Seed &amp; Feed stocks a random number of seeds of differing types that they give out to poor, local farmers. These farmers all share the same land and operate as a small co-op. The only problem is that the farmers are rather insane and decide, by lottery, which plots of land each farmer tends.&#10;&#10;This is a game for 1 or more players. The materials needed are the included game board, chits, dice labels, 10 beads (tokens, chits, M&amp;Ms, coins, a spinner&ndash;a d10 works wonderfully here.) to keep track of which turn you&rsquo;re on, and 3d6. There must be one standard die with the numbers 1-6 printed on it and you need 2 blank dice (or the willingness to put labels over your standard dice).&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to score the most points after 10 rounds of game play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Salmandaar Lite is a semi-coop game for 1-6 players wherein the players spawn armies from castles located at the points of a hexagonal island and try to withstand the invasion of Fire Salamanders pouring forth from the volcano in the center of the island. The island and counters are all contained in the PDF that will be submitted to the file section, as will the instructions.&#10;&#10;Player units represent workers, resources and military, and can be spent in attack, to build roads, or to support the generation of more units by providing infrastructure at the player's home castle. Players are expected to generally cooperate in repelling the Fire Salamander invasion, but player combat is possible and might be necessary to defend your castle from players fleeing Salamander overruns of their own lands. Combat with both the invaders and other players is by mutual removal, representing the consumption of both forces and materials and wealth, or will dice rolls, which might result in removal of the enemy without loss of the player unit, or might result in defeat and removal of the attacking unit. Both players and the invading Salamanders will start spawning from any captured castles.&#10;&#10;Paper unit markers are provided, and are color-blindness friendly, but wooden cubes of assorted colors would be a great substitute.&#10;&#10;At the end of every round (after the last player takes a turn), advance a marker on the turn track. Game ends after ten rounds, or if all players are eliminated.  Winner is the player with the most castles and armies afield at game end.&#10;&#10;This is a PnP version of a game still in development, Salamandaar (sans Lite,) for the One Sheet PnP contest. The PnP version is a fixed map, though I will provide additional maps.  The final non-lite version of the game will feature a fixed intro map over which random map tiles may be placed, or placed according to scenario.  The non-lite version will feature a larger map as well, and some more robust player abilities, some more ways to spend units.&#10;&#10;Variant:  Add a seventh player, who runs the Salamanders, ignoring the target priority rules and moving as he/she wishes.&#10;&#10;",

Shadows flit through the trees as the Jungle Elves prepare for war. An age has passed since last they were seen, but soon all of Itharia will recall that the Phoenix Elves do not stand alone for all of elfkind. Trained lions move through the greenery, the strongest bearing warriors upon their backs. Those who might spy this secret muster will find themselves riddled with arrows, courtesy of elite archers. And there are those who say even the trees themselves have come alive to join the coming battle.&#10;&#10;At the head of this army is Abua Shi, a powerful Summoner whose Summoning Stone was earned through betrayal and lies. He is driven by a secret shame, one that can only be set right through the act of violent revenge.&#10;&#10;Contents: 35 cards (1 complete faction deck)&#10;&#10;Jungle Elves Faction Deck Includes: &#10;1 Abua Shi - Summoner&#10;1 Miti Mumway - Champion&#10;1 Makeinda Ru - Champion&#10;1 Shikwa - Champion&#10;8 Lioness - Common&#10;6 Archer - Common&#10;4 Lioneer - Common&#10;2 Chant of Deception Events&#10;2 Chant of Haste Events&#10;2 Chant of Life Events&#10;2 Chant of Negation Events&#10;1 Chant of Salvation Event&#10;3 Wall Cards &#10;1 Summoner Reference Card&#10;&#10;",
