Of course I am! ...somehow ...&#10;&#10;But do the others think similar about me?&#10;&#10;Psychometer has the final answers for these questions.&#10;&#10;Choose from 560 attributes. Three randomly drawn cards are placed side by side. Arrows on the outer cards will point on two attributes on the center card. The player whose turn it is chooses one of these attributes and asks the other players how they rate himself in regard of this attribute (like: &quot;I am funny&quot; or &quot;I make friends easily&quot;). All players (including the active player) secretly rate how much they think that the chosen attribute is correct. The players have numbered cards from 1 to 3 (4, 5 - depending on the number of players) which they play face-down. All cards are then flipped face-up. The numbers are added up, the sum is looked up in a table which will tell which number will grant its player a point. The more the player's ratings are off, the fewer players (if any) will score points. Then it is the next player's turn. Whoever scores eight/ten/twelve points first (depending on the number of players) is the winner.&#10;&#10;28 attribute cards (560 attributes)&#10;30 scoring cards&#10;2 cards with scoring tables (depending on the number of players)&#10;30 scoring tokens&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;",

The rule book includes a full list of vessels; a description of each; an example fleet list; and for those who would like more information on the period, the appendix includes some historical notes and a list of recommended reading material.&#10;&#10;The rules allow for battles under oars, under sail, or a combination of the two and cater for anything from a single ship up to large fleet actions. Rod's Ability Chart system is used - a tried and tested method of reducing dice throwing and paperwork.&#10;&#10;Serenissima is designed to be user friendly and easy to understand. The rules give an authentic result with a reasonably short time and include all the aspects of warfare at sea during the Renaissance period.&#10;&#10;As was the case at the time, warfare 'under oars' predominates. However, should players wish, mechanisms exist to allow their vessels to go into action under sail or a combination of sail and oar.&#10;&#10;Statistics for all the main vessels of the period, whether oared, sailed or combined, are covered, so players have a wide choice as to the composition of their fleets.&#10;&#10;Serenissima is a full rule set, as opposed fast-play. However, it was felt unnecessary to give comprehensive sailing attitudes for vessels under sail. Their rudimentary sail plans meant that unless the wind was favourable (generally from the quarter or astern), they tended to anchor to await better conditions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this fast-paced card game each player takes on the role of a drag queen trying to out-perform her peers at the club.  On your turn you can play one card from your hand and the first player to earn 10 points of GLAM wins!&#10;&#10;&quot;Show Move&quot; cards, such as &quot;Shimmy the Girls&quot; and &quot;Hit the High Note&quot;, benefit your own performance and give you points.  &quot;Bitch Move&quot; cards, such as &quot;Smack Talk&quot; and &quot;Kick Her Canckles&quot;, hinder the other players' performances and make them lose points.&#10;&#10;You could also play nasty-sounding drink cards, such as the &quot;Turd Spackle&quot;, on a player which slowly gets them drunk and makes them lose points every turn until  they can pass it on.&#10;&#10;Fabulous card art from Stan Yan and witty catch phrases from Layman Kingsford help to inspire players to get catty with each other in true drag queen style.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Russo-Georgian War of 2008 is a DTP simulation game covering the military action during that conflict from August 8 2008 through August 12, 2008.  This involved full-on combat between the Republic of Georgia and the Russian Federation plus two breakaway regions of Georgia; Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The fighting began in the Ossetia (the primary Georgian target) and quickly spread to all of Georgia and Abkhazia.&#10;&#10;At first glance this seems like a fight between David and Goliath - the vast Russian military against a state with only about 20,000 active duty personnel in it's military and only 7 combat jets - but closer examination reveals it was a somewhat stiffer competition with several points of interest.  It was with this thought that this game was inspired.&#10;&#10;The game is relatively straight forward to learn and play and the system, while adapted to the conflict, very familiar to most wargamers.  Learning and playing the game can be done fairly quickly.  The game is play-balanced due to a selection of real-world scenarios, including the historical situation.&#10;&#10;This is a Desk Top Published (DTP)game - gluing and cutting of counters is required.&#10;&#10;SCALE - Game Turns represent 12 hours, units typically represent battallions of 500 - 1000 men plus some smaller and larger, units and hexes on the map are approximately 12 kilometers across.&#10;&#10;",

The game has 61 cards, each one depicting one event of German history from 1949-2010.&#10;&#10;The game contains two variants. The first variant is a simple guessing game if the hidden card from the top of your stack is earlier or later than the current open card. The second game is a bit more interesting for gamers. One player reads an event and the other players offer one of their events which should be as close as possible to the first event. The first player then decides which event is closest to his event. If he's right, he and the other player can keep the card. Otherwise, only the player who has played the closest card, can keep his card. Winner is the player who first gets 5 cards.&#10;&#10;",

Besides a good memory you need to be able to work together in this game to succeed. For only together will you be able to beat Diesel.&quot;&#10;&#10;Thomas needs to find his friends, and goes looking for them in various different stations, trying to avoid running into the mean Diesel. His friends need to be found in a particular order. If he runs into Diesel once too often (5 times), then the players lose.&#10;&#10;This is a cooperative game in which the players work together to try to defeat Diesel. They can help each other with remembering where the particular friend is whom they're looking for.&#10;&#10;This game involves memory, mainly, but it's as much a cooperative activity which makes for fun game-play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mario Kard&#10;&#10;Mario Kard is a free PnP version of the popular Mario Kart videogame saga. So, this is a racing game composed of four kind of cards: &#10;1. Road Cards destinated to make modular circuits.&#10;2. Object Cards representing special items that drivers can use for themselves or against the others, these are the well known shells, mushrooms, stars,...&#10;3. Character Cards for each driver with his atributes: speed cards, first card, brake, attack and defense.&#10;4. Speed Cards; each driver has a set of four speed cards to determinate the movements and aceleration.&#10;&#10;Drivers must move using Speed Cards. If you want play Child Mode you can use a D6. &#10;D6 is needed for attack and defense.&#10;&#10;-Preparing the game&#10;&#10;First you have to build a circuit and decide the total amount of laps to win the race. There must be at least one finish line and one special Road Card  where objects appear. Then each player chooses a driver (or randomly) and takes his Speed Cards. In the Driver Card is determined what is the first Speed Card to use (that is the acceleration rate somehow).&#10;&#10;-The Race&#10;Player generally moves using a Speed Card that limits the maximun positions he can move on. He'll choose to move more or less, but allways within that limit.&#10;&#10;-Start:&#10;Put Drivers on/beside finish line. Then each driver takes a random Speed Card and moves in turn. The first will be the&#10;younger player and then continue clockwise.&#10;&#10;On the road:&#10;Each turn, every player must choose secretly one Speed Card; then Speed Cards are shown and drivers move.&#10;&#10;Get objects:&#10;In the circiut there will be a Road Card with the object icon. When drivers pass on this, they get a Object Card from the Object Card deck. Drivers only can have one object card.&#10;&#10;Attack/defense:&#10;When drivers are moving they could attack other players using Object Cards. The result is decided using Drivers Attack/Defense values, Object Attack/Defense values and a D6. Something like this:&#10;&#10;Bowser attacks Mario with a Red Shell:&#10;  Bowser attack + Red Shell attack + D6 &gt; Mario defense + D6&#10;&#10;Total attacker value must be greater than total defender value; if equal then nothing happens. Some objects could be used to add more Defense value (shells, bananas,...)&#10;&#10;If the attack is successful the loser goes off the road, loses any Object Card and must wait one turn without moving. Then He must start using Drivers first Speed Card.&#10;&#10;-Dangerous Curves:&#10;Some Road Cards have a special values like -1,-2,+1. These cards decrease Driver movement unless the Driver has a brake value bigger than 0. &#10;So if a player must go through a -2 curve and has a +1 brake value the movement decreases is only -1. Anyway if the driver finish a movement in a curve this decrease is not applied.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is an economic simulation game where each player is the manager of a multinational company. These companies produce and sell the same good (but in different styles and qualities) in 4 different regions (North/South America, Europe, Asia). Each game year the players will need to make important investment decisions (such as constructing or shutting down shops/factories worldwide, buying/selling shares, paying dividends), select a viable and efficient production plan, try to fulfill it and finally convert their production to sales. Also, they will have to look at the competition and through research try to push their efficiency even further. Simultaneously, local providers will also offer their products and &quot;steal&quot; a share of the market.&#10;&#10;As in reality selling does not come easily. Each region will have a specific demand for the homogenous good (but in different quantities and styles) and a specific preference for quality and style. Considering these factors and of course the price, players will try to manipulate the markets. Demand is not totally known, however there is always a way to know better and possibly &quot;change&quot; the knowledge of the competitors at the last moment. Difficult decisions and a bit of luck will define the actual sales.&#10;&#10;Players try to make profits not only for the money but also for their share price. Otherwise they will have to pay dividends if they want to keep the share price from declining. Loans are limited, costly and should not be taken lightly.&#10;&#10;Scoring is unlocked by profitability and is measured by share price. Thankfully, no ownership changes are taking place in this game (it is assumed that the initial number of shares represent less than 50% of the company).&#10;&#10;",

You play one of the four Penguins of Madagascar and your goal is to reach your habitat base as fast as you can.&#10;&#10;The game curve is fast as it is geared to a younger generation, though is can be enjoyed by any age.  Ostensibly, this is a simple roll-and-move game, but the added aspects of the magnets in the board and the pieces adds an interesting variability not seen in many games.  The idea is a simple one: get to home base.  The difference is that there are several &quot;turning&quot; points on the board that alters you path of direction.  Either you move ahead, jump forward, or are send backwards.&#10;&#10;Overall a game that can be played and enjoyed by all.&#10;&#10;",

Pablo has entrusted Tego to form&#10;a Management Team that will run his new company, Pablo Chocos. With $50,000, players' task is to headhunt and &#10;hire 12 best characters within 10 working days (10 rounds). The player who emerges with the group of best &#10;characters and meets most of Pablo's criteria shall be the winner.&#10;&#10;Out of these winners, only a few will be The Ultimate Headhunter. These are those who can score the maximum&#10;110 points. So not all winners will become The Ultimate Headhunter, only the few great ones will.&#10;&#10;The game play involves players bidding for these characters. One character will be bid at a time. The highest bidder gets the character. Players can also negotiate and trade during the game. The challenge is how one needs to achieve the target of the game without running out of money and also not to undervalue them until you lose&#10;the bid. Thus one needs to bid wisely, value the characters at the right place and to get them at the right&#10;time.&#10;&#10;The Card Game comes with a package of 200 playing cards, 2 sets of 48 characters, and a fully coloured game &#10;manual.&#10;&#10;Tego has also been designed for tournaments and competitions.&#10;&#10;",

Each player must write a story using all the words in 90 seconds. The challenge? You may not know the meaning of the words, but to score points you need to make the other players believe you do. Players are scored during each turn. First player to reach 300 points wins. Literati Challenge is sure to get your creative mojo rising and your family and friends howling!&quot;&#10;&#10;This differs from Baffle Gab in that it is targeted for adults (Age 15+) where Baffle Gab is a Family game (Age 7+). The words used would be different and lend to a different experience.

You cannot move your tiles unless your king is on the board. The king can move 1 space in any direction. The king is captured by removing it, so this prevents it from escaping by 'climbing'.&#10;&#10;- The queen: The 6-pointer tile is the queen.

The player who has the &quot;knerten&quot; card at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the movie &quot;knerten&quot;, a movie based on a book by Anne-Cath Vestly. The story is about a boy who finds a friend in a wooden stick, who lives when the adults doesn&rsquo;t look. (I guess the thought is that kids find joy in simple things. The irony is that now you can buy plastic &ldquo;knerten&rdquo; in the toy shops In Norway.&#10;&#10;All illustrations are shots from the film.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Solid State War is a print-and-play game line set during a war of resources beginning in the year 2035 AD. It is a light, fast-playing game of aerial dogfights between small numbers of jets. The objective of play is to defeat your opponent's air forces in close combat. The game is designed to be suitable for quick pickup games as well as long term campaigns.&#10;&#10;As a print-and-play game, players are expected to print out and prepare the playing pieces with household craft tools (scissors, hobby knife, and ordinary glue). These playing pieces include jet fighters, movement and shooting tools, unique dice and (as an option) 3D paper models.&#10;&#10;Game sessions begin by choosing a scenario. Each scenario establishes the starting positions and objectives of the fighter jets on each team. There are two sides in the war, the Rebels and the State. The scenarios are sometimes written to favor one side, to reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing armies.&#10;&#10;Once a scenario is selected, the players spend a certain number of &quot;army points&quot; to purchase their aircraft and outfit them with more experienced crews, weapons and special devices. Each jet uses its own record sheet, and during play the player controlling that jet is responsible for marking its current damage, ammo and other variables.&#10;&#10;Gameplay proceeds by rounds, with each jet taking a turn according to its initiative score. Movement is handled using a fan-shaped &quot;movement key&quot; and rolling dice to determine the maximum turning angle for that instance. Attacks are handled with a &quot;range finder&quot; tool that is placed in front of the attacking jet and used to determine if any targets can be fired upon. Dice are rolled to determine the severity of damage.&#10;&#10;Scenarios may be won by destroying the enemy team's jets, or by disabling or disarming the enemy team, forcing a forfeit. Some scenarios have special victory conditions, such as taking recon photos or bombing a ground target.&#10;&#10;After a scenario, both sides are awarded some army points to further develop their air forces or replace ruined equipment. These changes may be carried over for use in the next scenario.&#10;&#10;The base release for this game is the Air War Starter Set PDF. It contains all of the essential components, such as print-and-play dice, maneuvering and range-finding tools, speed tokens, smoke clouds, bombing targets and 2D jet fighter game pieces. This set includes two versions of the RG-6 Tigress, a fighter jet used by both sides during the war. The custom dice include a unique distribution of numbers, as well as keywords that are used in different situations.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to be supplemented with individual vehicle packs containing new options and game pieces, as well as 3D paper model PDFs that can be assembled and used in place of the standard 2D jet fighter pieces. Expansions are planned that will introduce new jet types, heroic crew members, campaigns, ground vehicles and ships.&#10;&#10;",

Subsequent letters are similarly drawn one at a time. At any time a player may call out a word that can be formed from the available letters. Upon making a word it is placed in the scoring area of the respective player. Additional words can be formed either by using only letters from the pool, or by poaching one or more letters from the pool of an extant word in another player's scoring area. If a player uses another player's word, that word is taken and given to the player forming the new word. When no new words can be made, each player scores the words in their area. A word's score is equal to the number of letters in the word minus one.&#10;&#10;",

In this cracking game, teams of players compete to create items from modelling dough, whilst the others try to guess what's being made.  As this grand adventure continues, players can steal items as they move around the board and try to avoid Preston as he seeks to steal points.  The team who model and guess the most items will triumph as champion creators!&#10;&#10;Description:&#10;&#10;Teams take turns to roll-and-move their dough-modelled playing piece round the board, either modelling inventions out of dough or stealing inventions from another team.  Inventions are graded as hard (red / 3 points), medium (yellow / 2 points) or easy (green / 1 point).&#10;&#10;On a modelling turn, the modeller makes as many as he can from that colour in one minute.  Each correctly-guessed invention moves the teams scoring piece along the scoring track by the appropriate number of spaces - first to 30 wins - and the team keep the card.&#10;&#10;On a stealing turn, the team take a card from another team and advance that many spaces, while the other team goes back that many spaces, for a total swing of 2, 4 or 6 points.&#10;&#10;After each turn, the team also roll-and-move the Preston piece either way round the board.  If it lands on another team, or another team land on it, that teams discards a card and loses the appropriate amount of points.&#10;&#10;A variation listed in the rules is that dough cannot be reused during a turn, limiting the size and number of models that can be made.&#10;&#10;Game contents:&#10;&#10;Game board&#10;200 item cards&#10;3 pots of modelling dough&#10;3 modelling mats&#10;Preston playing piece&#10;3 playing pieces&#10;Sand timer&#10;Dice&#10;Instructions&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game represents the combat between various Factions of psychic Operatives.  Loosely based on the 2009 movie: Push.&#10;&#10;You win if at the end of your turn you control the center of the board. Control of the center represents the fulfillment of your own Master Plot and the foiling of the plots of the opposing Factions.&#10;&#10;The Board is an 11 x 11 Square grid.  The 4 spaces in each corner are called Faction Boxes.  The Center square is key to winning.  Players win by controlling four of the adjacent spaces to the center: either the four orthogonal or four diagonal spaces around the center space.  Operatives, represented by counters, occupy squares, and have various psychic special abilities that affect movement and attack modes.&#10;&#10;",

You must appease the god of the darkness with sacrifices while making sure that your civilization grows and flourishes. There are 20 rounds to the game representing the daynames of the Aztec calendar cycle, and to win you must offer up 26 sacrificial hearts or the sun will not rise again and the world will end.&#10;&#10;You begin the game with 3 harvest dice (white) and 2 city dice (yellow). Later you will have access to four additional expansion dice. These dice show a variety of resource icons:&#10;&#10;corn, useful to harvest to feed your people, extra corn can be stored from one round to the next&#10;&#10;black corn, which you may not harvest, and can mean famine and death if have 3 or more ears of it&#10;&#10;peasants, who can multiply your harvest yield with their hard work&#10;&#10;priests, who can cause your civilization to expand&#10;&#10;hearts, with which you must to appease Tezacatipoca&#10;&#10;warriors, who can gain you captured slaves for your sacrifices&#10;&#10;gods, which come with expansion dice, who can give you divine bonus resources&#10;&#10;During the game you must keep track of corn and hearts as well as rounds.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;There are 3 rolls allowed per round, and you must lock a die each roll, re-rolling any others you choose; with the exception of black corn which is always automatically locked on a roll (i.e. you are not allowed to re-roll a die showing the black corn icon, unless there is divine intervention). Some dice have 2 icons on a face; in this case both roll resources showing can be used. You must harvest enough corn in each round to feed all city and expansion dice being rolled (i.e. ears of corn=number of city and expansion dice rolled). At the start of the game this means you must harvest 2 ears of corn for each round, one for each of the city dice. As your civilization grows and you gain expansion dice, the number of ears of corn required will grow as well. If you do not have enough ears of corn to equal your rolled city and expansion dice (and you must use any stored corn you have as part of this), you must subtract 1 heart from your total (corn harvest may be saved from round to round).&#10;&#10;During the game you may gain additional expansion dice. These dice are a darker orange and have a set of black dots (1 to 4 dots) on one face and the great jaguar god is displayed in white. You gain these expansion dice in numerical order and they will give you extra peasants, priests, corn to harvest, warriors and hearts as well as gods to pray to.&#10;&#10;Game End: &#10;If after 20 rounds you have offered up 26 sacrificial hearts you have won and the world is safe for another calendar cycle.&#10;&#10;",

Magic commodities can only be collected on a brick intersection when a new Citadel building is present.&#10;&#10;This combined version requires a custom 12 sided event die (6 barbarian ships and 6 city gates, the last of which is a &quot;wild card&quot; gate allowing the player who rolled the dice to choose the color gate).&#10;&#10;If played separately, each fan expansion requires a custom 8 or 10 sided event side (4 barbarian ships and 4 city gates or 5 barbarian ships and 5 city gates, the last of which is a &quot;wild card&quot; gate).&#10;&#10;Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",

As at Grossbeeren, the Allied army's initial deployment is its greatest weakness &ndash; if the French can move quickly they can over-whelm the Prussians and occupy the Juterbog objective before the rest of the Allied army can be brought to bear.

    "Description": "Escape to Wisconsin Trivia is a roll and move trivia game with many similarities to Trivial Pursuit. Players take turns moving their tokens around the board on a track that is shaped like the outline of the state of Wisconsin. Questions are color coded into five categories, each question having to do with some aspect of the history and culture of Wisconsin: Famous People, Sports/Recreation, Geography, History/Government, and Agriculture/Industry. The winner of the game is the player who is the first to collect a scoring piece from each of the five colors. Scoring pieces are obtained by landing on star spaces and correctly answering a question corresponding to the color of the space.&#10;&#10;",

On their turn, each player can move to one of a number of specified spaces on the 9x9 grid, so as to catch the hidden prize that lies there.&#10;&#10;Players only know the color of their catch, and not its nature (rank). They can also only keep 6 prizes in their hand, so that they must choose which ones to keep to be able to build a valuable (poker-like) collection.&#10;&#10;Each move must lead to a catch, and the game ends when a player can't make a legal move. The player with the best set in hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
