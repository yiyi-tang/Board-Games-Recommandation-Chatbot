Across the war-torn regions of the Mediterranean, the Axis powers of Germany and Italy control much of the theater. But the mighty nations of the United States and Great Britain are on the move, launching a massive offensive &mdash;code-named Operation Torch.&#10;&#10;But where will the secret Allied fleet choose to land its assault? Will they reclaim air superiority, control the sea, and gain a foothold in the underbelly of Axis-held Europe, or will Axis forces repel the Allies back in a storm of blood and fire?&#10;&#10;Song for War: Mediterranean Theater is a tabletop strategy game based in the contested regions of southern Europe, north Africa, and the Mediterranean Sea during World War 2. Representing one of four nations, players must work together as the Allies (US or Great Britain) or Axis (Germany or Italy). Players have the option to set strategy, move units, attack and defend as individual nations or simultaneously as the Allied or Axis team. Innovative mechanics allow players to deploy their land, sea, and air units strategically as combined forces, with faster units moving first and more often, followed by heavy units with stronger firepower. Take strategic objectives, control shipping lanes and resupply, deploy new technologies and units, and recreate historical events to defeat the enemy and win the day.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Large, 3 (army group) player team 3-piece map table size or small single player(s) 11x17/A3 map (and smaller pieces) &quot;travel&quot; size - with single-sided pieces, VERY easy to assemble.&#10;&#10;The base map is the *actual* OberKommando Heeres (OKH) campaign planning map (albeit the 1943-44 edition with corrections made) in the public domain on Ft. Leavenworth's Command and General Staff School's Combined Arms Research Library's Digital Library for anyone to see/use.&#10;&#10;7 monthly turns. 6+2 German armies, 10+1 panzerkorps, and the 3 Luftflotten. No peripheral Finnish or Rumanian fronts/forces (so Odessa is left out).&#10;&#10;Similar to my more detailed wargame Robot Barbarossa: From the 48 Strong and Weak Russian units, 3 groups - Strong, Medium/&quot;Historical,&quot; and Weak - are pre-sorted and only 2 of these unknown groups are selected and mixed. At end of game, compensation victory points are adjusted up or down for the arrays having been found to be Weak or Strong.&#10;&#10;OR you can use the un-presorted free Bell Curve selection which usually (as with bell curves) comes out to the average/&quot;historical&quot; but can instead go to extreme extremes!&#10;&#10;2 &quot;Siberians&quot; arrive later, and risk arriving sooner than December if Moscow is too threatened too soon.&#10;&#10;Has hidden Russian individual and overall strengths with just Strong (1-factor) and Weak units - no armor vs. infantry combat arms differentiation.&#10;&#10;Ground combat is (for simplicity and playing speed) DICE-LESS - the unknown units factor giving unpredictability, strategically as well as tactically.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You can try to change, keep being relentless, or even secretly decide to be a Heartbreaker. It&rsquo;s your choice.&#10;&#10;The happily-ever-after won&rsquo;t be certain, but whatever way your zigzag romance unfolds, you&rsquo;ll always end up with a story full of surprises &ndash; guaranteed to raise a smile!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter edition has a slightly different UPC code than the retail edition, and above the bar code on the back of the box is the notation &quot;Kickstarter Edition.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter edition comes with the base game and the following expansions and promo cards packaged inside the game's box.

Players either bring a concealed wine and take turns being The Somm, or one player plays Permanent Somm and provides all mystery wines for the game.&#10;&#10;Players unlock Cellar Doors on the board by using common wine characteristics (Acidity, Tannins, etc.) to move closer to the final Call Zone to declare the mystery wine to the world. Players score points by pre-calling the wine correctly as well as guessing the wine correctly on the board. After all rounds and wines, the point-leader has proven themselves to be the best blind taster in the universe, and may refer to themselves in the third person for the remainder of the evening (bonus points for using the &quot;Royal We&quot;).&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player has variable powers and items further the things they can do.&#10;&#10;The antagonist will construct the search decks at the locations laying traps and surprises to get the players.

If you end up on pink, you can either try to guess another player's magician or if you are not yet prepared to take a pink token that can be used to guess at a later time.

    "Description": "Magic: The Gathering - The Precursors is a cooperative board game and card variant of the classic, competitive card game that has players work together in an epic campaign that can span several gaming sessions. It utilizes a slightly altered Commander (EDH) format of MTG.&#10;&#10;Similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a Dungeon Master &mdash; or a Game Master (GM), in this case &mdash; guides up to four other players on a series of six quests, each of which takes about two to three hours to complete.&#10;&#10;The players start in one of the zones. If it&rsquo;s the Red zone, they&rsquo;ll be facing a Red or Multicoloured commander; the Blue zone, they&rsquo;ll be facing a Blue or Multicoloured commander; etc. Each quest features a new enemy deck, so no two quests are ever the same.&#10;&#10;The GM is given certain card and life advantages over the Precursor heroes, and it is the goal of the Precursors to defeat the GM while working together. Also of note is that the game allows the GM to also play as one of the heroes if they&rsquo;re up to it. This means that the game supports up to five players.&#10;&#10;The game is quite affordable as it allows cards from every single MTG set. The players make their decks with whatever cards they want to use, a single commander (Legendary Creature) overseeing the army of cards.&#10;&#10;The board game consists of five different phases, two of which are almost identical to traditional duels. The game&rsquo;s pretty simple to learn for veteran Magic players, and not much more difficult than the card game itself for new Magic players.&#10;&#10;NOTE: This game is unofficial, of course.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Many events in American history have been labeled &quot;trials of the century&quot;, but for a young nation, it would have been impossible to top United States v. Aaron Burr. Unlike Washington, Jefferson, Madison or Hamilton, Aaron Burr came from American royalty &mdash; a founding father descended from the original puritanical stock that arrived in Plymouth. His father was the second president of Princeton. His grandfather was Jonathan Edwards, the philosopher-theologian who wrote &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,&quot; perhaps the most important American literary work of its time.&#10;&#10;So in 1776, if you were going to identify any of the Founders who would later stand trial for treason to his country, Aaron Burr would be the least likely &mdash; yet Burr's journey as an enormous talent born under a dark star is now well known. Less well understood is that when he shot Alexander Hamilton in the early morning hours of July 11, 1804, it would set in motion a chain of events much more bizarre than anything depicted on Broadway.&#10;&#10;Aaron Burr never stood trial for killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel. His trial was for treason, three years later, at the insistence of the Thomas Jefferson, the man Burr had narrowly lost to in the contested election of 1800. An embittered and politically ruined Burr seemed to have developed a scheme to separate the new Louisiana Purchase territories from the United States and declare himself king over the new entity. When Jefferson learned of the plot, he ordered Burr's arrest and publicly declared him guilty of treason.&#10;&#10;United States v. Aaron Burr: The Treason Trial of America's Third Vice President, a card-driven game for two players, recreates the treason trial of Aaron Burr in Richmond in 1807. But by accident of recent judicial reforms, Thomas Jefferson's detested cousin, Chief Justice John Marshall, would be riding circuit and would preside over the case. The resulting legal contest would read like a list of who's who of America's Founding Fathers.&#10;&#10;United States vs. Aaron Burr is a fast-playing card-driven game in which players seek to use events, evidence, and witnesses of Burr's activities to convince a jury to return a guilty verdict &mdash; or if playing for the defense, persuade at least one juror to find Aaron Burr not guilty. Each round, players have the opportunity to question witnesses, persuade jurors, and make points of law to the Chief Justice which will aid them in their cause. The game highlights all the events and participants surrounding one of the most important trials in American Constitutional Law &mdash; setting the precedent that the President of the United States is NOT immune from legal court orders, a precedent very much cited by the Supreme Court today.&#10;&#10;So try your hand as a great litigator in a great trial. Perhaps you will even find yourself smiling more and talking less!&#10;&#10;",

To escape the expanding corona, players must mine resources, manage their crew population and research sufficient technology to traverse actual locations in our Solar System and escape into the greater Milky Way Galaxy.&#10;&#10;On a turn, players have a variable number of actions to perform based on their Crew size. Actions include Mining (taking a resource die from their current planet or moon), Researching (gaining a technology card for new abilities), and Traveling (attempting a roll with resource dice to get to the next orbital location away from the sun). There are also interactive actions between players including Hacking (stealing a technology card), Spying (using another player's tech), and Attacking to steal a resource.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal is to escape the Sun's corona beyond Pluto and into the greater Milky Way with the highest number of crew.&#10;&#10;The base game contains a Solar System board, 10 transparent corona covers, and over 75 dice in 8 different colors, 49 technology cards and 4 spaceship player markers.&#10;&#10;NOVA: Race from the Sun also features a distinct Solo Mode with 864 possible combinations of technology and a unique scoring system for high replayability.&#10;&#10;Write your chapter in humanity's Solar saga!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The Japanese celebrate this occasion, as according to their traditions the goddess of Fuji mountain, Konohana Sakuya Hima, revives the fallen flowers at this time. The cherry flower is a symbol of vitality called &quot;sakura&quot;.&#10;&#10;The players in Sakura aim to play cards without taking any hands. They have to play two cards each time, one on each side of the Jin-Jang card following the rules, which by default require higher number on the Jin side and lower on the Jang side in the same color. (Alternatively, a player can place the same number in any color.) Also, the players are aided in their success by several characters, who require payment (money). The game ends when everyone has only two cards left in their hand. The player who earns the fewest points wins the favor of the goddess and glory will be theirs until next spring.&#10;&#10;&#10;This edition contains previous Kickstarter extras (not exclusive).&#10;&#10;",

The suspects on all mystery cards as well as the two detectives Lasse and Maja and also the police chief (who is also one of the detectives) are placed around the playing field with the help of a dice. In turn, you roll the dice and either move one of your suspects or one of the detectives (who are all used by all the players) towards the building that their mystery card has listed.&#10;&#10;In addition to this, each player has cards on hand that can either help one to move their suspects faster towards the right building or move the opponents' suspects further away from their building. Among the cards, there are also cards that give you the opportunity to take cards from an opponent, roll one more time with the dice, get the opportunity to use the cable car, etc. Every time you move one of the game characters into a building marked with an arrow, you have to draw new cards to your hand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "So Many Problems is a lightly competitive and deeply hilarious storytelling party game for 2 to 8 players. Your Mission (should you choose to accept it) is the first Deluxe Box, including four themes that won't self-destruct:&#10;&bull; Improvising Secret Agent is a master of physics and chemistry who can combine materials in unimaginable ways to escape from the most dangerous espionage assignments.&#10;&bull; You Meddlesome Youths bought a van, adopted a dog that sounds like he is trying to talk, and started a detective agency with some high school friends.&#10;&bull; Long Shot Astronaut and their crew face everything that can go terribly wrong in space, thinking on their feet while floating in zero-gravity.&#10;&bull; Not-So-Super Hero is fighting villains alongside heroes gifted with extreme strength or speed, even though they are basically just really good at a hobby like archery or martial arts.&#10;&#10;Every round, each player gets three story elements to secretly distribute and a far-fetched problem to solve, all coming at random from the four themes. You'll try to give the other players elements that might help to solve their problems, but they don't actually want your help.&#10;&#10;Before you look at the three elements you receive from others, shuffle in two random elements from the deck. Choose just three of those five possibly-helpful elements to use, trying to avoid those you suspect came from the other players, as you improvise and share a hilarious story that solves your problem.&#10;&#10;You'll earn one point for each element you contributed to another player that was used in a solution. Each random element from the deck that you used in your own solution is worth one point, too. After three rounds of problems, the player with the most points wins! Optional advanced game modes add trophies to reward stories that are especially funny or creative, and actions like the challenge flag to throw down and crank up the competition.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

If the player has one Mason, they can move one brick. Two Masons - move two bricks.&#10;&#10;The second part of a turn is when the player can use gold they have collected to buy more bricks for their unused pile, and hire more Masons (to help them build faster) and Brutes (to defend the unused brick pile and the player's Masons from the dragon).&#10;&#10;The final part of the players turn is rolling a 1d10 - the DieOfFate. The die can get the player more gold and bricks, as well as three other possibilities: &quot;Brute&quot; - where (if you have Brutes) you can steal from another players unused brick pile, &quot;Dragon&quot; - where you send the dragon to eat another player's Brutes (or their Mason if they have no Brutes), and &quot;Queen&quot; - where everyone hands their unique castle wall plan to the player to their right - this means you could be one turn from winning with the final brick suddenly you need to reorganize the bricks on the top two levels of your wall.&#10;&#10;The game goes fast and the twists and turns of the DieOfFate makes the game &quot;self-leveling&quot;, everyone ends the game only a few turns from winning - nobody is completely and catastrophically behind when the game ends.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

A Shaman begins their duty as just a youth, but must be wise beyond his or her years in order to grow, expand and thrive as a tribe. As the spiritual leader you will decide when and where your tribe should hunt, gather, settle, build and more. The best Shamans commune freely with the spirits, animals and nature itself, but this path is not always peaceful, beasts will be slain and foes will be vanquished. Will your tribe grow and thrive or merely survive?&#10;&#10;You are the Shaman leader of your specific tribe. Each Shaman has a collection of skulls in which they may commune with the spirit world. You must use these skulls to take actions, or harness a beast spirit, or even create and collect totems for bounties at your life's end. The actions you choose will tell your tribe to move, engage, grow, or worship, each having its own set of choices. In doing so, you will collect resources from the land to feed your tribe, to develop technologies, to build resources, make offerings to the great spirits, activate skulls and more. As the Shaman you must be wary of impending catastrophes known only to you and the other Shaman of the world. The Shaman whose tribe has the largest population is winner.&#10;&#10;A tribe's total end game population consists of their total token dial amounts (rovers, warriors, villages), their totem bonus amounts, and any end game bonus population. The population represented by the dials underneath your tokens on the board will be the main portion of your score.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The Elder Dragon Spirit (Player) with the most valuable horde of treasure at the end of the six years is the winner of Dragonbrood.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The nations of Doggerland fortify their borders, mobilize troops and artillery daily. Though many fear war, many more welcome it as the opportunity for glory and patriotic display. Little do they understand what destruction is to come&hellip;&#10;&#10;Each player in War Hounds is the leader of a nation of dogs. There are 12 factions (6 double sided playerboards.) Each faction with its own set of abilities, functions, costs etc. Players will play over the course of 4 years, the war ending at the close of the 4th year. Players will play in rondel turn order, each round the turn order possibly changing. Players will take one action on their turn by selecting an action in the top of their playerboard. As with everything in this era of Doggerland history, things are hierarchical, meaning a chain of command or top-down, and so in selecting actions, generally a player may not select an action above those they have already selected. Players will draft troops, build artillery, invest in new technologies, influence new policies, shift and transform their economies, and of course engage in embroiled bouts of combat. Players will conquer territories, gain medals and lose casualties. Ultimately, the winner is the nation with the most victory paws at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The winner is the nation with the most total victory paws at the end of the game (all paws are awarded at game end--none during). Players gain victory paws from the following sources: medals, casualties (negative paws), controlled territories, technologies, policies, loan debt (negative paws) and wealth (1 victory paw per $25).&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This book gives you everything you need to begin building your D-Day: Waffen-SS force.&#10;&#10;Between mid 1943 and mid 1944, the German focus was on the Eastern Front. After the failure of the German Kursk Offensive, the Red Army went on the offensive, throwing hammer blow after hammer blow to drive the Germans back to the Russian border. The elite 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions were rushed to wherever the Soviets broke through, counterattacking to seal the breach. By Christmas, the divisions were worn out, barely a regimental sized battlegroup remained. They desperately needed to be withdrawn to France to rebuild back to full strength.&#10;&#10;Then, as 1944 began, the Red Army attacked again. The two new divisions being formed in France, the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions were rushed to the Eastern Front and the plans to rebuild the existing divisions were shelved. Finally, in March, the Spring rains turned the roads to mud and the Soviet offensives ground to a halt. All four divisions were returned to France for rebuilding, joining the 12th SS Panzer Division which was part way through its training. Six weeks into their training, still trying to bring large numbers of conscripted replacements up to scratch, the Allies invaded France on D-Day. Ready or not, the SS panzer divisions were rushed to the invasion front, counterattacking to drive the Allies back into the sea.&#10;&#10;With a solid core of veteran leaders under your command, can your willing, but inexperienced troops defeat the Allies despite their massive superiority in numbers? Can you win a never-ending battle of attrition, or do you attack into the teeth of massed artillery, naval bombardments and airpower? Can you defeat the invasion and save your homeland?&#10;&#10;Forces details on:&#10;&#10;     Tiger SS Tank Company&#10;     Panther SS Tank Company&#10;     Panzer IV SS Tank Company&#10;     StuG SS Tank Company&#10;     SS Panzergrenadier Company&#10;     SS Reconnaissance Company Company&#10;     Support&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A children's game that has components for several different games that focus on the number 1 through 10.&#10;&#10;1) Number Duel - similar to the traditional game of war except if the same number is flipped over by both players, both cards go to the discard pile. When all cards have been taken whoever has the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;2) Die Counting - similar to Shut the Box. A player rolls the die and turns over a card matching that number or may roll again to try and turn over the 7, 8, 9, or 10. If the player pushes their luck and the sum is over 10, the play forfeits that turn. First player to flip over all 10 of their cards win.&#10;&#10;3) Pirate Destinations - Another push your luck game of flipping over a card from the deck of cards (1 thru 10) and moving a pirate the number of spaces equal to the number of the card. The player who got to 10 (or closest to it) wins.&#10;&#10;4) Quick at Calculating - Addition/subtraction math problem cards are used (the result will be a number 1 to 10). The player calculates the answer and then plays the card from their hand. If they are right, they keep the card, otherwise the card is discarded. The player with the most cards when the deck of problem cards is depleted is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Kappa is small humanoid that lives in rivers and waterways. The top of its head is formed like a crown or a dish, and the Kappa must keep water in it to stay healthy. If the Kappa spills or dries out, it suffers and dies.&#10;&#10;In this game, the Kappa is an inverted paper cut with the base cut into the crown. Players take turns to add water to the crown using straws. A player dips the straw into a glass of water, puts their finger on the open end, and draws the straw out. Then they put the straw to the crown and release the water. The next player does the same and so forth.&#10;&#10;Gradually the crown fills, until only surface tension is holding the water in. Eventually, a player adds enough water to break the surface and the water spills, and that player loses.&#10;&#10;The crown design means that it takes a surprising amount of water to break. Players start taking up less and less water, and the other players mock their lack of nerve.&#10;&#10;The game was originally hand-made and as well as a full sized Kappa, the game also has a mini Kappa for a quicker result. The game can be played by young children and adults alike.&#10;&#10;In 2019, a professional version was made by itten, Kappa Bros!.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Meanwhile, entertainment demands are at an all-time high.&#10;&#10;A child of these strange times, FORTUNE OF THE FORGOTTEN WORLD is the highest rated show in history. Located on Island 17A, a scientific experiment gone awry, the television show offers contestants a chance to find a veritable fortune in cash that is stashed on the island, locate the hidden raft and escape to safety, all the while fighting and running from dinosaurs, collecting useful items, fending off other contestants, and competing for the best ratings with the television audience.&#10;&#10;YOU are one of this season&rsquo;s contestants, having survived a rigorous screening process that includes a paleontologist, an engineer, a soldier, a trail guide, a cook, a medical doctor, a professional athlete, and a popular celebrity. Can you outwit the competition, survive combat with history&rsquo;s deadliest predators, puzzle out the island&rsquo;s technology all to recover the hidden stash of cash and escape with your life?&#10;&#10;Gameplay involves players &quot;landing&quot; on the island by placing their tokens on the hex board, and then rolling dice to move around, revealing tiles that they encounter along the way. Tiles might be useful items such as weapons, health packs, or tools -- or they could be wild dinosaurs which force players to evade or battle them. Only one tile is the sought-after prize money. Once the money is found, players must race to find the raft off of the island, which may lie beyond gates that must be powered on and unlocked. Will you prepare a route to safety before you search for the prize money? Establish choke points to steal the money from other players? Scour the island for the prize money in hopes that you don't encounter a deadly dinosaur instead? Your decisions affect how the TV audience perceives you. Unpopular players may get &quot;fired&quot;, while popular ones will be rewarded by studio executives. Random events may interfere with your strategy, so always have a contingency plan and don't forget about your character's unique skills!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They can choose to add another loaded card to 2nd Base, or they can choose to replace an existing card (loaded card OR base card).&#10;&#10;Players continue to add cards, earning singles, doubles, and triples, depending on the number of loaded cards in play. Once there are four loaded cards, one player can attempt to hit a &quot;grand slam&quot; by sharing an answer that incorporates all 4 loaded cards! Once the grand slam is awarded, players will tally their total points from all of their &quot;hits&quot;, and take note of their score for that inning. After a set number of innings, players will calculate their total scores to determine the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players can lose points by calling out incorrect answers (strikes) or by placing nonsensical cards on their own turn (outs). Strikes and outs cause you to lose varying amounts of points, depending on how many cards are in play! However, players will have two abilities (curve-balls and splitters) to help them get out of a tight spot.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the middle of the jungle, during a recon mission in a misty valley, a squad of soldiers of the Delta Sierra company comes face to face with dinosaurs from a bygone age.&#10;A savage battle ensues on a terrain full of traps and hazards, where everyone must fight to survive.&#10;&#10;One player leads a squad of soldiers and the other plays the dinosaurs. One group plays strategically while the other is more primitive in its tactics. The game ends when all soldiers or dinosaurs are eliminated.&#10;&#10;First, you choose or create your teams. Then, each player draws and places terrain tiles, face down, one after the other, trying to create a playing field to their advantage.&#10;After that, the players discover the field while fighting each other. Movement, placement and distance determine if a unit can be killed. Soldiers can attack from afar, while dinos can only do so up close and personal. Special abilities give each unit a tactical value and allow for elaborate strategies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You will face a challenging mix of villains and missions from the movies as you are tasked with defeating the evil mastermind before they are able to complete their evil scheme. The cards in this expansion closely follow the storylines of these two Bond films. Just like the core set, you must defeat the villains before they can escape and complete the missions or before the danger level rises too high. Like Bond, you must be ready because you can count on a few unexpected twists along the way.&#10;&#10;This expansion comes with 300 playable cards featuring images from the Bond movies. The game features James Bond as played by George Lazenby, and Timothy Dalton. Of course no Bond game would be complete without Bond's allies like Q, Moneypenny, Felix Leiter, and others. And how could we forget those fabulous Q Branch gadgets! Battle the bad intentions of infamous masterminds like the diabolical Ernst Stravro Blofeld and the ruthless Franz Sanchez. Will you be able to thwart Blofeld's Angels of Death? Can you destroy the power and influence of Sanchez's illicit empire?&#10;&#10;",

As long as this card is next to this row, only odd cards can be played into it &mdash; which means you might be forced to play into a different row!&#10;&#10;When any row is claimed, the player takes the five cards from that row, starts a new row with their sixth card, then moves the even/odd card to one of the other three rows, specifically the row with the lowest card in its rightmost position.

Other Nationalist forces attacked from the north and east to surround the capital and lay siege. In mid-December 1936 the Nationalists launched their offensives, but these soon bogged down at the end of the month due to inclement weather and a lack of fuel. During the respite both sides rushed reinforcements to the front along the road from Madrid to La Coru&ntilde;a. Besides additional troops and aircraft, tanks were sent in large numbers by both sides. For the Nationalists, new Panzer I tanks from Germany were deployed for the first time in the war, along with more CV-33 tanks from Italy. The Republicans dispatched T-26 tanks and BA-6 armored cars that had just arrived from the Soviet Union. One of the largest battles of the war was about to be fought for control of Spain&rsquo;s capital.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?
