    "Description": "The 16th century, the age of renaissance. Sailing and maritime trade are flourishing, vast fleets belonging to shipping companies are crossing the seas around the world. There is fierce competition for the available commodities which must be delivered to harbors. The shortest sea route may not be the easiest one. To achieve your goal in becoming the best captain, you need to find the best routes, deliver your goods to the harbor at the right moment and should not think twice to go raiding a little at times. Your portolan chart, a navigation map lies already in front of you, the crew is awaiting your order, and the race is just about to begin.&#10;&#10;In Portolano, each players controls a ship at sea. With each step you move your ship to the next map tile (map consists of tiles randomly drawn at the beginning of the game). If this is a sea tile, the player can pick one resource (3 different goods or cannons) available on the island. Each sea tile allows for one additional special action. The most important one is ship building, letting players upgrade their ships, extend their cargo bay, increase their speed, or attacking power in battle.&#10;&#10;Other possible actions include e.g. trading goods (change them to other goods or rum). Once you move to a harbor, you sell the goods collected on the islands to get coins (each harbor has differing needs for products). The more goods you can sell in one go, the  more coins you will get.&#10;&#10;The players plan their next moves simultaneously, without knowing the plans of others. Therefore it may happen that a player moves to sea tile, where the goods are already taken by other players or to a harbor, where the demands have already been satisfied.&#10;&#10;Once everybody has moved their ships in the round, the wind indicator will be spun, the new wind direction determines the next move of the pirates, who are also on the prowl at sea. After this, the movement phase ends. There is a battle after the movement phase if players and/or the pirate are positioned on the same/adjacent tiles. The fights use dice rolling, the winner steals goods/coins/rum from the loser.&#10;&#10;Rum is considered to be an important commodity as well, it &quot;fuels&rdquo; the crew to sail the ship according to your orders. If any player runs out of rum, the crew rebels and the ship can move only in the direction that the wind takes it until the rum stock is refilled. The costs of moving the ship in terms of rum depends on your movement compared with the wind direction (upwind, tailwind, crosswind).&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as any of the goods run out. The player who has the most coins wins the game (coins can be collected even at the end of the game by unlocking bonuses).&#10;&#10;",

Players draw tiles, place fish on them either lying or telling the truth, and score more points for having all 3 colors of fish / tiles in a particular horizontal row.&#10;&#10;When a player draws a tile, they examine it and then place it face down on the next open spot in their player's monk fish display. They then place a number of fish of one color on top of the tile. This claim can be either true or a lie. Going around the table, check whether another player wants to challenge the active player's claim. If challenged, the active player reveals the tile. If they were truthful, they keep the tile, but the challenger loses their most recent tile. If caught in a lie, the active player gives the tile and the bluff fish to the challenger, who places them in their next tile slot on their player board. In addition to the normal fish tiles, there are 2 special tiles which change up some of the results of the bluffing.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all but one player has filled up all their slots, or until out of tiles.&#10;&#10;Players score each horizontal row. In each row, they look at the colors of the fish (tokens or fish on tiles).  If all 3 colors are represented, then they score the number of all fish in that row. Otherwise, the row scores the number of tiles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

(Hurrah!)&#10;However, you have opened the coffin and found out that the rumor about the gold components was not true, though it was not entirely false either. The coffin contains mysterious unknown components collected by the deceased from across the world over the years. And many of them are human figures. (Eek!) The woman, who has become a zombie, is trying to put a curse on you to turn you into a zombie. She is vexed to have died without playing enough games and therefore has a grudge against you, who opened this coffin so joyfully.&#10;&#10;So now is the time to play this game and win it in order to nail in the coffin and put the zombie old maid into an eternal slumber. Well, do not fear. This is a simple game like any other Old Maid. All you need to do is just get rid of the cards in your hand quickly. Go ahead and break the curse with joy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;In this Old Maid variant, pairs are made up of a color card and a  gray card. A player that has one of the two Zombie Old Maids has to show his gray cards to the other players. When drawing a card from him, other players can choose to draw one of his (concealed) color cards, or to choose one of his gray cards - but then they get the Zombie Old Maid too. The goal of the game is to be the first to empty your hand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each builder lays their tiles in a row in front of themselves, and they want to arrange these tiles in a pattern known only by the speaker, with the pattern being the same for all teams.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, one of the speakers reveals a sound card, such as &quot;Woof!&quot; or &quot;Bong!&quot;, then they place a pattern card on a display that is visible only to the speakers. The pattern might be 3-5 animals in a row, 3-5 shapes in a row, or 3-5 colors in a row. Play then begins. Each builder starts by placing a finger on two different tiles, then their speaker will:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Make the sound once &mdash; Bong! &mdash; if the builder should finger different tiles.&#10;    Make the sound twice &mdash; Bong! Bong! &mdash; if the builder should switch the fingered tiles.&#10;    Make the sound thrice &mdash; Bong! Bong! Bong! &mdash; if all of the tiles are arranged properly. At this point, the builder slaps the multicolored tile in the center of the table. If this team's tile arrangement is correct &mdash; and with only 3-4 tiles depicted on a pattern card, the tiles must be in the proper order and adjacent to one another &mdash; then they claim the pattern card as a point. If they are incorrect, then each other team scores a point.&#10;&#10;&#10;The first team to score 3 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A contemporary variation on the classic game of Clue (Cluedo) crossed with the Trump-Russia collusion scandals. It is simultaneously humorous political satire and yet an engaging fully playable game with more complexity than the original.&#10;&#10;This card and board game contains many new innovations such as an action-point based system of movement between locations, the requirement that other player-suspects be subpoenaed with an action point (and the ability of other players to resist being moved by subpoena), and the Pardon Power--the ability to pardon the the guilty suspect to alter the game's logic mid-game. The game is played both collaboratively and competitively with other players.&#10;&#10;Each player is a Special Agent on a FBI team investigating clues at potential crime scenes from New York and Washington to London and Moscow. Each player is assigned one of eight suspects to tail around the world, and also has subpoena power to summon one other suspect each turn to a potential crime scene.&#10;&#10;Players use logic to separate out the merely scandalous from the criminally scandalous, and work to bring an indictment against the correct suspect in one scandal at one scene. The indictment must be correct, or the team will lose the game--and the country.&#10;&#10;Ideally, you would like to be the first Special Agent to discover the correct indictment, but any agent on the team can win for the good of the country.&#10;&#10;Remember, the clock is ticking. If the team makes Donald Trump too angry, he might exercise the Pardon Power. And if the investigation drags on too long, then all will truly be lost...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players travel to creepy locations and hunt for creatures of the night to assist them in defeating their opponents. A player's goal is to locate five monsters of a specific monster-type (Cryptid, Undead, Paranormal or Humanoid) before their opponents assemble their legion of monsters. At locations, monsters hide within Hunt Decks that also hold a variety of action cards that keep the game moving.  Players secretly make decisions about what they find while exploring, using the knowledge they've gained to track their monsters and prevent opponents from locating their monsters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Combatants&#10;&#10;(Les combattants) This is the story of the back alleys in the big cities, the grasslands at the outskirts of the rural areas, the field of the duel at dawn, the meetup of fighters in the park. The game of swashing blades, rivalling schools and swordplay and the bash of combatants in battle. You are the duelling gentlemen, the nobles, the privateers, the henchmen, the thugs and fighters of the streets. Trying to defend your honour, prove your loyalty, do your master&rsquo;s biddings or just to survive. Pick up your sword and roll your dice.&#10;&#10;This is the narrative of duelling. Duelling in the sense of swordmasters, fighting styles, sunset duelling and honour. You are a fighter with a specific style and your school. Combat is both luck and skill.&#10;&#10;Manage your opportunities and movement, and you will come out on top. Whittle down your opponent's stamina in order to score hits, chase your opponent away from the battle, knock your opponent out and win the duel.&#10;&#10; Base concept &#10;&#10;Combatants in a melee or a duel are constantly manoeuvring, in and out of each other's range, accelerating, slowing down, changing directions. Swordplay is like a dance in that you are moving and responding to your opponents, but you also try to outsmart them and to hit them or to keep them far away. The combat, distance, and turn order in this game is an abstraction. There is no fixed amount of time per round or turn, nor a fixed distance between players. The aim of this game is to both be a tool in a narrative and like a game of duelling, you would even be able to play this as a regular board game, player versus player, teams versus teams or in a Battle Royal style.&#10;&#10; Gameplay &#10;&#10;In this game of duelling, your goal is to knock out or chase your opponent away from the battleground. Various stories may drastically change winning conditions and combat is not always the answer. But this time and in this story, it will solely be a story about the duels.&#10;&#10;Once each turn, players will simultaneously roll several six-sided dice and allocate these as the attack, defence and action values. One selected die, and in addition to this, dice combinations will give a final combat value. To aid you during gameplay there will be cards displayed as a playerboard, to visualize and present your decisions, both to yourself and other players.&#10;&#10;Each combatant will have a combat skill level and each skill level will gain you one combat die to roll. The combat skill will range between zero and nine and the most common level is between two and four. In addition to this, there may be bonus dies, and sometimes dice are removed from play or temporarily locked down.&#10;&#10;Independent of how many dice you roll, only ONE of the combat dice is chosen and with its full value be used as the base combat value. The rest of the dice will be used in dice combinations, to either increase this base value or be used for actions. When you choose to perform any one of the various actions instead of, or at the same time as your general melee, dice will be used for action quality instead of as part of the final combat result.&#10;&#10;The combat value is used both as your chance to avoid being struck by ANY opponents and as your chance to land a blow at ONE opponent. These values are compared between players to see who succeeds. The difference between values is the quality of the blow, and are used for fatigue and damage.&#10;&#10;When a combatant is attacked by several opponents, the combatant&rsquo;s combat result will count as the defence value against them all, fully or partially lowering potential damage, regardless of it is a successful or failed onfall against any of the opponents.&#10;&#10;If you are up against and is attacking several potential opponents, you have to declare who is your main target, as you could only have one main opponent each turn. As a combatant is attacking for damage, gets a higher result, and thereby succeeds with the onfall against one, lower this opponent's stamina by the difference between the two results minus any penalty from distance. Turn order and actions may interfere with the attack, distance and protection may change the level of fatigue and damage.&#10;&#10;To be used as fatigue and damage level trackers, there will be three blue health dies placed on your character card. As your combatant gets hit, reduce the value on the health dies one at the time, equal to the quality of the blow. Starting with the topmost die, continuing until the whole value is accounted for. The difference between combat values are the quality of a blow.&#10;&#10;As soon as a die is down to zero you remove it. A removed die will reveal a penalty written on your character card. The values of these health dies will differ between characters and are based on a combatants&rsquo; constitution. Your combattant will be knocked out if all of your three health dice are removed.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of every new turn, you reroll all of your available unlocked combat and bonus dice. Change your turn order. You allocate your dice as combat value and dice combinations. Priority of placed dice, onfalls, defences and actions are resolved in an order determined by a cycling sequence of timeslots. These timeslot sequences are determined by fighting styles and timeslot positions range between one to nine. Higher timeslot number is later in the turn.&#10;&#10;Each fighting style sequence does not consist of all available timeslot positions, only a few and it varies between styles. You may voluntarily choose to act later within your own fighting style sequence for a bonus; as recovering stamina or focus and gaining additional combat dice.&#10;&#10;There is no death in this game if you not specifically choose to incorporate this. If you want to tell a more deadly story, you may allow for serious consequences, as permanent injuries, maiming and coup de gr&acirc;ce.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;-Quotes&#10;&#10;Inigo Montoya wrote:&#10;My name is Inigo Montoya.

The Strontium Dogs' official sanction from the Galactic Crime Commission lets them operate across many worlds and jurisdictions - even time itself - yet they are hated and feared not just by the criminals they hunt but by normal people as well.&#10;&#10;In Strontium Dog, players take control of a small team of bounty hunters or the outlaws, criminals and renegades they hunt in gun battles, chases and showdowns across the galaxy.&#10;&#10;This book contains all the rules you need to play Strontium Dog including scenarios, advanced rules, and profile lists to create your own Bounty Hunters and gangs for them to hunt.&#10;&#10;",

The game is comprised of only one round. During each turn, you can only replace magic stones once. The victory conditions vary for each player and only one player wins. Make deductions, suppositions, inductions, and actions, and unexpected results will be awaiting you.&#10;&#10;The second edition, released in the same year 2018, had some small changes:&#10;the package changed, a new evildoer card was added, and victory token added. The game was expanded from 3-4 players to 3-5 players and a small rule was changed, but the game remained basically the same.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#239;&#188;&#136;Evildoers&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#136;Agent&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#176;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#229;&#140;&#191;&#231;&#179;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#230;&#143;&#155;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#230;&#157;&#161;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#136;&#230;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#170;&#152;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#186;&#136;&#230;&#131;&#179;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Funded by shadow backers, the data-jacks accept jobs from faceless clients for profit, glory, and better chrome ... always better chrome.&#10;&#10;Battles take place in the concrete jungle known as the Sprawl, but data-jacks must remain wary of the threat posed by Cyberspace. Hacking rules are pivotal to the game, with data nodes, robots, machines, and even enemy chrome presenting potential targets for a cunning data-jack. No-one plugged into Cyberspace is entirely safe from intrusion, and the electronic sprites and digital djinn you can deploy alongside your team can be just as dangerous as any mercenary or assassin.&#10;&#10;Gameplay focuses on individual characters, with each skirmish offering you the opportunity to earn experience and equipment for your data-jack and operatives. A wide range of items and upgrades are available, from advanced weaponry and synthetics through to cyber-implants, biological enhancements, clones, and much more. This is a world obsessed with whether something can be done, not whether it should.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

By order of the King of Portugal, you embark on a mysterious journey following the famous explorer&rsquo;s trail. If you want to win the monarch&rsquo;s admiration and his favour, you must visit as many overseas ports as you can, bringing home the most valuable cargo. There&rsquo;s only one problem. Some goods go bad really rapidly. This is why you have to store them appropriately in your ship&rsquo;s cargo hold, to make sure most of them stay fresh when they reach the port back in Lisbon. Time to set sail. May the best servant of the King win!&#10;&#10;Route to India is a family friendly game (which also has an advanced version of the rules) for 2-4 players in which the participants embark on a journey to India and back. The gameplay is divided into two phases, composed of a number of turns which the players take. In the first phase your ships leave from the port of Rastello. Sailing along, you will be moving your ships to the selected ports or colonies (different types of spaces on the board), purchasing goods for doubloons and placing them in the cargo holds (player boards). During your turn you can take move and trade actions, and each cargo tile you obtain is worth a specific number of points at the end of the game. The last ship that arrives at the port in India starts the second phase, beginning the journey back (with new goods available). The game goes on until all the players&rsquo; ships reach Rastello again, then you count the points and the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each month, the team completes that months section on a P&amp;L, Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash flows.&#10;&#10;During the process, players are interacting with our website, their team and other teams and all of these relationships have an effect on the outcome of the game. The team with the most profit at the end of the game (year) WINS!&#10;&#10;To start the game, the players must divide into teams. Each team being made of 1-3+ players. Teams can be bigger for large groups but 3 is the ideal largest team size. The teams name their company and roll dice to determine which side of the game board to play on (franchise vs. non-franchise) and from there, the players reference the &quot;play now&quot; section of the website to capture their region info to note on the main game board before they begin the first turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn equals a month in business. The game lasts for 12 months (1 year) but the first quarter (3 months) has already been completed so the teams actually begin in April using Jan-Mar as a template for how to proceed.&#10;&#10;Each team begins by rolling a dice to determine if they pull a &quot;sales&quot; card or a &quot;company&quot; card. Sales cards tend to lead to better results but not always. Following the instructions on the sales card, the team proceeds with completing the income sheet for that month. They then use those results to complete the balance sheet and then the cash flow statement.&#10;&#10;Finally, they check the economic health of the other teams in their community to see if they are growing or declining which effects their income for the following turn (month).&#10;&#10;This cycle continues in and through December where the winner is determined based on their total earnings, cash at the bank and owners equity.&#10;&#10;Despite all the financial terms the game is both realistic and fun to play for families or professionals.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This variant also shortens the game by changing the goal into a race to complete words, as opposed to a competition over victory points.  Also, instead of completing the usual 10 or more words per game, the game ends when a player has completed only 4 words.  However, using the goal tiles from the original game, you can add variety by changing both the words and the number of words.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Villagers start moving by opening new tiles. They explore new lands and mine or find resources, kill enemies, buy new soldier... But they must be afraid of The Storm. The Storm is behind them, and the safe zone is becoming smaller over time. They must fight for that zone and survive. They can mine resources, help friends, shoot from catapult, be lost in a forest an much more.&#10;&#10;A bit detailed:&#10;&#10;Getting Started&#10;To start a game you need to connect borders and place tiles inside borders. Then choose a color, take 2 soldiers, open the central tile of one of the sides of hexagon and place your soldiers on it. That tile is considered as free space. It cannot harm you or be used in any ways. Place the counter on one of the corners of hexagon, which will be counting point. After finishing the preparation choose the first player by rolling the dice, the queue will be determined clockwise. The goal is to survive and be the last man standing.&#10;&#10;Turn&#10;Each of villagers can do one action in each turn. The actions are: moving to neighbor tile, buying another villager, killing enemy villagers. Villager can move only to neighbor tiles (the tile which has common side). He must open the unopened tile after moving on it, if the tile is not closed by the storm. He can also carry the resources with him to the new tile (maximal quantity of each resource is mentioned on villager&rsquo;s section), but resources only of one type.&#10;&#10;Villagers&#10;A villager dies after a hit from another. To hit an enemy, villager needs to stand on the neighbor tile of the enemy and move to another neighbor tile of an enemy, which is not an abyss, another enemy. You can only kill one enemy on a tile, if the enemy villager&rsquo;s number is greater than one, you can choose which on must die. Villager dies immediately, when he stands on enemy tile. Player can use only the resources, which are located in it&rsquo;s villager&rsquo;s tile. Player must pay one bread , if his villager&rsquo;s count is more than or equal to 3, otherwise he must sacrifice one of his villagers for each unpaid turn. On one tile can be placed less than 4 villagers. You can buy new villagers by gold. Bought villager is placed on tile, where is the other villager with gold. After death of the villager all his resources stay on the same tile, and everyone can take it. If that tile is not available, the resources go to bank. If player does anything with villager, he cannot cancel it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kaiju Stadium is a two-player strategy game about giant monsters playing sports. In it, you make use of dice, play cards, and unique kaiju abilities to pull off wild combinations and score points against your opponent.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you roll two dice and pick from them to decide what you're going to do with that turn. The dice give you movement options, let you kick the ball, and more, plus you have access to limited-use Play cards that let you do things that aren't on the dice. Beyond that, every kaiju has a pair of unique special abilities: one that modifies how it interacts with the basic rules of the game (e.g. Hyperion can trample through opposing kaiju while moving) and one that happens when they switch onto the field from the sidelines (e.g. Nimbus can steal the ball from a nearby space). You're going to spend each turn making decisions about who to move, who to have on the field, and what to do with your kaiju, trying to solve the ongoing puzzle of &quot;can I score a point this turn or not?&quot;&#10;&#10;Get the ball into the opponent's goal to score a point. The game is over when a player can reach three or more points with a two point lead or when either play reaches five points.&#10;&#10;Rounds take about 15-30 minutes and the game rarely unfolds the exact same way twice, so the game is meant to be played several times in a row.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Brexit: The Board Game of Second Chances is a dice-rolling, strategic-token placement game that is easy to learn, but provides depth for experienced gamers. It is also steeped in parody--both through artwork and flavor text--concerning the EU Referendum. Whether you supported Leave, Remain, or just like to see political figures taken to task, there&rsquo;s something here for you to laugh about. (There&rsquo;s also fact cards, with actual facts relevant to the issues of the EU Referendum&hellip;ones neither campaign seemed to actually use.)&#10;&#10;In a Nutshell:&#10;Each player chooses a campaign (Leave or Remain) then cooperates with that campaign to defeat the other campaign. There are two primary game mechanics: (1) rolling dice to match symbols on cards that provide effects, and (2) using those effects to strategically place campaign tokens on a map (or remove your opponents). The campaign that claims a majority of the map first, wins. Players can also use effects to sabotage the opposing campaign.&#10;&#10;A Player's Turn:&#10;A player rolls argument dice and tries to match the symbols on the dice (representing arguments relevant to the EU Referendum) with the symbols on headline cards. Matching all the symbols on a headline card grants the player various effects--from advancing the player's side on the map (and thus winning over voters) to sabotaging another player (by blocking that player from rerolling, using wilds, or advancing that player's side on the map).&#10;&#10;The campaign that flips three of the five voting regions first--by placing three tokens on a region or through other game effects--wins the vote and the game.&#10;&#10;Brexit: The Board Game of Second Chances provides humorous content with accessible, quick-to-learn, but dynamic gameplay. It's perfect for a mix of skilled and new gamers, or as a fun distraction on an otherwise long and serious gaming session.&#10;&#10;",

The same player may not be chosen twice.&#10;&#10;After the teams have been chosen it is time to play soccer. Each player has their own board where they put their player cards. Both players start with a ball on their goal keepper. The ball is moved by rolling a dice and players do so in turn. With 1-2 the ball goes backwards, 3 sideways and 4-6 forward. If the ball can't move back it stays where it is.&#10;&#10;When a player gets the ball to attacking zone a kick occurs. The attacking player throws the dice again and adds the value to the kickers attack value. Defending player checks the defending value of the goalkeeper and the player of his who has the ball and counts them together. If the attacker has a bigger sum the kick is a goal, and if defending sum is bigger the game continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when an agreed number of goals is made.&#10;&#10;This is basically a two player game, but can be plaid with multiple people as a tournament.&#10;&#10;",
