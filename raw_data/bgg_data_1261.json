After the round, the players' points are converted to a type of meta points by moving a pawn on a red carpet.&#10;&#10;In subsequent rounds, the player who is behind in meta points begins the round by setting cards aside from their hand to create a small private deck; they will draw from this deck once the main draw pile is exhausted.&#10;&#10;",

Recruit brave knights and assassins to crush your enemies. Get priests and peasants into your kingdom to expand faster. But don't lose your king or your kingdom will crumble before your very eyes.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player starts with a king card in their hand. If you lose your king card you are out of the game. You have to play cards to force others to lose their king. Some cards may help you to gain cards and other cards may be used to deplete your opponents cards.&#10;&#10;Certain types of cards can be used to battle against other people. You can use Horsemen, Knights, Guards, Squires and even Peasants to attack and defend your kingdom. If you play enough cards, your opponent will have to discard 3 cards. Other players can join in the battle by playing their battle cards during a battle onto either player's side.&#10;&#10;Envoy cards like the assassin, thief, imposter, baron and strategist have effects that involve taking a random card from an opponent&rsquo;s hand. If you choose the right card you get a good effect. Barons and strategists have good effects for both players. assassins, thieves and imposters have negative effects for the other player. Your opponent won't know what card you used until you take one of their cards. But they can chose the guard against you if you want to play and envoy card. By playing guards, they can check cards in your hand for assassins, thieves and imposters. But if they check your barons or strategists, they will have to discard their guards.&#10;&#10;You have to convince your opponent not to guard against you in order to play assassins, thieves and imposters or you can trick them into guarding against your barons or strategists to make them lose their guards.&#10;&#10;By having power points, you can expand your kingdoms even faster. For every 5 power points you have at the start of your turn, you can draw an extra card. Power points allow you to gain cards faster quickly turning you into a dominating force. Cards like Peasants, Priests, Princesses and Princes will give you power points.&#10;&#10;When all the players have lost their king cards the last player left is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Four battleships and eight heavy cruisers were available, with three more battleships being fitted out. However, there were no aircraft carriers (initially), not least because the Regia Marina was intended to operate near to friendly air bases in Italy and Africa.&#10;&#10;As might be expected from a force operating among the islands of the Mediterranean, light forces were quite numerous, including 14 light cruisers, 128 destroyers and 62 motor torpedo boats, which was a weapon favoured by the Italians and well suited to local conditions. No less than 115 submarines were available. The main Italian naval base was at Taranto, home of the battleship force. Lighter groups were based out of ports on the Italian mainland, Sicily and the Red Sea.&#10;&#10;The Regia Marina was primarily tasked with interrupting British logistics and trade through the Mediterranean, and with keeping the Axis nations&rsquo; links to North Africa open. Major actions with the Royal Navy were not desirable nor really necessary for this mission to be carried out.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 Aquila-class Carrier - Aquila&#10;1 Conte di Cavour-class Battleship - Conte di Cavour 1940&#10;1 Etna-class cruiser - Etna 1942&#10;1 Zara-class cruiser - Pola 1940&#10;1 Luigi Cadorna-class cruiser - Luigi Cadorna 1940&#10;3 Navigatori-class Destroyers&#10;4 Torpedo-Bomber Aircraft - Reggiane RE.2001 Falco II&#10;Ship Cards &amp; Damage Sliders&#10;Assembly Instructions&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Littorio class was the first new Italian battleship class for nearly a decade when design work began in 1930. Initially designed to remain within the 35,000-ton Washington Treaty limit, the final displacement was just over 40,000 tons. As well as being good-looking ships, the Littorio-class included a number of new features including high-velocity guns. They were probably the first of the &lsquo;fast battleships&rsquo; that would come to dominate capital ship design in the late 1930s and onward.&#10;&#10;Vittorio Veneto saw extensive service in World War Two, participating in the Battles of Cape Spartivento in November 1940 and Cape Matapan in March 1941. Though struck by a torpedo at this latter engagement and again later courtesy of a British submarine, she would escape unscathed from the British raid on Taranto of November 1940. 1941 and early 1942 was spent attempting to attack British convoys en route to Malta, until fuel shortages forced the end of such activity. In the armistice of 1943, she was surrendered to the Allies after Italy withdrew from the war, spending the next three years under British control in Egypt. Thereafter she was allocated to Britain as a war prize and was scrapped.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Submarines: Compared to a German Type VII C submarine, the Marcello-class were much larger, displacing 1,060 tons versus 769. Speed and range between the two classes were almost similar, but the Marcello-class had more torpedo tubes than the famous U-Boat. The Marcello-class should be considered one of the most successful produced by the Italian shipyards and showed very good qualities &ndash; being fast, structurally robust and relatively manoeuvrable.&#10;&#10;MTBs: Capable of 45 knots, the Italian Motoscafo Armato Silurante (Armed Torpedo Boat) or MAS Boats were extremely active in the Mediterranean theatre. Though they were not well suited to rougher seas, they still achieved a great deal of note, including the torpedoing of HMS Capetown and an attack on the harbour of Malta, though the latter was a failure that cost two MAS Boats.&#10;&#10;Based on German S1 class S-Boats the Italians found in the port of Cattaro in Yugoslavia, the MS Boat was larger and far more seaworthy than the MAS designs. Though not as fast, it was far better suited to long range patrols in the Mediterranean being more stable and more comfortable. It was an MS Boat that sank the largest vessel of any MTB in the war, HMS Manchester, in 1942.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The term Mare, which in Latin means &quot;sea&quot; was erroneously applied to such features by telescopic observers of the 17th century who mistook them for actual seas. In actuality, Maria are huge basins containing lava flows marked by craters, ridges, faults, straight and meandering valleys called rilles and are devoid of water. Maria are the largest topographic, dark and relatively young features on the Moon. Together with the bright, heavily cratered and very old lunar Highlands (Latin: Terrae), they form the landscape of the Moon. Maria are less reflective than the Terrae and can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Back in the days, the Apollo program, led by NASA, brought back many samples of lunar rock and soil material. It proved that among other minerals and elements, Maria are to be rich in Iron, Titanium, Magnesium and Silicon. Even three new minerals were discovered on the Moon and named Armalcolite, Tranquillityite and Pyroxferroite. Since then, besides being a research object, the Moon becomes increasingly, a point of interest to many of Earth's public and private companies, which perceive it as their next source for acquiring and extracting resources in the future ...&#10;&#10;... in Luna Mare: Mineralis &amp; Dominatio game, players compete in collecting elements discovered on the surface of the Moon with aim to discover additional, valuable, new resources and minerals. In addition to gathering resources they also fight for control over Maria to establish a rewarding Moon dominance.&#10;&#10;Gameplay introduces and smoothly combines 2 core mechanics of pick up &amp; deliver and area control in a single game. Together with light combat, score rivalry, units and cards management or team play, it provides a deep, tactical experience.&#10;&#10;2 to 3 players may compete with each other in multiplayer games. Also, 4 players may play the game by being divided into 2 teams of 2 players. Playing cooperatively team members compete with the opposite team.&#10;&#10;The game is based on a strong, realistic theme. Included map represents quite real boundaries of the lunar Maria seen from the Earth, as well as the Apollo landing positions. Also elements and minerals with their names, amount and composition are based on real discoveries, research and available publications.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;TWO GAMES IN ONELuna Mare: Mineralis &amp; Dominatio is a single board game that consists of 2 separate gameplay modes and experiences - Mineralis and Dominatio.&#10;&#10;Although sharing the same goal concept, each gameplay mode offers different mechanics ratios and ways of playing the game, forcing players to adapt their skills and tactics. Mineralis focuses more on a pick up &amp; deliver mechanics with a support of an area control. While Dominatio strongly prefers an area control with a complementary assistance of a pick up &amp; deliver.&#10;&#10;Besides using the same, basic gameplay mechanics and components, both modes also introduce their own, unique features. Mineralis has its element delivery and new resource discoveries. Dominatio, on the other hand, provides a constant fight for domination over the most valuable regions and elements.&#10;&#10;Each mode comes with a dedicated map, rulebook and a few additional, individual components. They may be easily treated as a standalone, full-featured games.&#10;&#10;Choose the way of playing and dominate the resources and surface of the Moon!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Check the forum thread for game presentation and all official resources/files/links&#10;[OFFICIAL] - Game presentation + PnP files + Links + WIP Thread + Digital versions&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;2021 Two Player Print and Play Game Design Contest - achievements&#10; &#10;     BEST GAME: 1st place!&#10;     Best gamer's game: 1st place!&#10;     Best game to play remotely: 1st place!&#10;     Best mechanics: 1st place!&#10;     Best rule book: 5th place!&#10;     Best art/graphic design: 1st place!&#10;     Best use of theme: 1st place!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You and your crew are on a mission manning an experimental ship to prove that alternate realities exist. The ship malfunctions and crashes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy in an unknown reality full of ferocious monsters.&#10; Each player takes control of a hero trying to defend against an endless swarm of monsters, all while repairing the downed ship. Players each roll 5 dice at the start of every round that can be spent to perform actions such as moving, searching, gaining XP, and attacking. They also have a unique starting ability that changes gameplay for that player from the very beginning.&#10;&#10;The face of a die only affects searching and attacking, though there are many ways to manipulate the dice keeping randomness at a minimum. There are also several free actions that do not require spending dice, giving players a large variety of choice and wildly-varying turns.&#10;&#10;Along with the 6 unique heroes to choose from, each hero also has their own 6-card deck of Level Up cards. Only 3 of these cards are used each game, providing a unique experience even when playing as the same hero multiple times.&#10;&#10;Monsters spawn onto the board and are trying to get to the ship to destroy it once and for all. Monsters are on cards which have die faces on them acting as their HP. To attack these creatures, players spend the matching dice to damage or defeat the monster. At the beginning of the game, the monsters only have 2 HP. However, as the game progresses the monsters get increasingly difficult with more HP for each beast. Players may want to gain XP and level up their heroes to combat these stronger baddies.&#10;&#10;The monsters are attracted to the smell of leaking oil coming from the ship. To prevent more monsters from spawning, players will want to contribute scrap metal to the middle of the board each round to plug the leak. Although, while searching for more metal, heroes may uncover a boss monster who is the fiercest of them all.&#10;&#10;The ship has 4 damaged rooms that must be repaired. Players will find ship parts for each room by searching different locations. Once a ship part is brought back to the ship, players choose what section of the matching room they wish to repair, providing a one-time ability and giving more freedom of choice. Each room also an alternative side of one-time abilities which can be chosen or selected at random during setup, offering more replayability.&#10;&#10;Once the heroes have repaired the ship, cleared the area of monsters, and everyone is on board, they can take-off and return home. Dice manipulation, as well as most actions not requiring specific dice, leaves players with the difficult decision of whether to attack, search, repair, gain XP, etc. rather than focusing on getting the best roll. The many different strategies to victory, along with the unique heroes and setup, provides a one-of-a-kind experience with each play.&#10;&#10;It was all going so well&hellip; and then monsters showed up.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each card has a Momotar&#197;&#141;-ness score in the top left corner, as well an effect.&#10;&#10;During each turn of the game, a player may chose to either (A) draw &amp; play a card, (B) use a Kibidango chip, or (C) pass.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;If the player chooses A:&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;After drawing a card from the stack they will proceed to place one card face up from his or her hand.

Alternatively, there is also a wild card that can be used to replace one of these three animals to win.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;When all players have empty hands and no one has been able to collect dog, monkey, and pheasant, use the total Momotar&#197;&#141;-ness score of all the cards that belong to a player (placed in front of them) to determine the winner.

Various types of ore are represented by colored cubes contained in a small cloth bag called &quot;the mine.&quot; A large card represents the Ore Train with a set of ore  cubes available to all players, but players may choose to draw a random cube from the mine instead. Each player has a large card representing their own refinery which includes conveyors to process the five types of ore. Each player also has a small screen called their Warehouse, behind which they will conceal their store of refined minerals as the game goes on. There are also cards which can be drawn by the players to aid their efforts, or hinder the efforts of their competitors. On each turn, a player may draw a card (if they wish), and will select an ore cube to add to their refinery. When ore completes the refining process, the player is rewarded by special tasks or choices they can make, including playing their cards. The end game is triggered when one player has refined five &quot;rarium&quot; cubes (the most valuable of the Martian minerals). Then the winner is determined by the greatest number of refined minerals in the player's warehouse.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Choose gods who will favor you with various blessings and decide whether to bury treasure in your own coffin or choose to steal treasure from others. The player who collects the most treasure wins the game.&#10;&#10;When playing with the &ldquo;Short Rules&rdquo; which require the usage of fewer cards, the game can be casually played in around 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fates and Favors is a strategic, team-based, track-movement game combined with Greek mythology.&#10;&#10;Players are Greek heroes invited to Mount Olympus to pay tribute to the gods by building temples in their honor. To win the game, heroes work with their teammate to complete two temples before the other team.&#10;&#10;Heroes use the game&rsquo;s dynamic card play to strategically choose actions in response to the evolving gameplay. Fate cards are the primary basis for movement while Favor cards are powerful interventions from the Olympians. While heroes have the means to control their own fate through clever moves and efficient teamwork, a few perfectly timed godly favors can unexpectedly shift the momentum of the competition in the blink of an eye!&#10;&#10;Fates and Favors&rsquo; is finely-tuned to provide heroes memorable experiences with epic comebacks, sweet revenge, and high-stakes anticipation as both teams race to complete their temples!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Plantation owners in Afghanistan have devilish tricks and creative tools to grow and harvest their poppies.&#10;&#10;In this card game, each player has their own poppy plantation and their goal is to harvest the most poppies by maximizing their plantation's productivity and stifling the opposition.&#10;&#10;There are four types of card:&#10;&#10;     The Field cards, which are the cards the players can harvest. Most of these are poppy cards, which have a value from 1 to 8.&#10;     The Infrastructure cards, which permanently affect the player's plantation in various ways.&#10;     The Action cards, which boost poppy production or sabotage the competition. These cards are discarded immediately after being played.&#10;     The Wild cards, which behave differently depending on what the player chooses them to be.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player must have five cards in their hand at the start of their turn. During their turn, the player must draw one card from the common stack and then play one card, either by placing it in front of them in their plantation (Field or Infrastructure cards) or by resolving its action (Action cards). They can also simply discard a card. If they so choose, they can play a second one and if they do, they have to draw a second card from the stack afterwards.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has five Field cards in their plantation, they must harvest it. The harvest is worth the combined value of the poppy cards harvested. The first player reaching 69 points wins!&#10;&#10;Note: One deck allows to play with up to six players, but one can combine several decks together to play with many more people.&#10;&#10;",

For example, &quot;my father's first cousin is my second cousin.&quot;&#10;&#10;The deck's 64 cards represent everyone from great-grandmother to third cousin. Of course, there are a few wild cards, to get you out of tight spots. The figures on the cards have what Smith calls Egyptian-like, angular features. These, she said, are universal faces.&#10;Smith said she started working on the game in 1975, &quot;even before Roots came on television.&quot; It seemed simple, she said, until she realized there are hundreds of possible combinations of relatives.&#10;&#10;Smith obtained a patent on &quot;Family Treedition&quot; two years ago. She paid a printer to produce 100 copies of the game last October and has sold them all, many as Christmas gifts. Another 500 copies are on the way for $14.95 each. The game can be purchased from Smith, or through Stanley 5 &amp; 10 Cent Stores in Brookland.&#10;&#10;",

While the Klingon B10 Invincible is huge, we have enough ships to bring her down.&#10;&#10;The most powerful ships in the galaxy have been unleashed and are now free to rain havoc upon their enemies.&#10;&#10;The Klingons have set loose the B10 battleship Invincible upon Federation colonies. The Invincible is supported by C5 light dreadnoughts and C10 heavy super-dreadnoughts. The Federation has sent in its fleet with the battleship USS Mars at the head. It is also supported by dreadnoughts. These titans of war will clash, and who knows what will happen when they do.&#10;&#10;There are over 60 starships, adding battleships, dreadnoughts, transports, and tugs to your fleets. There are also nine starbases to add more defenses to your systems. These are for the Federation, Gorn, Hydran, Klingon, Kzinti, Lyran, Romulan, Seltorian, and Tholian empires. The WYNs are not neglected as they get their light tactical transport with and without cargo pods.&#10;&#10;This book is an expansion. You must have Klingon Armada Unity or Romulan Armada Unity. Play will be enhanced with the Starmada Unity Rulebook.&#10;&#10;This edition unifies the previous Nova and Admiralty editions, so there will no longer be Starmada fans who cannot game together. The new rules preserve the best of both previous systems and add dynamic seeking weapons rules that do what seeking weapons are supposed to do: force the enemy to move out of key areas or shoot his way through a swarm of them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player draws their chosen construction type within their chosen location. When all players have used the dice roll, re-roll for the next turn.&#10;&#10;The pad comes with 50 scoresheets.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It is played on the spaces (squares) of a 10x10 square board. At the start of the game, white partisans are placed on the a4, g1, d10 and j7 squares, and black partisans are placed on a7, g10, d1 and j4. Additionally, each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color outside the board.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayWhite plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, move a partisan of your color to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over enemy pieces.&#10;&#10;Then, place a stone on an empty square that is a straight orthogonal or diagonal line away from the square onto which the partisan was moved, with no enemy pieces in between along that line. This is called shooting.&#10;&#10;Note that partisans can move and shoot over friendly partisans and stones as well as over empty squares.&#10;&#10;To compensate for the advantage of moving first, White is not allowed to shoot on their first turn, but they must still move a partisan.&#10;&#10;If you have no moves available on your turn, you lose.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesPartisans is based on Amazons, a game designed by Walter Zamkauskas in 1992.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NomadSed is a strategic board game where players assume the role of nomadic herders and try to increase their livestock capital. They have to make decisions that do not only depend on the state of the pastures, but also on daily challenges related to life in the steppe. At times, it makes sense to invest money and buy extra fodder; at others, sheep have to be sold at the market; and sometimes, cooperating with your neighbours is the best choice.&#10;&#10;The players&rsquo; goal is to obtain as many animals and as much cash as possible. In the end, it will be seen whether this is best achieved by exploiting the lands or through considerate resource utilisation.&#10;&#10;The players possess livestock herds, monetary resources, rangelands, and their own labour force which is expressed in action points. Not all pastures on the board are equally productive: fertile grasslands, as well as barren steppes, provide the dietary staples for the animals, and both are easily exhausted. Herd mobility is therefore vital.&#10;Moreover, the players have various options for action so they can persist in the face of external adversities and prevail against the others. At the market, they may buy fodder, sell part of their livestock, or purchase additional animals. Development cards open up new options and alternative income sources.&#10;&#10;The challenges faced by nomads are considerable. Year after year, they have to cope with different types of unexpected events. Recurrent external influences, whether local (drought, snowstorms, illness, legislation) or global in nature (price increases in animal fodder), determine their scopes of action. Only those who are flexible enough will prevail in the world of NomadSed.&#10;&#10;NomadSed is entertaining and instructive all at once. Current problems that are faced by nomadic societies across the globe have been adapted into a game which offers insights into a unique subject matter. It has successfully been used in schools and universities to delve into the complex social-ecological conditions of land use in drylands. &#10;The board game can be borrowed for educational purposes in an easily transportable version whose design has been registered.&#10;The game was jointly developed in the context of the DFG-funded Collaborative Research Centre 586 &lsquo;Difference and Integration&rsquo; in cooperation between the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research &ndash; UFZ Leipzig, the University of Leipzig, and the Berlin University of the Arts.&#10;&#10;",

It is at these times that the actions of one unit can make the difference between victory and defeat. Wise kings know this and realize that it is often prudent to hold back their best units until they can make the greatest difference. These elite units, called the &quot;battlesworn&quot;, are more than just powerful combatants, they are symbols of the glory and honor of a kingdom. All young warriors hope to one day join their ranks and add their oathmarks beside those legendary fighters.&#10;&#10;This supplement for Oathmark: Battles of the Lost Age contains rules for adding elite units to your armies and charting their progress from battle to battle. Will they grow even more powerful as they gain renown, or be broken in the face of tremendous odds, perhaps someday to be reformed when their kingdom needs them most? Also included are rules for rivers and boats as well as campaigns, featuring all-new scenarios that will give your battlesworn the chance to lead their kingdom to new heights of power and prestige.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There is a mysterious apple orchard.&#10;And the time for harvesting has once again arrived.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;Protect your orchard from insects and birds while taking care of your trees and harvesting your apples.&#226;&#128;&#168;Let&rsquo;s gather as many apples as we can.&#10;&#10;Each player tends to their own orchard and collects apples by strategically placing trees and apples.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player should lay down two cards (face up) from their hand to build their personal orchard. There are two types of cards: apples and trees. An orchard is made up a tree column and an apple column. Tree cards are played into the tree column to form a trunk. When the total value of the trunk is greater than or equal to 100, harvesting begins. If the trunk&rsquo;s value is exactly 100, it is an abundant harvest and therefore the player may harvest all apples that they have placed into their apple column. If the value is greater than 100, the player may only harvest a single apple (the uppermost card aka the most recently placed card).&#10;&#10;After harvesting, all tree cards are disposed and the player must work to grow another tree.&#10;&#10;In addition, a player may also place down cards horizontally to achieve different effects.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;An apple card of the same number can be placed horizontally to create a &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; of fruit. If, for example, this cluster is at the top of the apple column and a player begins harvesting after going over 100 in value, the player will be able to collect all the apples in the cluster (instead of just a single apple). However, if a player harvests their apples upon fulfilling the exactly 100 value requirement, they will only be able to harvest up till the first cluster and not the whole column.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;A tree card of the same number as another tree card can also be placed horizontally to create a branch. After harvesting, the non-trunk cards of this branch do not need to be disposed and instead can be rearranged to form a new column as the new trunk.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;In addition, branches give the player the option to include or exclude the cards forming the branch in their total tree value count (towards 100).&#10;&#10;Branches and clusters can only be continuously built on the uppermost card (aka most recently placed card) for the column.&#10;&#10;In this game, you can also chose to help tend your neighbor&rsquo;s orchard. You may play any card into their orchard instead of your own. If by doing this you fulfill the 100 value requirement for harvest, you will receive half of your neighbor&rsquo;s apple cards (you chose which half). If you fulfill the over 100 value requirement instead, you will battle with your neighbor over the single apple/cluster card(s).&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;Battling consists of playing a &ldquo;war&rdquo;-esque game where both players simultaneously reveal a card from their hand. The player with the higher value tree card will win the apple Card. (Except for in the case that the highest card is 50, which will then allow for a 5 card to win instead.)&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;At the end of the game (when the drawing deck is empty), this battling comes back into play to decide who gets the remaining unharvested apples in everyone&rsquo;s orchards.&#10;&#10;There are also some special cards including a pigeon card, a woodpecker card, and a bug card which have different effects. Like apple and tree cards, players can choose to play them into their opponents&rsquo; orchards.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "New duel variant for 2 players, with an additional duel board and 6 duel tokens.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Setup: Instead of using individual score boards, place the duel board between the two players. Use only one set of counters, placing one counter of each colour on the dividing line in the middle of each track on the duel board.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Play as usual. When you score, advance the respective colour counters on the duel board in your direction. You cannot advance the counters beyond the final space (value 9) on your side of the duel board. For each counter that reaches the final space, call out &ldquo;Axio&rdquo; and place the corresponding duel token face up in front of you. Then you get an instant bonus play of one tile as usual.&#10;&#10;Scoring: The player with more counters on his side of the score board wins. To break a tie, when both players have 3 counters on their side, compare the lowest positions of the counters on each side, as usual.&#10;&#10;",
