    "Description": "From the designer:&#10;My take on space combat is that it should resemble submarine warfare more than dogfights or naval action and this require that sensors and weapons to have more or less the same ranges. The system is tailored towards small encounters between small ships, a fight should be fun even if there are only two ships involved.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds on printed out maps, one for each player and one common for Spotted ships. Ships use vector movement for movement and are affected by gravity. Planetary Line-Of-Sight, sun direction, ship signatures etc all affect detection and combat. Players may design their own ships to test out ideas on how space battles should be fought.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Vector movement&#10;    Realistic gravity with stable orbits&#10;    Realistic sensor rules&#10;    Ship design system&#10;    Double-blind system without a referee&#10;    Optional deterministic system with no chance elements&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Tiles are worth 1 to 3 points as indicated in the center of the tile. The game begins with a square made of 4 randomly drawn tiles and each player drawing a hand of 3 tiles. Players take turns in clock-wise order placing a tile and replenishing their hand. The newly placed tile must be set side-by-side to the previously played tiles such that any adjoining sides have matching symbols. The turn is scored by adding the value of the newly placed tile to each tile that it touches. The winner is the player with the highest score after all tiles are played.&#10;&#10;",

The idea is to use the card square to reveal coins (which are then matched by examples from the pot) with the intention of arriving at pre-determined sums.&#10;&#10;The winner is the individual who achieves his or her sum correctly. The values are in pounds, shillings and pence, and the coins are made from card printed in gold and silver to represent the correct look of the original coinage.&#10;&#10;",

Because of the rapid expansion of the modern opening theory its role becomes too large and sometimes even dominating according to more and more chess players and grandmasters, including Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer - by many considered to be the best chess players in the world.&#10;&#10;This objection is overcome by Superchess: a natural and logical extension of chess in which the players create the starting position together following a simple procedure. Superchess is virtually chess without the opening theory.&#10;&#10;Superchess is played on an ordinary 8x8-chessboard with ordinary chess pieces, but with a few additional new pieces. The new pieces move slightly different from conventional pieces. For example, the Amazon moves like a Queen or Knight. Studying the opening theory will not be worthwile in practice because too many different starting positions exist.&#10;&#10;Now it comes down to strategical insight and tactical ingenuity only!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Skaters maneuver their players and puck on board to an advantageous shooting position, the best being one of the 18 circled spaces in front of the goal.&#10;&#10;For a board game involving pawns and a board of circles, Pass and Score is remarkably faithful to good hockey play. Each player gets three moves in sequence, which can be a combination of moving a pawn one space, passing the puck from one pawn to another along any clear line, and of course shooting on goal. Passes must not violate standard offside rules.&#10;&#10;Any given pawn can only move two spaces in a turn, but the board includes &quot;slide&quot; lines that allow bursts of speed on offence or defence. One player takes the puck away from the other by moving a pawn onto the same space as the puck carrier (the pawns have a peg to hold them on top of the puck), &quot;checking&quot; his opponent into an adjacent circle.&#10;&#10;Most challenging of all for all players: a penalty is called when either team fails to complete its three-element move within 15 seconds! Going over the limit means you lose one of your pawns for the next three turns.&#10;&#10;While intended to be played for fun, it includes a significant teaching component, including dotted lines on the board showing the areas of responsibility for different positions, and a set of 18 Hockey Tips listed inside the box.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher Blurb:  The Three Musketeers (Chess Variant) is a two-player abstract strategy board game that represents renaissance  warfare on an 8x14 board with alternating light and dark colored squares representing land, river, bridge, castle, and cathedral terrain. Each terrain type provides specific benefits or obstacles to the different game pieces. Opposing pieces, printed as blue and red chess pieces (but which may be substituted by actual chess pieces), are initially placed in specific locations designated on the game board. Each type of piece has a unique type of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, by its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece, as in chess. Each side takes turns moving a single one of their pieces trying to gain positional advantage, capture opponents, and achieve their objectives. The Cardinal&rsquo;s pawn type pieces are an important exception to normal movement rules.  If a pawn is selected to be moved, a total of two pawns may move during a single turn.  These are the only pieces that may do so.  The Three Musketeer player&rsquo;s knight type pieces may not move until the d&rsquo;Artagnan rook type piece finishes a turn adjacent to each and activates it.  Until they are activated, they face backwards on the game board and may not move.  The game was inspired by Alexandre Dumas story, The Three Musketeers, and by Chess-like games such as Siege.&#10;&#10;",

It is based on the principle that parliamentary boundaries and demographics, as well as party policy, determine elections. Policy may influence the floating voters, but all parties depend on their partisans whose loyalty is not a matter of electoral logic but of passion. You take your supporters where you find them, heavily concentrated for Labour and widely spread for the centrist parties. Psephology is as important as media hype.&#10;&#10;The game uses tile placement and area control mechanisms, and there is a random tile draw phase at the end to handle floating voters.&#10;&#10;The game is a PDF production, and covers the 2010 Election. Expansion sets will cover historical elections. A set of Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party markers is included for that purpose.&#10;&#10;",

Each cube has a weight on one side, so that when stacking players will need to put the side with the weight on the cube below it. To start, take any cube from your pile and place it on a flat surface in front of you. Take another cube and stack it on the edge of your first cube. Be sure not to stack the cube on the white square in the centre. Continue stacking until you have stacked all 8 of your cubes. If your cubes should fall, continue stacking.&#10;&#10;There are two alternate ways to play: a race to stack your cubes or take turns and stack on a shared stack. First to cause the stack to fall, loses the round. Play for five rounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chieftain Chess is a structured multi-move game for 2 teams of 1-4 players/side. It is scalable, with larger and smaller versions available. A chess-wargame fusion that uses 5 different types of simple short-range chess-like pieces, it mimics various aspects of an ancient battle on a 12x16 rectangular field. Four chiefs [the strongest but not the fastest pieces] per side lead their 32 piece armies in a set-piece battle that begins just after the 2 armies start to close with each other.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by killing all 4 enemy chiefs before your 4 get killed. Players move as many pieces per turn as they have friendly chiefs on the board. The moving pieces must be within &quot;command control range&quot; of the chiefs, generally 3 squares, to be able to move that turn. This forces the royal pieces to be active participants in the heat of the battle, rather than trying to hide in the corners like the kings of chess.&#10;&#10;Most games, regardless of size, are determined in 30-40 turns. The game is designed so the pace increases from beginning to end. The players start with 1 chief for every 8 pieces, so they move about 12% of their armies each turn in the beginning. By midgame, 20-25% of the army moves each turn, and by the endgame, roughly 50% of the remaining pieces move each turn.&#10;&#10;The game trades space for time compared to western chess. Where attacks in chess are sequenced deeply in time but concentrated in space, in Chieftain multiple attacks are spread out across space, but can't be accurately calculated more than 2 or 3 turns deep in time. It has a deliberate, almost defining theme, yet it is a pure abstract game, with perfect information, and in its specific &quot;combat&quot; pieces and their movement rules, there is no semblance of reality. What it allows is a game played on 2 levels, the tactical level being a pure, simple chess variant, and the strategic level being a simulation of a wargame.&#10;&#10;The game may be played online at chessvariants.org, or a Chieftain Chess set can be made from 2 complete sets of chesspieces and 3 same-sized chess boards, one cut in half, for face to face play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Introduction (Edited):&#10;&#10;The intent behind the game is to provide a set of skirmish rules (one-on-one combat between characters) streamlined enough that games can be played to a satisfactory conclusion.  In a suitalbly brief amount of time, with considerably more figures than the usual fantasy role-playing game encounter.  In many ways, this is a military adjunct to a Middle Aesopian role-playing campaign, allowing the players to engage in actions larger than a simple dungeon crawl.  Even though the basic rules are bare-boned and straightforward in order to help achieve these ends, they provide a solid foundation for the addition of house-rules and additional material.&#10;&#10;Although its roots go back a long way, the mythos of Middle Aesopia is a living story that contines to grow on the Skirmisher interactive forum and in it's soon to be released Quactica role-playing game.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Quactica: Battles for the Soul of Middle Aesopia was one of the new products Skirmisher released at Gen Con 2008 in Indianapolis. This innovative set of miniatures rules was created by veteran game designer and miniatures sculptor Steve Lortz, author of the famous Perilous Encounters rules released by Chaosium in 1978. Set in a world inhabited by various races of anthropomorphic animals - including Ducks, Dwargs, and Porks - the Quactica rules tie in with a beautiful line of miniatures created by Lortz and produced by Skirmisher Publishing LLC.&#10;&#10;",

Players receive three demand cards which each have three possible deliveries.  To complete a delivery a player must connect the demanding city with the city that supplies the good it needs.  Building track costs money, and the payout for each load is always going to be slightly less than the cost to build the track to make the connection.  This pricing mechanism forces players to coordinate the deliveries on all three cards to maximize the use of their track in order to turn a profit.  Once one of the three deliveries on a card is made, a new card is drawn to take its place.  Play continues until a player reaches $250 million and has connected all but one of the major cities.&#10;&#10;This print and play game is free to download.  It requires a copy of another crayon rails game for the money and trains.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Created by renowned game designer Reiner Knizia, Ingenious Challenges contains three games of mental dexterity for 2-4 players. Retaining the spirit of its predecessor board game Ingenious, the games in Ingenious Challenges challenge players to score as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also forcing them to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well. Four scoreboards with colored pegs and tracks for each color are used in each game, while the dice, cards and single-symbol tiles are used separately in their particular games.&#10;&#10;&bull; In the Card Challenge (published separately as Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel), a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. On a turn, he plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.&#10;&#10;&bull; In the Dice Challenge (Einfach Genial: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel), players roll dice up to three times, then score as many points for each symbol on the rolled dice as there are symbols on the dice in front of the other players. Players record these points on their scoring boards, with the barriers causing hiccups on the way, and the first player to move all colors to seven points wins.&#10;&#10;&bull; In the Tile Challenge (Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert!), all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) are shuffled face down, then three are placed face up in a shared pool. On a turn, a player reveals a tile. If the tile doesn't match one in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can collect all tiles revealed this turn and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn. If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool.&#10;&#10;Incorporates:&#10;&#10;    Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel&#10;    Einfach Genial: Das W&#195;&#188;rfelspiel&#10;    Simply Ingenious &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deft-initions&trade; is the great, new, anytime anywhere word-guessing game.&#10;&#10;Based on the fact that many English words have disparate, widely distinct definitions &mdash; all of which are correct!&#10;&#10;Each of 300 cards has a word to be guessed, and eight different definitions/clues &mdash; all of which are accurate.&#10;&#10;A reader selects a clue, reads it out loud, and the other players shout out what they think the word to be guessed is. Each of the different clues is read until someone guesses the word, or the reader stumps them.&#10;&#10;Created to be played by people with a 12 year old's vocabulary level.&#10;&#10;Think you know what words mean?&#10;Try to guess what common word the eight definitions/clues below refer to:&#10;&#10;* A small mistake&#10;    * A piece of paper used as a record&#10;    * A part of a plant used for grafting&#10;    * A place for a ship&#10;    * To slide suddenly and lose one's balance&#10;    * You don't want to get a pink one&#10;    * Of the tongue &bull; one's mind &bull; through one's fingers&#10;    * Rhymes with flip&#10;&#10;Right! The answer is &quot;slip&quot;.&#10;&#10;To Play&#10;A reader selects five clues from the eight shown (at least one must be a red clue) and reads them aloud, one at a time. The other players shout out their guesses. The correct guesser earns points depending on which clue he/she solves. Clues separated by dots indicate phrases or sayings that use the mystery word. An optional roll of the die can add a bonus or a penalty to a score depending on a player&rsquo;s luck.&#10;&#10;From Publisher (http://www.lexogon.com/deftinitions.html)&#10;&#10;",

To do this you must capture any two of his &quot;JEL&quot; pieces. JEL represents Judicial, Executive, and Legislative branches of our government. Lose one JEL piece and your country can still function, but lose the second JEL and you lose control of your government and the war.&quot;&#10;&#10;Warfare is an abstract strategy game similar in play style to stratego or chess with players taking alternating turns, where they may move, attack, or retreat (though there is no secret unit deployment as with Stratego). To win one must capture two of the opponents &quot;JEL&quot; pieces, which also have the ability to move and attack. The playing pieces are of various military and civilian ranks (JEL, Secret Service, General, Admiral,Army, Nacy, Airforce, and Marines). Each has a particular set of rules in how it can be moved, how far, or under what conditions/direction it can attack. Black squares on the game board represent land, while white squares represent water. Certain pieces may only move or attack on either by virtue of their class (Navy can only move/attack on water, while army can only move/attack on land).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game consists of tiles with four edges in four different colors. The tiles are placed between the players so each player faces one color edge (all tiles have to be aligned accordingly). Each edge contains a number which forms a larger number together with all the tiles in one row. There are also commas, which can turn a potentially large number into a very small one. The idea is to place commas in positions which are at the rear of one's own line, but at the front of another player's, so the other player's number is minimal and the own one is large.&#10;A turn consists of simply flipping over one tile and placing it into the grid. When all tiles are placed, four spaces in the 6 x 6 grid remain empty, thus further influencing the results.&#10;The player with the largest sum of all six lines is the winner.&#10;&#10;(User summary by HilkMAN)&#10;&#10;",

This card game features 120 cards and lets players manipulate the deck and their luck to activate their card functions.  But other players get to activate their functions in the same register #, even on your turn, and cause havoc with your plans. And the deck stacking isn't the only way to activate your card functions.&#10;&#10;As with all computers, random factors can cause you benefits or issues.  So, dice also activate function #s.  And as you replace your hardware, you get to fun your functions one more time as well.  There are combinations of actions that can lead to very interesting results and evolved complexity/depth.  Overall the game can be very deep, but is still accessible and easy to learn.&#10;&#10;The game plays via rounds and is only very loosely &quot;turn-based&quot;.  Players can buy and use actions/cards even when it's not their turn.  There are game balancing mechanics to help losing players catch up.&#10;&#10;This game falls into the Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, Glory to Rome, category of games in that you build your own arrangement of cards in front of you, and try to build combos.  Cards are bought via hand discards, but Two Bit Hack has a very unique method for how card functions are activated.  This aspect is most similar to Settlers of Catan.  Also, cards in hand are not only your money, but also your method of activating your functions with certainty.  Or you can leave things more up to luck and leave more cards in your hand for purchasing.&#10;&#10;",
