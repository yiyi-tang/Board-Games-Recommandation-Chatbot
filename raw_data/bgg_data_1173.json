All instructions and the playing board are provided on the centerfold; a required six-sided die is not included.  Players form two opposing teams with at least two players per team recommended.  The two teams assume the function of the Biblical wise men, traveling from their home to Bethlehem and gathering gifts along the way.&#10;&#10;Play alternates between the teams, with each rolling and moving the rolled number of squares.  Squares have game instructions for completion.  Many squares incorporate 6 separate actions, one of which is randomly selected by die roll.  Most game instructions direct some type of trivia exercise, based in Biblical or Christian knowledge of the birth of Jesus Christ and, especially, the visiting wise men.  Successful completion of the trivia activity yields a gift for the team.&#10;&#10;The first team to acquire all the needed gifts and then complete the journey to Bethlehem wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is published in the New Era magazine, a publication of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, primarily directed at youth ages 12 to about 18.  Print and PDF copies are available.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Pick your favorite and battle it out across town as you engage in shady business, sell yourself on the streets, or off your competitors.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn is very quick and composed of two main phases: &#10;Movement (Mandatory) and Action (Optional)&#10;Movement Phase: &#10;You must move your character to any new location along the line you&rsquo;re currently on. The new location may not be occupied by another player.  &#10;Action:&#10;You may take a single action chosen from those on the new location you&rsquo;re occupying. Alternatively, you may use any action ability present on one of your call girls&rsquo; cards as long as its symbol matches the one on the currently occupied location. &#10;The effects of each action are found on the game board or on the call girl cards. &#10;After you have taken your action, and if you do not wish to play cards from your hand, you may end your turn and the player on your left will be the next active player.&#10;&#10;During your turn you may play as many cards as you like from your hand, as long as their symbols match those on the currently occupied location.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;The game ends immediately when the last card from the Black Market is purchased or when the last Coin is drawn from the Coin Pool. The player with the most Coins is declared the winner. In case of a draw, the player with the most Call Girls wins - should this also result in a draw, the victory is shared amongst the winning players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Override is an abstract game for two players. The goal is simple: get five in a row in your color. What makes it interesting is that you and your opponent each have the option of controlling each other's pieces rather than your own on any given turn.&#10;&#10;All 30 pyramids begin off the 5&times;5 board. Each turn, a player may bring a piece onto an empty square on the board or move a piece that is already on the board one space orthogonally. Larger pieces can cover up smaller pieces of either color; same-size stacking and smaller-on-larger stacking is not permitted. Pieces covering up other pieces are fair game to move orthogonally just like solo pieces. Players may make these moves with either their own color or the opposing color. A group of two or three pieces on the same square count as the top color for purposes of the five-in-a-row goal. It is possible for a pyramid to be temporarily blocked in due to its being surrounded on four sides by larger pyramids. Players are not allowed to directly undo an opponent's last move, but they are allowed to create a very similar board-state. For instance, if there are four yellow pyramids in a row and the active player moves a medium yellow pyramid out of line, the next player is not allowed to move the medium yellow pyramid back into place, but is allowed to bring an identical medium yellow pyramid from off the board into that square.&#10;&#10;The first player to create a line of five in a row, diagonally or orthogonally, wins the game. In the case of two lines of opposing colors simultaneously being created, the active player wins.&#10;&#10;Requires a 5&times;5 grid and 30 pyramids: fifteen each in two colors.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;From the future me to the past me&#10;Tomorrow, I am going on a journey.&#10;It's a mysterious letter from the future.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Journey of My Future Self, a.k.a., &#230;&#152;&#142;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#151;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;, is a solitaire game in which you are invited to go on a journey and follow the mysteries of a closed world. As you travel, you encounter incidents from the past, present, and future, all of which will be repeated over and over again. You have to know them all in order to solve them. Will you be able to solve the mysteries of this world?&#10;&#10;In more detail, The Journey of My Future Self is a game of medium to short-term planning in which you have to constantly think about the best way to move your pawns, taking into account the numbers 1 to 6 that are randomly given and the numbers that are yet to be seen.&#10;&#10;The small number of cards used in the game (30) makes it difficult to recover from mistakes, and a single mistake can make the game impossible to complete. For this reason, we encourage thought experiments (trial play). This is all part of the solitaire nature of the game, which is designed to be played slowly and deliberately, without disturbing other players, no matter how long you think. We want you to forget everything else and immerse yourself in the game!&#10;&#10;You can manipulate the difficulty of the game to some extent by using any combination of &quot;items&quot; that change the basic rules. If you want to enjoy the atmosphere of the game, you can use more items to reduce the difficulty. If you are aiming for a solid high score, you can choose to barter the risks and benefits. This freedom of use makes the game replayable and flexible, allowing the player to adjust the difficulty according to their preferences.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game inspired by a detective drama of the Showa era.&#10;&#10;The player becomes one of the &quot;five unique detectives&quot; and investigates the case by allocating 24 hours each. Five cases are set at the same time, and a five-row, plot-type auction is held.&nbsp;Scores will be given to the 1st and 2nd place &quot;in the time allotted&quot; for each case. Do this for 3 hands.&#10;&#10;Detectives work together to investigate the case, but often go to stand, play to seek credit, or settle with the culprit.&nbsp;As a result, you may get deeply involved in the incident and get seriously injured or you may be killed!&#227;&#128;&#128;Moreover, even if you get a line of duty, the game is not over, and if you can get a line of duty at a good show, you can earn a high score.&nbsp;Produce your own line of duty scene well and decide &quot;What's this !!!!&quot;&#10;&#10;The basis of the game is a &quot;5-row, plot-type auction&quot;.&#227;&#128;&#128;A total of 24 common cards will be given to the player as a hand, and one card will be placed in each of the five cases, for a total of five cards.&nbsp;After placing, reveal the cards, and after seeing the result, arrange the remaining 5 sheets in the same way and judge by the total value.&nbsp;Therefore, it is important to avoid competition as much as possible and get more cases efficiently, because it is possible to guess to some extent who wants which case with the first placement.&#10;&#10;Then, shouldn't it be better to hide the information by arranging as few numbers as possible for the first placement?&nbsp;Of course, that's one strategy.&nbsp;However, if the numbers are the same, there is a rule that the one with the larger number placed on the first sheet wins, so it is not always advantageous to arrange the smaller numbers.&#227;&#128;&#128;In addition, each person has a ticket called hero time, and you can win regardless of the number unless the heroes spend time fighting with each other.&nbsp;Where to use this hero time is also important.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "the dead: SHOOT 2 SURVIVE is a Japanese horror game, following up the designer's previous game 'the dead: beloved one'.&#10;&#10;Shaun and Edo are childhood friends, and wish to become famous U-Tube stars! They love posting hot dog eating live feeds, video games, and boring videos. Today, they were having trouble shooting a video in the garage of Shaun's grandpa's house. (By the way, how long can you withstand a bunch of live crayfish in your body?) But that has nothing to do with this story. Instead, everyday life had collapsed due to a sudden zombie pandemic. The dead resurrected and ate the living. The army and police could not keep up, and the zombie population continued to expand day by day. The threat has arrived in the country town where Shaun and Edo live.&#10;&#10;As the evacuation activities proceeded, the two thought, &quot;Now is our chance to become top U-Tubers? Let's film a zombie and upload it!&quot; A fool is a big deal in a small town. Thus, the two idiots headed to the city center full of zombies. Shaun packed Grandpa&rsquo;s keepsake revolver and ammunition in his backpack, as well as a smart phone and a lot of donuts. In this way, two stupid people began to stream an endless battle with the zombie pandemic to the world. &quot;Share zombie videos with the world and become famous! I'm getting out of this shabby town!&quot;&#10;&#10;Achieve a total of 1 million likes (acquire all 8 Like cards) to clear the game. The game is over when the threat level reaches 20 or the barricade durability reaches 0 in any location.&#10;&#10;A cooperative zombie defense game, balance the life of your four barriers against the need to shoot and film the attacking zombies.

How will you manage your unique branch? Will you focus on one action, allowing other players to take advantage of your repetition? Will you get and keep morale high to reap the benefits of happy, productive employees, or try to make money quickly and work around the consequences? Will you focus on recruiting and fill your office with as many employees as you can, or will you try to avoid employees altogether and run the office by yourself?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The player who holds the Pigeon card cannot snitch, but only wins if the cop wins.

    "Description": "A Luminous Flame in The Darkness (LFID) is innovative Board Game for sharing and learning. The LFID is Homemade Integrated Design. It is also suitable for a solo game at home.  The player can share and learn about ethic, goodness, moral, and core cultures while they adventure and explore with many experiences on the map of a community. Some happenings tend to be worse. How do they live? How do they make a decision? or How do they take an action?&#10;&#10;Each Player can create Core Culture and a story together, including modify rules. In the game, the player may see a picture emerge of inter-relationships with multiple factors that are connected, such as causes that lead to multiple degenerations or the existence of individual forces against outer contexts. Preservation and recovery of life is more difficult than destruction. Creativity, life, people and the maintenance are essential for the existence of a core culture. The environment is not for the individual to exploit, but for all lives to enjoy.  This game simulates incidents happening in a world of fantasy in which virtue and ethics are crucial to the survival of humanity.  Each player will be able to perceive an overall concept of the core culture which they created together in the game.&#10;&#10;    Note : In case of using for eduacional game, an experienced adult or parent is required to teach and guide.&#10;&#10;&#10;BACKGROUND :&#10;I graduated in Ph.D. of Arts and Culture Research from the Faculty of Fine Arts of Srinakarinwirot University in Bangkok, Thailand. My research of Green Culture for Ethics Through Documentary Films, found out the issues of many problems and wide ranging effects, including the realisation that the relationship between natures and ethics are complementary in both the individual and public contexts. The complimentary nature of living in accordance with an ecological system leads to a balance between the physical and subjective, the concrete and the abstract, human behaviour and the mind which can be seen as the foundation of ethics for peaceful and sustainable mutual living.&#10;&#10;A Game Story :&#10;After humanity has destroyed nature and the environment in many areas, some of the areas have  been restored and rejuvenated. Nevertheless, many people turn to violence to hurt and destroy each other for fame and wealth, focusing on dominating the land which causes many problems and adverse living conditions.  People have lost trust for each other : no faithfulness exists. They have lived in unsafe place and lead insecure lives. At the same time that pollution has dominated and deterioration also spreads widely into several areas.  In one remote district, a city that was once full of happiness, many things have began to change. However, the last thing that still keeps faith and hope and that will not be destroyed so easily, the GOODNESS OF PEOPLE&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;All players help most members in their community to stay away from evil power before most terrible things appear. They try to cultivate goodness and ethics in the land of loss before the darkness comes.  At the end of game, all players consider successful future and present outcomes together.&#10;&#10;GENRE&#10;Fantasy game, &#10;Solo Game,&#10;Co-operative game, &#10;Strategic game, &#10;and Educational game&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;1. 16 Miniatures / 16 Character Markers&#10;2. 3 Draw Bags&#10;3. 12 Intelligence Dice&#10;4. 12 Conscience Dice&#10;5. 6 Open-Mind Dice&#10;6. 8 Sincerity Dice&#10;7. 12 Tolerance/Endurance Dice&#10;8. 12 Evil Dominance Dice&#10;9. 2 Protection Dice&#10;10. 20 Moral Cards (5 Principles)&#10;11. 47 Happening Cards&#10;12. 4 Ending Cards&#10;13. 6 Random Quality Cards&#10;14. 76 Encounter Cards&#10;15. 6 Item Cards&#10;16. 15 Special Person Cards&#10;17. 11 Monster Cards&#10;18. 1 Devil Card&#10;19. 5 Mechanical Move Cards&#10;20. 59 Person Tokens&#10;21. 89 Merit Tokens&#10;22. 224.

There are three variants of War Machines: cannons, rocket batteries, and powerful siege crossbows.&#10;&#10;Not only you will be able to use them in the game, greatly enhancing your defense potential, but also, each player will get a few upgrade cards to choose from, giving further variation and replay possibilities to the War Machines. For example, one player might favor building cannons, but they want them to be as cheap as possible, while another might concentrate on a single but very powerful one.&#10;&#10;Additional Horde types &amp; Siege Engines&#10;Mongols have brought some siege engines with them! Some of the Hordes cards will come with the special engines to try and break your walls. Defend yourself against battering rams, which will break your walls, catapults, which will strike your archers, and Hordes with siege towers, which will change the way you plan your defense. They will try and counteract your towers, employing miners to tear them down.&#10;&#10;New Hordes will add to the replayability while being able to be used in basic games as well.&#10;&#10;New Troops!&#10;Each Clan sends out their elite warriors to join the fray - all of the Clans will have their own unique and extremely powerful Soldier! You can upgrade one of your basic Soldier types into an elite. For example, Snake Clan will be upgrading their Archers into Chu-Ko-Nu Crossbowmen, being able to outshoot any of the opponents quickly. On the other hand, Dragon Clan, as befits their name, will equip some of their Spearmen with fire-lances. You can be sure they won&rsquo;t be cheap, but if you can get them recruited early in the game, you will gain a huge advantage over the Hordes (and your opponents).&#10;&#10;New Generals, Advisor, Artefacts and Tech-Trees!&#10;This expansion brings also new Generals, Advisors and Artifacts to further enhance replayability and allow for bigger customization of your desired tactics.&#10;&#10;Additionally, this expansion will introduce Tech-Trees creating new exciting possibilities of development for each clan. Whit those cards you will be able to adjust your strategy and invest into Towers, War Machines or enhanced Army units!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Using it carries great danger, but usually positive effects will overshadow the negatives.&#10;&#10;If you want to use Iron Dragon you will have to assign Clerk to it. First player will have to spend resources to cast the cannon, but will get to choose on which Wall Section it will be deployed. It is obvious, that Emperor will bestow great Honor on the one, who created such a great weapon. Then, all players can send their Clerk to shoot from the Iron Dragon. When player shoots, they draw 1 card from mini-deck, showing what effect the shot had. Effects vary from blowing huge hole in the Horde card, through just scaring them off for a turn, to cannon exploding and destroying current level of the wall.&#10;&#10;If you do not like the random effect you can play that you can choose the effect - even exploding it sometimes, so other player cannot use it or you can build it (and earn Honor for doing so) yourself.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Then each player chooses an action card and reveals them simultaneously. Actions are taken from the lowest number up; you can prep food in the kitchen, move food from the kitchen to the burners, or serve cooked food to customers. Each action succeeds only if there's space for the food. You get one point for each action you complete, plus bonus points if you fill up a customer's order. This repeats until all the customers are gone.&#10;&#10;There's one big wrinkle in the dough though - each round customers get more impatient, and if they get fed up and leave the player currently in first loses points. This means that if you're behind it's in your best interest to antagonize the leader by filling the kitchen with food nobody ordered, serving customers who just arrived first, or other kinds of bad service. But since you might be the leader next turn you'll have to strike a balance.&#10;&#10;What will you cook up in Konamon!?&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Alas, this is Streetball, not basketball. On the street, style is just as important as scoring, if not more. You can actually win without getting a Basket in, simply by achieving 42 Style points first - after which you would have won the heart of the audience which then proceeds to jeer your opponents off the court and you win in style.&#10;&#10;Players will take turns taking on the Offensive and Defensive roles. The Offense player plays one card at a time, getting closer to the net with each successful play. The Defense player decides if he wishes to play a Defense card to steal the ball, and if so, which one from his hand. Even if Defense fails to snatch the ball, there is accumulating defensive pressure building up each time as the Offense player goes deeper into the arc until eventually the Offense gets overwhelmed by Defence. This is where the Offense can decide to pass the ball, which resets all cumulative defensive pressure back to zero. Then again, passing should not be something you do often since it gives the Defensive player Style points for pressuring you into passing!&#10;&#10;When you get close enough, you play a Shoot card and hope your opponent does not block it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
