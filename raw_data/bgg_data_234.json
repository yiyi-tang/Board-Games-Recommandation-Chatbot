The game is a typical family game in which everyone participates with equal enthusiasm. Two persons play at a time. Also, you can play alone, trying to solve the code with as few moves as possible.&#10;&#10;Underneath the gameboard at the top you will find four sheets of different colours. These sheets are called code boards. The game is supplied with the green side A at the top. Place the pegs corresponding to this patten. Before playing you must turn the green board so that the reverse side B faces up. A pattern now appears with the colours arranged in vertical rows. Try - with the fewest possible moves - to place the pegs so that they coincide with this pattern.&#10;&#10;Unrelated to Othello.&#10;&#10;",

A simple and compact game for adults and kids alike!&#10;&#10;Each round first player picks a card from the market. This is the card he probably wants to get, and this is the card the players will start bidding for. After the card has been chosen, the players start bidding on it or they can pass and not take part in the auction. To place a bet a player puts a special token on a card he refuses, which means, that during the game he can never get this card. The one, whose bid is the highest, gets the card and leaves his refusal tokens on the cards he has refused during the round. All the other players take their tokens back. Then the game proceeds till the deck of cards and the market are empty. In the end of the game players score victory points for different sets (by colour or by value) on their hands.&#10;&#10;",

Little Red tucked the basket under her arm and walked toward the door'.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget your knife,&rdquo; Red&rsquo;s mother reminded her.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;I KNOW mom,&rdquo; Little Red sighed and retrieved the knife from the table. &ldquo;Duh!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Little Dead Riding Hood is a racing game. Each player assumes the role of one of the Riding Hood sisters trying desperately to get supplies to their beloved grandmother. Simple really, except for those pesky zombie wolves.&#10;&#10;",

If a faction has acquired sufficient power, represented by the number of its feudal holdings, it can &lsquo;do homage&rsquo; to the relevant sovereign and call on either the royal army of France or of Catalonia to intervene. In fact to achieve victory it must achieve this eminence as well as capture an enemy capital.&#10;&#10;In a four-player game it is possible, suitable candidates being available, for a faction to ally with another by marriage and aim for a joint victory, unless Death do them part, albeit with more onerous conditions. The rules are modified slightly for two- and three-player games.&#10;&#10;Caveat: This is a French-language production and there is some text on the event cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The six-man international crew has just dimmed the lights, bid each other a multi-lingual good night, and settled back to dream of gravity on board the International Space Station when the unthinkable happens.  Siren blare, airlocks slam shut, emergency lights flash and it quickly dawns on the crew (not an IQ under 120 among'em) that something has gone horribly wrong.  They quickly realize that the whole station is losing oxygen and that it isn't going to be long before they're all so much unrecoverable salvage.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The space station is a disaster.  Equipment is strewn about after years of neglect.  Nobody knows what to do.  But then it dawns on them (sharp lads they are) - there is only one escape pod and six of them.  It doesn't take an astrophysicist with a PhD from M.I.T. to figure out that only two of them are going home, and the rest are going to end up Sucking Vacuum.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sucking Vacuum is an easy to learn, fast action strategy game for 3 to 6 players.  Players assume the role of the doomed astronauts searching for equipment and struggling to escape the doomed space station.  They must make their way through a randomly assembled map of the International Space Station while fighting off attacks of other players who are trying to escape themselves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sucking Vacuum 2nd Edition (titled Ultimate Sucking Vacuum) is an updated version of the Origins Award-nominated game.  Now in full color with a sturdy box, the game features new artwork on the 18 map tiles and 73 die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to the original, but the rules have been re-written and revised in a number of areas.  Additionally, the game now includes Tournament Rules and the Alien Incursion variant.&#10;&#10;",

So they've decided to take matters into their own hands and rob a speeding train full of Brains. They'll bring home the best Brain they can find, and then pass that around instead. Hey, no-one said it was a good plan.&#10;&#10;This is the fourth game in the Friedey's series, and the first Cheapass board game to come in a sturdy cardboard box. The &quot;board&quot; is composed of eight double-sided Train Cars, and the Train grows and shrinks throughout the game. New cars appear in the front as players move forward, and old cars fall off the back, well, sort of randomly. To win the game, you need to find the Brain with the highest IQ before the Train comes to a stop, and defend it from all the other Zombies who'd rather beat you up than find a better Brain on their own. A splendid and imaginative adventure for 3-7 players, illustrated as always by lovable Zombie artist Brian Snoddy.&#10;&#10;",

The actual gameplay is similar to Risk, with players taking it in turns to produce units, move them and then perform combat by rolling dice. The twist, and the major way in which it differs from Risk, is in the different unit types.&#10;Land, Sea and Air forces may all be built, with differing movement and combat abilities. For example, air units move further and determine  first firer in combat, but cost more to build.&#10;In short, I would describe this game as &quot;Risk with attitude&quot;, and is definitely preferable to normal risk. It is less luck-based, due to special dice used for combat.&#10;&#10;",

Since you can insert square pictures in four directions, each picture can create four butterflies depending on how it's orientated.&#10;&#10;Once players see the image of the butterfly created, they now try to find this specific butterfly by turning the tiles face up, one by one, until a player finds the matching butterfly. Since the tiles remain face-up during this time, players have the opportunity to memorize as many cards as possible.&#10;&#10;Once a player succeeds, he collects the matching butterfly card and places it face-up in front of him. All other butterfly cards are turned face down again. The next player now exchanges the picture tile, trying to insert the next one in a direction resulting in a butterfly he is able to locate immediately. This is more difficult than it seems as you have to imagine the butterfly just from the picture before inserting it.&#10;&#10;The player who collects the most butterfly cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "First issued in 1989 for fewer players, the second edition (released in 1996) is for 2-6 players. The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides. Possibly Doris &amp; Frank&#039;s first game and related to their Bunny Zick-Zack.&#10;&#10;3rd Place 1989 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Donky [sic]).&#10;&#10;",

Treat patients by laying treatment tiles with matching malady symbols. Place your doctor marker on that malady to show you helped cure that patient. You place complication cubes on patients who are not visited during your shift (or turn), but if that patient has no spaces left for complication cubes then that means the patient has died on your shift!&#10;&#10;Patients are completely cured when there are no open malady spaces on the patient or any connected treatment tiles.  The player who cured the final malady on the patient during their shift collects their doctor markers and places them in the score pile on their doctor board.

Work hard. Learn to control the elements. Study each recipe and combination, no matter how impossible they may seem. Face your worst fears. And trust fortune as well because it's wise to admit that not everything is in your hands. That's the only true way to become an alchemist.&#10;&#10;In each turn of Los Aprendices, players throw all their dice at the same time to get resources. With these resources, they place their tokens in one or more of the six boards on the table, and on these boards they can get abilities or knowledge (depending on the area the player wants to develop). The game is all about gaining resources, using the abilities to transform them into other resources (or multiply them), and rising in the different boards to gain as much knowledge as possible. When a player has more than 42 victory points, that triggers the last round, then whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Your knowledge and intelligence will be the key to your becoming the next alchemist!&#10;&#10;&#10;Ahora sois aprendices y os queda un largo camino por delante. Un camino de conocimiento que estar&aacute; lleno de trampas, de amenazas que no imagin&aacute;is todav&iacute;a y que os pondr&aacute; a prueba. Esforzaos. Aprended a dominar los elementos.

Confiad, tambi&eacute;n, en la suerte porque es prudente reconocer que no todo est&aacute; en nuestras manos. S&oacute;lo as&iacute; os convertir&eacute;is en alquimistas.&#10;&#10;El primer jugador que llegue o supere los 42 puntos de conocimiento cierra la &uacute;ltima ronda. El que tenga m&aacute;s puntos en la &uacute;ltima ronda gana.&#10;Al principio de cada turno, los jugadores tirar&aacute;n sus dados para obtener recursos seg&uacute;n sus resultados. Con estos recursos se colocar&aacute;n en los tableros que m&aacute;s les interesen. En cada una se obtendr&aacute;n m&aacute;s conocimiento o m&aacute;s habilidades (seg&uacute;n el campo que cada jugador quiera desarrollar).&#10;El mecanismo del juego consiste en obtener recursos, usar las habilidades para transformarlos en nuevos elementos (o bien multiplicarlos) e ir ascendiendo en los distintas tableros para obtener tanto conocimiento como puedan.&#10;&#10;Los Aprendices es un juego en el que tendr&eacute;is que usar vuestros conocimientos e inteligencia para convertiros en alquimistas.&#10;&#10;",

In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Votre capitaine vous a confi&eacute; une mission importante : veiller sur un homme au pouvoir inestimable, mais dont vous ignorez le secret.

    "Description": "A spinoff of the original 1935 Hasbro game, this 2011 Klingon edition (released November 17th) follows the same format.  There is a &quot;Go&quot; square in one corner, and players roll dice to travel around the squares lining the edge of the board in circles trying to acquire properties.&#10;&#10;What seems like the biggest difference between the editions (i.e. the fact that you are trying to take over the galaxy) actually involves no changes from the original edition other than name changes.  &quot;Properties&quot; are &quot;galaxy systems&quot; such as Qo'noS, Romulus or Earth (home base of the enemy Federation), and they are &quot;conquered&quot; instead of &quot;owned&quot;.  The most ultimately valuable &quot;property&quot; (equivalent to Boardwalk in the original game), is now called Kronos, and the equivalent of Park Place is Khitomer.  The equivalents of the valuable green properties in the original are Boreth, Ty&rsquo;Gokor and Krios Prime, and so on. The standard money is replaced by &quot;Klingon Force&quot; scrip. &quot;Houses&quot; are renamed &quot;Outposts&quot; (and redone as small yellow dome-shaped constructs) and &quot;Hotels&quot; are renamed &quot;Capitals&quot; (miniature red versions of the Klingon High Council Building). &quot;Railroads&quot; are &quot;Starships&quot;: the Raptor, the Negh'Var, the Vor'Cha and the K'T'inga; and the &quot;Utilities&quot; are now the Rura Penthe Mines and the Praxis Energy Facility.&#10;&#10;The REAL differences lie in the facts that, for one, &quot;Combat&quot; cards replace &quot;Chance&quot; cards.  Furthermore, the element of &quot;Honor&quot; replaces the &quot;Community Chest&quot;.  The penalty of the &quot;Luxury Tax&quot; is replaced by a penalty of losing a battle against Starfleet.&#10;&#10;Another difference which does not affect gameplay, but which does add a lot to the feel of the game is that the board, cards, and rules are all bi-lingual: written in both Klingon and English.&#10;&#10;In order to attain victory and &quot;preserve the glory of the Klingon Empire&quot;, players must conquer all of the systems in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Two editions were released, a standard &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; and a 1701-unit-released &quot;Limited Edition&quot; that includes a miniature replica of Chancellor Gorkon's bone cane from STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.&#10;&#10;Both versions include as standard equipment: the gameboard, 6 Collectible tokens, 28 Title Deed Cards, 16 COMBAT cards, 16 HONOR cards, 2 Dice, 32 Outposts, 12 Capitals, 1 Pack of Klingon Forces, and Rules.&#10;&#10;Like most of their MONOPOLY releases, this does not include the &quot;Speed Die&quot;, although the rules mention both classic &quot;speed-up game&quot; options.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "War in the Aegean is a simulation of the sea, ground and air battles that raged in the Dodecanese Islands from September to November 1943. With the confusion surrounding the surrender of Italy, seizing those islands struck Churchill as easy pickings, with a vast potential for future Allied operations. A single British brigade, the 234th, began a bold island hopping campaign. In time, the Germans countered and checked the advance, first at the island of Kos, and then later at Leros. The war in the Aegean highlighted a clash of weapons systems, with the Luftwaffe controlling the air while the Royal Navy dominated the seas.&#10;&#10;Each Game Turn represents one week. Each Impulse of a Game Turn can represent a variable amount of time within that week. A hex is approximately six and one half kilometers across. Ground units range in size from companies to regiments. Naval units represent a single vessel, although Torpedo Boats and MFP counters represent 2-3 vessels each. Each air counter represents approximately six aircraft.&#10;&#10;Design - Perry Moore&#10;Development - Paul Rohrbaugh&#10;Graphic Design - Craig Grando&#10;&#10;",

To control the action of your character in the Pit, you create a deck, exactly like you would a CCG, but the cards available for Pit Fighter: Fantasy Arena are not randomized and have no rarity. The starter box comes with 2 sets of Expansion pack #1. You can purchase extra expansion packs, currently 3 of them are available. Each Expansion has pre-set cards, so you know exactly what cards you get when you purchase the Expansion Pack. Each Expansion pack has 21 cards in it, and the cover tells you what cards the pack has.

If you're in a deadlock, the player who's Agent Gibbs, will decide!&#10;&#10;&#10;This game has 6 potential suspects in each case, with a little background. There are 8 things you can investigate each round (the suspects, plus the crime scene, and research in headquarters). There are clues that you don't have the time or resources to hear, so you have to decide where to focus to get the information you need. That doesn't always mean just the person you think is the suspect, sometimes another person gives you a clue about your main suspect.&#10;&#10;If you put an investigator on an area, there is a number to look up and read in the book to tell you what information has been found. After four rounds, you'll make an arrest, and then read the solutions book to find out if you were right.&#10;&#10;All characters are used no matter the play count, so it works the same no matter the number of players.&#10;&#10;",

Play the last piece to win the game.&#10;This game is an updated version of the earlier Pan-Kai by the same author, to which Universe adds the three and four players variants.&#10;&#10;The game box featured publicity stills from the movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;  In the movie, one of astronauts plays Universe with Hal (the computer). This scene was cut and replaced with Dave playing Chess with Hal. The director thought it would be more understandable by the audience.&#10;&#10;The game doesn't mention puzzles, but there are plenty of patterns to try to make with the pentominoes. For example, form a 5x12 rectangle, or a 6x10 rectangle, with one set of pieces.&#10;&#10;The two player form of this game was published in 1961 as Pan-Kai&#10;&#10;",

Once players have gone through the entire deck, the game ends and five points (gems) are handed out: One to the player who collected the diamond; one each to the player who collected the most sapphires, emeralds or rubies; and one to the player who collected the most cards. In the event of ties, no one collects a point. The first player to collect eleven gems wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a simple board game based on JRR Tolkien's epic three-part book: &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.  Players take on the roles of the major characters from the book (Frodo, Gandalf, Sauron, etc.).  The large paper board is a representation of Middle Earth with various paths on it.  Players move along the paths using standard die rolls, conducting combat when opposing pieces cross each other.  Spaces on the board (Bree, Entdowns, etc.) are havens or hazards for different players.  The Fellowship players win if they get the Ring to the Crack of Fire, or destroy the Dark Tower (Sauron's fortress) through combat.  Sauron wins if he brings the ring or Ringbearer to the Dark Tower.  Saruman wins if he brings the Ringbearer to the White Tower.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS is an uncomplicated war game centered on the naval aspects of the series of wars between England and the various European powers between 1756 and 1805 for dominance of the world&rsquo;s oceans.&#10;&#10;The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms.  The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play.  SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS owes its original inspiration to the game concepts of WAR AT SEA published by The Avalon Hill Game Company, a game which covered the war in the Atlantic in World War Two.  SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS borrows a number of these concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, individual leaders, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the sailing warship era situation.&#10;&#10;The object of the game for the English player is to destroy the naval forces of the  European Powers player and prevent them from obtaining control of vital sea areas around the world.  The object of the game for the European Powers player is to escape the forces of the English player and obtain temporary sea control of vital areas to support the continental and colonial objectives of various European nations.  The game uses over 650 counters, a two piece map, and numerous organization cards and play aid sheets.&#10;&#10;Product Information&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10&#10;    Time Scale: Yearly turns&#10;    Map Scale: Area&#10;    Unit Scale: individuals ship&#10;    Players: 2 or solitaire&#10;    Playing Time: 3-4 hours hours&#10;    Designer: Stephen Newberg&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Two 22 X 34 inch maps&#10;    Six Countersheets &ndash; approximately 600 counter&#10;    One Rulebook&#10;    Rules and Scenario book&#10;    Player Aid Cards&#10;    Dice&#10;    One Box and Lid set&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Galapa Go! (aka Kroko Togo), players have come across a newly discovered island teeming with animals both normal and not-so-normal. To be honest, they're mutants - animals with a giraffe body and alligator head. That kind of thing. Hunters are preparing to descend on the island to take home a few trophy animals, so it's up to you to save as many animals as you can. Save more than anyone else, and you win the game.&#10;&#10;The game includes a deck of 30 animal cards &ndash; each showing one or two animals of the normal or mutant variety &ndash; along with 48 criteria cards and 18 special cards. Fifteen animals are laid out face-up on the table, then a player turns over a criteria card that shows animal-claiming restrictions (e.g., you cannot claim an animal card showing any part of a lion) or requirements (e.g. you can claim only those animal cards showing a blue starfish and a giraffe).&#10;&#10;Each player has a color-coded island card, and once the criteria card is revealed, everyone races to slam their island card on an appropriate animal. Once everyone has done so or passed, they claim the card if it meets the criteria or lose a previously-claimed card if it doesn't.&#10;&#10;Once most of the animals have been claimed, the second set of 15 animal cards is added to the table. Once at most one animal card is on the table, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Galapa Go! contains two variants, one in which two criteria cards are revealed each round with animals being claimable only if they match both criteria cards, and a second in which the special criteria cards are shuffled into the deck at the start of play. These cards include conditions like claiming a non-mutant animal or claiming the animal that appears most or least frequently in play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Viewpoint in a non-collectible card game produced by the Australian game design company 93 Made Games.  The game contents consist of a deck of 70 cards, each illustrated in a &lsquo;70s/&lsquo;80s retro art style, and a rule sheet, attractively packaged in a small black cardboard box.  Most of what you need to know is printed on the cards themselves and makes picking up and getting into the game very easy.  The use of icons on the cards, representing different aspects of the game (e.g. the discard pile, the play area and your hand of cards), makes the game even easier to understand.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2 to 6 players of ages 7 and up.  Games can take as little as 5 minutes or as long as 30 minutes to play - depending on the experience of players and the number of players in each game.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to be the first player with 100 points down on the table, which isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds.  Players have cards that can steal cards you have tabled or send them to the discard pile.  So you need to be able to judge the best time to put cards on the table and how to defend your cards once they are down.&#10;&#10;Game-play is highly interactive and the base rules are simple to follow to make it accessible to casual and non-gamers as well as dedicated gamers.  At the start of play, each person is dealt a hand of five cards.  These cards each have values clearly printed on them, ranging from negative amounts to a maximum of 20 points.  They also have actions printed on them, along with a graphic (which features some pun on vision such as &lsquo;wink&rsquo; or &lsquo;blind spot&rsquo;).  The action associated with an individual card is usually executed as you attempt to put the card face up into your play area (known as your Field of View).  There are a few cards (such as Spectacles) that allow you to play the card as a reaction to other players trying to affect your cards.&#10;&#10;While your first few games of Viewpoint might not appear to involve a high degree of skill for winning, you will soon discover that you need to be much more strategic about how and when you play your cards, as well as keeping a careful eye on what people have got down on the table.  Simply placing cards into your Field of View won&rsquo;t win you the game, as other players will start targeting you as you hit a score of around 80+. You need think &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; and bluff your opponents, by sitting on a &lsquo;non-threatening&rsquo; score, while searching for cards that will let you steal cards or take multiple turns, allowing you to suddenly win the game by coming from behind.&#10;&#10;The design of the game system provides an entertaining and interactive experience encouraging replayability.  The games system also provides the opportunity to release future expansion packs of cards to add to the mischief already present in the base deck.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Bid-It! is the bidding game where your hand doesn&rsquo;t really matter, as long as you know how to bid it!&#10;&#10;The object of Bid-It! is to bid how many of a given number appear on the cards held by all players together. For instance, a bid of &ldquo;four 5&rsquo;s&rdquo; means the bidder believes that there are at least four fives being held by all players as a group. The next player must either make a higher bid or challenge the previous bid. Once a bid is challenged, the cards are revealed. If the bid was too high, the bidder loses a card. If not, the challenger loses a card. Players try to figure out each other&rsquo;s hands by their bids, but remember, bluffing is not only legal, it&rsquo;s sometimes quite effective (unless you get challenged!)&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re very sure that your opponent&rsquo;s bid was too high, why not bid &ldquo;double&rdquo; and put the loss of 2 cards on the line? Of course, the bidder may turn the tables on you and &ldquo;redouble&rdquo;. Or if you think that your opponent&rsquo;s bid was exactly right, take a chance and bid &ldquo;Perfecto!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Includes 110 cards and instructions in a colorful metal tin.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Perudo&#10;&#10;",

In Annapurna you co-operate &mdash; or compete &mdash; with your fellow climbers to achieve balance on this treacherous, ever-changing mountain. As you explore your mountainside made of cards you will encounter rockslides, yetis, and danger at every turn!&#10;&#10;You start with a deck of 18 mountain cards, laying out 15 of them face down in a pyramidal mountain and keeping the rest as your backpack. Each card has a yin or yang value of 1-4 on it as well as a special effect. To start the game, each player reveals a card in their bottom row, carries out the effect, then places their meeple on the card.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you explore an adjacent card on a non-lower level by flipping it over, carrying out its effects, and placing your meeple on it; trade a card from your backpack with a card in your mountain, pacing the replaced card in a cache; or hide a card, which is the same as trade, but on another player's mountain. If your face-up mountain cards have a balance of yin and yang, you can remove them from play.&#10;&#10;Once you reach the mountain's peak, you add your cache to your hand, then you can spend your turns doing nothing, dropping cards from your cache face up on the mountain to better balance your yin and yang, and throwing cache cards onto another player's mountain, who then flips up one of your remaining face-down cards.&#10;&#10;In the competitive game, when everyone is at the peak, players score 3, 2, and 1 flags based on who is most balanced, with ties being broken in favor of whoever ascended their mountain first; play multiple rounds until someone collects nine flags and wins. In the co-operative game, you end the game after everyone has scaled their mountain, and you all win only if everyone has an even yin-yang balance.&#10;&#10;There are also rule books for Cooperative, Solo, and Team play.&#10;&#10;",
