    "Description": "Goldr&auml;uber is a fast, exciting, cooperative game with simple rules for 1-4 players, which are also understood by small treasure hunters from 8 years up. Thanks to the solo player variant a lonely brave miner can play Goldr&auml;uber even if there are no other pitmen around.&#10;&#10;Goldr&auml;uber is a cooperative game in which the players try to find the legendary treasure of the mountain as well as a lost miner and bring it back to light. The mountain consists of 24 cards.&#10;&#10;The players decide together from where they want to enter the mine. Alternating is diced and considered whether to turn over a face-down card, to move the pawn to an already-revealed card, or to chop a stone wall that blocks the path.&#10;&#10;As if the way into the mountain was not already arduous enough, the guardian of the treasure can break down a gallery from time to time.&#10;&#10;Only with courage, with the smart planning and the necessary little bit of luck the gold rushers can succeed in returning to daylight with their loot.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Combat Patrol: World War II is a set of rules for WWII miniatures skirmish game involving two or more players. Combat Patrol is an exciting set of rules that allows players to focus on the game instead of the rules.&#10;&#10;Combat Patrol is a unique card-based miniatures game.  The unique Double Random Activation mechanism provides a streamlined method for activating units that provides the friction and drama of card-based systems with none of the drawbacks.&#10;&#10;More importantly, Combat Patrol uses a card-based combat resolution mechanism that is exciting and simple while eliminating unsightly chart cards cluttering your beautiful gaming table.&#10;&#10;In developing Combat Patrol(TM) I developed the G.A.M.E.R.(TM) &ldquo;engine.&rdquo;  Key features of the engine are:&#10;&#10;&bull;The Double Random Activation(TM) mechanism provides the unpredictability and drama of card-based activation without the drawbacks. This activation mechanism was originally developed for Battles by GASLIGHT and was refined during the development of Look, Sarge, No Charts titles.  The mechanism uses cards for activation but ensures that multiple players are acting at the same time.&#10;&bull;No big yellow or pink chart cards cluttering up your beautiful gaming tables.  Each player needs one or two 3&Prime;x5&Prime; cards with the information about his units, including their weapons and equipment.   Other than those, there are no chart cards.  The back of these unit records includes the modifiers for hand-to-hand combat and terrain effects on movement.  After a game or two, players rarely need to refer to these, so two unit records can be taped back to back for even less clutter.&#10;&bull;Combat resolution is resolved by flipping cards.  Players read different sections of the cards in the Action Deck depending on what they are trying to do:  shooting, resolving hits, &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; to penetrate enemy vehicles, hand-to-hand combat, movement, and morale.  In development, I took a series of charts and then broke them apart to fit on an Action Deck of 50 cards.  Flipping a card is essentially the same as rolling a die and looking up the result on a table.  The difference is that you don&rsquo;t have to do all that table look up.  Flip a card and determine whether you got a hit.  If so, flip the next card to see which target figure was hit, how severely, and whether he is protected by cover.&#10;&bull;Cover is represented explicitly.  Instead of cover providing a negative modifier to hit, if you get a hit, when you flip the next card in the Action Deck, you look for cover icons.  If the target figure is in the type of cover indicated on the card, instead of being wounded or incapacitate he ducks back behind cover and is stunned.  While the use of cover as a to-hit modifier and the process in Combat Patrol(TM) can be mathematically equivalent, there is something intuitively appealing to knowing that the window sill deflected that round that would have otherwise hit your figure.  In play tests, this explicit representation of cover has made players make better use of cover while maneuvering their squads.&#10;&bull;Messy &ldquo;opportunity fire&rdquo; rules are replaced by a simple reaction mechanism.&#10;&bull;Somewhat randomized movement speeds based on the Guts level of the unit or its leader.&#10;&bull;The G.A.M.E.R.(TM) engine name is an acronym for the attributes which describe figures in Combat Patrol(TM): Guts (morale), Accuracy (shooting), Melee (hand-to-hand combat), Endurance (how many wounds a figure can take), and Reaction.  The game master can &ldquo;sculpt&rdquo; a unit to fit a historical scenario.&#10;&bull;Playable on multiple levels of resolution.  At the lowest level, all the figures in a unit have the same attributes.  At the highest level, each figure can have different attributes.  The levels of resolution can be mixed so that the Commando unit has more detail than the installation security personnel.  This allows games that have a historical feel as well as those with a more cinematic feel.&#10;&bull;Rules for replacements of personnel and equipment between scenarios enable players to represent mini-campaigns.&#10;&bull;Ground scale is 1 inch = 5 yards.  This is a good compromise ground scale between extreme range being 12 inches and the games resembling Agincourt and ranges that are in scale with the figures where short range covers the entire table.&#10;&bull;The basic rules are just eight pages -- and that includes several pictorial examples of firing and grenade resolution that fill almost a full page themselves!&#10;&#10;Activation:&#10;  Combat Patrol(TM): WWII uses the Double Random(TM) Activation mechanism.  In Combat Patrol(TM), forces are divided into teams, which are typically half a squad.  At the beginning of each turn, players roll a six-sided die for each team.  This is referred to as the unit's command die.  Then cards are drawn from an Activation Deck.  The Activation Deck has cards numbers 1 to 6 in red, 1 to 6 in black, and a reshuffle card.  The cards are drawn from the Activation Deck.  When a card is drawn, all teams whose command die matches the drawn card activate.  In this way, many teams are activating at the same time, speeding up game play.  When all teams have gone, the next card is drawn.  When the reshuffle card is drawn, the turn ends.  The command dice are rerolled, and the Activation Deck is reshuffled.&#10;&#10;Combat Resolution:&#10;  Combat resolution uses decks of cards, called Action Decks.

Coincidently, though, more than one team is trying to pull this off at the same time - and maybe even with the same specialists!&#10;&#10;Yes, the meeples are not trustworthy and might be working for other parties (also know as other players). So, while trying to advance their own plan, players must take the challenge to discover which meeple works for whom, utilizing cunning, deduction and a bit of luck (yes, this is a dice game after all). The idea is to control your team with maximum efficiency, positioning them at the right place at the right time to execute your big plan and get away with as much money as possible from the Casino.&#10;&#10;You will lead a charming but unreliable team of specialists: The Brain, The Face, The Muscle, The Eye, The Feet and The Fingers. In the end will you grab just a few coins or can ou pull off the most ambitious heist of all time?&#10;&#10;In any case, just remember: don't trust the meeples!&#10;&#10;",

Three dice are white, one is blue and one is red. The Blue Die represents your hero; each White Die that rolls below or equal to the Blue Die does one damage to the Enemy. The White Dice that roll above the Blue Die do damage to your hero.&#10;&#10;If the Red Die rolls over the Blue Die then the Enemy you're attacking gets to activate their ability. This can be anything from an energy shield that protects the Enemy to a devastating counterattack or more.&#10;&#10;When you defeat an Enemy the Hero that you used gets to level up and heal, get stronger or gain powerful loot. Each Hero has two abilities that they can use to increase the chances of success. The only thing is that you have to choose which ability you want to activate, and you can only activate it once per game.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to take out all of the Enemies before your opponent takes out all of theirs. You can play solo, too!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to North Afrika November 1941 and Operation Crusader, which was part of the Western Dessert Campaign fought during World War 2. After the Allied defeat in Operation Battleaxe in June, a lull settled in North Africa, and the Axis siege of Tobruk continued. The Allies used this time to build up their strength and the 8th Army was formed. Before dawn on 18 November, the 8th Army was ready to strike and the Allies launched a sweeping offensive into the Axis controlled Cyrenaica (Eastern Libya) in order to relieve the besieged fortress of Tobruk. After a series of swirling battles, the Axis had to withdraw and the siege was lifted.&#10;&#10;In this game, as the Allied player, you control the XXX and XIII corps, Tobruk Garrison and the Strategic Reserve force of the 8th Army. As the Axis player, you control the DAK (Deutsches Afrika Korps), the Italian XXI corps and the Corpo d&rsquo; Armata di Manovra (CAM) of the Panzergruppe Afrika commanded by the famous Erwin Rommel. Units in the game represents regiments/brigades and some battalions, while assets are mostly battalion size and turns are 1-2 days in time.&#10;&#10;In FAB: Crusader you will see features like Motorized Infantry units, higher stacking limits, Tank Refit, Italian Trieste Reserve Division, Ghost Units, Fortified areas, Realistic Armor treatment, Special Reconnaissance Unit Capabilities, movement points to trace Supply and Divisional Integrity rules, a new Combat Matrix and other rules for transferring the system to desert warfare. Assets include Machine Gun Battalions, Allied &quot;I&quot; Tanks, Powerful German 88&rsquo;s (AT) and more. Various events are included such as Air Missions, Allied Rapid Response, The Beta Convoy, British LRDG Commando Raid, Naval Bombardment and German Auftragstaktik, Command Confusion among others. The game also have optional rules to enhance realism such as Allied Armor Doctrine, Probe Attacks, Italian SNAFU Check and German Momentum.&#10;&#10;This battle will provide interesting challenges to both sides: Will the Allies try a risky breakout from Tobruk, and will it be relieved, will Rommel go for a dash to the wire, will Allied replacements outlast Axis fuel and supply, will the Italians crumble or hold? Now, it is up to YOU to find out&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

One of these has an illustration on the front, the other a few sentences written in the first person listing characteristic traits or related facts; both have the name of the species on the back.&#10;&#10;Several ways to use the cards are suggested, such as employing them in group exercises (e.g. sorting cards by categories or shared traits) or for a scoreless solo matching game. When played competitively, the rules suggest dividing an arbitrary number of participants (like a class of pupils) into two teams, potentially with a moderator (like a teacher) to read out clues from the text cards. The teams then try to collect pairs of cards either by identifying the species on a given picture card, gaining an additional point if they don't need any clues to do so, or by selecting the right picture card based on the clues from the corresponding text card.&#10;&#10;In addition to Skogen, the series includes the entries Insj&ouml;n (The Lake), &Auml;ngen (The Meadow), Havet (The Sea), Fj&auml;llet (The Fell), and Staden (The City).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BraveGuard is a rpg-inspired strategy game that captures the spirit of high-adventure in a fantasy world. Players control a Hero with unique abilities as they explore the open-world map, defeating Encounters and gaining Treasure on their quest for victory. A core set of simple rules that make it quick to get started, but multiple Scenarios to choose from allow players to either work together in a cooperative game, or go head-to-head for victory in a competitive game. This variety of scenarios provides the option of either a lighter game or one with more depth.&#10;&#10;Each game starts with the Heroes in central town, from there players choose their own path. The map is divided into several areas with their own types of increasingly difficult Encounters - beginning to the relative ease of the Plains, into the dense Forests further out, then giving way to the dangers of the ancient Ruins. In the furthest reaches, players will find a variety of unique points of interest, like the Great Tree or Eternal Volcano, which will be their goal for many of the unique Quests. There are also the Fallen Palaces, home to the great Fiends - the most challenging Encounter for any Hero.&#10;&#10;The Encounter system is the heart of most turns in every Scenario. After moving, players draw an Encounter card matching the type of space they are in. There are two options for how to approach each Encounter, each corresponding to one of the 4 stats - Combat, Agility, Magic, or Intelligence. Players must use try to determine which stat they think each option is and evaluate their various bonuses to determine which option is best for them. After deciding, you'll flip the card over to see the required stat and target number, then roll the die and add your bonuses. Win and you get a Treasure, lose and you're down a Heart. Lose all your Hearts and you must spend the next turn healing up at the nearest Camp. At any point during your turn you can choose to use one of your Hero's unique powers to help you in a number of ways.&#10;&#10;BraveGuard was developed with the goal of being a game that offers seasoned gamers a quick &amp; compelling adventure, but also offers enough clarity and lighter options to be welcoming to new gamers...young or old! At it's core the game offers choice every turn, character development, and serves as an introduction to the core concepts to help create the next generation of serious gamers!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ticket to Ride Map Collection 6: France &amp; Old West includes a double-sided game board that features France on one side and the western half of the United States on the other.&#10;&#10;In the France half of this expansion, 2-5 players collect train cards and claim routes in order to complete tickets in hand, but most of the tracks on the board aren't colored! Each time that you draw cards, you must take a colored tile that's 2-5 train cars long and place that tile on an empty track bed. Once you've done this, any player can claim that route by discarding the appropriately colored cards from hand, as in any other Ticket to Ride game. (Single-length routes are already colored, and the map contains a number of gray-colored ferry routes.)&#10;&#10;Multiple track beds on the game board overlap, and once a tile has placed on the board, any track beds crossed by this tile are off-limits and nothing can be built on them. At the end of the game, players score their tickets, with bonuses being awarded for longest continuous route and most tickets completed.&#10;&#10;In the Old West half of the expansion, 2-6 players start the game by choosing (in reverse player order) a starting location for one of their three city pieces. The first route that a player claims must have this city as one of the route's two endpoints, and each subsequent route claimed must connect to that player's existing network.&#10;&#10;After claiming a route, a player can place one of their remaining cities on either end of that route by discarding a matching pair of train cards. Only one city marker can be in each city. Whenever a player builds a route that connects to a city owned by another player, the owner of the city claims the points for the route, not the player placing the trains. If both endpoints of the route have cities, then the owner of each city scores these points. Whoever completes the most tickets in this expansion scores 15 bonus points.&#10;&#10;As a variant, you can play Old West with Alvin the Alien. No player can start the game in Roswell, and the first player who builds a route into Roswell scores 10 points, then places the Alvin marker in any city that they control. The next player to connect to this city scores 10 points, then moves Alvin as before. Whoever controls Alvin at the end of the game scores 10 bonus points.&#10;&#10;",

Mounts allow a Hero to saddle up and ride into battle in style. Mounts all have a shove-style ability, being able to clear other characters out of the way. They will also all have a unique ability, giving each Mount something cool they can do. And, like the Pets, they will have specialized gear that they can use to enhance their abilities and increase their survivability on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Along with the mounts, the expansion will also have two brand-new heroes, as well as a brand-new major villain and a brand-new minor villain. The set also comes with a new 6-mission campaign. There are alternate scenarios for use with other Arcadia Quest expansions as well: if you have the Pets expansion, there&rsquo;s an alternate version of one of the scenarios that makes specific use of that material. Same goes for Beyond the Grave. And if you have both, there&rsquo;s yet another alternate scenario you can try out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, seven piles are placed on the surface, each consisting of three neutral stones, and two of each player colors, for a total of seven stones in each pile, with each player maintaining the remaining seven stones in their color in front of them to form their stock.&#10;&#10;Play consists of players taking alternating turns starting with black.  Each move is either the placement of a stone from their stock into a pile on the board, or moving any number of neutral stones and/or stones of their color from one pile to another, in order to create a number piles with 'primacy' in their player color.  There are a few small restrictions on moves that can be used by cunning players to strategically limit their opponent's viable options.  The first player to reach the target number of piles with primacy in their color wins.&#10;&#10;",

If it does the game is over.&#10;&#10;How it works: &#10;The land is a landscape of dark (shadow) and light (no shadow) spaces. &#10;You can move freely as long as you do not use a dark connection (dotted line between spaces in shadow) or enter a dark space. &#10;In the last case you would become scared and have to add a despair cube to your cup of action cubes.&#10;&#10;These cubes are drawn during the game and placed onto an action display. &#10;9 cubes arranged into 3 by 3 grid define what might happen:&#10;Each round you will choose one column or row of cubes in that display.

While one player weaves a tale inspired by the story card, the others will play their Vanfolk, overcoming the challenges presented.

If you like the stories of Narnia and Red Wall, this game is for you.&#10;&#10;The simple core mechanics ensure that Vanagard is playable by a wide range of player, from age 7 to 77. There are 6 talents in the game, and they appear on both Nature cards and Talent cards. These talents are used to overcome the challenges presented in the scene. Runes are drawn to set type and difficulty of the challenge.&#10;&#10;Players may create their Vanfolk characters as they play, ensuring that you can jump right into the action from the moment you open up the box.&#10;&#10;EXTEND the game with new card decks. As the Vanfolk increase their level, add-on decks present a natural evolution to the rules. These add-on decks include magic items (relics), spells, profession cards and other goodies that evolve the Vanfolk as they embark on a series of adventures.&#10;&#10;Add-on decks will also include new tools for the story-teller, in the form of challenge decks, story plots and many more interesting features. All of these are optional add-ons allowing you to tailor the game experience to your personal taste.&#10;&#10;",

Each player places their piece on the matching spot on the woodland board. Spread the time tiles with the written and digital time face up. Put the big analogue clock within reach.&#10;&#10;Play: Each player in turn rolls the die, moving the number of spaces clockwise around the track. If you land on a clock with a question mark, everyone calls out 'What's the time Mr. Wolf?', and you pick up a tile. Read the phrase and digital clock, then move the hands on the big analogue clock to represent what was read on the tile. Turn over the tile to the analogue image, if it matches the big clock, place the tile on one of your player board spaces. If the image and analogue clock does not match, return the tile back to the pile. In both cases it is the next players turn, going clockwise.&#10;&#10;If you land on the wolf picture, 'feed' one of your clock tiles on your player board to Mr. Wolf, if you have one. Again it will be the next players turn.&#10;&#10;Continue until one player has filled in their player board (if you run out of tiles to draw, return the tiles from behind Mr. Wolf).&#10;&#10;Second way to play if experienced is to play with only the player boards showing analogue clock faces. Set up is only making a stack with the tiles, again with the written and digital time face up.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn draws the top tile to see if it will match any of the analogue times showing on their board. Turn over the tile to see if they match, if so place it on the matching image on your board, if not return it with written and digital time face up. In both cases play passes to the left.&#10;&#10;Continue until one player has filled in their board.&#10;&#10;",

Players form two partnerships: the USA and West Germany versus the USSR and East Germany. However, there can be only ONE winner! This fact makes every decision a nail-biter: What is more important right now? Your side's interests or your own?&#10;&#10;The forty new action cards add events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the SALT treaties. The range of strategic choices is significantly wider, making 2+2 a completely different game. As a superpower, you want to gain global dominance, win the space race, and increase your living standards to demonstrate the superiority of your system. Never let the other side get too far ahead in the arms race. Subtly manipulate your partner's choices, but don't hesitate to sabotage their plans outright if necessary. Most importantly, always remember the need for world peace, for otherwise there might be no tomorrow...&#10;&#10;",
