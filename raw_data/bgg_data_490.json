The pack consists of 72 cards - 50 unique station cards which have small photograph of area around station, 16 junction cards i.e. EARL'S COURT, BANK &amp; MONUMENT, HOLBORN [x2], KING'S CROSS, OXFORD CIRCUS, TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD, LEICESTER SQUARE [x2], PICADILLY [x2], BAKER STREET and CHARING CROSS [x4]. and 6 exactly the same Season Tickets [which act as jokers for interchange cards.]&#10;The Object of the game is go LOBO by making up a hand of two or more completed journeys either exposed or unexposed.  A completed journey consists of a junction card together with two station cards.  On the junction card are printed the names of starting or finishing stations made through that particular junction.&#10;Although rules state that game can be played by any number there is a limit to number of players which is constrained by the size of the pack which I suggest is 6 at most.&#10;&#10;",

Your elite force of MechWarriors drives these juggernauts into battle, proudly holding your faction&rsquo;s flag high, intent on expanding the power and glory of your realm. At their beck and call are the support units of armored vehicles, power armored infantry, aerospace fighters and more, wielded by a MechWarrior's skillful command to aid him in ultimate victory. Will they become legends, or forgotten casualties? Only your skill and luck will determine their fate!&#10;&#10;The product of more than twenty years of gaming experience, Total Warfare presents the rules of the Classic BattleTech game system as never before. For the first time, all the rules for various units that have a direct impact on the deadly battlefields of the thirty-first century appear in a unified rules set: from BattleMechs to ProtoMechs, Combat Vehicles to Support Vehicles, infantry to aerospace fighters and DropShips. Interwoven and meticulously updated, Total Warfare provides the most detailed and comprehensive rules set published to date for BattleTech&mdash;the perfect companion for standard tournament play.&#10;&#10;Total Warfare is the single-source rulebook for people who play Classic BattleTech.

The introductory game in the BattleTech line is the Classic BattleTech Introductory Box Set. New players should pick up that product before diving into this one.

If players land on a space which already has property built, rent is to be paid to the house owner.&#10;&#10;The game is similar in some ways to Monopoly, but with more options.

An excellent gift for the 'Chess and Checkers' type&quot;&#10;&#10;Tactics is a landmark game in that it was the first cardboard-counter commercial board wargame that was intended (albeit with limited success) to accurately simulate warfare and command.&#10;&#10;The game was self-published by Maryland National Guard infantryman Charles S. Roberts, who would go on to found of Avalon Hill Games. The original edition of Tactics was published by the Avalon Game company, with a print run of approximately 2000. Roberts sold Tactics by mail order out of a garage in Avalon, Maryland.&#10;&#10;The game portrayed a modern day strategic conflict between the forces of two hypothetical countries. The opposing units included infantry, armor, and airborne forces. The game was played on a mapboard which used a square grid rather than the hex-based style map which would later became preferred in the board wargaming industry. However, many of the conventions and mechanics established in Tactics still live on, in one form or another, in many of the wargames published today.&#10;&#10;Based on his success with Tactics, Roberts decided to expand his operation and in 1958 he formed Avalon Hill Games. The initial line-up of games from Avalon Hill included Tactics II, a revised version of Roberts' original wargame. Avalon Hill would go on to publish a 25th Anniversary edition of Tactics in 1983, which represented a modified version of the original game in that it used a prototype mapboard which had not previously been released.&#10;&#10;Other than a few graphical changes there are some functional changes from the Tactics map to the Tactics II map:&#10;&#10;Going over the 1954 Tactics and 1958 Tactics II boards square by square the only functional changes are:&#10; - The squares around the edge of the map for 1958 now have numbers 1 to 43 from North to South and 1 to 55 West to East.&#10; - Cities for 1958 had unique numbers added. &#10;No numbers are present on the 1954 board in the cities or the grid.&#10; - There is no map compass on the mapboard label like there is in Tactics II&#10; - The mountain pass in the large mountain range on the board label edge is not present on the 1954 map. Also there is only one single clear square, same place as in Tactics II, 7 squares in from the Blue coastal city near the map label in that mountain range. There are none of those longer dead end corridors in the big mountain range like on the Tactics II map.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Tactics II&#10;    Tactics (25th Anniversary Edition) (25th Anniversary Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;On June 12, 1898. Filipino revolutionary forces under Emilio Aguinaldo declared proclaimed independence of the Philippine islands from the colonial rule of Spain. The declaration of independence however was not recognized by the United States of America and Spain since the Spanish government ceded the Philipines to the USA in the aftermath of the 1898 Treaty of Paris which formally ended the Spanish American war (April 25 to August 12, 1898). Tensions already existed between both sides due to conflicting movements of independence and colonization further aggravated by misunderstandings on both sides and feelings of betrayal on the Filipino side. The tensions escalated between the former allies on February 4, 1899 when a Filipino soldier was shot by an American soldier (William W. Grayson) in Manila. Fighting soon erupted in Manila and culminated in an official Filipino declaration of war by the Malolos congress on June 2, 1899. The war would last 3 bloody years and would see a short conventional war followed by a long guerilla war which would be a prelude of things to come in Vietnam 60 years later.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;&quot;Bolos &amp; Krags&quot; is a simulation of the Philippine American War 1899-1902 which saw 4 years of brutal guerilla war resulting in 4,000 American soldiers and a million and a half Filipino dead. The war influenced Mao Tse Tung to refine his people's war guerilla doctrine which would haunt the U.S. in Vietnam and Iraq many decades later.&#10;&#10;Area impulse action movement system.  280 counters, 12 pages of rules, area map covers all of Luzon. units are leaders of regiment sized battlegroups which you equip with companies in a system similiar to Death In the Trenches/CSA. Victory centers on Political will (like Byzantium Reborn/Battle For China). Combat is the NO CRT wescom system from Death in the Trenches/CSA. Has Strategic chits(from Storm Over Taierzhuang) to give both sides a wealth of strategic options. Lots of random events.&#10;&#10;The game shows the political and military dimensions of the war. 16 bimonthly turns. In a historical, easy to play and learn, balanced and interactive format. Playable within one evening. Interesting situation as the U.S. with military supremacy tries to fight a guerilla war with determined but poorly equipped Philippine Republic insurgencts in one of the most roughest terrain in the world.&#10;&#10;This game includes:&#10;Mark Twain, Bandit hunts, guerilla warfare, atrocities, Sun Yat Sen, Boxer Rebellion, Philippine Constabulary, President Mckinley, 1900 U.S. presidential elections, epidemics, Mao Tse Tung (Ok, a cameo in the random events), General Joe Wheeler, typhoon, hearts and minds and more...&#10;&#10;This game is probably the first wargame on the Philippine American war 1899-1902 and this game will shed much needed light on a obscure part of American history.&#10;&#10;",

The first deck contains lighter questions such as, &quot;If our family inherited a million dollars, I would like for us to _______.&quot; Most of the questions in the first deck are about families in general and not about individual members of the family. The second deck is composed of more specific questions, such as describing your feelings about other family members or explaining how you felt when a family-member hurt your feelings. Other cards allow the player to talk about any subject they choose.&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing cards and answering the questions on them in a few sentences. Most of the rules are considered as guidelines, such as the &quot;hint&quot; to keep your answers fairly short, but the Rule of Silence during another player's answer must be observed.&#10;&#10;As with other games in the Ungame series, there is no winner or loser. The object of the game is to spend quality time with your family and learn more about the thought and feelings of those closest to you.&#10;&#10;",

Several times during the period from 1833 to 1876 the Carlists &mdash; followers of Infante Carlos (later Carlos V) and his descendants &mdash; rallied to the cry of &quot;God, Country, and King&quot; and fought for the cause of Spanish tradition (Legitimism and Catholicism) against the liberalism, and later the republicanism, of the Spanish governments of the day.&#10;&#10;Dios Patria Rey uses a beefed up and revised Libertadores system (Soldados y Estrategia n. 10) to simulate eight of the most decisive battles of this war: Arquijas, Luchana, Oriamendi, Barbastro, Maella and the 1st and 2nd battles of Perecamps.&#10;&#10;The game features the several foreign units which fought in Spain in 1833-40 including the British, Portuguese and Belgian legions and the French Foreign Legion. There were also French, Prussian Austrian and Russian Absolutist fighting on the Carlist side. In fact, the Carlist pretendant died in exile in the Austrian Empire. He is buried in a church at Trieste, now in Northern Italy.&#10;&#10;",

Although its elegant image made some fantasy like &quot;game of Heian Era from a millennium ago&quot;, it is only legend. According to evidences of manuscripts, it might be flourished from middle of Edo era (about 1770s).&#10;&#10;Skilled veteran makes victory points constantly. Beginner may hit big score luckily. Because of this easily enjoyability for everyone, it won popularity once among commoners.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Difference of Tosenkyo from Darts&#10;&#10;&#10;As same throwing game, Tosenkyo is frequently compared with Darts. The most significant deference of Tosenkyo from Darts is way of scoring. VP of Darts are gained from stabbed area directly. But in Tosenkyo, after hitting fan dropped the target down from the Base box, VP would be determined between distance and over/under positions of fan and target (and sometimes Base of target). Beginner cannot win almost against veteran in Darts. But in Tosenkyo, scoring system has some happening factors. Some beginner may hit big lucky score and win against constant veteran. This makes the game unexpectedly thrilling and exciting.&#10;&#10;In fact, adequate proportion of luck factor against cool rule is the joyous essence of Tosenkyo.&#10;&#10;Page: http://www.tosenkyo.net/whats-e.htm&#10;&#10;",

The Abbey tiles act as Cloisters but do not have to match adjacent tiles and they complete adjacent features when placed. Mayors can be placed only in cities, with their strength determined by the number of pennants in the city. Barns allow players to score fields during the game rather than just at the end. Wagons are placed on roads, cities, or cloisters, and can move to an adjacent open feature when their current feature is completed.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Carcassonne&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If a numbered card is played then the next player must pay cards in succession equal to the number on the card. If while paying out that player turns over a numbered card then the next player must now pay for that card. If a player pays cards to match the required number without revealing a numbered card themselves the player who player the numbered card collects the entire stack from the centre of the table and adds it to the bottom of their own pile.&#10;&#10;This game has the addition of 2 Peregrine the Penguin cards. When one of these is revealed the first player to shout &quot;Muffin&quot; instantly wins the centre pile.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player has all of the cards.&#10;&#10;",

Demons can use fireplaces to move, cast a curse, use pentagrams and holes to hell.

At least that way they can better afford the occasional bestial attack or an epidemic disease. However, player's can't hold on to their good locations forever because every time they want to evolve to the next level only a small fraction of their population can make the leap while the rest continue to populate the area.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Projex (Projective Hex) is a Hex-like abstract strategy game: two players take turns to occupy hexagonal cells, competing to build a chain of occupied cells across the board.&#10;&#10;For Projex, the hex grid wraps around at the edges to form a projective plane.  Six pentagons (or three squares) must be included among the hexagons for the whole plane to be tiled.&#10;&#10;A winning chain is any loop which encircles the projective plane, in the sense that it is not topologically equivalent to a trivial loop.  As with Hex and Y, the game has the mathematically appealing property that when the board is full, exactly one player will have a winning chain.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;References&#10;     Designer&#039;s post to sci.math describing the game&#10;     Description at gamerz.net&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Lured by the promise of all the treasure one can carry from the Emperor&rsquo;s Vault, heroes thrust themselves into combat with the Emperor&rsquo;s fiercest monsters, the most diabolical of tricks, and the most blood-thirsty competitors.  To those who can survive an hour in the arena, a life of fame and fortune awaits.&#10;&#10;In The Emperor&rsquo;s Arena, you and your opponents take control of rival teams of heroes battling for fame and fortune within the Emperor&rsquo;s Arena.  As time progresses, the Emperor will release increasingly dangerous opponents into the ring, requiring you to decide how much punishment your active hero can take before tagging to the next team member.  Fame is gained from slaying monsters and attacking other players.  The player whose team has gained the most fame by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

From the box; Round up your herd and hit the trail with your Chuckwagon, Cowboys and Longhorns in this exciting new game of the West. Watch out for rustlers, pardner, good luck on your TRAIL DRIVE.&#10;&#10;The game includes 40 new Western Cards and a rule card.  For boys and girls Ages 6 - 12&#10;&#10;Rules: &#10;How to Play Trail Drive&#10;&#10;THE GAME: Try to play as many cards as you can each turn to build a long Trail Drive with a Chuckwagon, Cowboys and Cows, laying your cards in a row on the table in front of you. A Rustler might stop you, but a Sheriff gets you started again.&#10;THE DEAL: If four or more play, deal 4 cards apiece, then play that round, deal 4 more and play again, continuing to deal and play until the deck is used up. If three play, deal 5 cards apiece each round. If two play, deal 6.&#10;THE PLAY: After each round is dealt, beginning at left of the dealer you each play what you can from your hand. The first three cards must be 1 Chuckwagon and 2 Cowboys in any order; then you add cows, the more the better. Discard the rest of your hand, face down. After each round the discards are added to the bottom of the deck. You may play a Rustler card to stop anyone&rsquo;s Trail Drive when it has cows. Then no more Cows may be added, until a Sheriff is played on the Rustler. You may start a new Trail Drive, when your first Drive is rustled (with 1 Chuckwagon, 2 Cowboys, then Cows, as before), but you may not play on more than one Trail Drive in one turn. Therefore, you may not play a Sheriff card and start a new Drive in the same turn.&#10;When Deck is used up, whether or not it comes out even, the dealer calls, &ldquo;Last Round.&rdquo; On the last round, each player passes to the next player the cards he can&rsquo;t use, instead of discarding.&#10;THE WINNER: When all possible plays have been made, you each take out all the Rustlers, plus two Cows for each Rustler. Count the rest. Whoever has the most wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game board also has several Chase Challenge spaces, which might help lucky players take the lead or avoid a crash.

    "Description": "Subtitled: 5000 years of dice and dicing&#10;This 192-page book covers the entire history of dice in many cultures.  It summarizes the many dice that have been found in sites of antiquity around the world.  The history then moves into various efforts to outlaw or tax gambling with dice.  There's also a chapter on dice cheating and another on modern dice.  The book is peppered with interesting stories and legends that revolve around dice.  If you ever wondered why many bone dice are hollow, it's explained.  If you want to know where the best museum exhibits of dice are, it's also covered.  The origins and evolution of many dice games are covered as well.&#10;&#10;The book is heavily illustrated with drawings and photographs.&#10;&#10;The copy I read was a complimentary copy published under the auspices of Dice &amp; Games Ltd and translated from the original Dutch.&#10;&#10;",

There are also secure places on the board. If you are on a blue field with a drawing of Pluto, you're safe from attacks of other players. Barricades can not be placed on the blue fields. There are even simpler rules (with one pawn) for children between four and six.&#10;&#10;Though it is somewhat confusing, Ravensburger produced a Spongbob version of both Junior Malefiz and Barricade, the latter is a version of Malefiz.  These two different items used the same cover artwork but differed on the board layout, rules, and numbers of figures.&#10;&#10;",

You can try to stack as much items on your balancing sticks as you want whenever it is your turn to race, but you risk slower speed, and if any of the items fall, it is back to the starting point.  But if you succeed in bringing a stack of items from the start to finish, then you can leave the items at the end point and go back to the starting point to pick up some more or pass to the next player in your team.  The team that completes all the items first wins.&#10;&#10;",

From the starting area, paths of circles lead to a picture of each animal. The game is divided in two phases; in phase I, players try to collect the footprints of their chosen animal, being occasionally hindered by Wind or Snow. Phase II starts as soon as one player has collected all 14 footprints of their animal, and in this phase the players use their collected footprints as &quot;stepping stones&quot; to reach the picture of their animal on the board; naturally, in this phase those who managed to collect more prints in phase I have a better chance of success. Winner is the first player to reach their goal.&#10;&#10;This is a reworking of a similarly themed game by Peliko's preceding publisher Paletti, WWF Taktinen Luontopeli, using very similar components and game board.&#10;&#10;5 Finnish marks (about 1.30&euro; in 2020) from the sale of each copy were donated to Lastenklinikoiden Kummit RY, a Finnish charity raising funds in support of five university hospitals providing a clinic for children.&#10;&#10;Published with the new Peliko logo already, while the Finnish mark is still in use; therefore, this is from sometime in the 1990's.&#10;&#10;",
