    "Description": "When people along the coast see the banner of the Kraken, they pray that the Blacktyde Chosen aren&rsquo;t the ones coming ashore. Not your average raider, the Blacktyde Chosen are kitted out in more sturdy armor, large round shields, and armed with master crafted axes. Their extensive training means they can take charge of a situation, no matter what it is.&#10;&#10;The Blacktyde Chosen unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Greyjoy players a robust unit for their armies. The unit&rsquo;s extensive training with their master crafted axes means they can cut apart enemy forces with ease. And their resiliency can see them coming back time and again, even if an opponent once counted them out. Plus, they care nothing for the spoils of war, letting other Greyjoy units collect the loot.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The sigil of House Harlaw is a silver scythe. The House Harlaw Reapers have taken that sigil and turned it into an actual weapon of war. Agricultural scythes make poor combat weapons, but the Reapers have adopted using long-handled axes with equally massive blades. These grisly instruments can mow down men in combat the way a regular scythe can mow down wheat in the field. House Greyjoy is putting them to use, clearing the battlefields of enemies.&#10;&#10;The House Harlaw Reapers unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Greyjoy players a melee-focused unit for their army. The Reapers wade into battle with their scythes, dealing massive amounts of damage as they go. But as they reap, so too do they sew. Sew chaos among the enemy ranks, anyway. Foes do not like standing against these gruesome soldiers. The set also comes with the Warsworn Unit Attachment that will make taking out enemy ranks and units even more rewarding.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

That comes a decade later, after both have built up their forces in anticipation of a naval war in the Caribbean basin. And in 1908, the United States finds a pretext to start an invasion of Spain&rsquo;s Caribbean Empire.&#10;&#10;Caribbean Empires, Part One is an expansion set for Great War at Sea: Remember the Maine. It adds 80 new pieces (60 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 20 standard-sized ones), and uses pieces and the map from Remember the Maine. The Americans have the pre-dreadnought battleships of the Great White Fleet, plus some other designs that were considered but never built. The Spanish have also built a fleet of pre-dreadnoughts, pouring resources into an effort to keep their empire alive and maintain the long-departed illusion of Great Power status.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In October 1740, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI ate a poisonous mushroom and died, leaving no sons. Over the weeks that followed, one European power after another reneged on their promises to support his daughter Maria Theresa&rsquo;s inheritance of the &ldquo;crown lands&rdquo; of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary. In December the newly-crowned King Frederick II invaded Austrian territory without the courtesy of a declaration of war.&#10;&#10;Maria Theresa&rsquo;s ministers counseled compromise. Her husband urged Maria Theresa to placate Frederick with gifts of territory. The 23-year old Archduchess refused. &ldquo;I found myself,&rdquo; she wrote later, &ldquo;without money, without credit, without an army, without experience and knowledge of my own and finally, also without any counsel because each one of them wanted to wait and see how things would develop.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The War of the Austrian Succession would last for eight years and eventually involve almost all of Europe. The resolve of Maria Theresa and the fierce loyalty of her soldiers assured that Austria would not perish.&#10;&#10;Pragmatic Sanction is a complete game for two to eight players, based on the events of the War of the Austrian Succession. Players represent the crowned heads of the great powers of Europe: Austria, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, Britain, France, Spain and the Ottoman Empire. It uses the same game engine as our Soldier Kings game, and is very similar to Soldier Emperor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During and after the Napoleonic period, Ottoman Turkish armies fought the French, Russians, British, Persians, Wahhabis, Greeks, Serbs and Egyptians. The decaying empire retained enormous military strength, and despite repeated defeats both maintained its independence and enacted a series of military, economic and political reforms aimed at restoring the empire&rsquo;s power.&#10;&#10;Sultan and Shah is an expansion book for Soldier Emperor, focused on the Ottoman Empire as well as its satellite Egypt and rival Persia. Just as these so-called gunpowder empires formed a bridge between east and west, so does Sultan and Shah, which connects Soldier Emperor and Indian Empires into one large game stretching from Scotland to Scindia.&#10;&#10;Sultan and Shah includes a full-sized (22x28 inches) map of Persia and Central Asia connecting the two games, plus a dozen new high-quality playing cards, 25 new huge playing pieces representing armies and fleets and 24 simply large ones that serve as leaders and markers. The book includes historical background, game analysis, additional scenarios and variants for Soldier Emperor and Indian Empires, and the rules, cards and pieces needed to link the two games together.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "War ravaged the globe during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Europe saw the French Revolution and then the Napoleonic Wars, while India underwent the struggles of powerful local dynasties against both one another and European invaders.&#10;&#10;In South-East Asia, the kingdoms of Burma, Siam and Viet-Nam fought one another, the British and the Chinese Qing Empire. Meanwhile China&rsquo;s Qinglong Emperor mounted his Ten Great Campaigns to expand Chinese rule to the west, south-west and south against the Dzunghar Empire, Burma, Nepal and Viet-Nam.&#10;&#10;Soldier Emperor: Asian Empires is a complete game in the Soldier Emperor game system, based on these wars for Asia with over a dozen scenarios featuring two to four players (Burma, Siam, Nepal, Viet-Nam, Dzunghar, Qing &ndash; not all of them appear in every scenario). It uses the same rules set as Soldier Emperor and Soldier Emperor: Indian Empires, modified for the new theater. If you know how to play one of those, you already know how to play Asian Empires.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In celebration of the 10th anniversary of Rhino Hero, HABA is proud to introduce Rhino Hero: Missing Match, a fast and furious reverse-matching speed game that&rsquo;s fun for all ages.&#10;&#10;The villain Forest Fox has been wrecking havoc in Rhino City. He's been making one of each of the many pairs of twins disappear. The goal of the game is for the superhero player to find the twin card which has the missing pair. During each round, a player acts as the villain Forest Fox who keeps their chosen missing twin card out of sight while the other players, who act as the superheroes, close their eyes.&#10;&#10;The superheroes then start searching for the twin card with the missing pair after the villain player turns over the sand timer. If a superhero player thinks they've found it, they immediately mark the card with their play figure. If the correct twin card is marked, the round ends and they receive both twin cards. If the incorrect twin card is marked, they may not continue searching anymore and the round continues. If all superhero players marked the wrong twin card or the sand timer runs out, the villain player wins the round and keeps the twin cards they hid.&#10;&#10;The game ends when only 8 twin cards remain in the center at the end of the round. The winner is the player with the most pairs of twins. If there is a tie, the tied players shall share the win.&#10;&#10;",

Each player deck has its own set of numbers.&#10;&#10;A selection of instrument cards are made out to be bid upon, and players choose from their hand a number of cards to bid face-down. When the bids are shown, the highest bid chooses an instrument first, then the next highest bid and so on.&#10;&#10;The players decks have different sets of numbers, and every instrument card in the game is unique.&#10;&#10;There are seven kinds of instruments, appearing in four colours. The more different instruments a player gathers, the more points they score. But after scoring, they must discard the most cards in one colour. So by gathering diverse colours, they can quickly reform their band and score again.&#10;&#10;Scoring occurs at the end of each round (a jam session).&#10;&#10;If a player gets all seven types of instrument into their hand, they instantly win the game. Otherwise the most points wins at the end.&#10;&#10;The way the instruments are selected for bidding also depends on players' hands, so they are not simply appearing randomly.&#10;user

    "Description": "Although the rules do not explicitly reference Battlestar Galactica, this set of 55 custom hexagonal cards bears elements showing that the game was inspired by the seventies TV show, including two cards that display Cylon helmets and an Ovion &quot;Death Card.&quot; In keeping with the theme, there are rules regarding gameplay when the ship you are stationed on is at yellow or red alert status. Cheating is explicitly authorized in the rules, but with penalties for being caught. There are no face cards in the game. The cards of the four suits are ranked in value from 2 to 13 plus a Pyramid card. The three special cards with Cylon or Ovion markings round out the deck.&#10;&#10;Galactic Poker comes with rules for four different games:&#10;&#10;&quot;Pyramid&quot; - the name of a card game the characters played on the seventies TV series, Battlestar Galactica;&#10;&#10;&quot;Red Eye&quot; - perhaps just a generic reference to Cylons, but Red-Eye is also the name of a specific Cylon character featured in a 1978 episode of the TV series;&#10;&#10;&quot;Draw&quot; - in reference to a fast-draw western showdown with blaster pistols; and&#10;&#10;&quot;Galactic Strip&quot; - which is exactly what the name implies - a game where you wager articles of clothing rather than money - and where the Death Card causes you to lose all of your attire, except for your blaster and holster!&#10;&#10;Other Implementations of Pyramid&#10;&#10;This implementation of Pyramid is different from that reflected in the game Triad (the name given to the card game in the newer version of the TV series) and appears to be an independently designed game rather than a variant of Triad. In addition, the cards shown in the BGG entry currently described (without attribution) as the &quot;Official Version&quot; of Pyramid appear to use the same artwork as this set, but that deck has 56 cards, with four Cylons and no Death Card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;There are thousands of forms of Poker through out (sic) the galaxy. They differ only in details &amp; all basically follow the same elementary principles. The following rules are not the only games of Poker that can be played with these cards. They are a galactic deck which can be used for most any card game.&#10;&#10;May the Lords smile upon you with great fortune!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The first to have no more cards in his personal deck win the game.&#10;&#10;All players start with their own same deck of cards. They then draw 3 cards from it which constitutes their starting hand. In turn, each player plays a card from his or her hand by placing it on the mat in the frame corresponding to one of the 5 families of the game (Spades, Clubs, Jokers, Hearts, Diamonds).&#10;&#10;Each card causes an effect when it played. Spades and Clubs allow you to put cards from your deck on top of an opponent&rsquo;s deck. Joker allow you to do special effects. Hearts and Diamonds allow you to draw cards while emptying your deck. As the rounds progress, 5 piles of cards are formed on the mat. The top visible cards of these piles form a combination. As soon as someone notices it, an additional effect is applied.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has no cards left. That player wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

You, the player, will be in command of a two crew midget submarine Type XXVIIB called &ldquo;Seehund&rdquo; (Harbor Seal; plural &ldquo;Seehunde, die&rdquo;) or simply &ldquo;Hund&rdquo; (Hound) by its crews. Equipped with two G7e Torpedoes, the Seehund was designed as a short range commerce raider for deployment in the North Sea.&#10;&#10;The game play is divided into two games, which are connected to each other. You will start with the Strategic Game, which is played on a geographic map of the British Channel and it surrounding coasts. Here you will be at risk of encountering different events and challenges while searching for&#10;convoys to attack. Once you find a convoy, the Strategic Game pauses, and you switch to the Tactical Game, which is played on a large map, which is centered around the encountered convoy. You will try to maneuver as close a possible to identify the individual vessels&#10;and pick the biggest fish. For torpedo simulation, the game uses a simplified mechanism, which allows you to attack from any angle and any range with minimal restrictions. Once there is no more to achieve against this convoy, you will try to escape the scene by grounding your submarine on the seafloor and hoping for the best.&#10;&#10;After your escape, play will continue with the Strategic Game, where you can now choose to continue your journey, or head back to the home harbor of IJmuiden. Once you reach harbor, the game comes to a happy ending. But don&rsquo;t be fooled, as there is only one happy end, and a dozen ways to die in the cold waters of the North Sea.&#10;&#10;",

If the defender can reach the circle and suppress it, the monster cannot arrive. But if it gets through, the land is damaged.&#10;&#10;However, the game has many more elements beyond this fighting. As players are battling, they also must take a key hidden by a guard, and use it to rescue a servant. This gives clues to decide the mystery of the deadly death that can be used only once during the battle, and summon the phantom beast to aim for the opponent's capture.&#10;&#10;This is handled in the game by various cards, giving 'keys and keyholes', six unique followers, four different tactical types, tactics that make use of the terrain, and 'mysteries and secrets'. The elements of strategy, identity concealment, and luck are combined in a game system that requires you deduce your opponent's hand whilst concealing yours.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;Create magic circles and summon phantoms to conquer your opponent's area! Psychological battles where players read each other and cheat each other as the board changes rapidly!&#10;&#10;Great Summoner&quot; is a two-player board game that features a non-stop psychological battle between players.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of novice summoners in a battle for the fate of their country.&#10;&#10;The player can summon phantoms by creating magic circles in the opponent's territory.&#10;&#10;However, the opponent can move to the square where the magic circle has been created to remove the magic circle and prevent the summoning of the beast.&#10;&#10;It is important to read each other's cards and create magic circles in squares that your opponent cannot reach in order to summon monsters!&#10;&#10;In addition, you can also collect keys hidden by the guards, special skill cards for your followers, and special skill cards to summon powerful monsters.&#10;&#10;The player who can summon the most monsters wins the

    "Description": "With the death of her father, Emperor Charles VI, in October 1740 23-year-old Maria Theresa inherited not an empire or even a country, but a collection of far-flung territories stretching from the Atlantic coast to Italy to Transylvania. The Habsburg inheritance seemed almost intentionally designed to encourage predators, with its richest territories widely separated from the &ldquo;core lands&rdquo; and bordering her hungriest neighbors.&#10;&#10;For the next eight years, almost all of Europe would be engaged in war as Maria Theresa fought to retain her crowns and exert her family&rsquo;s right to rule the Holy Roman Empire. France, Spain, Prussia and Sweden all lined up against her, while Britain and Russia only provided sporadic help. Despite a tiny army, weak finances and utter lack of competent generals, Maria Theresa somehow kept her empire intact.&#10;&#10;Austrian Succession is an expansion book for Soldier Kings: Pragmatic Sanction, adding even more historical background to this unique conflict plus game variants plus scenarios for two additional wars: the 1733-1735 War of the Polish Succession and the 1735-1739 Austro-Russo-Turkish War. You get 76 new die-cut and silky-smooth playing pieces plus 16 additional tiles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A simple hex and counter, IGO-UGO system introduces players to basic mechanics used in the majority of commercial wargames. Game-play is solo or two-player and does not require an umpire to facilitate.  This makes TTH suitable for self-learning, cooperative play, or a larger seminar wargame. Advanced rules add complexity and additional realism as required by the players. whilst staying true to the base rules.&#10;&#10;In the game, the player represents a platoon with three sections and a Platoon HQ, which must take hold of an enemy position while minimizing the time inerted as well as the loses incurred. In each turn, each unit can move or fire, unless it is spent because of enemy fire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Hollow Trail, you become pilgrims on the long-for-gotten road to salvation. Your goal is to place cards controlled by you (servants)on selected locations and gain points. But the trail vanishes in your steps, so it&acute;s up to you, if you&acute;re willing to sacrifice your servants by placing them on those doomed places.&#10;&#10;There are 4 actions in player&acute;s turn: &#10;&#10;     Send - You&rsquo;ll start every turn with 5 Minions in your hand. When you take a Send action, choose one of them and place it below the leftmost card of the trail. Mark it with a token in your color.&#10;     Travel - With a Travel action, you advance one Minion along the trail to the right. Your Minion can take a number of steps indicated by its speed &#10;     Fight - With a Fight action, you can attempt to slay or turn an opponent&rsquo;s Minion. Choose one of your Minions at that same location. Your Minion is the attacker and your opponent&rsquo;s Minion is the defender. Specify whether you will fight with strength or willpower.&#10;     Conjure - Each location along the Hollow Trail holds magical power that can be unleashed by those who know its secrets. To take a Conjure action, your Minion and its location must have a matching type. This type determines the type of spell you can Conjure.&#10;&#10;&#10;Contests&#10;Hollow trail is a positional game. To score, you need to send your Minions to a particular location. The locations that allow players to compete for points are called Contests. The Contests are not resolved until the scoring phase (every 4 rounds) so it&rsquo;s not enough to gain the dominant position &ndash; you must hold it.&#10;&#10;Scoring phase&#10;After each set of 4 rounds, there is a scoring phase, as indicated by the timing track along the top of the scoreboard. The following things happen in this order:&#10;1. Guardians attack. Resolve Guardians from left to right.&#10;In the example below, the Guardian attacks the location to its left, turning the red Minion into a Lost Minion.&#10;2. Score locations from left to right. &#10;In the example below, the red and blue players are tied at the first location, so each gets 2 points. No one gets points at the second location. The red player could have scored 5 points at the third location, but red&rsquo;s Minion was turned, so no one scores. Both players at the Campsite score 1 point.&#10;3. Old trail vanishes! Remove the first three locations and all Minions there. Cards go to their respective discard piles. Slide all remaining cards left.&#10;4. If any of the remaining locations is still face down, turn it face up. Guardians revealed this way do not attack, but give Guardians and Obstacles their resistance tokens and replacement-option cards, as usual.&#10;5. New trail appears. Shuffle the deck corresponding to the next part of the game and deal out 3 new locations face down.&#10; At the ends of part I and part II, the first three locations in the trail are removed. The Minions at those locations have a chance to glean magical essence for their players, but they don&rsquo;t survive to the next part of the game. In general, it&rsquo;s a good idea to get at least one Minion to the second half of the trail so you aren&rsquo;t starting the next part of the game with nothing.&#10;6. The leftmost card of the trail must not be an Obstacle or a Guardian. If it is, replace it with a random Contest from the same deck.&#10;7. All players may now discard any number of Minions from their hands and draw back to a full hand of 5. In this case, all cards must be drawn randomly from the deck.&#10;8. Advance the round counter and determine a new starting player. The player in the worst position gets to go last. This means the starting player is the player to the left of the one with the fewest points. If players are tied for fewest points, the one with fewer Minions is worse off. If there is still a tie, break it randomly.&#10;&#10;",

There are a variety of cards on the table from which you can score points, and the type and suit of cards you collect in front of you is very important.&#10;&#10;Your goal will be to compose as clever combinations as possible to represent the characters, horses, objects and locations of our story.

Any player who doesn't have a number card to play in a sequence during their turn must lay down their cards for all to see and draw at least one card from the bank. That's when the skullduggery and the scheming begins.&#10;&#10;Any player who plays a rare red number card into a queue earns a blind draw from a treasure trove of wild cards, devil cards and Q-cards which they can use to open new queues. First out wins and cards held by losing players count against them.&#10;&#10;One more thing. In poker a player with a bad hand can fold. In Devil's Choice a player dealt a poor hand is the underdog who can earn double points for winning. With much to gain and little to lose the pesky underdog can take risks and torment fellow players.

To aid the players, the powerful Professor X himself joins the fight, in both Super Hero and Zombie Hero versions. And if that&rsquo;s not enough, the players can even take control of Nana, the reprogrammed Sentinel!&#10;&#10;Sentinels can be added to any scenario to bring an extra challenge to the players. These giant robots, programmed to hunt down and exterminate any mutant lifeforms, do not care about the distinction between living and dead. If it&rsquo;s still moving, it&rsquo;s a threat that must be eliminated.&#10;&#10;This expansion will contain a few Sentinel-centered scenarios for both Zombie Mode (using the New York tiles from the Marvel Zombies core box) and Hero Mode (using the X-Mansion tiles from the X-Men Resistance core box). Each of the Sentinels has a unique, highly detailed game piece, measuring a whopping 12cm if standing straight.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You win by gaining the most Renown (Victory Points) over the course of 7 rounds. Gain Renown by expanding and upgrading your clan buildings, raiding and weakening your opponents, and completing unique quests.&#10;&#10;Throughout the course of the game, you will encounter remnants of the Tuatha De Dannan's power. Arcana cards can instantly change the flow of battle and their powerful Artifacts give you a permanent upgrade based on ancient Irish gods, such as Lugh, the Dagda, and more.&#10;&#10;Each round has up to three Seasons. During the Building Season, you can place and upgrade the buildings on your clan board. The Harvest Season lets you gather much-needed resources based on which buildings you have. Finally, the Raiding Season allows you to attack your opponent's clan, or attempt a quest through simultaneous action selection.&#10;&#10;The key to victory is to outthink your opponents and send your Warriors where they can earn the most Renown, but be careful not to leave your precious buildings unprotected.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players build a tableau of three cards in three columns (similar to games like Battle Line). Likewise, players are building scoring combos to claim the different keys as prizes.&#10;&#10;The deck has 35 cards, from 1 to 7 in five colours.&#10;&#10;Each round, 3 fresh keys are drawn from a bag and placed as a line between the players. The deck is shuffled, and five cards are dealt face-up alongside the keys. Each player is dealt three hand cards, and gets a player aid showing the possible combos.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws a card and then plays a card to the tableau, or discards and pulls a face-up card to the tableau instead. Whenever a player completes a column on three cards, they draw one more card and discard from their hand.&#10;&#10;Cards can be played face-down to a column. A player can discard two cards, and use a discard from the other players side instead.&#10;&#10;When the three keys have three cards set on both sides, any face-down cards are turned up. Equal combos do not get a key, otherwise the winning combo claims a key.&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled over for the next round and fresh keys are pulled from the bag to make up the line.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player wins enough keys.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Evil:101 is a card game for 2-6 people between the ages 13-Infinity. It is a fast-paced warm up game for those game nights when one or two players are running a bit late.&#10;&#10;The theme is a parody of the old spy thriller genre.&#10;&#10;The majority of the players act as villains attempting to set their various plots into action, while one player acts as the Agent, trying to trip up the rest. After each round the role of the Agent goes to a new player.&#10;&#10;Victory depends on how much Evil you can spread throughout the world, with points being given based on how well the plan fit with the target of your evil deeds.&#10;&#10;Every round, the Evil players lay down one of their Plot cards, face down on one Target card, matching all the Plots symbols with the symbols on the Target card. No two players can place their Plot on the same Target. The player acting as the Agent then tries to guess which symbols each Evil player has used on each Target, and place their D.I.C. Agent card with the symbol of their choice on each Plot. If the Agent guess right, no points are given to the Evil player. If the Agent guess wrong, the Evil player gets points according to the Plot and the corresponding symbols on the Target. The Agent does not get any victory points even if they foil a Plot. Chase cards may be used by the Evil player to escape with their points if the Agent guessed right, and the Agent may respond in kind. The players then replenish their hand and may buy new Chase cards for a victory point cost.&#10;First player to 20 points wins and ends the game.&#10;&#10;",

These cards grant powerful benefits to you and your team, as long as they are strategically used! Opponents also won&rsquo;t know exactly what plan you have until you&rsquo;ve revealed it, so secret strategies and tactics can be employed as needed!&#10;&#10;This expansion features two new locations: The New York Subway System as well as Central Park, bringing new Missions (for both Team vs Team and normal play) and customizable map options. These can be easily combined with the Marvel Zombies core box tiles to create sprawling arenas for epic battles to take place.&#10;&#10;Note: Since Team vs Team mode has players controlling both Zombie Heroes and Super Heroes, to properly use this mode both the Marvel Zombies and the X-Men Resistance core boxes are needed.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nambarz is a game of mental arithmetic and strategy for adults and children, age 7 and up. Played by anywhere from 2 to 12 players at once, either as individuals or in teams, it is an educational game which promotes the practice of mental arithmetic, as well as strategic thinking, while having fun.&#10;&#10;It does not require complex math exercises. The idea is to perform combinations of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) using numbers from 1 to 10. The goal of the game is that a player be the first to discard all of his or her cards. The sooner a player finishes, the better his or her ranking and the more points received.&#10;&#10;There are two possible means of getting rid of cards : either by finding a card that matches the card which is face up in the card pile (that is, sharing the same face number or picture), or by doing mental math (which is not limited to a certain number of cards or number of mathematical operations). The latter allows a player to eliminate several cards at once.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s challenge is to find mathematical combinations that allow the elimination of a maximum number of cards at one time. It must be kept in mind that strategy is required, both in the choice of cards and in the order of the mathematical operations performed, in order to create an advantage in the next round or for a teammate&rsquo;s next play.&#10;&#10;Four types of wildcards are included to make game strategy even more challenging and exciting. The variations that are built into the game allow players to advance gradually from beginners to seasoned players, depending on the number of wildcards that are used.&#10;&#10;",

There is no Queen&#10;2. There are only 1 of each of these pieces: Rook, Knight, and Bishop&#10;3. There are 4 pawns instead of 8&#10;4. Adds a piece called a Diplomat which instead of capturing can suborn enemy pieces, making them changes sides rather than capturing.&#10;5. Pawns become more powerful because instead of changing direction to capture in 2 directions (diagonal right or left). They can capture in 3 directions (diagonal left/right or diagonal down). Pawns still need to move forward, but &quot;forward movement&quot; is defined as movement that moves the Pawn closer to the opposite side. So for that reason, the Pawns movement expands and it becomes a more powerful piece.&#10;&#10;Diplomat Chess is different from Circular Chess because the board has a complete circle with 43 spaces, adds the Diplomat Piece, removes the Queen, and expands the movements of many pieces in the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is 1793, and France is in the throes of bloody revolution. Every day the Committee of Public Safety carts dozens of aristocrats and royalists to the hungry guillotines. But a mysterious hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, has been rescuing dozens of condemned Frenchmen and their families, whisking them away to the safety of England. Nobody seems to know who he is, for he and his League of supporters are masters of cunning and disguise. But can they continue to outwit agent Chauvelin and his guards who are determined to stop them?&#10;&#10;Based on the novels of Baroness Orczy, this card game sets each player a secret identity and a different win condition. The Scarlet Pimpernel and his League try to rescue as many prisoners as possible, against Chauvelin and his agents for the Committee for Public Safety who try to execute the condemned. Depending on the player count, there may also be a corrupt guard, out to make as much bribe money as possible, or a tricoteuse (knitting woman) who simply aims to be near the heart of the violence.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a maximum of seven rounds, corresponding to seven prisoners to be rescued, each with unique rule variations so that no two rounds are the same. Within each round, players must simultaneously place face-down cards containing coins, pimpernel flowers or swords at one of two potential rescue locations. Once all cards have been played, the location with the most bribe money (coins) is where the rescue attempt takes place, and at that site the fate of the prisoner depends on whether there are more swords (executed) or flowers (rescued). Players must use bluff and cunning to deduce the identities of the other players, then work with their allies to swing the outcomes to their favour.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A version of three-dimensional chess with 4-half boards stacked on top of one another.  A 4x8x4 playing field.  Requires two sets of chess pieces, that even means two kings and two queens.  Each 3D row has alternating colors.  It is ideal to play facing each other along the long span of the board.  The game is intended to naturally extend the 2D-Chess game into 3D.&#10;&#10;The game was inspired by the 3D chess and checker boards depicted on Star Trek.  A 18-page booklet was published in 1970 entitled &quot;The Complete Rules of Three Dimensional Chess&quot;.&#10;&#10;All aspects of 2D-Chess are retained and extended into 3D, even some things you would not expect like &quot;Castling&quot; and &quot;En Passant&quot;.  However, there is one rule that remains ever unpopular and may seem counterintuitive.  'The Change in Distance Rule' (CID) It states that all diagonal or L-Shaped moves must advance or retreat to or from the opponent.  Yes, players do find it naturally intuitive to move on side-diagonals. But with the rule in place: The Rook nearly stays above the Knight in Piece-Power. Bishops &amp; Knights cannot just move around on their Back-Rank. This eliminates Extra Diagonal 3D King running room and expect a similar game length to regular chess.&#10;&#10;Two-Kings?: The rules were simplified by Robert Jr.  It was very unpopular to have to checkmate both kings.  Therefore, a King-fork, and/or either King being Checkmated wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "With barely a foothold in the snow, your squads of Stabilizers have brought new technology that allows for the continuation of The Artemis Project. The launching of geosynchronous platforms called Chariots, which orbit Europa and influence the development of the colonies below.&#10;&#10;Simultaneously, an elite group of women and men, forged under Europa's harsh conditions, have emerged to assume greater leadership roles. These Commanders have assumed a prestigious rank with great power and authority over the growing colonies.&#10;&#10;With one harsh development cycle under your belt, you look to expand your colony and compete again to establish the most successful outpost on the resource-rich Europa. The Artemis Project continues...&#10;&#10;The Artemis Project: Satellites &amp; Commanders is an expansion that adds two new major opportunities for strategic play to the base game. Satellites are off-board locations which players can access and influence the action on the moon&rsquo;s surface below in subtle yet powerful ways. Commanders are a new category of colonist that can act as any colonist type, lend their power to dice you send to various locations, and assist in end game scoring.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Once known as Qualip, during the first Star League the unfortunate world became a cautionary tale of botched terraforming and human ignorance as entire continents became locked in ecological warfare even before Combine nukes fell in the Succession Wars. When the Clans invaded, ilKhan Ulric Kerensky saw in abandoned Qualip a chance to implement Nicholas Kerensky's vision for the Inner Sphere and the Clans, and the rechristened Kerensky's Vision became that chance. Setting Clan science to restore a paradise world lost to war created a planet unique in the occupation zone. On Kerensky's Vision, Clan and Inner Sphere merchants compete, while others smuggle, spy, and even steal in the packed enclaves of the capital. Here, anything can be bought, for a price.&#10;&#10;Touring the Stars volumes consist of a color cover depicting an orbital view of the subject planet, a short history section, a small number of RPG tracks tailored to the planet, a rules annex detailing optional rules for games and scenarios set on the planet, a color world map and a hexed Battleforce 2 map. Each volume averages between 15 and 19 pages in total.&#10;&#10;",
