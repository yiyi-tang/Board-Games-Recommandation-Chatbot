    "Description": "This 267-page history of the world's games is divided into nine chapters plus appendices. A two-page table near the end summarizes the distribution of games in countries across both history and the globe. Murray categorizes games according to their general goals: &quot;Games of Alinement and Configuration;&quot; &quot;War-Games;&quot; &quot;Hunt-Games;&quot; &quot;Race-Games;&quot; and &quot;Mancala&quot; (four types). Each major category is sub-categorized further. The text richly describes multiple games in each category, offering ample black-and-white illustrations to help the reader visualize lesser-known games.&#10;&#10;Excellent book re-published by Oxbow Books in 2000 (ISBN-10 0-19-827401-7 -- ISBN-13: 978-0198274018), but once again out of print.&#10;&#10;",

Despite intense public speculation, the exclusive 'high-roller' guest list always remains a closely-guarded secret until play is just about to start.&#10;&#10;However, just an hour before this year's game is due to begin, and shortly after Frank's own entrance into the saloon causes no small commotion amongst the eager spectators, four loud shots ring out from Jesse's room on the first floor.&#10;&#10;Amidst the ensuing chaos, the murderer quickly escapes unnoticed from the bedroom window and leaves few clues as to their identity.&#10;&#10;However, once the initial confusion subsides, Frank, soon realizes that his brother's killer must be amongst the other players due to take part in that night's game, as they were the only ones who knew that Jesse was in town at the time of the murder.&#10;&#10;In a desperate attempt to discover the killer's identity before the trail goes cold, Frank quickly devises a high-risk game of 'truth-and-dare', carefully designed to lure the unknown murderer into taking the biggest gamble of their whole life.&#10;&#10;If Frank is right, his 'winner-takes-all' challenge may well just tempt Jesse's killer into staking everything they've got to lose, in a daring attempt to seize all they could wish to win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mersa Matruh&#10;&#10;This is an operational level game, for two players, of the battles that took place in North Africa, near the coastal Egyptian port of Mersa Matruh in late June 1942. After Panzer Army Africa (PAA) had defeated the British 8th Army in the Gazala battles, and had captured Tobruk, the newly-promoted German Field Marshal Rommel was intent on destroying the retreating 8th Army and advancing to Cairo. Initially Lt Gen Ritchie intended to mount a stand at Mersa Matruh but he was relieved by his superior General Auchinleck, the Commander in Chief, Middle East, and 8th Army was ordered to break contact with PAA and retire to the El Alamein defensive position. Can PAA stop the 8th Army from conducting an orderly retreat and destroy sufficient units so it can continue its drive to the Nile, or can 8th Army slip away from their pursuers, with minimal losses, so as to be able to regroup at El Alamein and halt the eastward march of the Axis forces?&#10;&#10;Units are regiments/brigades with some battalions. Map scale is 4.8 Kms/hex and each of the six turns represents about half a day. Mersa Matruh comes with a full colour 11&quot; x 17&quot; map, 198 mounted color counters, rule book, roster sheets and charts in a ziplock bag.&#10;&#10;",

You can pull warriors and weapons from any reality to do battle for you.  Thus you can fight with samurai, vampires, MechaClowns, angels, demons, Nexans, dragons, etc., etc.&#10;&#10;The focus of the game is strategy.  You play with three decks: Barracks, Armory and Spellbook and on each turn you choose which one to draw from.  Combat has three ranges: Long, Medium and Close, moving through the ranges as you fight, with many ways to affect the battle.  Long Range weapons give ground troops the chance to shoot down flyers and some weapons can be thrown at opponents.  When you defeat an enemy, you can loot the weapons they leave behind.&#10;&#10;The resource for creating your warriors, etc., is a product of your Mage's HP, as well as the damage you inflict on your opponent.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game in HABA's mini-spiel key chain series comes with two sheep (one black, one white), four green four-leaf clovers and a die showing a four-leaf clover on three sides and a wolf's head on the other three sides. Like other games in the series, the pieces are wooden and terribly cute, especially the tiny die.&#10;&#10;To start, the two sheep are placed at equal distances from the box they came in. Varying this distance will determine how long the game is. During a player's turn, he can create a path to the box using up to four clover leaves (slight ambiguity in the rules here: initially the rules say 3 then say 4). However, before he can place each leaf, he must roll the die. Rolling a clover leaf means the player can continue to add clover leaves, or the player can stop and move his sheep ahead of the last clover leaf placed (i.e. nearer to the box). If instead a wolf's head is cast, the player's sheep is so frightened that it is unable to move that turn. The player whose sheep reaches the box first is crowned King of the Sheep and wins the heart of the woman shepherd, Edda.&#10;&#10;&lt;!-- Entry audited by (nsolitander) (13-08-2009) --!&gt;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game was first released in Norwegian in 2002, and in a much improved Swedish version in 2004. In the original version, the players try to collect gold coins without waking the sleeping bear; in the later version they gather blueberries instead.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, circular tiles are randomly placed face down on the board. In the original only the central 20 spaces are covered, in the later version all 44 spaces (not counting the four starting spaces). Players roll the die and move their pawns on the board. If they land on a face-down tile, this is revealed and acted on, and then turned face down again. If it depicts 1, 2 or 3 coins/blueberries, the player may take that number of couns/berries from the pool. The remaining symbols differ between the editions:&#10;&#10;Norwegian edition: If a bear tile is revealed, the bear wakes up, and all players currently in the lair lose one coin. If a player lands on one of the bear paw symbols (printed on some of the non-covered spaces, not found on a token), two face-down tiles may be swapped.&#10;&#10;Swedish edition: If it is a bear tile, the player loses one berry. If players stop on a face-up troll tile, the player may pick up the tile and use it to defend against the bear. Face-up bear print tiles may be used to swap two face-down tiles around (so that if players remember where the 3-berry tiles are they can use this to their advantage).&#10;&#10;When all coins/blueberries are taken, the player with the most coins/berries is the winner.&#10;&#10;Contents of the Swedish version:&#10;Gameboard&#10;44 wooden gameboard tiles&#10;10 spare wooden tiles&#10;27 wooden blueberry tiles&#10;4 pawns&#10;1 oversized die, numbered 2-2-3-3-4-4&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Contents of the Norwegian version:&#10;Gameboard&#10;20 cardbord gameboard tiles&#10;20 cardbord gold coins&#10;4 pawns&#10;1 die (not stated if this is numbered 1&ndash;6 or 2&ndash;4)&#10;(Rules are printed on the back of the box)&#10;&#10;4 years and up (Norwegian version is given as 5+, but is actually slightly simpler than the Swedish marked 4+).

    "Description": "From the Publisher's web site:&#10;&#10;This murder mystery game is rated for Teen and Adult audiences. The murder does not take place at the party although there may be further murders that do. The main 12 characters are all couples very much in love. There are no affairs at all in this game. This game was created for church groups, class reunions or those looking for a VERY clean murder mystery game.&#10;&#10;We also have a Mature rated Version. It is still relatively clean, but has more intrigue then the 'clean' version and it does have 1 past affair.&#10;&#10;A Killer Reunion was written to be a little different than the rest of our games. First of all the main suspects are all couples very much in love. Couples will be working together at times to achieve goals. They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor. This murder mystery game is what we would call a 'clean' game. There are no affairs &amp; people are basically good. This game is great for church groups, high school &amp; college reunions or others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests. It can also be used for older teen groups!&#10;&#10;Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.&#10;&#10;This is the same game as our Class of &#039;57, but we removed all reference to year &amp; school so that people could customize it to any year, decade or school. We have areas in the game that can be customized by you to perfectly match your event.&#10;&#10;The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups. (Remember... these are included FREE in the 12 player version, no need to purchase them!)&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/killerreunion.htm&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Durk's Well is a simple asymmetric wargame. One player controls settlers (led by Anders Durk) who have settled in a valley and the miners working nearby. The other player is a nearby wizard who sends a group of Orrks and Spooks to poison the well (on which both settlers and miners depend) and burn down the settlers' houses.&#10;&#10;According to the designer's notes, the settlers and miners are inadvertently damaging the Orrks' and Spooks' environment, so it's not a simple good-vs-evil battle (although the background doesn't affect the gameplay to any great extent).&#10;&#10;Components consist of a 4-part paper map (with hand coloring, it appears), paper counters, and a set of rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Space War is a strategic space conflict game. The 2-4 players each start with a single home planet and must accumulate resources to build ships, capture additional planets (obtaining more resources), and eventually conquer the other players' home planets.&#10;&#10;There are three types of ships that can be built, plus immobile (but transportable) star bases. Somewhat unusually, players must keep track of each ship's fuel and weapons, and have a ship stop off for refueling when its onboard fuel supply gets too low. The deck of cards adds events and such to the long version of the game.&#10;&#10;The components consist of a board, 4 record sheets in plastic folders, crayons for the record sheets, a reference chart, a set of rules, a deck of cards, and 4 sets of pre-cut counters.&#10;&#10;The 1977 edition of Space War was sold in a rectangular box. The game was also published in ziplock format as Space War II. Based on the apparent similarity in the components between the two editions, it is unclear if there were any substantive revisions to the game or if the two editions simply involved a change in packaging.&#10;&#10;",

There is also no prostitute, madam or house of ill repute referenced in this version. They were not needed to bring the game forward 5 years. This is actually a pretty clean game that still manages to be very exciting in spite of it:-) It is filled with twists and turns.&#10;&#10;Murder At The Four Deuces 2 is the sequel to our very popular Murder at the Four Deuces. It takes place 5 years later at a New Years Eve Party and has most of the original characters returning, along with a few new ones. You are not required to have played the original game to play this one, but I highly recommend doing so, as it does add a depth to the game. Guests who have played before will have a greater understanding of the characters, motives and backgrounds. If guests are playing the same character as previously played they will really have a blast with their matured character.&#10;&#10;It's New Years Eve 1924 and Don &amp; MeMe Wannabe are hosting their annual New Years Eve Bash at their speakeasy The Four Deuces and you are invited to attend.

So if you are a real conservative group, there will only be 19 usable characters in this game..&#10;&#10;Political Intrigue among the Vampyr Houses, Mage Guild, Were Clans &amp; the Fae Court.

The Royal Courts of the Mage, Were, Vampyr &amp; Fae will be in attendance. It is whispered that there will also be a special meeting of the Hidden Council to address the recent Watcher murders. Watchers are important to the Immortals and help keep their existence hidden from humanity. The Immortals in turn have sworn to protect the Watchers for their service.&#10;&#10;We think you will be really pleased with the additional activities we have added to this unusual game! It is a little different then our previous games in the following ways: In this game there will be 5 Artifact Weapon Cards. The host will get instructions on where to hide these. Then at a certain time guests will get riddles that will be clues to where the weapons are hidden, then it is a race to see who finds a weapon. The weapons can only be used once &amp; no one can commit murder without a weapon card. These will be very valuable commodities.&#10;&#10;Next we will have 20 Spell Cards. Each guest gets to draw one from a hat. If there are any cards left over after the draw guests will roll dice and the highest rollers get the cards! 10 spell cards are helpful game wise &amp; the other 10 are funny spells that will provide a lot of entertainment.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/immortals.htm&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It was a sad, sad day in Santa City at the North Pole when the body of Jolly JoJo, Chief Elf and toy designer, was discovered by Ebba Sneezer Scrooge, in the main toyshop.  Poor Jolly was found standing on one leg in a bucket of hardened cement.  He had been blindfolded and duct tape had been wrapped around his mouth. And oddly enough, his arms were straight up in the air&hellip;and his hair stood on end!! My goodness, Jolly was quite the sight, he looked like he had quite the fright&hellip;&hellip;and he certainly  must have ticked someone off - big time!!&#10;&#10;Tell us more&hellip;&hellip;&#10;&#10;For decades, Jolly JoJo had been an employee of Claus Enterprises and was in charge of toy design.  He began his fabulous career with the creation of &quot;Mr. Zucchini Head&quot; which proved to be incredibly popular with children all over the world. Jolly then went on to invent &quot;Darbie&quot;, the first doll ever designed with an hour-glass figure and an &quot;out of this world&quot; wardrobe.  After &quot;Darbie&quot; came &quot;G.I. Jose&quot; and an array of other action figures quickly followed.  He was there at the infancy of computerized video games and the rest is history. His genius and adaptability to the new venue of entertainment was astonishing&hellip;.and his most amazing success, the creation of the action packed hand-held computer game series featuring &quot;Volcano Vinnie&quot;, won him universal fame&hellip;..so, it's  no wonder, Santa adored him.&#10;&#10;So what Happened?&#10;&#10;It was Christmas Eve and Santa had just left for his annual, around-the-world toy distribution trip.  As a long time North Pole tradition, all residents of Santa City gathered in the Town Square, waved goodbye to Santa and then headed off to the Candy Cane Cabaret to celebrate another successful season. Everyone was having a grand old time&hellip;..when Ebba Sneezer Scrooge, toyshop foreman, noticed that Jolly JoJo was nowhere to be seen.  Scrooge decided to hightail it over to the toyshop and lo and behold, there he found Jolly&hellip;..who wasn't looking very jolly at all, in fact he was quite dead.&#10;&#10;Some guests include Frostbite and Snowflake Snowmanelli (toy inventors), Holly Berry (greenhouse supervisor), Ebba Sneezer Scrooge (toyshop foreman), Don Blitzen (stable keeper), Noel Angelino (JoJo's guardian angel), Bob Humbug (Santa's navigational coordinator), Sweet Wings (sugar plum fairy), Kirby Marlow (Ghost of Christmas Past), Ginger Snap (cookie baker), Capt. Pistachio (nutcracker) and of course, the Clauses.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Xenon Empire's Star Wars was one of the titles in Galaxy-Foundation Games' strategic Battle for Andromeda: Conflict for a Trillion Suns! series. The games in this series used a series rulebook which contained the production rules, ship information, movement and combat rules, etc., and a game-specific rulebook describing the scenario, units, and special rules.&#10;&#10;This particular game covers a war between the Xenon Empire and the Federation of the Monad. From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim, but with some sections removed):&#10;&#10;&#10;        STAR WARS OF THE XENON EMPIRE: Crusade against the Warlords. Connected to the Deliverance Game, this is also a game in itself. IT has the most unique feature, as every BFA game has a new feature incorporating a special principles from others. THIS IS THE ONLY GAME THAT CAN BE PLAYED SOLITAIRE in its fullest sense. Yet, it is designed for &quot;LIVE&quot; play with one or two additional players. Many Gamers not having partners often play by themselves, but  the Paper-Computer set-up to function alone or with two players allows unique and individual actions!&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;        Xenon has a vital Colony off the board (on another map in another Game). This Colony may be struck by the Kons Dirak Ahm, the oppressive Empire of such huge size and tyrannical rule that all independent Cultures fear it. Only the numerous revolts needing reprisals and other Cultures being overrun have prevented the Xenon Cluster-Colonies from being brought to heel. Xenon needs to consolidate its own systems before attempting to aid their Colonies, yet their Vast Cluster System is surrounded by the War-Lords - small petty Groups that of themselves have little power, but nibble away at Xenon Zones. To wipe them  out is easy, but time-consuming.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;        [deleted for space]&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;        The Monads, using the deadly Monadian &quot;web&quot;, a Plasma Body of sheer energy that drains and implodes ships and holds fleets in submission. The Xenon Vulcan Cannon and their &quot;Harpoon&quot; Missile Conglomerates (each one as big as Cuba or Florida!), and a variety of other weapons such as Diffusion Mines, Sabre Beams, Phasers, Photon Torpedoes, and even the Death Ray of Doom!&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;        The entire Xenon Fleet is enclosed, as well as the Monads' strange ships and the Warlord forces, but over 30 Tactical-Variant Cards, play aids, and Scenario Manual. No two games or Strategies can ever be alike! The 22x28-inch rigid Map-Board predominates in Brilliant Reds and &quot;hot&quot; pinks - a startling appearance once observed by new players.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this game, the murder of Lord Sagen Ray takes place at the start of the party....but that doesn't mean he stays dead and buried.&#10;&#10;Once again, the infamous celebrities of the &quot;dark side&quot; have gathered together for their annual secret gala and this time it is a &quot;fete champetre&quot; (outdoor feast)!  Each year they assemble on All Hallow's Eve for a chilling celebration of sinfulness, an evening of evilness and a night chock-full of nightmares&hellip;.to say the least.  This year's blast will be NO exception as there is sure to be some major blood-curdling and hell-raising going on!  And so on this evil evening,  black silhouettes of broomstick riders can clearly be seen across the bright full moon as they head for the annual bash. The setting is perfect - a long forgotten cemetery where vampires and zombies, ghosts and ghouls, and mummies and monsters from all over the globe will party hardy ... until the sun begins to rise.&#10;&#10;&quot;So what happened?&quot; Last seen, everyone was having a delightfully devilish time.  The guests were feasting on a barbeque of Malaysian monkey brain medley, river rat ragout, along with bubbling cauldrons overflowing with the potent plasma of Peruvian llamas. Bone chilling music, provided by Haggy May Maudlin and the &quot;Undertakers&quot;, echoed through the graveyard. A s&eacute;ance was in session and interestingly enough, the spirit of Sir Matthew Tudworthy had been conjured (executed for wizardry on October 31, 1694, Grave Harbor's only recorded execution). All in all, the boneyard bash was quite the smash! &hellip;that is until Lord Sagen Ray arrived.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell us more.&quot; Suddenly the evil gaiety stilled in silence as Lord Ray and Nadia Tarot (local gypsy extraordinaire) became involved in a rather &quot;heated&quot; conversation.  Nadia was heard to lash out, &quot;Liar! Liar!! Lord Sagen Ray&hellip;..you are nothing but a miserable master of falsehoods, an overlord of deception and, worst yet&hellip;&hellip;..a loathsome heart breaker!!!!&#10;&#10;Nadia burst into tears and dashed toward a grove of pine.  The music began once again but the party was disrupted, for the second time, when an arrow flying through the air with the force of the devil speared and lodged into Lord Sagen Ray's head. Sagen's blood covered body then fell upon the grave of Sir Matthew Tudworthy.&#10;&#10;Now it is time to join the Bogey Mann; Count and Countess Cadaver; the Grave Harbor Butcher; the Cemetery Skreecher; Boney Baloney; Black Beauty (the Headless Horsewoman); the ghosts of Sir Matthew Tudworthy and Lord Sagen Ray and many, many other creatures of the night. So get ready for a ghoulish, ghastly evening of masquerade, mystery and, of course, MURDER!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players each start with one circular jig-saw piece that says Toys, Cloths, Flowers, Fruits, Animals or Shapes. This decides what kind of pieces each player is trying to collect. To each circular piece belongs six segment pieces, each with a picture, e.g. a pig or a horse (Animals), or a doll or a ball (Toys). These 36 segment pieces are laid out face-down.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds much like a common Memory game, except that players are not collecting pairs but pieces that belong to their category. Players take turns picking up a face-down piece. If the piece belongs to that player&acute;s circular piece, he/she puts it there. The segment pieces fit the circular pieces like a jig-saw puzzle, and when all six pieces have been added the player has a full circle of Toys or Animals etc. Hence the name of the game, The Cake Game, because the pieces fit like pieces of cake.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect all six pieces is, of course, the winner.&#10;&#10;Each category has its own background color, so players don&acute;t have to be able to read the name of the category on the circular piece. With two players, you can play with two or three categories each.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;6 wooden circular pieces&#10;36 wooden segment pieces with color drawings&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;3 years and up, language independent&#10;&#10;",

As the plot unfolds, they gradually find out&hellip;&#10;&#10;The murder mystery is usually run over a meal, but if you are feeling particularly adventurous, you can run it in short bursts over a whole weekend.
