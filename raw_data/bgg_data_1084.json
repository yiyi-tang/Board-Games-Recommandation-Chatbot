    "Description": "It's been 30 years since the last uprising of the Zraxii Empire was beaten down by the brave troops of the Terra Republic. Applying for the mission with the codename &quot;Elite Peacekeeping Shockwave&quot; sounded glorious at first, but turned out being a little bit dull as patrolling a remote part of the galaxy without any upbeat outposts did not motivate the crew greatly. Instead, one of the most stimulating activities became the weekly BBQ on the electric fire in the dust-heavy unused launch bay, within the protective shield of the XP95 fighter craft. Today's menu included some deep space frozen Milky Way cow meat, discovered on an abandoned vessel near the dwarf planet Taplor 4.&#10;&#10;&quot;RRAARRRAARR!&quot; &mdash; The ship's alarm was blazing.&#10;&#10;Only after a few important wasted moments did the squad realize this was not a test as they found themselves between the run wild XP95 fighter, filled with enough explosives to destroy a small moon, and the marching forces of the until now assumed defeated Zraxii Empire trying to board the ship. Luckily the squad's exceptionally extensive combat training and experience came in handy, if only they had kept up training regularly...&#10;&#10;Launch Bay Escape is a ridiculous co-operative game featuring planning that's enriched with a small deck-building mechanism. It's suitable for space soldiers from the age of 10 and takes about 30-45 minutes. The difficulty level is easily adjustable per game as you increase the complexity by adding more and more aliens, obstacles, and madness.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. At the start of the game a rectangular game board divided in rows of squares is placed. One end features the launching ship and the starting area for the players, the other end features the Launch Bay exit. All players have their own character sheet and corresponding deck, and all players have their own special abilities, number of hit points and shield. Players start with six cards in their hand. At the start of a round, all players plan three cards from the available cards in their hand, face down. Next, the first card of all players is revealed. All cards show a number, movement options, and special abilities. In order of highest to lowest number, every player follows the instructions on their planned card. When all cards are resolved, the ship moves one row towards the Launch Bay exit and all aliens move once towards the ship and attack. This is repeated for both remaining planned cards. At the end of the round, all planned cards and remaining cards in the player's hand are discarded and a new hand of six cards is drawn. Once damage accumulates, some cards will be planned randomly.&#10;&#10;Players can gain experience by killing aliens. Experience enables the players to buy extra cards to add to their deck. In addition, players may find items on the game board, usable only once or multiple times.&#10;&#10;The players lose if the ship or all the players are destroyed before reaching the escape pods at the end of the Launch Bay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game is not balanced although players may balance it as they deem fit.  The actual fight was not; we had a healthy respect for the quantity, if not the quality, of the enemy.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you must have a copy of the initial GMT MBT Game.  The expansion includes a new map of four 11 x 17 inch map sheets scaled at 100 meters per hex (the same scale as the MBT game).  The map is based on a period map of the battle area and utilizes contours to depict elevation.&#10;&#10;The Scenario Briefing, a B Troop and Soviet Battle Books with deployment instructions, and alternate order of battle listings, a planning map and terrain key are downloadable from the files section.&#10;&#10;Expansion sets are not required (BAOR, FRG, and the forthcoming Canadian supplement) provide additional vehicle counters as well as leaders.  A list of substitute counters is provided to enable the player to field the complete order of battle for both sides or the players can use some of the expansion set vehicles or combine sets to complete the order of battle.&#10;&#10;Mind the Gap can be played with two players but may be more interesting if played with up to 6 players on the US side (CO and the five platoon leaders), and 6 on the USSR side (Battalion Commander and 4 company commanders), and a referee.&#10;&#10;The gamer can also simulate a 1978 engagement by downloading a Vehicle Card for the M60A1 tank from https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/146576/official-bonus-data-card-um-13b-m60a1-aos and by deleting the M901 Improved TOW vehicles from the US Order of Battle&#10;&#10;Mind the Gap&copy; 2018 StrongPoint Simulations and Modeling, LLC.  &bull;    MBT&trade; is arbitrable to James M.

Beloved characters from the Super Meat Boy Cinematic Universe make appearances for the first time as trading cards, each with their own unique abilities and powers to help navigate the levels ahead at breakneck speeds. Rival Rush is a nonstop fast paced no holds barred finger blistering every card for themselves showdown where only the swiftest and smartest survive.&#10;&#10;Taking heavy influence in the micro-deck builder genre, the game puts the players in the task of creating a deck of cards that matches the symbols that pop up in the &quot;stages&quot; in front of us. The trick? Your rival might guess which card you have chosen for this turn and could block your moves through the stages; and in Rival Rush there will be only ONE winner.&#10;&#10;Taking in consideration that the game offers the possibility of a fresh experience every time it's played thanks to it's random generated levels (constructed from the cards themselves), Rival Rush seems like a very fun and competitive way of enjoying Super Meat Boy; hopefully not as frustrating as it's digital counterpart.&#10;&#10;",

GFY makes a perfect gift for anyone in college or the military.&#10;&#10;Each player start with 7 cards and your goal is to be the first to get rid of your cards, that is how the game ends.&#10;&#10;On your turn draw 1 card and play 1 card, doing exactly what the card's rules say to do. Typically, this will be to discard more cards, draw more cards, or give or take cards from another player. If you can't do it exactly, you can not play it. If you can't play anything, draw a 2nd card and end your turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was made as a form of giving back to our fans and supporters. Yes, it's FREE! You can get the Print N Play file simply by subscribing your email to Medieval Lords. We love to spread fun and joy (perhaps death and destruction too, in this case) It is wild, so expect to laugh lots when you play - more so if your friends are horrible actors! Alternatively, you can get the game professionally printed over at The Game Crafter here: https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/i-know-how-you-died1 (Cost-to-cost price by Game Crafter with zero profit for us) This game is intended for pure utter rubbish type of casual fun, don't go in expecting any serious game play! Play this with the wrong crowd and you'd end up in an awkward evening!&#10;&#10;Players are issued 3 random secret cards depicting various deaths, and they must choose one of them to re-enact. Then after everyone has done a quick 5 to 10 seconds re-enactment of their chosen scene, they toss these cards (still face-down) into a common pile in the middle of the table. Shuffle the pile and reveal the top card to everyone. If anyone wants to guess at who had acted out the death scene of that particular card, simply say 'I know!' and call out that player's name. This is on a first-come-first-serve basis. Note that the actual actor of the card cannot guess his/her own card, but must pretend to participate so as not to give the answer away.&#10;&#10;If a scene was guessed correctly the first time, the guesser gains 4 Point. If a scene was guessed correctly the second time, the guesser gains 3 Point. The actor also gets 3 Points. All wrong guesses will deduct 1 Point from the guesser.&#10;&#10;If no one got the correct answer to a scene after two attempts, the next scene is drawn and the game continues. After 3 scenes, the entire pile is discarded completely and a new round begins. This also means there will be some scenes that do not show up despite having been acted out. This is to increase the difficulty of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last card is drawn, or when someone achieves 20 or more Points. Rules can be found at the Files section of this game page.&#10;&#10;Have fun dying...&#10;&#10;",

We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity.

    "Description": "The aim of the game is to get your family of 3 across the valley of death to the safety of their new home.&#10;&#10;To do this you have 2 dice, you can use the number as one whole number for one Lemming or you can split the dice and move two lemmings (sticking to the numbers on the dice please!!) as you move along you must avoid rivers, canyons, forest fires and the ubiquitous Random Encounters which can be good or bad! However, you can navigate the terrain using Save or Play cards specific to each obstacle. For example, rivers can be used as normal squares if you have a boat, Lem Cardashian's floating but, or a Child's birthday balloon. Save or Play cards can also save you from predators such as the Lemming Chainsaw Massacre which prevents you from being eaten by mountain lions, snakes, or being trampled by an angry bull BUT you can only use one card per one lemming (then the card goes back to the bottom of the pack) so use them wisely to get your lemmings to safety.&#10;&#10;As you move around the board the risks are greater AND if at any point you land on a space with another teams lemming you must battle it out for territory by rolling one die each, the one with the least has to move back the number they rolled, but beware of landing on Random Encounters and other Lemmings because you must keep going until you are safe.&#10;&#10;The game builds in tension as the players begin to reach their new home because you are now in a position where you don&rsquo;t have the option to choose which lemming you move, beware friends and family as you get closer to winning they might have a mean streak you didn&rsquo;t know about and use a Save or Play card against another player.&#10;&#10;This board game pits you against your family and friends in a fun but strategic game, it&rsquo;s your job to know which Lemming to move and when to strike in order to get home first. As the game progresses the stakes are higher - Lemmy is counting on you!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Showdown introduces a new mode: full Player-versus-Player deathmatches that will see players draft &amp; pick all-new Upgrade tokens and enter a vicious arena to battle enemy Crews!&#10;&#10;The action in Showdown takes place in a Double-sided Game Board, with one side designed for 3-4 players, and a 2 players version on the back. With its tight corridors and sharp turns, the Crews (and Guilds) will see themselves immersed into non-stop action! Only 1 Stimpack, 1 Recharge Token and 2 Computer Terminals are still functioning in the arena and sometimes become contested hotspots. In Showdown, the Crews don&rsquo;t claim Victory by accumulating Victory Points: the first Crew that manages to score 3 Kills is deemed Victorious!&#10;&#10;Thanks to the Hollow Deck technology, Starcadians can conjure up the legendary Heroes from ancient Arcadia to test their mettle! With 60 Hero cards and 4 Crew Dashboards (sporting an appropriately battle-damaged look and slots for Pets and Mounts!) players with any Arcadia Quest core box (Classic or Inferno) or with the Starcadia Quest core box can join the Showdown!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Lovecraft inspired 1920&rsquo;s horror skirmish game.&#10;&#10;In Providence U.S.A a City like many other, the stage is set for what could be the first battle for the very survival of every last man, woman and child of Humanity. A war is coming, though not like the one that ended but a few years ago. An ancient being stirs in the deep, something so powerful that if it were to awaken, it would wipe out Humanity in the blink of an eye.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;The Sea Queen has been given the task and sent forth her best, they have made their way to land and now walk amongst you attempting to blend in as they scout this world above the water.&#10;&#10;Other creatures born in the wild have been drawn to the area, the woods and forests are their realm and they are fiercely protective of them. They strengthen their numbers with sacrificial magic and awaken the old things of the forest best left sleeping.&#10;&#10;Guardians from a long past age have been shipped by chance or fate to the town, their chittering growing in volume as they begin to awaken from their hibernation.&#10;&#10;Cultists find key points of power for summoning. Their decades long work finally paying dividends as they close on the secret to moving beyond human form and finding the path of enlightenment that will see them become gods.&#10;&#10;And finally, the defenders of Humanity, long since forgotten but still ever vigilant. The prophets have spoken, the signs of something dark and powerful are plain to see and they will not stand idly by but will fight to their dying breath against the coming darkness.&#10;&#10;This skirmish game will see two or more players take to the table top to play one of the core game types, or one of the story solo/campaign games of Mythos.&#10; Each faction member is unique, coming not only with their own stats, Mythos abilities and traits but also a second side to their nature. Some will reveal this as insanity takes hold, others will be triggered by certain effects and interactions. Each turn players will alternate their activation's using up all the action points of each character. &lsquo;Live combat&rsquo; will see that not every fight goes your way even if you started it, blasting your foes with ranged or arcane attacks may see them dodge away, taking that valuable item with them as they do.&#10;&#10;Balancing your Mythos use will be key, as each point spent also takes away a point of sanity and once you go insane there&rsquo;s no coming back but it&rsquo;s not always a bad thing.&#10;&#10;So, are you up for the challenge, to take the fight to your faction&rsquo;s enemies, to put the objective before all else and push past your sanity threshold until all you see is red and insanity takes you?&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;Yes, then welcome to Mythos!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Powerful Samurai families each have conquered large parts of Japan, and the days of the last Ashikaga Shogun in Kyoto are numbered. By land and sea, many more battles will befall the already war-torn country. And soon, one of the many Daimy&#197;&#141;s &ndash; the Samurai Warlords &ndash; might unite enough regions of Japan under his banner, to call himself the new Shogun. Who will be the first to quench his thirst for power, and start a dynasty to shape Japan for the centuries to come?&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;Become the greatest of the Samurai, by controlling Kyoto and large parts of Japan.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Players draw cards to place armies, attack or fortify provinces and send out agents to sabotage their enemies. The more powerful players become, the more cards they may draw, but the less control they have over which cards to keep.&#10;&#10;Every now and then, an Event Card will bring change to the war. The biggest of which is the arrival of the Europeans, who bring firearms and Christianity with them, opening up new possibilities to the players.&#10;&#10;",

Now there&rsquo;s one more for the list &ndash; Beards make the perfect backdrop for a fun party game!&#10;&#10;The game centers around completing stunts with three different fake beards. On a turn, two players (either as a team or two cooperating competitors) will try to complete one of the many stunts represented on the cards in the game. Each card provides details about the challenge, the number of attempts allowed, and how many points the stunt is worth.&#10;&#10;One player puts on a fake beard with a set of glasses, while the other grabs the plastic balls that are covered in Velcro. The team then follows the instructions given on the card, often trying to get the ball caught on the beard. If they succeed in the designated number of attempts, then both players (or the team) score the points!&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player (or team) reaches 11, and he/she/they are the winners!&#10;&#10;Contents include - 50 beard ball stunt cards, 5 beard balls, 3 stylish beards of varying difficulty levels, 1 pair of glasses, 1 Bearded die, 1 game board, and instructions&#10;&#10;",

English rules are on the designer's website.&#10;&#10;In the game of GAMBLE ZEBRA, players try to accumulate victory points by betting on black or white.&#10;&#10;Each player receives an identical deck of eight bidding cards. Any of these cards can be played in two ways: bid on black with a value of X or bid on white with a value of Y. In any card, X+Y is always 9. For example if the upper half of a card is 8 on black, the lower half is 1 on white. In addition, each player receives two random special bidding cards.&#10;&#10;Each round, a victory point card, whose value ranges from -1 to 5, is shown up. Players guess whether the back of the card is black or white, and play two cards from their hands. When the card's color is revealed, the highest bidder on that color takes the victory point card and a random victory point modifier card.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;Designer's summary&#10;3&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;1&#227;&#129;&#164;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#231;&#153;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#187;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#179;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#10;2&#227;&#129;&#164;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#139;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#10;3&#227;&#129;&#164;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#155;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#230;&#157;&#161;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#154;5&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#10;&#10;",

Scotland Yard has assigned Inspector Abberline to take over the investigation, aided by five new detectives with extraordinary abilities. The new recruits include the formidable Professor Moriarty, who uses his intelligence and cunning to impersonate the other detectives. Is he trying to put Jack off his stride, or to outwit his rival Sherlock Holmes? Or could he even be Jack himself, disguised as Moriarty? Who is the elusive Jack? The unrelenting manhunt continues!&#10;&#10;Mr. Jack: Extension is an expansion for the Mr. Jack deduction game that features refreshed artwork for the tenth anniversary of the game as well as an original character as strong as it is enigmatic: Professor Moriarty, whose special ability is to imitate one of the characters who is not at stake.  Moriarty is quite the chameleon, impersonating the other detectives by mimicking their appearance and using their abilities!&#10;&#10;This expansion lets you play with six new characters: meet the sultry Madame, flee the terrifying Pizer, avoid the revolutionary Joseph Lane's barricade, dodge Inspector Abberline's probing questions, bound along London's streets with the Spring-Heeled Man, and watch out for Moriarty. At the start of the game, choose which of the eight characters to play with via a draft and determine their starting locations. These new possibilities add fun and strategic depth.&#10;&#10;Whether playing as Jack or the Detective, master them all to win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Beginning with a search for two missing Miskatonic University professors, your inquiries in The Dunwich Legacy launched you on a campaign that led from the decrepit streets of Dunwich to the infamous Clover Club and realms beyond. But questions from these strange investigations still linger, compelling you to board the train to Dunwich once more.&#10;&#10;Return to the Dunwich Legacy invites you to re-open your old cases and experience the first full-length campaign for Arkham Horror: The Card Game with fresh eyes as you encounter new challenges and new surprises. Across this expansion&rsquo;s 81 new scenario cards and 23 new player cards, you&rsquo;ll explore new locations, face more ghastly treacheries, and enhance your investigator&rsquo;s abilities as you face even more unspeakable terrors. Finally, Return to the Dunwich Legacy also features a premium box and thirty-two divider cards to conveniently store your complete campaign in one place.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The main components are 25 plastic sombrero-shaped hats, each concealing a sticker in one of five colours.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players are dealt a set of hats and three hats are placed on the table. The player in turn to play may conditionally peek at the colour of a lone hat, and must then place one of their hats on one of the three piles, calling out a colour as they do so. Stating a colour is purely psychological though, as the player is only required to match colours with the hat underneath and whatever is said is disregarded entirely when confirming this. It is also possible to pass at the cost of taking a hat from the &quot;deck&quot;.&#10;&#10;Another player may challenge a placement, at which point the newly placed hat and the one underneath are inspected to see if they match. In typical bluffing game fashion, whichever of the challenged and challenging player is in the wrong is penalized by having to pick up the entire pile in question, and the other continues play by beginning a replacement pile.&#10;&#10;The goal of each round is to be the first player to get rid of all hats, at which point the other players get penalty points based on the hats they still hold. The player with the least penalty points after three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher game submitter&#10;&#10;",

Units can be used to defend a player's castle, attack other players, or complete specific goals to earn victory points.&#10;&#10;Victory points are acquired by accomplishing goals to better your kingdom. You can choose to take control of the center of board, prove you can keep your civilians safe during times of war, build immaculate parks, or even fulfill the quest for the Holy Grail, there are many strategies you can pursue to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Assymetric player powers make each play unique. Leader drafting happens at the beginning of the game, starting with the player who goes last and ending with the first player. There are 10 unique leaders including one that gives you extra turns throughout the game, one that lets you buy &quot;blindly&quot; off the top of a deck, and one that lets you increase the maximum health of your units.&#10;&#10;Between the ever-changing market, the unique leaders, and the constant unit interactions, every game of Furtherance is different! And, with the streamlined action system and rules, it takes less than 15 minutes to learn and 30 minutes per player to play.&#10;&#10;Furtherance can also be played in solo mode. In solo mode, the lone player must defend their castle from ever growing armies in an attempt to make their mark on history by acquiring enough victory points to win before they become overwhelmed with enemies.&#10;&#10;",

However, the players do not have a set team at the beginning of the game. Players work toward the final victory, while also building the two piles and earning their score.&#10;&#10;A a turn, the player simply puts one out of three cards in front of someone. Wherever the card is played, the probability of the black cat team or the white cat team written on the card will be added. If this probability exceeds 100%, the player's team is confirmed. Then, when the player's team is confirmed, the points from the card that confirmed the team will be added to the team. The game is over when all players have a confirmed team, or the deck runs out. The team with the most points wins. Even though it is very simple, frustration is bound to happen.&#10;&#10;",

By exploring deeper and deeper into the ruins of this lost tribe, they will discover and try to make narrative sense of new elements to the legend, all while hopefully not succumbing to their worst fears. As these things always go, however, there is a catch. Somewhere in the deep, dark underground waits a malevolent force, older than time itself, and with each step they take, our intrepid explorers are unwittingly awakening it. Will our noble adventurers unlock the key to the lost Legend of the Ancients?

A 1-page, print-and-play DOC file also is included as an errata.  The game uses two distinct decks of cards and a play surface that is randomized at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Play involves drawing map tiles and placing them, to create the randomized playing surface.  Players have a token marking their position on the board.  During each turn, the player selects an action from among six possibilities and executes that action.  Several of the options entail moving the player token to a new map tile.&#10;&#10;Players are free to cooperate to achieve game goals, and play is considered cooperative.  Indeed, a few game actions require more than a single player.  Individual players may have leave the game prior to the end of play (they are driven &quot;stark, raving mad&quot;), but this is not common.  Instead, the game ends when the players collectively complete one of two tracks of play (one of the tracks is the &quot;happy&quot; ending - universal success; the other is the &quot;doom&quot; ending - universal failure).&#10;&#10;The game is meant to be played with 3 - 5 players; a minor variant rule can be used to adapt the game for 2 players - in effect, the rule creates a dummy, limited, third &quot;player&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game was written for, and submitted to, Game Chef 2018.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battles that Tell More than Just a Story&#10;&#10;Heroes of Normandy &ndash; The Untold Stories Vol. 1 is an expansion module for Lock 'n Load Tactical's Heroes of Normandy. It contains eight new scenarios, plus a bonus scenario in which two scenarios are combined to form a larger one.  The idea for this expansion started from a long desire to tell these stories as well as enjoying hearing them.  One of the many wonderful things with books, comics and of course games is sharing the fun together.  Many hours of storytelling can start off with &ldquo;Do you remember, or I can&rsquo;t believe this happened.&rdquo; It is clear to us we weren&rsquo;t the only ones who enjoy hearing these stories.  We wanted our stories to be told with characters you know and enjoy playing our games but at the same time if you never played one of our games you would still enjoy reading these stories.  So, a number of the story elements are taken from our Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical game series, specifically the names of leaders, heroes, units, and the occasional moments inspired by our own gameplay.  By doing this it has added a new level to our stories and added the ability and similarity for these men and their stories to live on not just in our games but also in our stories and hearts.&#10;&#10;The scenarios do not have to be played in order and are presented here in the same order in which they appear in the book. Most of them can be played in 45 minutes or fewer, and the replay value is high. It was also nice to get the little-used British commando units into some more scenarios.  Three new 4K X-Maps are included that depict the lush Norman countryside, presenting winding streams, tree-lined farms, and a quaint village. Vital bridges need to be destroyed, important villages need to be controlled, daring rescues need to be made and vengeance must be doled out no matter the cost. Heroics, leadership and, as always, luck can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Now you can read or listen to the stories and then play them out on your gaming table!&#10;&#10;Requirements:  To play Heroes of Normandy  &ndash; The Untold Stories you must own Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical &ndash; Heroes of Normandy.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
