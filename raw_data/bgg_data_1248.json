Miss Sophie is once again celebrating her 90th birthday with her deceased friends, but in the party game Der 90. Geburtstag oder Dinner for One based on the cult sketch of the same name, the players take turns playing the role of the butler James and reenacting the scenes: Saying toasts to the birthday child, hitting the heels, and serving food and drink &mdash; including, of course, jumping over the tiger's head, along with an increasing physical handicap through cardboard bottles clamped in the crooks of the arm or between the thighs because the increasingly drunk state of James cannot be missing in this party game.&#10;&#10;The scenes are revealed as cards in a random order. As the game progresses, more and more cards are added, but the round always starts with the first card, followed by the second, and so on, so you should memorize the &quot;script&quot; in the game or else you will collect penalty chips.&#10;&#10;In the end, whoever has the fewest Schwips-Chips wins. &quot;Skol!&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The first is the General Reaction deck that directs the opponent at the start of the game and in the face of uncertainty. The second is the Enemy Visible that will direct opponent when its units are in contact with your units. Finally, the Event cards will help customize play as you want to change your game.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed for a simple assessment criterion.

But, if the battle is lost, you will be buried with just a little sympathy (VP).&#10;So, the adventurer&rsquo;s dilemma is: Should I fight bravely for glory at the risk of dying, or cower at the right time to live longer to enjoy the even sweeter triumph at the end of the game?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Brazil, a great amount of energy is produced by hydroelectricity. Dams are responsible for providing energy to industries, markets, and houses across the country. This electricity is distributed by great networks of transmission. It's a big business that moves billions every year.&#10;&#10;El&eacute;trica invites you and your friends to take on the role of energy entrepreneurs. During the game, you need to increase the size of the map and construct lines to supply energy to cities. With each new line, you can complete contracts and receive victory points.&#10;&#10;In more detail, following a set-up phase in which you each place a tile next to the starting spring river tile, on a turn you either (1) reveal and place a new tile or (2) build. The tile-laying works as you might expect, with tiles needing to be adjacent with the elements on each side matching. After placing a tile, you can place a marker on it to reserve it.&#10;&#10;The game includes five types of constructions &mdash; hydroelectric, electrical substation, transmission tower, utility pole, and city &mdash; and to build one of them, you use workers on a tile and choose an available construction, following certain limitations on building. A hydroelectric construction must be placed on a tile with water, for example, while a city can't be built next to a transmission tower and three constructions can't be neighbors to one another on a triangle of tiles. When you build a functioning network, you can complete a contract and score points. Two constructions of the same type earns you 2 points, for example, while more complex combinations earn you more.&#10;&#10;Once the final tile is revealed and placed, the game ends and whoever has the most points becomes an energy magnate!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The life of a zombie can be a lonely one. Like anyone, zombies crave companionship. It's just too bad that their main friendship-making techniques involve such force. But hey, it beats dying alone!&#10;&#10;Lonely Undead is a survival board game that pits (very recently infected) zombies (Zs) head-to-head against a small-town of wannabe heroes, innocent bystanders, and other freshly turned Zs. Each player embodies a different Z with its own distinct set of special abilities and styles fitting to their character. If the characters can be harnessed effectively depends on a number of factors, for this is no push over town and you're not the only one out seeking friends.&#10;&#10;Plan and navigate your way about town and find some people to bite! Whilst doing so, look for supplies to aid your cause, but be careful who you walk up on. You might not always enjoy who you discover. Your targets are The Living and are revealed upon engagement. Each Living has its own set of attributes and bonuses that you have to try to beat. If they're stronger than you, hope that chance is on your side.&#10;&#10;Watch out for other Zs trying to foil your plans! &#10;Other Zs will do their best to try to keep you from infecting your new buddies. How rude. Let's hope they can't stop you.&#10;&#10;Then the Town gets its turn!&#10;After you've caused some mayhem, the Town retaliates. Apparently they don't like being preyed upon and bodies lying in the streets. Draw your reactions, suffer the consequences, and watch out for cars and dogs!&#10;&#10;Be the first Z to infect so many of the Living to become the winner!&#10;&#10;Many other game modes!&#10;Lonely Undead comes complete with many other game modes. Team up and try your (severed) hand in a Co-op mode or run amok on the streets alone in a Solo mode.&#10;&#10;Build a different town every time!&#10;Lonely Undead comes complete with modular tiles of the towns structures. In the &quot;Mutated&quot; Mode, players can build the town based off of their goals before they even set foot into it.&#10;&#10;55 different Aids cards to help your cause!&#10;30 different Living to encounter!&#10;55 distinct Reactions from the town!&#10;Six unique Zs to play as!&#10;Three main game modes with multiple difficulties and objectives!&#10;A customizable modular town system!&#10;Lonely Undead is a game with infinite possibilities.

The world fell into chaos as the resourceful bunny girls fought for supremacy in what became known as the Entrepreneurial Warring States Period. In this hand management and tableau building game, play as the bunny president of a new company aiming to hire the best bunny girls and surpass all the competition.&#10;&#10;On your turn, choose to either draw two cards or manage your workers. Hire one bunny per turn either as a free trainee or a full-time employee by discarding other bunnies whose colors match its cost. Promote as many trainees as you would like by paying their costs. Each of your workers gives you Bunny Points (BP) needed to win the game. When a player reaches 8 full-time employees, the game ends at the end of that round.

In the other case, the hacker with the highest individual score (bitcoin) wins; which creates some healthy paranoia amongst the hackers.&#10;&#10;The CISO starts with (at least) one defence card (&quot;security measure&quot;) per type of attack and a starting budget in euro. Each hacker starts with 3 attacks of their choice, 3 identity tokens, and a starting money stack in bitcoin.&#10;&#10;Each player also has a hidden goal for the game, which - when completed - gives them a leg up.&#10;&#10;The game plays in 3 phases per round:&#10;&#10;(1) the EVENT phase: &#10;(a) the CISO receives his budgets (which depends on the number of hackers) and &#10;(b) both CISO and hackers draw an event card (which is resolved as indicated on the card)&#10;&#10;(2) the PLANNING phase:&#10;(a) the CISO can spend budget to purchase additional security measures (= draw cards) and can deploy security measures (= ready cards) &#10;(b) the hackers can learn additional attacks (= draw cards, up to a hand limit of 4) and can plan attacks  &#10; (3) the ATTACK phase: &#10;(a) the hackers declare (joint or separate) attacks on the assets of the bank, starting with the assets at the outer rim of the corporate infrastructure (ATM, router,...) and pay for the attack (in bitcoins)&#10;(b) the CISO then checks if they security measures they put in play are sufficient to block the attack&#10;=&gt; if the attack succeeded (defence value is lower than total attack value), the asset is hacked and the hackers receive a bitcoin reward for the successful attack &#10;=&gt; if the attack failed, the hacker leading the attack hands over 1 identity token to the CISO&#10;&#10;",

But mountain men, rangers, cowboys, the regular U.S. army, Navahos, Apaches, and immigrant woodland and southeastern tribes are also covered.&#10;&#10;The game is played with miniature figures of any scale.  A unique feature is the use of playing cards in place of dice to resolve game mechanics.  Players draw cards from a standard card deck, which is reshuffled periodically.  Cards determine activation, movement distances, the outcome of shooting or melee combat, and of pin and morale tests.  There are extensive notes on specific native American tribes and a system to play solo.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Broken Skies is a game for two or more players. A standard game will generally consist of 2-3 models per side. Players first choose the faction they want to play and select a force up to the agreed points value.&#10;&#10;When selecting your force, you start with selecting your aircraft. These may then be upgraded by adding pilot skills or aircraft upgrades. A player may choose a maximum of one Pilot Skill upgrade and one Aircraft upgrade for each model.&#10;&#10;Broken Skies is all about fun customisation of your list to make it uniquely yours! Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to customise with skills and upgrades. You can just take the basic model as listed on the stat card. These represent the basic rookie pilots that has yet to win glory in the skies.&#10;&#10;With this in mind it&rsquo;s also possible to play a series of friendly games in which your force builds their skills and upgrades over the course of the campaign.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trepidation is a cooperative horror survival game, where players are trying trying to make it to the end of the forest. All players are given a role card at the beginning of the game, which is broken down by the townspeople and the possessed role. Townspeople are trying to make it to the end of the forest, while the possessed player is trying to have everyone killed before they reach the end.&#10;&#10;There are monsters and events standing in between you and your escape. Your survival will depend upon collecting and trading items, strategizing, and figuring out whom to trust in your party. Can you make it out of the forest alive?&#10;&#10;Every player is dealt a limited number of location and item cards. The location cards are used throughout the game to progress through the forest. Each location card will indicate whether you will draw an item, event, or monster card for that turn.&#10;&#10;There are unique location cards found within the deck called landmarks. The landmarks are what you will be searching for and must complete as a group to continue your progress through the forest. Depending on the difficulty you select at the beginning of the game, you will have to complete either 3, 5 or 7 landmarks to make it out of the forest. Planning ahead is a necessity, as the landmarks will force the entire party to combat monsters the moment they are played.&#10;&#10;Every monster has a unique way that it must be warded off. Some monsters are more problematic, and even more perilous to come across than others. Use your items and plan ahead in order to overcome that which awaits you and your team.&#10;&#10;Be careful, though, as the possessed player may try to deceive you. They can use the event, item and landmark cards to their advantage, and will try blending in as a normal towns person throughout the game... waiting until your guard is down before sabotaging you.&#10;&#10;",

It is possible for a single piece to complete the corners of several different squares.&#10;&#10;After a player sets a piece, they check to see if any new squares were formed. They make note of how many and keep a running total. A player is given a reasonable time to count up all the new squares, and then the next player may take his turn. If a player spots any new squares after the other players sets a piece, that player loses those points.&#10;&#10;After the last piece is set, the scores are tallied.

Other than 206 pages jammed full of gaming goodness?&#10;&#10;This is a set of science fiction miniatures rules aimed at not only recapturing the spirit and feel of old school science fiction gaming, but presenting it in an updated and improved form, combining familiar mechanics with the polish and elegance expected in a modern game.&#10;&#10;Using this system, you can command everything from tentacle aliens to squads of futuristic troopers, tanks, walkers, dinosaurs and more. Rules include off-map support, supernatural powers and a host of strange terrain features and world conditions to fight among.&#10;&#10;If you are looking to revive some of your favorite old miniatures, note that Renegade Scout is profile compatible with the two first editions of the most popular gothic scifi wargame, allowing troops and weapons to be used as is, but with sleeker and more elegant mechanics.&#10;&#10;If you want a fully fledged space opera setting to dive into, you can explore the worlds of Unified Space, where a host of alien species battle for supremacy, from the blood-stained cyborg troops of the Converted to the proud K'Erin and mysterious Engineers.&#10;&#10;If you want to just open the book and play, we include 8 Battle Scenarios ready to play with your own armies, as well as the Objective Battle letting you fight an unpredictable encounter with randomly generated objectives. &#10;Scenario driven gaming more your speed? An array of tools and mechanics cover everything from radio communications to barricading doors.&#10;&#10;The Army Builder allows you to construct a huge range of forces for any of the included troop types, for pick-up games using an army list and a fully fledged points system lets you build your own custom forces.&#10;&#10;Want something a bit bigger? Why not start a Persistent Game where your troops gain experience from battle to battle. Perfect for campaigns or league play.&#10;&#10;In short, almost whatever it is you are into and whatever scale of miniatures you enjoy, Renegade Scout has something for you.&#10;&#10;Note that this is a fully updated 2nd edition of the rules, featuring much expanded content, material from several supplements, brand new options and far more pick-up-and-play possibilities than before.&#10;&#10;If you are an experienced player, please enjoy this new edition generously funded by the fan base.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You can use the rest to grow your vine.&#10;- By branching, you gain blossoms, while also getting more connection points for future tiles.&#10;- As the board fills, competing vines converge and can remove other player's blossoms.&#10;- Single blossom tiles keep a blossom safe from removal, but also prevent that branch from growing further.&#10;- Triple blossoms earn an extra point, give protection, and increase the number of tiles you can place each turn.&#10;- At the end of your turn, draw tiles back up to your hand limit.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game of survival and exploration, for 1 - 4 players (ages 10 and up), by Steadman Watson&#10;&#10;As a student of the Vildhall School of Wilderness Survival, you and your friends learn valuable survival skills. Now it is time to put those skills to the test on a wilderness adventure. Grab your pack, fill your canteen, check your compass and let&rsquo;s head out on an adventure!&#10;&#10;The objective of Wilderness Survival School is to make it back to town with the highest Karma score, which represents how well each player&rsquo;s adventure went overall.&#10;&#10;Each player holds cards representing the courses they have completed, which enable specific feats of outdoor survival.  There are four foundation course feats available to all players: Fire Making, River Fording, Route Finding, and Shelter Building.  In addition, each player selects two elective feats.  Feats are not always successful, and players roll dice to determine how they did.&#10;&#10;Before setting out on an adventure, each player fills their Day Pack with various supplies, keeping in mind the equipment requirements for chosen feats.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own scorepad to track their vital statistics.  Every player starts with the same amount of Health Points, Energy, and Karma.  Health Points is the capacity to absorb damage, Energy is the capacity to take actions, and Karma is the sum of a player&rsquo;s actions, both good and bad.&#10;&#10;Each day is broken down into 6 turns, which are tracked using a turn tracker.  Turns 1 - 4 are in the daylight, while turns 5 and 6 are at night.  Movement and feats are undertaken during the day, while the night is used to recover Energy.&#10;&#10;As players move, they will explore nearby terrain (moving meeples) and gradually expand the map.  The map is composed of hexagon tiles; new tiles are placed by the players using simple rules and the map is different each time the game is played.  Moving through the wilderness is how players will have wildlife encounters, locate additional food and water, and eventually find the way back to town.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as all players make it back to town. Once everyone is back, the players tally up their Karma (including any of the secret objectives found on the foundation feat cards).&#10;&#10;Whoever has the highest Karma score wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the desinger&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a deduction party game for 3-5 persons, offering  30-45 minutes playing time.&#10;&#10;A group of novice detectives are deployed to a condominium where every tenant is likely to be a crook. Each detective receives a description of a certain suspect, and their task is to find their target person in one of the apartments. The player who is first to succeed wins the game.&#10;&#10;One of the players takes the role of the Game Master, acting for the tenants. The rest of the players compete with each other in the investigation, which must be done by questioning the tenants. However, as they all have something to hide, they may be willing to give some bits of information on their neighbors only, and never about themselves.&#10;&#10;All the detectives receive a police file with a suspect&rsquo;s description, a dozen question cards, a player aid used for deduction, and some cash which might come in useful to make people talk. In their turn, the detectives knock on a door of their choice and ask a few selected questions by playing their question cards. Their ultimate goal is to locate the suspect by deduction, based on the answers they get during the game.&#10;&#10;When a player asks a question about the occupant of a certain apartment, the Game Master checks the back of the relevant door card (visible only to him/her), and tells the answer based on the 12 data found there. But as the answer will be heard by all the players, everyone can note it down and use it for their own progress! Door cards are placed on the table randomly. Not knowing which tenants the detectives will be looking for, the Game Master is not in the position to give hints. But his or her spirited answers can make this party game great fun for everyone!&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;============Description in Hungarian:&#10;&#10;A T&aacute;rsash&aacute;z 3-5 szem&eacute;ly sz&aacute;m&aacute;ra aj&aacute;nlott dedukci&oacute;s partij&aacute;t&eacute;k, mely kb. 30-45 percig tart.&#10;&#10;A rend&#197;&#145;rf&#197;&#145;n&ouml;k egy csapat kezd&#197;&#145; nyomoz&oacute;t r&aacute;&aacute;ll&iacute;t egy t&aacute;rsash&aacute;zra, ahol csupa gyan&uacute;s alak &eacute;s k&ouml;r&ouml;z&ouml;tt b&#197;&#177;n&ouml;z&#197;&#145; &eacute;l.

    "Description": "The last days of the Third Age of Middle-earth may have been dominated by the many great battles fought during the climactic War of the Ring, yet the most seismic event of all was the destruction of the One Ring and the final defeat of the Dark Lord Sauron. Crucial to this lasting victory over the forces of darkness was the epic journey undertaken by the Nine Walkers &ndash; the Fellowship of the Ring &ndash; for the deeds of its members, both good and ill, were destined to rule the fate of all.&#10;&#10;This expansion for the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game brings the fateful quest of the Fellowship of the Ring to life. As well as background on where the Fellowship&rsquo;s journey took them and vivid descriptions of the the many trials and tribulations they faced along the way, the book features a wealth of new rules, Scenarios and profiles. There are also rules for a linked, 28-scenario campaign that enables you to refight every key engagement involving the Fellowship and its members &ndash; from the smallest skirmish to the largest battle &ndash; with your collection of Citadel and Forge World miniatures.&#10;&#10;Inside this 128-page hardback supplement, you will find:&#10;&#10;Scenarios: 28 Narrative Scenarios, from the very start of Frodo's journey in Farmer Maggot's crop in the Shire, right through to the destruction of the One Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;The Journey of the Ringbearer: Rules for linking the Narrative Scenarios together into a flowing campaign, with each battle having an impact on others. These include rules to represent the length of the journey, your Heroes being injured (or even dying!), and recovering their strength between encounters with the enemy.&#10;&#10;Armies: Detailed army focuses, including the strengths, weaknesses and key models for five Armies: The Fellowship, Rangers of Ithilien, Wanderers in The Wild, The Black Riders and Cirith Ungol. Also includes two new profiles for the Rangers of Ithilien list, and two for the Wanders in the Wild list.&#10;&#10;Legendary Legions: Rules for six new and updated Legendary Legions: The Breaking of the Fellowship, Rangers of Ithilien, Lurtz's Scouts, Depths of Moria, The Black Riders, and Cirith Ungol.&#10;&#10;Fantasy Fellowship: Guidelines for creating your own Fantasy Fellowship by assembling Heroes from across Middle-earth in a similar way to the actual Fellowship of the Ring, but accounting for numerous 'what ifs' that could have reasonably happened throughout Middle-earth's and The One Ring's history. Includes rules for selecting a Ringbearer, their Companion, and the rest of The Fellowship. Also provides a slightly revised Fantasy Fellowship campaign, consisting of 23 linked Scenarios. (Please note that you will need the War in Rohan and Gondor at War supplements to be able to play all the way through the scenarios featured in the Fantasy Fellowship campaign.)&#10;&#10;Weathertop Masterclass: An extended masterclass on how to best build and paint the Weathertop scenery piece, available on ForgeWorld.co.uk, which was a key location on Frodo's journey.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Where is the loot hidden? Sausage in the bedroom? Money in the bathroom? Each player receives a robber's house complete with floors, side walls and roof parts for a total of three floors and five loot chips of one color, which he can distribute in his rooms. You roll the dice: For each thrown robber sack you can ask a fellow player a yes / no question about an object; for two or three you can always ask the same player or a different player every time. For a gift as a result you can ask for an item from a player. If you have asked or requested correctly, you receive the chip and place it on your robber's bag. Whoever has collected any five items wins.&#10;&#10;",

You&rsquo;re putting moves on each other, fake draws, designed to rile each other up like a scorpion in a bedroll.&#10;&#10;Draw your hands simultaneously, with digits in some arrangement as to signify a 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.&#10;&#10;The player whose number is 1-2 higher will win that round and score a point.&#10;&#10;1 beats 4,5&#10;2 beats 5,1&#10;3 beats 1,2&#10;4 beats 2,3&#10;5 beats 3,4&#10;&#10;These points are your nerve, or grit. The player with the best nerve will make the best shot, naturally.&#10;&#10;The time o&rsquo; reckoning comes along when both players throw matching digits.&#10;&#10;So do the math, the player with the most grits makes a clean shot.&#10;&#10;You decide, do you put a warning into their shoulder or hamstring n&rsquo; set their noodle straight, or whistle it real close past their ear like a mosquito or, hell, clean through the top of their hat -that&rsquo;ll surely send them hightailing out over the arroyo.&#10;&#10;Either way it seems that settled things and you figure you&rsquo;ll both be close as ever, until the next time anyhow.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Warhorn has a companion mobile application where players access the WARHORN which is a digital timer that has large buttons where time can be added and subtracted when prompted by certain clan abilities.&#10;&#10;When the war horn sounds players unleash their army (play their deck in its current state) trying to deploy their entire army of creatures as efficiently as possible by matching clans in a bid then match or exceed clash. Players whose clan cards are &ldquo;defeated&rdquo; go back into the Discharge pile which is later shuffled to create the communal Draft pile.&#10;&#10;During the Draft Players will use their time as they see fit to build up their current army for crushing victories, sabotage, and Interfere with their opponents draft or diversify their forces for varied strategic outcomes.&#10;&#10;Players may choose to stall during their turn and run down the clock in order to gain strategic advantages forcing other players to play clan abilities to force a turn pass, add or subtract time to or from the Warhorn, or ultimately cause the WARHORN to sound.&#10;&#10;Players can choose to hold onto creature cards to create an active hand while the WARHORN is ticking down and Interfere with their opponents all while attempting to adapt to the clans drawn during their turn in order to build a powerful army deck from the communal drafting pile.&#10;&#10;Clan cards will have different amounts of troops on them complimenting their clan abilities. The first player to deploy all their creature cards into the fight wins the battle. The first player to win 3 battles wins the war.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
