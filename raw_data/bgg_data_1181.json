    "Description": "Journey across a state with many railroads and difficult terrain. An unofficial expansion to T2R.&#10;Rules:&#10;Ticket To Ride New York State&#10;Recommended players: 2-4, maybe 5?!&#10;Time: 45-60 minutes&#10;If you are reading how to play this, I assume you know how to play the base Ticket to Ride game. If not, please familiarize yourself with the rules.&#10;&#10;Game Setup: Shuffle the 6 long destination tickets (routes with blue lettering) and deal one to each player. Discard the remaining. Then deal 3 regular destination tickets to each player. They must keep at least two. Discard the unwanted routes. Deal 4 train cards to each player.&#10;Drawing destination tickets during the game: Draw 3, keep at least one.&#10;Ferries and Tunnels: Ferry routes are designated by one or more locomotive icons. To build a ferry, you must pay a locomotive card for each locomotive icon on the route. The route between New York and Newark is a tunnel. To build the tunnel, pay one card of any color. Then flip over the top 3 cards of the deck, and pay an extra card of that color for each card of that color you flipped over (including locomotives). Discard the 3 flipped cards.&#10;Bonuses: The player who has the longest train receives the Empire State Express card, and 10 bonus points. The player who completed the most routes receives a Globetrotter bonus of 15 points.&#10;Double routes cannot be claimed in a 2 player game.&#10;Stations: This expansion uses station rules from Ticket To Ride Europe.&#10;&#10;",

The children are trying to collect the most shells of their favourite type while their dogs want to collect the most different types of dog toys. Starfish give extra points whereas creatures deduct points.  Rubbish can be good or bad depending on whether it is cleaned up or ignored.&#10;&#10;Stone Cards occasionally reveal Waves that wash the contents of the Rockpool out to sea.  After eight Waves the tide comes in and the game ends. Those who were most successful in their collecting celebrate by paddling in the Rockpool. The player with the most of their team paddling wins the game.&#10;&#10;Rockpool is a good mix of easy to play but hard to master, making it enjoyable for players of different ages and abilities. The key challenge is judging when to Shout as players can only use each of their team cards once.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tree of Liberty is a wargame for the usual brigade-to-division sized battles of the American Revolutionary War for independence. With minimal tweaking, it could be used for other battles between Europeans and natives on the American continent from the abandonment of the pike to the arrival of the rifled musket.&#10;&#10;The game has an order-based activation system which allows enemy interruptions, and elegant firing and melee mechanics that resolve the entire attack by picking multiples (doubles, triples &amp;c) out of each attack roll. The &quot;Disorder&quot; based morale system integrates personal and force level morale to produce believable results with no more book-keeping than a d6.&#10;&#10;The rules as written are for models from 15mm to 28mm - halving or doubling ranges will give good games in smaller or larger scales. An average-sized game takes about two hours once you know the rules, and large games can still be finished in an evening. If you are playing a large game, you may want to invest in a few counters to mark the use of initiative orders.&#10;&#10;Morningstar's Tactical Two Pager games are a series of simple but engaging games filled with fun and flavour. Each one takes up only two sides of easy-to-print A4, eliminating the need for a quick reference sheet and providing our players with a cheap source of entertainment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Recreate the battles for North America, Sharpe's adventures, the fall of the Alamo and the Spanish Americas, the Sikh Wars, the Wild West and more with your own cast of heroes and masses of minions! Though not designed to cover the period explicitly, the game also works for the later 19th century - for instance the ACW, the Prussian Wars and the colonial conflicts of various European empires.&#10;&#10;The game has an initiative-based activation system with an element of risk, and elegant firign and melee mechanics that resolve the entire attack using just one roll of two six-sided dice. The &quot;Panic&quot; based morale system integrates personal and force level morale to produce believable results with no book-keeping.&#10;&#10;The rules as written are for models from 15mm to 28mm - halving or doubling ranges will give good games in smaller or larger scales.

ZomPie is a quick paced card drafting game that is fun for the entire family. Be the first to collect your ingredients and make your ZomPie before you can be eaten by the Zombies.&#10;&#10;For 2 to 8 players ages 6 and up. Game setup is simple as each player is dealt 1 of 8 unique recipe cards, such as: Squished Eyeball Crumble, Pustule Pie, Crusty Scab Pie and others. Each recipe card lists the 5 ingredients that you need for your ZomPie recipe. Next, each player is dealt 5 ingredient cards. The ingredients are not for the faint at heart and are only appetizing to the zombie horde with favorites like: Toe Nails, Putrid Arms, Ear Wax, Jellied Bile or Canned Farts.&#10;&#10;Game Play is just as easy, each player attempts to collect all recipe ingredients for their ZomPie as game play progresses through card draw and discard. Players draw new ingredient cards from the pile and discard unwanted ingredient cards from their hand to maintain 5 ingredient cards at all times.  But watch out, because Zombies are at every turn with NomNom and NomNomNom cards with the likes of: &ldquo;A strong wind blew away your opened can of farts&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Zombie clown juggles your ingredients and drops a few&rdquo;, these can cause you to discard, trade or pass your pie ingredient cards or even, lose a turn!&#10;&#10;The first player to collect all 5 ingredients needed for their ZomPie recipe wins that round. Once someone completes their ZomPie, all recipe and ingredient cards are collected and redealt and the first person to win 3 rounds (or as many, or few rounds as everyone wants to play) wins the game&hellip; all other players are fed to the Zombie Horde (or maybe they just lose). So, stay off the menu and live to play another day!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The cardboard spinner has the numbers 50, 100, 150 or 200, representing miles a fighter will fly towards Tokyo along the sea lanes. The spinner also has a red plane that represents a Japanese fighter and black plane which is an Allied fighter. If a player spins the red plane it sends his fighter back one space and he can't proceed until he spins the black plane. If it is repeated the player loses his fighter but can regain it by spinning the black plane. The first to reach Tokyo with all 4 fighters is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The National Football Game is an early example of the uniquely Australian game of Australian rules football. Made by the National Game Company in 1900 the game is loosely based on an Australian rules football match.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is for a player to score a goal by moving a marker (football) along a players path using the roll of a dice.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the marker (the football) in the center of the board and players take turns to move the ball towards their goal on the roll of the dice. Each players progress is along a path and the goals are in each corner of the board. The next player rolls the dice and moves the ball back towards the center and can then begin along their path towards their goal. Players can have an extra throw of the dice on certain space (i.e. Free kick and behind) or by throwing a 6. To score a goal the player must throw the exact number by the dice to land on the goal.&#10;&#10;Recorded in the National Archives of Australia dated 1900. Several versions are known to exist. The most common type is mounted on a square board. A much rarer smaller rectangular board version also exists. &#10;Updates were continually made. For example, on the rectangular board the South Melbourne Football club is represented with a red and white hooped guernsey which was worn from 1897 to 1904. The Geelong team also shows hooped sleeves that were worn between 1902 - 1904, suggestion this version was dated between 1902 to 1904.&#10;The Square board version shows the South Melbourne Football club with a red sash, Melbourne Football club with a Red central strip and Fitzroy Football club with a Maroon and light yellow Guernsey. These football Guernsey's were all worn in 1907. In 1912 numbers were added to the back of football guernseys which is not evident with these early versions of the game.&#10;A third version of the game shows superimposed photos of Footballers over the background. St.Kilda football team now replaces Essendon as the side playing South Melbourne. The St.Kilda geurnsey has long black sleeves which were worn between 1924 to 1932, suggesting this was probably the last version of this game. &#10;National games produced another Football game called 'Out Great Game' but this was probably near the end or after 'The National Football Game'. 'Our Great Game' is listed elsewhere on BGG.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

These cards can be road cards, action cards or accessory cards:&#10;&#10;     The road cards are played on the map always adjacent to a previously played road card and keeping concordance, so that there is an adequate route to gradually reach the different check points.&#10;     The action cards have different effects that can be played on road cards or on accessory cards.&#10;     The accessory cards are stored in a player's backpack (it can be from an opponent or your own) and can have various effects, whether permanent or single use.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of his turn, each player draws cards from the main deck until he has 4 cards in hand again.&#10;&#10;The final round is determined when a player collects the 3 check points but the remaining players can continue playing until the current round is completed.&#10;If more than one player manages to collect all 3 check points in the final round, a tie is declared, otherwise the only player who managed to do so wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The New Zealand Wars&#10;Skirmish Game for the NZ Land Wars 1845 - 1872&#10;&#10;The New Zealand Wars is a simple and fast-play skirmish game covering the wars between Colonial and Maori forces in the mid 19th century in New Zealand. &#10;This ruleset is designed to be fast and brutal, and to reflect accurately the specifics of the period, and the asymmetry of the forces. &#10;Maori forces utilize guerrilla tactics, emerging from hidden rifle pits and outflanking Colonial positions, while Colonial forces rely on their superior weapons and drill/training. Players compose their forces from an army list, and add extra support like artillery or trenches, or fortified Pa in the case of the Maori forces. &#10;There are multiple scenarios and deployments to play, and the variety of possible army lists adds to the replayability.&#10;&#10;Officers and Ariki (Maori Chiefs) also factor in, being able to issue orders and fight. &#10;Rules are provided for muskets, carbines, swords, taiaha, patu, pistols and a few other melee weapons. &#10;Maori forces can upgrade regular soldiers to be combat specialists, as well as being able to field sawn-off double barreled shotguns (called Tupara), artillery and various other forms of support. Most soldiers can be given horses too and made mounted. &#10;Colonial forces can field regular British soldiers, militia, forest rangers, as well as artillery and can also make use of horses.&#10;&#10;28mm Miniatures are recommended, and the author uses the wonderful Empress miniatures made for this conflict. Any scale would work with these rules though.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Day of Battle - the Middle Ages Fun, Fast and Furious. Historical Rules for the Medieval Era&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms in Day of Battle are designed to give a game that has the feeling of the period, not just the battle.  Like most published games of the past and present, Day of Battle: the Middle Ages can be played as standalone game where players setup a game, have a great time and then pack up and move on. &#10; To gamers just starting out in the hobby this is great, but it isn&rsquo;t too long before they yearn for a campaign.  In a campaign game you can truly prove who you are and how good you can be.  Ah, &#10;but campaigns can be a black hole.&#10;&#10;The Player as a Character&#10;&#10;Day of Battle attempts to satisfy the desire to play in a campaign but does it in an easy and enjoyable way.  As mentioned earlier, you are a general referred to as a Warlord.  Borrowing from our role-play cousins, your Warlord has a number of skills and attributes that make him who he is on the battlefield.  During the actual battle you acquire honor points whenever you perform actions appropriate to your Warlord.  At the end of the battle, win or lose, you total up your honor points and turn them into skill points.  As these accumulate, you spend them on your Warlords skills and attributes to make him better and more powerful.  Gain enough skill points and you have a chance to climb the social ladder and become a higher-ranking noble.&#10;&#10;A Solo and Multiplayer Game&#10;&#10;Each battle you play with Day of Battle is based on the social rank of your Warlord.  The higher the social rank, the bigger and better the army your Warlord summons.  In a campaign, the better your army, the better your chances of winning.  This campaign system is unique in that it doesn&rsquo;t require a map, an umpire, or even other players.  The fog of war in the game system is so good that you can play a game against yourself and not know which side will win, and if both survive then both will win.  You would truly have to cheat to trick the game.  Mind you, it is always more enjoyable playing with other gamers.  I run a campaign with six different Warlords that I have created and play them randomly against each other.  When first time gamer friends come over to play, I have them play one of my Warlords.  Such games are fast.  Games between new Warlords are over in an hour or so, which allows for multiple games in one sitting.&#10;&#10;Army Creation &amp; Feudalism&#10;&#10;The army creation mechanism is based on a loose interpretation of the history of times but designed to be fast, fun and unpredictable.  A Warlord and army can be created on paper with a deck of playing cards and a handful of six sided dice in 10 minutes.  There is little math involved and unlike most point system games, you have very little control over your army.  The size of your army is based on the social rank and household of your Warlord. The units that arrive at the &ldquo;summons&rdquo; are based loosely on the Domain (army) you are playing and of course a little bit of luck.  You draw playing cards to determine how many army points you have which then determine the number of units that arrive and then roll dice to determine what troop type they are.  You can promote the morale, armor and training of some of your units with the number of promotions available based on your social rank.  With this unknown in mind, retainer units must be chosen wisely &mdash; and then go hire some mercenaries!&#10;&#10;In summary for a new look wargaming the medieval era try Day of Battle.  It will give you an experience you have never had before.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The publisher encourages you to make your own games using the 46 character chips!&#10;&#10;The game includes hex-mapped tiles (akin to Attika). Players draw letter chips from a bag and place them on the tiles.&#10;&#10;The main way to play &quot;Kana Kana&quot; is to place chips on the board, make words and turn them over, and use the characters to make up a territory hunting game!&#10;&#10;Kana Kana is the story of two kingdoms on a small island, Hiragana kingdom and Katakana kingdom. The two kingdoms circumvent each other's interests, and Hiragana and Katakana fight seriously between Jiji and Moji! Use a character chip with hiragana and katakana back to back to create many words and expand your area!

    "Description": "An easy to play fast-paced card game where players discover and collect valuable treasures to gain points.&#10;&#10;But beware any treasures that are CURSED!  They will subtract points from your total score.&#10;&#10;Collect the Loot Cards and pass the Cursed Cards on to other players and win!&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;2 players: 20 rounds, keep all cards in game, reshuffle Discovery Cards when all are used.&#10;3 players: 13 rounds, remove 1 standard Loot card, reshuffle Discovery Cards when all used.&#10;4 players: 10 rounds, keep all cards in game, reshuffle Discovery Cards if needed.&#10; Items needed to play not included: pencil and paper to keep track of player scores.&#10;&#10;Getting Started: Prepare Loot and Color Card Decks based on number of players. Keep cards types separate and shuffle each deck thoroughly.&#10; Stack the Loot and Discovery Decks in center of play area next to each other and within easy reach of all players.&#10; Being Play: The youngest player starts by drawing three cards from the Loot Deck and places them face up on the table in front of them. Then, going clockwise around the table, each player also draws three Loot Cards and places them face up in front of them on the table.  This is done so everyone can see who drew what from the Loot Deck.&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts the Game Round by turning over one Discovery Card and placing it face up on the table next to the Discovery Deck.&#10; Each player must then stash into their personal stash pile one Loot Card that color code matches the Discovery Card that was overturned.&#10; If a player does not have a Loot Card that color matches the Discovery Card displayed, they must discard the lowest point rated card in their hand into the stash pile.&#10; &#10;            Cursed Loot Cards are also color coded Blue, Yellow, Green, and Wild, and must be discarded if that is the &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;only card in the player&rsquo;s hand that matches the displayed Discovery Card.  Cursed Loot will subtract points!&#10; Once each player has stashed one of their loot cards into their own stash pile (this is how you gain or lose points), they then choose one card from their hand to pass to the person of their left. Players cannot pass in the same round a card that was given them by another player in that same round.&#10;&#10;Once each player has stashed one card and passed one card, they should have one card left on display.  They then draw two more cards from the top of the Loot Deck.&#10; Once each players again has three cards on display the current game round ends and the next round begins with a new Discovery Card being overturned.&#10;&#10;Wild Cards: Any Loot card can be stashed when the Wild Discovery Card is displayed, unless a player is holding the Cursed Wild Card, which must then always be stashed.  It is possible for the Cursed Wild Card to be in game play until the last round &mdash; players beware!&#10;&#10;Ending A Game:  When no more cards can be drawn each player should have one card left before them. That last card is added to their stash pile. If their last Loot Card color matches the last Discovery Card players can add an extra 50 bonus points to their total score.&#10; Scoring: Each player adds up their total Loot Points and the end game bonus point if it applies, then subtracts any Cursed Loot Points to get their total score.  High Score Wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

And don't forget the wz. 34 armored car...&#10;&#10;All the French tanks and arms are covered, from the Hotchkiss H35 cavalry tank, to the Char D1, Char 2C, and Char B1 bis, and of course the ubiquitous Renault FT.&#10;&#10;The field guns of the opening period are covered, from the short barrel infantry support guns like the LeIG 18 to the 76mm Soviet regimental gun. larger calibers include the Polish Wz.36 (a copy of the Bofors 37mm), the German 5cm PaK 36, British 2-pdr, and the French 75mm M1897 and 47mm APX field guns.&#10;&#10;Cavalry are of course covered, with universal cavalry units available.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with five tank cards on stands that move over this landscape. The tanks are differentiated by range and damage ability, but not firepower - all tanks roll a six-sided die when shooting and if the number rolled exceeds the target's damage value, it is destroyed. If any tank moves onto the opposing HQ space, the game is over and that side wins the game immediately.&#10;&#10;The game has some unique interpretations of &quot;realism&quot; in its rules. For example, each tank MUST move one space each turn, regardless of the situation on the board. Also, damage in a given turn is cumulative, so two (or three, or four) tanks can combine their damage to destroy a single vehicle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The War in Vietnam&#10;&#10;The War in Vietnam is a map campaign representing the entire war at a strategic scale. These rules focus on quick and easy play, and are designed for 2 players, or solo play.&#10;&#10;Forces on the map are considered to be unspecified until they are engaged in combat, at which point both players secretly choose the forces they wish to take, and then compare their results and roll off to inflict casualties depending on the types of units chosen. For example the US player might choose a Long Range Recon Patrol, who specialize in keeping a low profile and gathering intelligence, but can engage enemy forces if they desire. Meanwhile the Vietcong player has chosen Artillery. The players roll off and the LRRPs win the roll, spotting the artillery and forcing them to become &quot;locked&quot; as artillery so that other forces can engage them this turn and know what they're dealing with. The LRRPs can also choose to engage directly, potentially inflicting casualties on the artillery, but risk taking casualties if they do.&#10;&#10;Each faction has 11 different types of forces to choose from, and the combinations chosen have different outcomes, making for 121 different types of battle. Artillery vs Armor, VC Screening Forces vs US Marines, Air Strikes vs Civilians, just a few examples.&#10;&#10;Both factions track casualties and morale as a whole, and depending on their total casualties, their war support and morale will be effected. For example, too many US casualties will result in war support dropping and less troops will be deployed each turn. Rules for capturing cities are included, and they also have an effect on morale and war support.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one faction takes over 60,000 casualties, or if the Vietcong hold Saigon for 4 turns in a row.&#10;A printable color map with hexes is provided, 9 A4 sheets in size (3 X 3), but the author recommends that you get a large color map printed and laminated at your local print shop.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Shipyard - WW2 Ship Design &amp; Combat&#10;&#10;A simple and effective ship design system is coupled with a more granular combat system, allowing you to quickly build a fleet before a game, then test it out in battle.&#10;&#10;Shipyard is designed for miniatures of around 1/3000 scale, although 1/1200 would work just as well. &#10;The game is designed for 2 or more players, on a table roughly 6' x 4' in size. &#10;An average game takes around 2 hours, including the time spent designing your ships (around 10 minutes to half an hour for designing, depending on the size of the game).&#10;&#10;Ship Building:&#10;&#10;Shipyard allows you to build ships of all sizes, from motor torpedo boats, up to aircraft carriers and super battleships. Each basic hull has a number of available &quot;space&quot; points, which can be spent on weapons, sensors, armor, or extras like aircraft, catapults and smoke generators.&#10;&#10;Combat:&#10;&#10;Shipyard has a unique combat system, aimed at simplicity and a dose of realism. Fog of war and communication are represented: Ships start the game inactive, steaming forwards until they detect the enemy. Once they become active, they can send messages and orders to other ships, and begin to move and attack as they wish. Rules for Gunnery, Torpedoes, Air attacks and defense, submarines, depth charges, evasive action and much more are provided, allowing for a fun yet fairly accurate rendition of WW2 naval combat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
