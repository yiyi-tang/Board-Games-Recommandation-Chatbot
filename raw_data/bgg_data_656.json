However, for each research role you may only count 1 Utopian planet this way.  For example, if you have 1 Advanced planet and 2 Utopian planets in your Empire, then you could choose Advanced technology cards from level 1 or 2 (but not level 3).  You could not choose any Metallic or Fertile technology cards unless you also have planets of those types in your Empire.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User summary:&#10;&#10;Theme - A fortune telling game based on cards and pendulum. Played solo or between two players with roles of questioner (later on just Q) and interpreter (N). The interpreter leads the game and the questioner is the one receiving information about his/her home, work, personality, love, future and past.&#10;&#10;Game-play - The game-play is divided into two phases 1) the card turning and 2) the pendulum swinging.&#10;&#10;1) The card turning phase starts by picking up the proper coloured scarabs to the game board; the hair, eyes and favourite colour of the Q. The Q shuffles the purple 54 card deck and hands it over to N. N divides the deck into 3 separate decks of 18, 9 and 27 cards. The cards are dealt on the game board in the order 18, 27 and 9. The 18 cards are dealt on locations shown at the front page of the rule leaflet. The cards have 6 words in them and one of those is picked depending which is forming a pyramid with the game board (the black half of the pyramid on the left side of the card and the white half of the pyramid on the game board). While the cards are dealt, the N questions the Q if the word on the cards have any special meaning. The forming words are related to either home (1st vertical row), work (2nd), personality (3rd), love (4th), future (5th) or past (6th), depending which vertical row the cards are placed to. The 27 cards are then dealt on the game board (some restrictions apply, see the rule leaflet). Then the deck of 9 cards is used as a key to whole interpretation. At last the rest cards of the deck of 27 are used to check if something is being dominant on some areas of the Q's life. The final interpretations varies each playing time.&#10;&#10;2) The pendulum swinging phase starts by placing the four decks of 28 cards onto the game board. The decks are placed on lower part of the game board, around the pyramid (letter A shown on the first page of the rule leaflet). The decks represents the areas of home, work, personality and love. The players decide one of the four categories and Q decides a question he/she wants to get answered related to that category. The transparent pyramid is placed on the game board and the pendulum is used for random number selection. There is numbers of 1-28 around the pyramid on the game board and the random pendulum swing decides the number of the chosen card. The N reads the text on the proper card to the Q. Same is repeated to other categories and questions.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game - Interpreting the message gotten with cards and pendulum and gaining more self-consciousness.&#10;&#10;The game includes:&#10;&#10;1 game board&#10;1 transparent pyramid&#10;1 pendulum&#10;4 decks of cards (28 cards each)&#10;1 purple deck of cards (54 cards)&#10;2 bags including different coloured scarab buttons&#10;1 rule leaflet (4 pages)&#10;&#10;From Finnish intro on the rule leaflet:&#10;&#10;&quot;Karnak on kiehtovan j&auml;nnitt&auml;v&auml; ennustuspeli, jota voi pelata yksin tai yhdess&auml;. Se perustuu er&auml;isiin muinaisegyptil&auml;isiin mysteereihin ja kulttuuriperinteisiin. Koska peli on tunnettujen astrologian ja horoskooppien asiantuntijoiden suunnittelema, pelaajat voivat sen avulla my&ouml;s kehitt&auml;&auml; omaa kuudetta aistiaan ja salattuja kykyj&auml;&auml;n.

The 3rd Belorussian Front under command of Cherniakhovsky launches an attack into the northeast of East Prussia while the 2nd Belorussian Front, commanded by Rokossovsky, one day later starts an attack from the south east. However, Army Group Mitte, under the command of Reinhardt, puts up an astonishing defence desperatly pushing the Soviets back.&#10;The time is however on the Soviet side and when the defence finally crumbles there is nothing left to withstand the Soviet troops to ravage the country.&#10;&#10;K&ouml;nigsberg &acute;45 is taught in 30 minutes and easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players. It is built around the same system of rules that shaped Stargard Solstice, K&#195;&#182;nigsberg '45 and Army Group Narwa and utilizes a Command chit-pull system to activate HQ, which in turn allow their controlled combat units to move and attack.&#10;Each turn is two days and the game has 10 turns.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     50 x 70cm-size map&#10;     280 die-cut counters&#10;     1 six-sided die&#10;     Rules&#10;     Box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This is the dutch version of SantaClaus and is celebrated on december 5th each year.&#10;&#10;In The Steambootgame players use there playingfigure to collect presents from the hold of the ship on the gameboard. They do no know the value of the present they took.Via stairs and rooms of 3 different colors they attempt to bring them to the deck, to secure them. To do so, they throw a dice with the 3 different colors on it. A player must stop in a room of that color. When 2 players are in the same room, they have to switch presents. Two special actions which are in some rooms give players the chance to look at another players present, or his own, or to catch up with another player who is at max two stories higher in the ship. If all presents are on the deck, the player with the highest value of presents wins the game!&#10;&#10;In The Giftgame players buy a few small presents upfront. They agree on the amount of money to be spent. You can also use the chips in the game and play for points.In this game also the colordice is used to decide to what field on the gameboard the player moves his playingfigure to. On each field is a different symbol, each giving a different action. The possible actions are: Take a present, switch presents and open them up, give present away to the player with the fewest presents, all presents in front of the players are passed to your neighbour in a clockwise fasion. and finally open up a present. When there are no more presents in the pile, the game ends. When playing with chips in stead of real presents, the game ends as soon as the last chip is taken from the supply. The player with the most points wins!~&#10;&#10;The Memoryvariant is just another memory: There are 2 pairs of 12 different colored-and-valued chips. Turn them up-side-down so the sack is showing, shuffle them, and try to find the matching pairs as in regular memory. The player witrh the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;",

There are six different animals - donkey, frog, rooster, cat, cow and pig - on the cards and there are one, two or three of them on each card.   The cards are dealt, in his turn the player turns the top card of his stack and places in front of him.&#10;&#10;If somebody sees a series - i.e. one, two and three animals of same type on one card - it makes the noise of this animal and gets all the played cards. Player who calls 4 times first is the winner. Whomever calls wrong must give one card to other players as a penalty. Who has no cards left is eliminated.&#10;&#10;",

If a second hint is needed he moves up 3 places.  After a third hint he can move up 2 places.  But if passes after the 3 hint he has to move back 1 place.  When he guessed wrong he has to move back 2 spaces.  The game ends when a player gets at the top of the holy points.&#10;&#10;The game contains:&#10;- A board&#10;- Pawns&#10;- 300 playing cards&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A bi-collaborative game where two teams of gamers group together to try to accomplish game objectives and stay alive for the duration of this game set in downtown Milwaukee, WI USA. The game will involve dice-based combat, but will have multiple paths to victory for both the monsters and the humans, both fighting for different things.&#10;&#10;One group will consist of six monsters: a cow; a crayfish; an asian carp; a gorilla; a bluegill; and two deep-tunnel sewer rats. The other group will consist of humans, plus humans with functions like workmen, fire fighters, police, nat'l guard, and some super-humans like Lara Croft and ninjas might appear during gameplay.&#10;&#10;The game is driven foremost by the HO scale minis used in the game, and the plastic monsters. The toy value is what this &Uuml;ber-Ameritrash game is about.There will be multiple rule sets developed. Really, this game started with the toys, and a desire to improve an old game or two, while thematically morphing it into a game which featured downtown Milwaukee, WI USA.&#10;&#10;At this point it's a prototype. The game is a homage to The Creature That Ate Sheboygan, borrows from Heorscape and Monsters Menace America, requires some D&amp;D features like THACO, and has lots of other options for tweaks and alt games.&#10;&#10;The &quot;ha ha&quot; is deliberate in the name because of the twisted humor woven into the fabric of the game. The &quot;bronze fonz&quot; is on the map, and either side will get a bonus for either destroying it or simply rubbing it for good luck. Names for the creatures also have built-in humor:&#10;&#10;Vince Gill: the bluegill who is also a Packer fan, but hates Milwaukeeans because of their fascination with the Friday Fish Fry. His desire is to crush restaurants which serve fish.&#10;&#10;Son of Samson: the undead giant son of the most famous ex-resident of the Milwaukee Zoo, whose goal is to get to the top  of the Firstar/U.S. Bank tower and fling poo.&#10;&#10;Carpie Diem: an asian carp, who seized headlines recently as the no.1 environmental enemy to Lake Michigan. He can jump across city blocks and smash things under his weight. Very easily distracted by the Ladybug Club, thinking they are asian lady beetles.&#10;&#10;Holey Cow: a sympathizer with O'Leary's Chicago firestarter, this copycow is a Cubs fan and happens to breathe methane gas fires from her four stomachs, and out her nostrils. She's also capable of making massive cowpies which block city streets.&#10;&#10;'Hood Ratz: a pair of residents from our failed Deep Tunnel system, these rodents are skaven mad *wink* and capable of chewing through even the five foot thick walls of the Fed Bldg. They're also attracted to hip-hop music.&#10;&#10;Rebecca the Boiling Crayfish: (no relation to our new Lt. Governor of WI) she's looking for her crawdaddy in one of the restaurants that serve her brethren. The humans are in hot water this time.&#10;&#10;The game narrative is such that an event has taken place that, combined with the deep tunnel sewer failure, has caused six local creatures to grow in size and terrorize Brewtown.&#10;&#10;The Federal Bldg. is within the now quarantined section of Brewtown, and the goals of the monsters are many, but they have to achieve them before they are killed or the feds are able to call in the antidote. Meanwhile, the humans are to stay alive and kill monsters,while protecting buildings from fires, repairing blocked roads, and achieving other goals along the way.&#10;&#10;There are several groups of humans:&#10;&#10;Firefighters: complete with a new ladder truck, these six individuals have axes and hoses in hand *wink* to face any challenge.&#10;&#10;Police: one car (Milwaukee police are grossly underfunded) and a handful of officers help with attacks, rescue civilians, and keep the peace among the surviving humans.&#10;&#10;National Guard: these weekend warriors with five tanks were setting up for maneuvers downtown, ending in at the Veterans Memorial nearby when this hit. They've not got much live ammo with them for this reason, but they have plenty of rubber bullets of all sizes-and they look scary as hell. The can fly in one helicopter from General Mitchell Airport in a couple of rounds, and it will have the firepower they need, but the rest of the military is on furlough.&#10;&#10;Municipal Construction: several men on a job site with a huge dump truck, a CAT backhoe, and two CAT scoopshovels. They're tough enough to fight the monsters on their own with their equipment and they're experts at &quot;catcalls&quot;.&#10;&#10;Waste Management: one unmanned truck full of Milwaukee's finest refuse, abandoned.&#10;&#10;Superhumans: activated at different times in the game when humans accomplish certain goals: a Lara Croft lookalike, with the guns to prove it; a ninja; two advanced swordplay students from the T'ai Chi Ch'uan center of Milwakee, and their leader Mike. Mike's wearing a Yoda costume he found at the Milwaukee Film office, and his mastery of push hands gives him the equivalent of the &quot;force push&quot;. He hopes the creatures watched the trilogy, and fear him...&#10;&#10;The two collaborative groups struggle until the game ends for a variety of reasons. There are several paths of victory for either team.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A 2 player board game.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is to find as many combinations as it&rsquo;s possible which sum is exactly 10. Every combination has to consist of exactly three digits situated on three neighbouring areas connected with edges or with corners. Each area can only be used once in a combination.&#10;&#10;Players take turns finding such combinations. Upon finding one the active player may place his pawn on the board on the first or the third digit of the desired combination (never second). On any one area can only be placed one pawn. Therefore such area can be part of combination, but cannot be chosen to place a pawn on it.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who has found more combinations (indicated by the number of pawns on the board). If both players used the same number of pawns the winner is the player who has situated his pawns on areas which digits sum up to a higher number.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From back of book:&#10;&#10;TechCommander is a fast paced sci-fi action tactical game that puts you in the command chair of a hi tech operations center leading an elite squad on dangerous missions!  TechCommander combines miniature gaming with the sci-fi action seen in first person shooters and sci-fi real time strategy video games. The game has powerful Mechanized Strike Vehicle units (called MSV&rsquo;s for short) that can destroy targets in seconds, but also has the ultimate in elite power armor infantry units.  These units are based on a possible progression of future soldier programs in development in the modern day, and are  equipped with technology to keep them agile, powerful and somewhat safe from the monster MSV&rsquo;s roaming the landscape. The infantry are jump jet equipped, and in many cases, running a visibility and sensor masking stealth suit. Many also have capacitance based shield meaning if you do not fully eliminate them, they will recharge!  The MSV may be powerful, but left unguarded, it is no match for a crack squad of  USSC Force Recon Marines!  TechCommander MSVs are fairly large miniatures, standing anywhere from four inches to a foot high. They use a peg-together system so that swapping out weapons and gear for a battle that requires a custom load out is easy!&#10;&#10;",

They may also capture an enemy piece (or a series of them) by jumping over it to a vacant junction beyond.&#10;&#10;Once across the river a Soldier may move two squares or capture pieces two squares ahead or to the side, or capture a piece an adjacent piece and land two squares past it.&#10;&#10;When a Soldier reaches the far side it promotes to an Elephant (the name source).  &#10; Elephants may move to any vacant junction (since Xiangqi is played on the points, not sqaures) vertically or horizontally. They capture by jumping over an enemy piece, and can continue to any empty square beyond the capture.&#10;&#10;&quot;They may promote to King and win the game if on the Throne point in the center of the opposing fortress, but that move counts as a non-capturing move, and can not be made when there is a capture available.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each time a beast dies, the player can collect the weapon that the beast had in it's lair. The weapons are humorous and include such things as a double barreled bazooka, a rocket sword, and a tank.&#10;&#10;The combat system is very simple. Both the player and the beast have a starting health which is decreased by modified die roll. Depending on your weapon and the beast's strength the damage may be a die roll + 2, a combination of four dice rolled together, or similar modifiers. Each lair and weapon has it's own modifier. Assuming that you survive combat, you're health is automatically reset for the next cave.&#10;&#10;Each beast is more difficult to kill than the last (culminating with the dragon in the 7th lair), but each new weapon is more powerful so the player's combat ability increases with the game's difficulty.

    "Description": "Wicked Wickets is a cricket based table game suitable for the whole family, cricketers and non-cricketers alike, and can accommodate anything from two to twenty-two players. The game involves selection, bowling, batting, and active fielding, allowing for short over fast action games through to the complex realms of strategy found in test play. Although, like with cricket itself, the basics are simple and easily learnt, it will inevitably take a lifetime to master.&#10;&#10;No prior knowledge of cricket is needed to play the game which is suitable for the whole family and up to 22 players. In essence the side that scores the most &quot;runs&quot; wins, though selecting the right players, the order they play, and where they are positioned all affect the outcome of the game. The basics of Wicked Wickets are really quite simple; the bowler throws the ball, in this case the red ball shaped die, and the batsman &quot;hits&quot; it by throwing the buff bat-shaped die. Adding the scores together shows how far the ball goes using the long flight measure. If the batsman's score is higher than the bowlers, the ball &quot;flies&quot; in the air; if the bowler's score is higher than the batsman's, then it is struck along the ground. The yellow counter and dice are used to show which direction the ball goes. The short pace measure is simply used to measure the distance players move and the green die is mostly used for fielding. The game cards give the individual abilities of the players affecting how and where they are used. However, as with most games there is often more to it than first meets the eye. --From the publisher&#10;&#10;Official website: http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/&#10;&#10;",

Players are dealt a hand of 9 cards.

Shuffle the deck of cards and put three cards on these locations.  Then you put a pigeon figure on the roof in one of the three slots above a card.

But if he turns the same card  that is under the pigeon then the player has to make the sound of a pigeon and take the pigeon figure from the roof to prevent the witch from coming down.  At the same time each other player may try to take the hansel figure.  The first person who does this gets the first card of the open pile, and all the cards go to a discard pile.  So the player who turned the cards lost all his cards (except maybe one).  The witch is then put in a slot on the roof again.&#10;&#10;A player that took Hansel by mistake has to give in a card he won in a previous round.&#10;&#10;When the drawing deck is empty the game stops.

This is so as to combine the forced progression of diagonal checkers with the richness of the orthogonal game.&#10;&#10;Object: Capture all your opponent's pieces (&quot;Checkers&quot; or &quot;Kings&quot;) by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves.&#10;&#10;Checkers can move diagonally forward, by sliding to an adjacent empty square or by jumping either left, right, or forward over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it, but you may not jump diagonally. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible, taking the maximum number of pieces.&#10;&#10;The King is a long range piece and can slide diagonally in any direction or jump left, right, up or down over any opponent piece to any free square. When your Checker stops on the other end of the board, it becomes a King and can then also move backwards. If it merely visits a promotion square during a series capture moves, then it does not promote.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Hopperdame website ( http://mlwi.magix.net/bg/hopperdame.htm )&#10;&#10;HopperDame (or simply Hoppers) is a new invention. In HopperDame with promotion rule you win by capturing all the opponent's pieces. Pieces move forwards and sideways, orthogonally or diagonally, by shifting to an adjacent square, or by jumping over an adjacent friendly piece (also termed 'hopper'). Jumps must only occur over a piece of the same colour. It's not allowable to step or jump backwards. The exception to this is the &quot;king&quot;, which can jump over any piece, and step in all directions.&#10;&#10;To promote to king one must conquer the &quot;castles&quot;, that is, the corner squares behind the enemy position, by holding both these positions with a piece, so called &quot;double-promotion&quot;. If a piece steps or jumps into the enemy corner then it is promoted to king only if the other enemy corner is already occupied by a friendly piece. Also, a piece which steps into the corner square may later be promoted if the other corner has subsequently become occupied by a friendly piece. The promotion is then done by dropping the piece on the same square. But this costs a move.&#10;&#10;HopperDame employs the rule of exchange-capture: the counter jumps over a friendly counter. If the square where it lands is occupied by an enemy counter, then this is captured. It is only when leaping that the counter can make captures. A leaping counter may continue to leap over friendly counters until there are no more to leap over or the player decides to stop. It's not allowable to jump back to the square you just came from.&#10;&#10;Note that capture is only made when jumping. Thus, a single piece cannot make a capture by itself. The exception to this is the king, which has an additional capture method: it can capture an adjacent enemy piece directly, like a king in chess.&#10;&#10;",

Each square has a strength value depending of the type of terrain represented in it. For example, in squares representing plains, the cavalry unit are strongest, but it is rather different for the cities and wooded terrain types. Each army contains artillery, cavalry, infantry and guard units. The artillery units must be used by infantry or guard units, never alone. The objectives include the destruction of the opponent's army, eliminating the opponent's general or capturing cities.&#10;&#10;",

The game currently features:&#10;&#10;20 characters cards (5 heroes, 5 villains, 5 vigilantes, and support characters - Police Lieutenant, Police Squad, Mobster, Gangsters, and Street Punks)&#10;12 location cards&#10;markers&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by controlling a majority of the locations in play. Each player takes control of either the Heroes or the Villains. There are also five independent vigilantes that can be persuaded to join either team over time. The Mob is an extra resource for the Villains that can be driven out of the picture by the Heroes, and the cops swing with City Hall. If City Hall falls under the sway of evil, corruption runs rampant, and the police will actively help the Villains. Clean up City Hall, and the police become the force for Good they're supposed to be.&#10;&#10;The fate of The City is in your hands!&#10;&#10;&#10;                        &#10;                    &#10;                &#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;HVV is now available as a free PNP edition.&#10;&#10;",
