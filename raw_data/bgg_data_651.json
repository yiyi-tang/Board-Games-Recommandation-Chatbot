    "Description": "Farm Cards is a fast-paced game where players assume the roles of farmers, try to harvest the most balanced crops they can, and earn the most money at the Farmer&rsquo;s Market. Each player is in direct competition with the others and tries to sabotage the others&rsquo; fields by dumping garbage on their land! Don&rsquo;t expect a fellow farmer to be kind, his only goal is to win!&#10;&#10;This is a print and play game. There are 108 custom cards depicting plots of land with seeds and values; and seeds with values. The game may also be played with 2 standard 52 card decks + 4 jokers.&#10;&#10;Players take turns working with the &quot;junked-up land&quot; passed to them by their competitors and attempt to achieve the highest score through two mechanics.&#10;1- A standard point mechanic through plot and seed values (card face-value).&#10;2- A second scale representing pH balance that can either be positive, negative, or balanced (0). This is achieved through the use of card suits (vegetables, fruits, and grains with the custom cards - 8 in total; Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds with standard American playing cards - 4 in total).&#10;&#10;The game is currently undergoing playtesting and review.&#10;&#10;",

The cardboard playing board is about 6&quot; x 6&quot;, the spinner is 1 3/4&quot; across, and each little pawn is 1/2&quot; x 1/2&quot;. There is no date but it's probably 1950s.&#10;&#10;",

The game itself is a print and play type, and available for free download.&#10;&#10;From the Introduction in the basic rules:&#10;Starship Marine is a set of science fiction wargame rules, designed for use with toy soldiers. The basic idea is that there is a battle to control and capture a starship by a boarding party moving down the corridors and rooms of the ship. One side controls the attackers, who are mostly composed of the eponymous 'Starship Marines', and the defenders, usually less well armed crewmen, with perhaps a smattering of Marines to stiffen the defense. The deck plans can either be drawn out or built in 3D, depending on your preferences and time available. The scale of toy soldier is 25mm or 1/72, and any make of figures can be used [...]&#10;&#10;The minimum you need are a few toy soldiers, some dice, a large sheet of paper with a deck plan on it, and the rules. A typical small game takes about a hour or so (longer if you like arguing about rules). The largest game we know of, to date, involved some 60 people, hundreds of toy soldiers, and many very very big sheets of paper.[...]&#10;&#10;",

Nevertheless, the Swedes are nothing if not resilient and under one of Gustav's outstanding lieutenants, Johann Baner, they have reconstituted their army and gone back on the offensive.&#10;&#10;&quot;John George, Elector of Saxony, has changed sides once again and now marches with the Imperial forces of Melchior Hatzfelt. With a combined army of 20,000 men the two outnumber the Swedes, and Baner has fallen back.&#10;&#10;&quot;Having seemingly disposed of the Swedish threat the Imperials have slackened their pursuit. Whereupon Baner has immediately turned on them, cutting off the joint army from the remaining Imperial troops in the neighborhood, and preparing to attack them near the small town of Wittstock on the river Dosse.&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;Scenario comes with deployment information, army lists, orders of battle, etc.&#10;&#10;Scenario appears in Wargames Illustrated #186 (March 2003)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This 4-dimensional chess variant, using the standard 16 chesspieces and pawns, is played on a 4x4x4x4 board. (A printable 2D version of the board is provided, with coordinate numbers in each square.) This printable gameboard is laid out as a 4x4 arrangement of 16 &quot;levels&quot;, each level being a 4x4 2D chessboard. Alternatively, 4 3D 4x4x4 gameboards set up in a row are usable. The game is available on Zillions, in a version by L Lynn Smith.&#10;&#10;Piece moves are translated as directly as possible from 2D to 4D, with some adaptations for play balance. So a rook now can move not only north-south and east-west, but up-down and side to side, too, for a maximum of 8 possible directions. Bishops move diagonally within each level, and may also move diagonally from level to level, which simplifies the move somewhat, changing the bishop from a fully 4D piece to one that is 2D+2D. This change makes the game much easier to play.&#10;&#10;The knight, on the other hand, rivals the queen in power, because it is the only piece in chess that already moves in 2 dimensions. On a 4x4x4x4 board, it can reach up to 2 dozen spots. The queen combines the moves of rook and bishop, and the king is a one-square queen in movement.&#10;&#10;Pawns are the most changed, moving 1 square &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;sideways&quot; - 6 locations in all, and capturing as it moves. This allows 2 pawns to support each other, a useful feature on &#10;a 4D board.&#10;&#10;The game is won by checkmate, which with the held king rule, can be achieved in the standard fashion, or it can be forced on a bare king by a king and 2 major pieces, from any legal positions on the board. The held king rule allows a king moving onto the other king's current &quot;level&quot; to pin the enemy king in that level. This solves a major problem in higher dimensional chess, that of mating the opponent on a 4D board, which has so many ways to escape.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Introduction&#10;&#10;&quot;One of the regular debates that my wargaming colleagues and I seem to have is that of the role assumed by players during a wargame, and hence the level of detail that should be represented. Are we playing ships captains or fleet admirals? In general naval wargamers tend to assume the role of admirals whilst demanding a level of detail more appropriate to a 'game of captains.' For most periods this isn't too much of a problem as the numbers of ships tends to be relatively small, and there are fleet level rules with appropriate levels of abstraction for most periods. However, ancient naval warfare seems to be one period where all available rules operate at the ship level. Obviously this makes battles such as Salamis, with hundreds of ships involved, difficult to handle. I wanted a set of rules that could be used to recreate these enormous battles whilst placing the placing the players truly in the roles of admirals and squadron commanders. At this level the fate of the individual ships, other than those on which the commanders themselves are embarked, is unimportant. Hence, &quot;Greek Fire and Roman Fury&quot; was born.&#10;&#10;&quot;The basis for these rules is a theory that the naval battles of antiquity were fought in a style that was essentially similar to typical land actions. Therefore, in these rules, the respective fleets are represented by squadrons rather than individual ships, which are maneuvered around the 'battlefield' in a similar manner to armies. After a few false starts I decided to use the ever popular and quite robust American Civil War Fire and Fury as the basis for the system, hence the name I finally selected for this article.&quot;&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;This miniatures rules set comes with information on what sorts of figures to use, and explains fleet composition, ship data (for the various sorts of ships that appear in the game), formations, sequence of play, morale, and a small number of charts&#10;&#10;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #187 (April 2003)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Introduction&#10;&#10;&quot;Once Hannibal had been defeated at Zama in 202 BC, Rome was clear to concentrate on securing and expanding its eastern frontier beyond the Adriatic. The resources required for the Second Punic War had previously forced the Romans to conclude a compromise with peace with Philip V of Macedon, but with the Carthaginian threat removed, it was payback time.&#10;&#10;&quot;The neutral states of Rhodes and Pergamum provided an excuse for war, appealing to Rome for aid against Macedonian aggression, and the legions marched  towards Greece. Philip blocked the passes onto the peninsula at Epirus, but a consul named Titus Quincticus Flaminius managed to get a small force around the Macedonian flank. Philip, convinced that the whole Roman army was about to descend upon him, pulled back into Thessaly.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Romans consolidated their hold on Epirus and voted Flaminius in for another term as consul and therefore military leader. After some intense diplomacy to establish which of the less dominant, minor powers of the region were allied to whom, Flaminius and Philip met at Cynoscephalae, named from the Greek for 'dog's head' after the name of a nearby ridge.&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;Subtitled The Battle of Cynoscephalae 197 BC, this is a scenario for the Vis Bellica miniature wargame system. Scenario includes orders of battle for both sides, features of the battlefield, historical information about the battle, army sheeets for all of the forces, initial deployment, and defeat condition.&#10;&#10;Scenario appears in Wargames Illustrated #187 (April 2003)&#10;&#10;",

Many variants (including a very natural 3-dimensional version) are possible.&#10;&#10;It is based on the fact that in politics, or committees with sub-committees, a minority of people in critical places may nonetheless  carry a voting motion. This has long been felt as a weird situation by the game inventor (Bill Taylor), who has devised this family of games to illustrate this phenomenon.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;The board is initially empty. The first player places a stone on any cell, then players take turns placing two pieces per turn on empty cells.&#10;&#10;A majority of stones in a line wins that line.&#10;A majority of parallel lines in a direction wins that direction.&#10;A majority of directions wins the game.&#10;&#10;The board has a few unplayable cells, to guarantee that every line has an odd number of playable cells, so that ties are impossible at all levels.&#10;&#10;Source: Gamerz.net help file by Bill Taylor&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net Real time or turn based,against humans or robot players&#10;     Gamerz.net Turn-based&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As would befit your ration pack if you were about to embark on one of the coldest and most bitter fights of the war, after 5 long years of weary battles, we have packed this expansion with every thing you could ever need to combat in a snow-covered environment.&#10;&#10;But judge for yourself, soldier! Inside this pack you will find:&#10;- 88 double-sided Winter tiles, 28 Special Unit badges, 20 round markers and 16 obstacles&#10;- 20 Winter Combat cards, similar in concept to the Urban Combat cards introduced in Memoir '44: Sword of Stalingrad&#10;- 80 new Command cards, designed specifically for Breakthrough battles&#10;- New Winter Combat rules&#10;- New Troops, including the all new Tank Destroyer and Heavy Anti-Tank Gun units and Late War model versions of an Anti-Tank Gun, Mortar and Machine Gun&#10;&#10;These will all be critical to fighting (and winning!) the ten scenarios this booklet contains, all focused on those crucial 2 weeks of Christmas 1944 in the Ardennes. The first six scenarios included are all standard scenarios, playable with a single base game and this expansion alone (though a Memoir '44: Winter/Desert Board Map will add a nice cosmetic touch to your battlefield). The four scenarios that follow are gigantic Breakthrough renditions of the Battle of the Bulge. These will require a single copy of the already released Memoir '44: Eastern Front expansion, and the Memoir '44: Breakthrough maps, in addition to the aforementionned expansion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Introduction&#10;&#10;&quot;Last year I promised to present for discussion a set of rules covering the Armada period of naval warfare. Here are those rules, or rather a fast play version of the Channel Wargames Group's current set.&#10;&#10;&quot;The philosophy behind them is both to make an attempt to make a set of rules that give a good flavour of the period and the methods of fighting with ships current at that time. And to make the games played with them as enjoyable as is possible. Because of this things such as gunnery have been simplified as much as possible.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ships gunnery at the time of the Armada was a thing in a state of flux. It is as well to contemplate, that ships carried many different types of ordinance, all intermingled together on the same deck. The logistics of serving such a varied armament in a rapid manner was beyond the capabilities of the time, and I would hazard a guess beyond us today as well. Most authorities give a maximum rate of fire for the guns of the Spaniards as once, yes once, a day. Small pieces and hand held weapons were obviously much quicker to reload. Even the English rate of fire is said to have been at best once an hour. If this difference had been used in the rules the Spanish player's would be sitting on their for much of the game, and the English for quite long periods. The solution to this problem can be read in the rules themselves...&quot;&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;Rules set covers scale, speed of units, sailing rules, handling classes, wind effects, firing, ranges, firing charts, special effects table (effectively a sort of critical hit table), putting out fires, effects of bowing on hull factors, boarding, morale, special rules for galleys, a ship list, and a brief bibliography. Game requires models (1/600 preferred for ease of scratch building), and two types of dice (d6 &amp; d20).&#10;&#10;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #178 (July 2002)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Russian card game of attacking and getting rid of all cards. Originally a game for two, three or four players, it's mostly known today in an adapted version for two players brought into England by the Mathematics professor A.S. Besikovitch, and later included in David Parlett's Oxford Guide to Card Games. This version is played with exposed cards and symmetrical hands, giving it a strong strategic flavour.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the (Besikovitch) game each player chooses two sets without overlapping with the other player, typically in a 32-card deck, out of which one is their own trump. Cards are dealt for the first player, who keeps the cards of their both sets; the second player gets exactly the same cards in the other sets and both their hands are filled up with the rest of the cards. As an example: a player who's chosen spades and clubs with spades as trumps keeps the cards in both sets and gives all their red cards together with the undealt cards to the other player, who then selects the analog cards to the first player's in the red sets with hearts as trumps, gives the rest of the red cards back to the first player and finally keeps all the remaining black cards. Both hands are symmetrical, and play can start.&#10;&#10;From now on each turn a player lays a card in a pile between both players; before the next player can play out a card of their choice they must throw one that is superior in value to the top card in the pile or a trump. If the player can't or doesn't want to do so they must take the whole pile and forfeit the turn. So, each player throws two cards in a row: one following the previous card, and one to be followed by the opponent. The first player to get rid of all cards in their hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

You need 1 set of Nestortiles.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses 5 colours and takes the corresponding tiles.&#10;One player begins by placing a tile valued 1 on to the table. Then the players continue alternately.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player puts 1 to 3 (dependent on the move type) tiles onto the table. There are 6 possibilities to extend the building:&#10;&#10;(Floor tiles are tiles directly on the table, wall tiles are vertical tiles and top tiles are horizontal tiles not touching the table)&#10;&#10;&#10;    Floor - A tile directly on the table touching at least one other tile.&#10;    Corner Wall - Two adjacent vertical tiles with an inbetween angle of 90&deg;, both touching a floor tile.&#10;    Single Wall - A vertical tile touching at least one other wall tile. It also has to touch a floor or top tile.&#10;    Tunnel - The top tile has to touch exactly one wall tile, and may additionally touch one or more top tiles. On the opposite side of the touching wall side another wall is placed.&#10;    Single Top - A top tile touching at least 2 wall tiles.&#10;    Corner Top - A top tile touching at least 2 other top tiles but no wall tile. On every side not touching another top tile a wall tile is added.&#10;&#10;&#10;There are some additional restrictions for the moves:&#10;&#10;The players have to use the tiles colour by colour. Only if the first used colour is completely placed on the table, the next colour may be used. So if there is only one tile remaining in a colour the player can only place one tile in his next turn.  The colour by colour rule is meant to be for the tiles of one player. Example: Player A starts with a yellow tile. Player B continues with two green tiles. Now player A has to continue with yellow until all yellow is used. Only then player A may choose his next colour. (Same for player B with green)&#10;&#10;Each placed tile has to touch at least one tile with the same or a smaller value.  The dots of the top tiles always must be on the top side. So it is not possible to have a top directly above a floor.&#10;&#10;A player wins if he places all 30 tiles on the table.&#10;A player loses if he has no legal move (Beware of tiles with small value).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zomboree is a large group social card game (6 - 16 people) where players take on the roles of various survivors in a town under seige by zombies.  Each turn is affected by an event card drawn for that day.  Each turn is divided into two phases: Day and Night.  A 90 second timer is provided with the game to provide a  fair length for both phases.&#10;&#10;During setup, survivor cards will be handed out.  One of the survivors will be Patient Zero and become a zombie at the end of the first day.  Each survivor starts with one item.  After everyone has an item, the group elects their leader.  Since no one knows anyone else's role, it is possible to elect Patient Zero as the group's leader.  Anytime the leader becomes a zombie, the survivors must elect a new leader before beginning the day phase.&#10;&#10;During the day the elected leader of the survivors draws resource cards and the survivors discuss how to divide them up.  Some of the Survivors, however, are infected and will eventually join the Zombies attacking the Survivors.  At the end of each day, players check their character cards to see if they have become a zombie.&#10;&#10;During the night, the players who have become zombies play attack cards of various types against the remaining survivors.  The survivors must work together to defend themselves using the resources they found during the day to resist and shunt off zombie attacks in order to survive.  Those who cannot stop or deflect a zombie attack, become zombies who will get a zombie attack card the next night.&#10;&#10;The game's scenario runs for one week's time, from Sunday to Saturday.  Each turn an event card shapes both the day and night phases.  Each day the survivors use their drawn resources to make a plan for resisting the zombies.  Each night the zombies attack the survivors and try to wipe them out.  The game ends after the night phase on Saturday when those still alive win by surviving the zombie apocalypse, or else when all survivors are   dead (or undead, as it were).&#10;&#10;",

It is similar to, but differs a fair bit (scoring and key cards), from the card game known as Casino and another called &quot;Bazra&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game uses a standard 52-card deck, without jokers. After an initial deal of five cards to each person (2-player only), two cards are turned up in the middle of the table. After playing one card at a time from the hand, another 5 cards are dealt to the players once their current hand is empty. Thus, each game segment lasts 5 rounds (10 cards per round + the initial 2 card outlay).&#10;&#10;Points (always 5 per game segment) are given at the end of the deck for the following:&#10;Most cards = 2&#10;Most clubs = 1&#10;2 of clubs = 1&#10;10 of diamonds = 1&#10;&#10;See the A new 2-player card game (for most of you) for a visual explanation of rules and scoring basics.&#10;&#10;",

Then pairs are assigned and the two players try to guess what answer the other player chose. The first successful pair exchanges heart chips. If only one player guessed correctly, he/she gets a single point. After 12 rounds, heart chips are counted, with multiple chips in the same color counting less than a diversity of colors.

However, not all paths head toward the top, some are rock-falls or dead-ends or lead in different directions.&#10;&#10;Each player is a Billygoat, each of whom starts at the bottom of the mountain and must race their way up to the top.  The first Billygoat to reach the top is the winner.  However, as each player takes their turn, they change the paths leading to the top, to either help themselves or to hinder other players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "LineUp! is played on a 5x5 grid of squares, with circles at each corner of these squares forming a 6x6 grid. On each player&rsquo;s turn they are permitted to place a token on any of these squares or corners. Players start with 25 tokens each and the game is over when both players have used all of their tokens.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to attempt to build secured structures by either placing or capturing tokens on the board. There are two types of secured structures:&#10;&#10;     Having tokens on a square and the 4 corners surrounding it&#10;     Having tokens on a corner and the 4 squares surrounding it&#10;&#10;&#10;Tokens making up a secured structure cannot be captured.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a token on an unoccupied area of the board, a player may remove one of their opponent&rsquo;s tokens and replace it with their own. This is called capturing a token. Captured&#10;tokens are removed from the game. A token may only be captured if you have a line of tokens adjacent to the token you wish to capture that is greater in length than the line of your&#10;opponent&rsquo;s adjacent tokens in the opposite direction. Thus, to capture a square you must have a line of squares and to capture a corner you must have a line of corners. Tokens that make up&#10;part of a secured structure cannot be captured, but can be used in forming lines to capture other tokens.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players have run out of tokens to place on the board. When this happens, count the number of secured structures each player has built during the game. Remember, tokens can be used in more than one secured structure. The player with the highest number of secured structures wins.&#10;&#10;If the number of secured structures is equal, then the player with the largest number of tokens on the board wins on possession (this is the same as the player who has captured the most tokens). If this number is equal then the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;(Excerpts from the instructions)&#10;&#10;",

If a player loses his capital city, he is left out of the game. There are optional rules for winning: world domination, timed game play etc. The game map resembles RISK but the Tamga game map covers territories from eastern Europe, Anatolia and northern Africa. Battle mechanics involve dice rolling, army hiring and paying their upkeep cost, buying culture cards to be able to hire more powerful armies. Each clan has an army-location-figure to represent their army on the game map. A player can not have more than one army. The army of a player consists of maximum 3 squads. (Janissaries, Cavalry, Ranged attackers etc.)  Specific cities have to be captured to hire specific squads. More powerful squads can be hired from more powerful neutral cities. A player has to defeat the militia of a neutral city to be able to hire those squads. The Tamga game comes with 6-sided(d6) special dice. Each die have three Star faces, two Crescent faces and one Sword face. Different squads have to roll different symbols to be successful. The cards representing the squads have special abilities against other squads written on them. More powerful armies require cultural achievements. The culture cards have historical flavor text on them and a culture point value at the bottom. A player has to pay money(AKCE) to buy culture cards and hire squads. The game comes with a small pouch filled with yellow and white metal coins called Akce. The coins are designed true to the original coins of era.&#10;&#10;(from the official Tamga board game website):&#10;TAMGA is a tactical strategic board game about the Ottoman Empire that takes place during from its the foundation until the end of its golden era. Players take role of Turkish leaders and try to defeat other players to become the ultimate ruler of Ottoman Empire.&#10;&#10;The flavor texts on game cards, the money currency of the game called &quot;akce&quot; pieces, drawings of soldiers and Ottoman Empire game map are the result of hundreds of hours of research from historical literature.&#10;&#10;The creation of game's historical texts and design took nearly four years of careful research and reading. During this time Associate Professor Erhan Afyoncu have been consulted numerous times to provide a true to the original historical experience for the players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Munchkin Sammlerkoffer is a metal briefcase designed to hold all of your Munchkin cards (until they make more), all of the Munchkin dice (until they make more), all of the bookmarks and rule books (until...), and all of the other extraneous Munchkin coins, pens and doodads tucked around your game room.&#10;&#10;Munchkin Sammlerkoffer, which succeeds the out-of-print and previously large enough Munchkin Sammlerbox, includes a Munchkin Kill-O-Meter for you, its owner, to keep track of your fighting level as well as 101 rare or brand new German-language Munchkin cards: 55 (of the 56) cards in Munchkin 7: More Good Cards, a selection of German promotional cards not previously available outside of fairs and conventions, the promotional cards from the German Munchkin Bites!-Halloween cooperation with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, all cards designed for the Munchkin Sammlerbox, and 13 new cards unique to the Sammerkoffer and illustrated by John Kovalic.&#10;&#10;As Munchkin Sammlerkoffer is a magic item &ndash; yes, really &ndash; it grants its owner a special ability in each Munchkin game.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Munchkin Sammlerbox&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Unofficial Sammlerkoffer FAQ:(Courtesy of Clipper)&#10;&#10;This should encompass all the information a Munchkin fan wants to know about the box, its included cards and accessories and so on.&#10;&#10;What is the Sammlerkoffer?&#10;The Sammlerkoffer (translation: Collector's Case) is a product released by the German licensee of the Munchkin property, Pegasus Spiele. It is a metal suitcase-style box with a plastic insert that is perfect for holding the cards included in the Munchkin card games. It also comes with some German cards and a Kill-O-Meter.&#10;&#10;Where do I get the Sammlerkoffer?&#10;Pegasus Spiele's shop is the easiest way to order it. See the &quot;Links&quot; section for the link to the game page, which has a link to the shop page. The site is mostly in German, but there is a translation option at the top right that makes it easy enough to get through the ordering process without knowing any German (note that it will not translate the product description). Note that you will not pay during the checkout process. Instead, Pegasus Spiele will contact you (using English) and give you instructions on how to pay via either bank transfer or Paypal.&#10;&#10;How much does it cost?&#10;It costs 39,95 Euro plus an additional 15 Euro shipping to most locations (at least to the US and Australia, Europe might be less). Payment must be made by either International Bank Transfer or Paypal as specified in the previous question.&#10;&#10;What else do you get with it?&#10;There are 101 included cards with German text and backs for various sets. There is also a Kill-O-Meter. The Sammlerkoffer also has its own special rule.&#10;&#10;What is the Sammlerkoffer's special rule?&#10;If you are playing with cards that all come from a single Sammlerkoffer, the owner of the Sammlerkoffer may, once per game, take a card from either draw pile at any time that they are not in combat. If more than one person brings a Sammlerkoffer, then play with cards from the heavier Sammlerkoffer.&#10;&#10;Are the cards usable with English Munchkin sets?&#10;Some of them can be mixed into your existing sets, but the German backs for some cards are different from the original versions, so they would stand out.&#10;&#10;     The backs of the Munchkin cards, both Treasures and Doors, are significantly darker than the English versions.&#10;     The card backs for the following games have the game name in German: Munchkin Bites!; The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin; and Munchkin Booty.&#10;     The cards with the same backs are for Star Munchkin; Super Munchkin; Munchkin Cthulhu; and Munchkin Fu.&#10;&#10;&#10;How many cards are there for each themed set?&#10;The breakdown is as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Munchkin: 45 Doors and 30 Treasures&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Super Munchkin: 1 Door and 1 Treasure&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Munchkin Bites!: 6 Doors and 1 Treasure&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Munchkin Cthulhu: 2 Doors and 4 Treasures&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin: 1 Treasure&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Star Munchkin: 3 Doors and 1 Treasure&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Munchkin Booty: 2 Doors and 1 Treasure&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Munchkin Fu: 3 Doors&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Can sleeved cards fit into the Sammlerkoffer?&#10;Some can, but it is a tight fit. The 56mm x 87mm standard sleeves from Mayday just fit inside the box. Nobody has reported yet whether the premium version of the sleeves or if other types of sleeves fit or not. Note that the sleeved cards do take up more room, so you will get about 25% less cards in the box.&#10;&#10;How many cards fit inside the Sammlerkoffer?&#10;By my estimate, approximately 4,000 unsleeved cards or 3,000 sleeved cards can fit if you pack them tightly. This is not counting the areas set aside for rules, dice and Dungeon cards.&#10;&#10;How are the card areas arranged?&#10;The plastic base of the Sammlerkoffer includes spaces for various decks and expansions. The included insert suggests putting each core set and expansion in a different slot, but as the ratio of decks to expansions is approximately equivalent to the ratio between Doors and Treasures, it is possible to use a pair of slots (one large, one medium) for the Doors and Treasures of sets with one 112 card expansion or two 56 card expansions, which is perfect for most of the Munchkin themes. The number of slots and approximate number of unsleeved cards that each slot can hold are as follows:&#10;&#10;     11 slots for core sets or Doors of an expanded set fitting about 190 cards each.&#10;     12 slots for 112 card expansions or Treasures of an expanded set fitting about 125 cards each.&#10;     6 slots for Boosters and Promo cards fitting about 60 cards each.&#10;     4 slots for Dungeon cards fitting about 40 Dungeon cards each.&#10;     1 slot for storing rules, dice, bookmarks, Kill-O-Meters, pawns and whatever else you want to store.&#10;&#10;&#10;Is the Kill-O-Meter the same as the Steve Jackson Games version?&#10;Not quite. It features the same art, but it uses different card stock.&#10;&#10;What icons are on the cards?&#10;All 101 cards have an icon for the Sammlerkoffer. In addition, 55 of the cards have the More Good Cards icon, one card has the Kill-O-Meter icon, and one card has the Crazed Caverns icon.&#10;&#10;What are the translations of the included cards?&#10;We do not provide a translation of the cards here. That being said, all but 18 of the cards have already been translated or have equivalent cards in English (see the &quot;Community Wiki&quot; section, below, for hints on where to look).&#10;&#10;",

Use of an hex grid recommended for smoother play.&#10;Smaller tables can be played in as little as 45 minutes.&#10;Infantry three stand units represent platoons or full companies and they do play their proper role; like in reality mighty tanks are of little use unless properly supported. This is effectively enforced by awarding full objective values only when infantry takes them.&#10;The game does not feature common alternate turns, instead HQ issue orders accordingly to random initiative dice (d6); this means that HQ Ally1 may activate, then HQ Axis1, then HQ Ally2, etc.   &#10;The rules feature 1:144 miniature pictures and are probably best from 1:200 to 1:144.&#10;&#10;Because of its design and the use of an hex grid by default, this game has been pointed as a bridge between a miniture wargame and a boardgame.&#10;&#10;Note: this is a rules book only, an hex grid, a dozen d6, 1 d20 dice and miniatures or custom built counters required to play.&#10;&#10;Now available again (2023) from Wargame Vault, in pdf format.&#10;&#10;Has been available on BGG market, in book format.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played on a board depicting 60 fields, arranged in a circle. Each field has a colour corresponding to a category; every sixth field is a large scoring field.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he rolls the die and moves his pawn as many spaces in the direction he chooses. He is then asked a question from the category of the field he landed on. If he answers the question correctly, he gets to move again.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on a scoring field and manages to answer the question correctly, he not only gets to move again, but he also receives a century chip of the correct colour (if he doesn't have one in that colour yet). The first player to collect century chips of all colours wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game can be expanded by adding questions from the various editions of Spel van het Jaar (Game of the Year).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The name of the game is DownsideUp. It is played and scored like rummy, but with a vengeful twist.  Players are dealt a hand of cards, with the goal being to rid yourself of all the cards in your hand. You can do this by playing cards to the table, in groups of three, either in sets (groups of cards with the game value from different suits) or in runs (three or more consecutive cards for one suit). Once a person lays down a group of cards, other players -- including the player who played the original set -- can now &quot;lay off&quot; cards to that group.&#10;&#10;The unique components of this game are:&#10;&#10;1.    Negative Cards - When you think your opponent has amassed too many points and is about to win the game, take revenge and play your negative cards to take points away for your opponent.&#10;&#10;2.    Discarding your card Downsideup - If you have been watching which cards your opponent is collecting and you think your discard is going to help them, then play your discard &ldquo;Downsideup&rdquo; to keep your opponent from seeing that card, but remember where you put it so you can play it again later.&#10;&#10;3.    Wild Cards - When your opponent lays down the card you have been waiting for to complete their run or set of card, use a wild card instead to play those cards to score points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Almost all of the events portrayed in this game actually took place in Washington DC during the 1980s. The exact circumstances and names have been changed to protect the guilty.&#10;&#10;This game portrays the fauna of the District of Chaos and the institutions of its home rule government in realistic situations. Some parts of this game may be unsuitable for the politically naive.&#10;&#10;Home Rulette is a political parody game themed on political corruption. In the game, players move their pieces along the path based on dice rolls.  Other players can impede movement through card-play.  Cards are gained by landing on spaces.  The first player to reach the end space is the winner.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Home Rulette takes place in the District of Chaos, a make believe capitol city of a world super power.  The game is totally fictional.  Obviously nothing so ridiculous as the characters, events or institutions contained in this game could exist in the real world.This make-believe capital city had been created by the country&rsquo;s Founding Fathers as a neutral place, free from local political funny-business, where people could safely go and conduct the nation&rsquo;s business. &lt;p&gt;However, this concept had one fatal flaw:  it worked, and as we all know, its standard government policy to try and fix things that aren&rsquo;t broken. As with any congressional action, many interest groups had to be satisfied.  One of these groups was the Humor Lobby.  If improvements had to be made, they should be funny.  Congress thought long and hard on what could be done to generate the most amount of laughter over the longest period of time.  Then the idea came to them.  Why not take the capital city which belongs to all of the country&rsquo;s citizens, and hand it over to a few local people who tried to burn it down in the 1960&rsquo;s&rdquo;.  At this suggestion smiles broke out on the Congressmen&rsquo;s faces as the potential for a  massive comic effect rolled through their minds. Then like drunk Olympian gods who decided to reach down from the heavens and play some tricks on some unfortunate mortals, they passed a&hellip;..bill. The results were as anticipated.

    "Description": "Choose your EVOKER and evoke powerful ENTI to defeat your rival. ENTI (plural for ENTIS) are powerful beings from another realm, the Dream Realm, who aid you in battle. You can also call upon hordes of monsters in the meantime to protect and strike for you!&#10;&#10;Basic Play Rules&#10;&#10;-Each player must have a deck of at least 30 cards. At least 1 of those cards MUST be an EVOKER card. The minimum is 30 but you may have more, as many as you wish.&#10;&#10;-There are no doubles allowed of EVOKER or ENTIS cards (you may have 2 cards of the&#10;same name as long as the illustration is different) but you may have up to 3 copies of all MONSTER/BOSS and SKILL cards.&#10;&#10;-Each player starts with 90HP.&#10;&#10;Select an EVOKER to start then shuffle your deck and draw 5 cards (this applies to both starting players).&#10;&#10;Roll a dice to see who plays their EVOKER first. If its you draw a card and play an ENTIS or MONSTER/BOSS card(s). You may not attack on your 1st turn (this applies to both starting players).&#10;When both players have set-up defenses, ENTIS or MONSTER/BOSS card(s) then another dice roll is done and whoever has the highest dice roll may attack and have their 2nd turn.&#10;&#10;After that, turns just alternate accordingly.&#10;&#10;How a Battle Turn Goes...&#10;1.Draw a card.&#10;2.Play an EVOKER, ENTIS and/or MONSTER/BOSS card(s).&#10;3.Play any Add-Ons or SKILL cards.&#10;4.Attack (Enter Battle Mode)&#10;5.Play ONLY any other SKILL cards you wish.&#10;6.Turn end.&#10;&#10;An Encounter (the entire course of your game) proceeds until one of you loses all their HP or a player can no longer draw cards.&#10;&#10;02/02/11&#10;&#10;        NEW**&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Theme Decks out!&#10;Starlit Night Deck: Use a deck brimming with the chaotic energy of the stars!&#10;&#10;Harness the unpredictable power of the stars (Star-Type Cards) in this all new strategically structured theme deck. Use &quot;Affuse&quot; to evoke and then re-evoke fallen Enti all the while playing lady-luck by using Star Monsters and their random, high-risk effect Abilities.&#10;&#10;If you like to tempt fate (while using &quot;Marlain&quot; to redo your die rolls) then this deck is for you. Watch as your opponent's well laid plans crumble.&#10;&#10;OR&#10;&#10;Darkside Moon Deck: Decimate foes with raw power and the inverse strategy of dark matter!&#10;&#10;Darkness and destruction await all those who face the power of the moon (Moon-Type Cards). This deck while lacking in Enti power relies on hordes of Monster/Boss Cards particularly &quot;Cronie&quot; a dark bird who returns automatically once defeated.&#10;&#10;Master dark matter and increase your attack power, all the while using inverse tactics to raise your HP and reduce your opponents.
