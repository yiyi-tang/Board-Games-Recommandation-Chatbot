If the card he has just placed ends a meeting (all the drawings of several cards are all on one card), he picks up all the cards of the meeting and puts them in front of him. Cards that are not part of the meeting remain on the table. Attention: if a player lays a card without realizing that he is holding a meeting, the next player has the right to pick up the cards by appropriating the take.&#10;&#10;When no more takes are possible or when the players no longer have cards, the game is over. Everyone counts the cards he has taken and the player who took the most card wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game is designed for four players only. Players send their workers into four triumphal gates to gain or convert resources during action phase, then they spend resources to construct buildings and ramparts during construction phase.&#10;&#10;The distinctive features are variable cost and worker availability.&#10;&#10;Each gate has six action spots. Five of these spots enable you to gain or convert resources. From the leftmost spot to right, its effect becomes greater.&#10;&#10;The cost to send a worker is randomly determined by cost card. There are six spots which corresponds to action spots. From the leftmost spot to right, it becomes more costly. You may place a worker on any vacant spot, but doing so makes all spots rightward cheaper.&#10;&#10;You should note that workers you sent to a gate don't return until someone send a worker to the rightmost spot of the gate, in which case the rightmost worker contributes to the gate's influence, earning its owner income per round, and all other workers on the gate return. Then a new cost card is placed.&#10;&#10;During building phase, you may spend resources to gain coins, and construct a building and ramparts. Each building has its unique ability, and ramparts grants you victory points. The first player who has passed, takes these actions as many as they desire. Except for coins, all unspent resources are lost at the end of this phase, so you must plan ahead how many resources you need this round and where you should send your workers.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#180;&#190;&#233;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#189;&#177;&#233;&#159;&#191;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#229;&#159;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#230;&#186;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#232;&#182;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#175;&#142;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#190;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

If equal, princess is saved, otherwise, dragon takes the princess away and players turn another page of the story book. At the end of the book, if all princesses are not saved, the game is over and lost.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s some variant rules in the booklet to increase game length and/or difficulty.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The chemical elements make up all the things around us (including us!) &ndash; they are the building blocks of nature. Now you can use the elements like never before &ndash; and Battle, Steal, Block and Heal your way to victory with Elementals Unleashed! The game that brings the Periodic Table to life!&#10;&#10;Featuring 32 chemical elements of the Periodic Table, each turned into unique characters (Elementals) with their designs and skills based on their chemical and physical properties, and history. These properties also determine whether an Elemental is classed as Battle: duel another player&rsquo;s Battle cards; Steal: Attempt to steal from another players hidden hand or Chemical Battlefield; Block: Try to stop the steal!; Heal: replenish your hand with cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 4 cards from a shuffled deck, which are hidden from the other players.&#10;&#10;The first player draws a card, and depending on what Elementals they have, can either battle, steal, or heal. The success of this depends on the level of the card, and the skill of the Elemental. After a player has used a card, it moves to the Chemical Battlefield in front of the player, becoming visible to all players. However, the cards in the Chemical Battlefield still count towards the players total score.&#10;&#10;Battle Elementals are the warriors of the game and are used to duel with other players. When the active player uses a Battle Elemental card their chosen opponent must also produce a Battle Elemental card. Battle Elementals are revealed at the same time and the card with the highest level wins, unless the other Elemental&rsquo;s special skill gives it an advantage. The winner receives their opponent&rsquo;s Battle Elemental into their hidden hand, then places their used card into the Chemical Battlefield. When an opponent doesn&rsquo;t have a battle a card, the active player may take a random card from the opponent&rsquo;s hidden hand.&#10;Steal Elementals are the thieves of the game and are used to steal other players&rsquo; cards. Cards can either be stolen from both the hidden hand &ndash; a random selection - or the Chemical Battlefield - where players can choose the card they want. The Steal Elemental will be successful unless their opponent has a Block card.&#10;&#10;Block Elementals are the police of the game and are used to prevent the theft of cards. When a player tries to steal from the hidden hand, Block Elementals will always stop any Steal Elemental.  However, a Block Elemental can only prevent stealing from the Chemical Battlefield when the Block level is higher than that of the Steal Elemental.  Block cards must be used when an opponent attempts to steal and are revealed at the same time as the steal card, then moved to the player&rsquo;s Chemical Battlefield.  In the case of Steal cards with Elemental skill 2x steal, two Block cards must be used. When a player has only Block cards in their hand, they may pick another card from the deck and immediately play it.&#10;&#10;Heal Elementals provide the support of the game and allow a new card to be taken from the top of the deck, unless otherwise specified by the Elemental skill.&#10;&#10;When a player is asked to battle, or is being stolen from, and they don&rsquo;t have an appropriate card to retaliate (Battle vs Battle, Block vs Steal), they may take the top card from the deck. If the player can use it, they must do so immediately, however, if not, the card is placed into their Chemical Battlefield.&#10;&#10;When there is a draw (Battle vs Battle, Steal vs Block), both cards are moved to the relevant Chemical Battlefield, and the active player&rsquo;s go is then over.&#10;&#10;Cards taken from another player (through stealing or battle) go into the hidden hand.&#10;&#10;The game is over once the deck has been depleted, but the last player to draw a card may still play a card from their hand. The players must then count their total points in both their hidden hand and Chemical Battlefield, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

In Troop-Chess, players organize battle-formations with their pawns and use these formations in both offence and defense.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in three versions, each using groyps of three, five or eight pawns. A player can take action only if they have organized a battle-formation using the specified number of pawns.&#10;&#10;For this reason, a player who has reduced their pawns to fewer than the specific number, or has divided them too small, making it impossible to organize any formation, will lose the game. It is possible that both players get incapacitated at the same time, because they have reduced their pawns too much simultaneously. In this case, the game ends in draw.&#10;&#10;Each type of battle-formation has its own nature, such as strong in attack or highly maneuverable. One formation has only mobility. As well as the predefined formations, you can create original battle-formations as you like. And modify the number of pawns that are used too.&#10;&#10;Each pawn does not have any nature by itself, but the power or strength of the formation organized from pawns is affected by its relationship with the neighboring pieces.&#10;&#10;What is required to determine this is only a method to judge which are allies or enemies.&#10;&#10;Further, whilst in the original game, each pawn has no nature itself, the designer encourages players to customize the game further by introducing specialized pawns.&#10;user

Every turn a player places a card from his hand on the table and takes the card from that position in his hand. He ends his turn by turning a card in the middle over and making it visible. The players try to collect a group of 5 of the same cards that fit their role card. The first player to achieve that says &quot;Histo&quot; and wins the game. Other players with the same role will be awarded points as well. It's also possible to claim &quot;Histo&quot; when 5 of the same cards are visible in the middle, although fewer points will be awarded to the winners.&#10;&#10;Every player receives an action card that can be played once. Players can choose from 4 different high impact actions to turn the tables in their favor. Although the mechanic is accessible and straightforward, there are a lot of different viable tactics possible to win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Neither the publisher nor the designer is indicated, but the game comes in an envelope saying &quot;Enclosed: Your Free Animal Triva Game&quot;, so one might imagine that it was a promotional item or was given away for free with some product or service.&#10;There are 30 cardboard rectangles with numbers from 1 to 30, and another 30 cardboard rectangles in 6 different groups (indicated by pictures and words): birds, insects, primates, fish, mammals, and reptiles (however, the reptile rectangles have a picture of a frog on them). One of each of these 6 groups has a stars, in addition to the pictures and the names of the groups.&#10;The two different types of squares (numbers and animals) are put into two different containers. Players (presumably without looking) take one rectangle from each container, and this determines which question (from the question sheet) they have to answer. For example, if a player drew 6 and primates, he would have to answer the question &quot;True or False: Lemurs and lorises have huge eyes so they can see well at night&quot;. (The correct answer here is &quot;true&quot;). Most correct answers give the player 5 points, but if a starred rectangle was drawn,  a correct answer gives 10 points.&#10;The game can last a chosen period of time (in which case whoever has amassed the highest total wins) or until a set target of points is reached (in which case whoever has reached that target wins).&#10;&#10;",

Designed for children, but adults can also play seriously.&#10;&#10;Planet Go Round is an open memory game. As cards are turned up from the deck, all the players get to see them. Then the card is given to a player's hand. There are four cards in each of seven suites. If a player receives a duplicate card into their hand, the paradox damages the Universe. They pay a penalty chip to the person who gave them the card.&#10;&#10;The player with the fewest chips at the end is the winner. So players are trying to distribute the cards to other players without drawing a penalty to themselves. This means they must remember what cards others are holding or have discarded.&#10;&#10;There is a Challenge mode too, if a player can get all seven suites into their discards.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#167;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#156;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#169;&#139;&#230;&#184;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#131;&#145;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#164;&#170;&#233;&#153;&#189;&#231;&#179;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;5&#230;&#173;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#232;&#187;&#189;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#141;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#232;&#168;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;7&#231;&#168;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#132;4&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#232;&#164;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#184;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#232;&#168;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;Easy instruction of the rules:&#10;Each player draw a card from deck in his turn. The player should reveal this newly drawn card to all other players. Then the player must give this card to any other player.&#10;If that player already has same card of given in his hand...&#10;... a paradox happens and his universe explodes!&#10;Then the player who gave that card gains meteor token.&#10;When the meteor token in the token pool runs out, the game ends and the player who has the fewest tokens wins!&#10;&#10;However, what you can do when there is no one safe to give it to? Indeed! If you suspect every player already has same card which you have to give, you can discard it instead of giving. Additionally, a player can hold only two cards in his hand, therefore, when a player who already holds two cards is given a card, he must discard the oldest card. For this reason, surely you will be confused if the card you saw before has been discarded, or not...!&#10;&#10;Additionally, you can perform a 'challenge!' before draw a card. When you try a 'challenge', check a player's discard pile. If all 7 suits are included in the discard pile, you pass the test, and you can return a meteor token back to token pool. Do your best to memorize each players' hands and discarded cards!&#10;&#10;Background Story:&#10;This universe is in danger! Specifically, it explodes!&#10;&#10;One day, the Gods have come to hold a party. The guests of honor of this party are the planets that the gods brought up under their own care. So, the party became lively! It was good so far, but ...&#10;&#10;The god of solar-system, your universe, has drunk too much and fallen asleep. Oh my gosh, good heavens, the planets cannot get back to their proper places without their god. Under this situation... you are the gods of other universes.&#10;&#10;Please, players must co-operate, and let the planets go back to their solar-system by handing over the right planets among the players. But beware, if a god bears same two planets at a time, a paradox happens, and one of universes explodes, the planet becoming a meteor. So, which god performs best in this accident?&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The book includes rules for mutations and creatures that stalk the Wastelands.&#10;&#10;What separates Wasteland Warriors from most tabletop miniature games on the marker is the unique card driven turn mechanism. This leads to snap decisions and tense moments where all the players are involved.&#10;&#10;For Wasteland Warriors we wanted the play to be fast and furious, with a Hollywood flair to it. For that reason, record keeping is kept to a bare minimum.&#10;&#10;In most games, each player can control up to 5-6 miniatures without much trouble. Games can have up to 8 players without slowing down the game. Now, you can dig out all your old miniatures gathering dust and have a game set in the Wastelands of the future.&#10;&#10;Experienced wargamers and new players alike will enjoy this game. It&rsquo;s perfect for convention games and just one on one skirmishes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Before doing this, the guest draws as many condition cards as the number of chefs, then gives one card to each chef.&#10;&#10;After drafting their ingredients, each chef presents their dish, explaining how they prepared it, after which the guest awards victory tokens according to their favor. Then another player becomes the guest to play the next round.&#10;&#10;The game ends after each player has finished their three dishes, and whoever has collected the most victory tokens wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players draft tiles at the start of the game while seeing only their backs; tiles in the first group have a &quot;capsule opening&quot; on only one edge, while tiles in the second group have a straight or curved tube from one edge to another, and tiles in the fourth group generally have three or four open edges. You can look at the faces of your tiles are you draft them.&#10;&#10;The start player in a round plays one tile of their choice, optionally placing one of their wooden cubes on it. Each other player in turn must place one of their tiles in the same group (if possible) face down in front of them, again optionally placing one of their wooden cubes on it. Players then reveal their tiles, then add them to the shared playing area, starting with whoever has the highest-numbered tile. If you placed a cube on your tile, you then place this cube somewhere on your tile in one of the capsules.&#10;&#10;When a capsule is closed, akin to a road being closed in Carcassonne, whichever players have the most cubes in it score points equal to the number of energy symbols in that capsule. After all the tiles have been played, whoever has the highest score wins &mdash; except that if exactly one player has scored 0 points, then they win instead!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deadpan is game centered around holding your composure while abiding by hilarious rules that players draw from the deck. Players take tuns drawing one card from the deck. The object of the game is to not laugh when it is your turn to read a &quot;Statement&quot; card or read/answer a &quot;Response&quot; card all while trying to follow your own rules cards in your hand at all times.&#10;&#10;In the deck are &quot;Response&quot; cards that the drawer must ask another player of their choosing, in which that player must respond, and there are &quot;Statement&quot; cards which the drawer must simply read out loud. What makes Deadpan unique are the hilarious rules cards that are also in the deck. When a player draws a rule card, they must abide by the rule at all times, even when it is not their turn.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Response&quot; and &quot;Statement&quot; cards act as points. To score the &quot;Statement&quot; point, the drawer must successfully read the &quot;Statement&quot; card without laughing while following any rules in their hand. To score the &quot;Response&quot; card, the drawer must ask the question to another player of their choice while trying not to laugh and following their own rules. If the responding player is able to respond without laughing and follows their own rules, then they are awarded the point. If the responder fails, then the drawer who asked the question is awarded the point. If both fail, no one is awarded the point. If a player is caught not following their rules at any time, they lose one (if any) of their points.  First player to collect seven points is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are &quot;Mannerism&quot; - rules that implement a type of action a player must do as directed by the card, &quot;Starters...&quot;- implements that a player must start each sentence they speak with the statement on the card, &quot;...Enders&quot; - implements that a player must end each sentence they speak with the statement on the card, and &quot;New Name&quot; - implements that the player must refer to the directed player on the card by the name on the card anytime they address that player. There are also DEADPAN rules in the deck - These are the same categories as normal rules, but the difference being they are more over the top and the drawer gets to assign the DEADPAN rules to other players.&#10;&#10;In the deck are also &quot;Veto&quot; cards and &quot;Revenge&quot; cards. &quot;Veto&quot; enables a player to discard any regular rule from anyone's hand. &quot;Revenge&quot; cards give the player the opportunity for payback towards any player that has given them a DEADPAN rule.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
