In fact, no food vendor has ever turned a profit, since the invention of the restaurant over 4,000 years ago, except for those vendors who moonlight as arsonists.&#10;&#10;That's right, your only hope is to collect the insurance money on your establishment. However, burning down your own restaurant is a sure fire way to get yourself put on ice by the fuzz. You'll have to rely on silent partners and the kindness of strangers to light up your livelihood.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;* 35 Restaurant Cards&#10;    * 1 First Player Card&#10;    * 42 Investment Markers (7 in each of 6 colors)&#10;    * 50 $1,000 Bills&#10;    * 25 $5,000 Bills&#10;    * Rules for playing Out Of The Frying Pan&#10;&#10;Available at http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/out-of-the-frying-pan&#10;&#10;",

A spinner included in the game is used to determine how many spaces the moving side may travel in a turn. The players on the offensive team must move only in straight lines and must make at least one pass every turn, while the opposing team's players may change their direction of movement while moving.&#10;To shoot, the game comes with a 'Power Shooter', that is placed on top of the fielder with the ball. Pressing a button will shoot the ball toward the goal.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with a trivia version, where you must answer trivia questions correctly to proceed on offense.&#10;&#10;",

Place both footballs on the 50 yard line (one above the large football in the center of the board and one below). Each team takes a turn picking a question from the &quot;Question&quot; sack. If they answer it correctly, they then pick a yardage amount from the &quot;Yards&quot; sack. They move their football the indicated amount. Continue taking turns until one team reaches the goal line. Then the team can pick an additional card from the &quot;Extra Point&quot; sack. On a chalk board or piece of paper, keep score. Each team receives 6 points for each goal and the amount of extra points they pick from the &quot;Extra Point&quot; sack. When all the questions have been answered (or time is up), the winners are determined by their score.&#10;&#10;",

On his turn, the player moves any agents, distributing the total movement points obtained among the agents he wants to move. When one or more pawns stop at the building where the suitcase is, all players score: the pawn which is the suitcase&rsquo;s building receives 5 points and the other pawns receive points corresponding to the buildings where they are at this moment. At the beginning of the game, each player only knows its own identity. Thus, the game has two objectives: to win more points by moving the pawns (the game ends when someone reaches 42 points) and earn additional points, by discovering the identity of other agents (this is done, once someone reaches 32 points, placing numbered chips into the slots of the forecasts bases).&#10;&#10;",

The players move their tokens round the board and win parts of the body as they go along. When a player lands on a space that already belongs to the other player, he or she must meet a challenge whose 'level of difficulty' depends on how parts of the body the other player has in his or her possession. There are thee categories of challenges: Romantic, Sensual and Erotic. The players can also land in a cabaret in Paris where they will enjoy a striptease performance. Landing on one of Cupid's spaces means that the players have to go along with what he asks them to do and adapt their lovers' play accordingly.&#10;&#10;",

We have recently changed our map style from hardback mounted (like the original Squad Leader maps) to a lightweight mounted map (that we use in our ASL Starter Kits).

We included a scenario which uses the board, Marders not Martyrs. This map will be used in the Starter Kit games, but is also fully compatible with ASL.

    "Description": "This is a monopoly-like game with three kingdom's theme.Roll your dice,buy locations,employ generals to conquer other lords and unite ancient China.&#10;&#10;Some rules differences between this and Monopoly:&#10;&#10;&#10;         Each player starts with a property and their starting space is that starting property rather than the Go space (called the palace in this game). For example, Cao Cao starts the game at Chen Liu and owning that deed.&#10;             In addition, the colored set corresponding to the starting property of that pawn is also free to purchase for that pawn when landing on it. For example, Cao Cao can buy any blue property (including Chen Liu if he ever lost it, Shou Chun, or Xia Pi) for free when landing on it and no one owns it.&#10;        &#10;         No bonus for completing a colored set.&#10;             Unlike monopoly, you can start building &quot;houses&quot; (camps in this game) even w/o collecting a complete colored set.  However, you can only build them when you land on a property and only on that property.&#10;             Only 3 houses before a &quot;hotel&quot; (city [walls] in this game).&#10;        &#10;         Free parking space replaced by a Shrine space where if you land on it, any accumulated money in that space is split between the player that landed on it and the bank at around 50/50.&#10;         Jail/Just visiting space replaced by maintenance space&#10;             Each player pays 200 taels [aka gold] per property owned (doesn't matter about houses).  &#10;             Player who pays the LEAST money from this gets a free camp built on a property of their choice.  Money paid for maintenance goes to the shrine space.&#10;        &#10;         Go to Jail space replaced by a Disaster Aid space. &#10;             Each player pays 10% rounded down to the nearest 100 taels of their current cash on hand to the shrine space.  &#10;             The player that pays the MOST money from this gets a free camp built on a property of their choice.&#10;        &#10;         Community Chest cards are called Secret Pouches (ala Zhuge Liang) and are generally somewhat more powerful than in Monopoly, though some are still weak as well.&#10;         Chance spaces replaced by a Tavern space where you can recruit officers to join you.  &#10;             Only 3 officers are displayed at a time and these 3 are replaced whether or not you recruit one after landing on a Tavern Space.&#10;             Each player can recruit a total of 3 officers, which each officer having a special passive ability specific to that officer.  For example, Diao Chan forces an opponent paying rent to you to pay an additional 1500.  Lu Bu allows you to not pay any rent for landing on a space, but after using him, you must put him back at the bottom of the officer draw deck.  &#10;             There are a total of 30 officers to choose from.&#10;        &#10;         After a player goes bankrupt, that player actually submits to the player that caused the bankruptcy.  &#10;             The bankrupt player is now considered a Subordinate while his master is considered the &quot;New Ruler&quot;.  &#10;             They share resources, officers, and properties. The New Ruler essentially gets to move two pawns per turn instead of one, with the Subordinate rolling his own moves but the results of the space the Subordinate's pawn landing on being resolved by the New Ruler.  &#10;             This keeps the subordinate tied to the game instead of being completely eliminated.  When the ruler wins, the subordinate gets second place.  &#10;             There can be multiple levels of subordinates as a result of cascading bankruptcies etc. &#10;        &#10;         The game is won when only one ruler is left and the rest are his subordinates.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Overall, a more complex game than monopoly, especially cause of the officer cards and the somewhat more powerful community chest.  Also, the free camps from the maintenance and disaster aid spaces promote hoarding of cash while developing only a few properties normally.  Easily expandable to 6, 7, or 8 players, really. Though that'll increase the game length dramatically, of course.&#10;&#10;",

If the player forms the expression correctly, then he places his Poker cards face-down in front of him in his Score pile.&#10;&#10;For the player who is unable to form any expression and has placed his 5 Poker cards on the table, he will reveal his cards and other players have a chance to form an expression. Any of the other players may shout &ldquo;Calculae!&rdquo; and then start to form an expression. If the expression is formed correctly, he gets to keep the Poker cards used in his Score pile.&#10;&#10;If a player makes an attempt to form an expression, either using his Poker cards or other player&rsquo;s Poker cards, and is unable to do so or forms an incorrect expression, he will have to discard 3 cards from his Score pile to the Poker discard pile face-up.&#10;&#10;Once all players have verified their expressions formed, they draw Poker hands to fill their hand to 5 and the next round starts where a new Result card is revealed.

    "Description": "(from the back:)&#10;&#10;A Decade of War, the sixth &quot;action pack&quot; for Advanced Squad Leader, covers nearly ten years of world-wide conflict, from the 1936 Nationalist drive to capture Madrid during the Spanish Civil War, to Japanese engagements with the Allies in Asia and the Philippines, to the death throes of the Third Reich on the Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;The ten scenarios spanning this period were developed with tournament players in mind, and are designed for an &quot;expert&quot; level of game knowledge; yet they are accessible to the casual player as well since A Decade of War includes, for the first time, optional &quot;Australian Balancing System&quot; (ABS) provisions for each scenario. (ABS was devised almost two decades ago to allow for scenario side selection via a series of escalating handicap bids. Each player secretly bids on which side and at what handicap level they wish to play; the higher the bid, the greater the handicap.)&#10;&#10;Three double-sided 11x16 mounted maps, including a unique river bend, round out the package. Each is completely geomorphic, and compatible with previous ASL mapboards. Offering new and novel map configurations, these are sure to spark the interest of designers and players alike.&#10; A Decade of War contains: &#10;&#10;    3 ASL 11x16 double-sided geomorphic mapboards (1a/b, 2a/b, 3a/b) &#10;    10 ASL scenarios featuring the new maps.&#10;&#10;&#10;Scenarios: &#10;&#10;    AP53 Far From Home - 7 turns, 18 December 1936, Boadilla del Monte, Spain &#10;    AP54 800 Heroes - 5 1/2 turns, 29 October 1937, Shanghai, China &#10;    AP55 The Generalissimo's Own- 6 1/2 turns, 26 May 1938, Lanfeng, China &#10;    AP56 Quagmire - 10 turns, 22 September 1939, Shangfu, China &#10;    AP57 Kleckerweise - 9 turns, 14 May 1940, Bulson Road, France &#10;    AP58 Sat Sri Akal! - 7 turns, 2 January 1942, Kampar, Malaya &#10;    AP59 Taking Heads - 6 1/2 turns, I January 1942, Concepcion, Luzon &#10;    AP60 Nisbne, Nyet! - 7 1/2 turns, 10 February 1943, Nishne-Gnilovskaya, Russia &#10;    AP61 Desobry Defiant - 7 turns, 19 December 1944, Noville, Belgium &#10;    AP62 Shouting into the Storm - 6 1/2 turns, 8 February 1945, Klein-Silber, Germany&#10;&#10;&#10;A Decade of War is not a complete product, and assumes the buyer owns the core Advanced Squad Leader game system.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(source: ?)&quot;MMP has reached an agreement with three ASL legends to produce a new Action Pack. AP6&mdash;The Decade of War&mdash;will have three new mapboards and ten scenarios using them.&#10;&#10;When talking ASL, Gary Fortenberry, Charlie Kibler, and Bob McNamara need no introduction; all three were major figures in ASL at The Avalon Hill Game Company before MMP took over ASL development. The new mapboards&mdash;based on a concept that Gary has been toying with for a number of years&mdash;resemble two half-boards placed side-by-side and allow new mapboard configurations not possible before. The scenarios consist of a battle a year for the ten years 1936-1945 and feature the combined research and design skills of Fort, Charlie, and Mac.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The Sen So Pirate is the balanced counter part to the Ninja.  Same abilities with a Double Flintlock pistol for one extra shot.  If you don&rsquo;t like Ninja and have a Pirate spirit, the Sen So Pirate is perfect for you.  The Pirate is a single player set that can be played against any of the Sen So variants.&#10;&#10;The Sen So game system uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to set (program) actions before their current action is revealed. All players reveal actions together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players.  Game scoring provides balance and keeps the leaders on their toes. Players are required to choose their weapons and abilities for each battle.&#10;&#10;",

When a player has no more old cars and has brought all the new ones home, the game ends and the richest player (in cars and money) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introduction text:&#10;&#10;Argosy Command&#10;A game of starship miniatures combat.&#10;&#10;These rules are designed to allow players to quickly design fleets and get right to playing. Battles involving over a dozen ships per side should be resolved within a couple hours play easily. While not as detailed or full of options as several other games available, this should be appropriate for even small children to understand and enjoy until they are ready themselves to move on to more challenging rule sets. Above all, it is hoped that the rules presented here provide an enjoyable experience to all that choose to play, for a game that is without fun...is simply not a game at all.&#10;&#10;The ships portrayed within the Argosy Command universe travel between stars by means of wormholes and may represent various races as characterized and postulated by the likes of H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, and other such literary notables at the turn of the 20th Century.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Sovereignty!! the king has died leaving no heir to the throne.  You are a noble who sees this as an opportunity to grab power.  In order to place yourself on the throne, you will have to win the support of the people, gather valuable resources, collect taxes, raise an army, and finally obtain tactical information on your opponent. The player who uses their skills at bribery, sabotage, and brute force the most effectively will capture the throne!&#10;&#10;This game is played over 4 rounds with opponents competing to claim 6 objective cards per round.  To do this each player places a card face down at each of the objectives.  When all cards are placed there is a showdown where players claim their gained obectives.  New objectives are then drawn, hands are refreshed, and the next round begins!  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;This game was designed as an alternate version of the card game War with shorter game lengths and addition of decision making.  After a redo in March 2010 it is now a set collection game with 5 varying types of objectives with 7 cards of each type (3x standard card, 1x +1 bonus, 1x +2 bonus, 1x +3 bonus, and 1x +1 per card of this type).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Master of the Elements is an element-themed part strategy, part luck card-centered game where players aspire to be the first to master the elements by one of three methods: maximum power in each element, summoning 5 spirits, or playing a 9 card mastery set.&#10;&#10;Players take turns going through the phases each round (referred to as the &quot;season&quot;).  Cards corresponding to the season have a bonus.  Each season, there is a lead player who chooses a special universal modifier.  It could be a draw bonus, it could be to prohibit using/summoning spirits or to prohibit special cards from being played.&#10;&#10;The cards, spirits, element power levels, and seasons all interact in a synergistic way throughout the game.  Cards can allow you to draw more cards, put a spirit into play, or boost your element power level.  Spirits can help you draw more cards, boost your power level, and more!  Higher power levels means you may be able to draw more cards.&#10;&#10;Do you go for element power? Can you summon enough spirits?  Do you change your strategy along the way...&#10;&#10;",

Not all of them were kind and happy wizards, but the old royal mage made sure to leave some nasty tricks behind just for them. Traps and curses of all kinds were left strewn about his hiding places, now being plundered by the wizards seeking to replace him. Will they survive to claim the prize?&#10;&#10;Lootin' Wizards: Curses! Foiled again is the first exciting expansion for the group card/board game where you race around trying to get more loot than your opponents. Now, not only can you make spells to battle each other, but curse them and their items to slow them down. This crazy expansion introduces a new character (the evil Alchemist Art), the ability to play with up to two more players in a game (up to 8 when used with the basic game), and a great mix of new Spell and Loot cards to add to the mix.&#10;&#10;",
