    "Description": "Green Guardians is a strategic resource management game based on the scarcity, risk, and cost-benefit of natural resource use. Green Guardians is inspired by the precious natural world around us that is being irreparably altered through climate change and habitat destruction. The challenge for the Guardians is to find the balance of seeking prosperity without polluting the world beyond recovery.&#10;&#10;Green Guardians is a strategic game for 2-4 players, recommended for ages 10 and up, and after a quick setup lasts 45-60 minutes. Players' choices drive the action and competition but random events provide an extra challenge.&#10;&#10;Guardians explore the undiscovered world to gather resources. The resources can be used to build and upgrade to structures that provide additional resources and research. However their actions create waste that accumulates over time to form pollution that prevents the structures from working. In addition, the use of resources subjects the Guardians to disasters that slow down their progress. Guardians overcome these challenges by using their resources to research abilities and cleanup the pollution to keep their buildings productive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If they are correct, they score 1 token. The first player to collect 5 scoring tokens wins!&#10;&#10;It takes timing, deduction, bluffing, and acting skills to win!

There are no result tables to reference with each roll. Once you learn the turn sequence the only information you reference is your army roster sheet.&#10;&#10;Solo Play: While not strictly designed for solo play, Ages of Conflict does play perfectly well as a solo game and includes guidelines for playing Ages of Conflict in solo mode.&#10;&#10;-description from Kickstarter campaign&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Battle of Onin is a strategic trick-taking card game, designed for between 2-4 players. It offers some mechanics reminiscent of classic games such as Spades, Euchre, Pinochle and Hearts, but with incredibly nuanced gameplay.&#10;&#10;How to play: &#10;13 cards are dealt to each player. Each player sets a bid for how many tricks they'll try to win; high card wins the trick! Collect too many tricks and over time you will become corrupted and your influence will suffer.  Collect too few tricks and you won't keep up with your adversaries! Strategize with your enemies to survive; you may have to make risky decisions in the process. But remember, allegiances change rapidly. Score the most influence points to win without being negatively affected by your corruption.&#10;&#10;What separates A Battle of Onin from other traditional trick-taking games?&#10;&#10;A reimagined 52 card deck along with familiar mechanics offers a new challenge for experienced trick-takers; while players who are unfamiliar with the genre will learn with ease.&#10;&#10;With a cohesive blend of subtle complexity, cooperative elements, and unique strategies, A Battle of Onin requires the ability to play offensively and defensively simultaneously; as every hand can and must be strategized to your advantage...even the &quot;bad&quot; hands.&#10;&#10;A Battle of Onin is designed to be color-blind friendly. For players who are colorblind, we have kanji symbols denoting color and faction; Featuring four unique characters that are easily distinguishable. Provided is a key to help translate the symbols and play seamlessly.&#10;&#10;Because we know that skill levels vary, what makes this game stand apart from the rest is it's malleability. A Battle of Onin is Modular. We encourage you to play the multiple variants of gameplay we detail that fit your skill/enjoyment level. From basic, to advanced to expert mode. We also encourage you to implement your own ideas and house rules to maximize your fun-factor. Be creative and make the game as enjoyable as possible!&#10;&#10;Beyond all that is the ease it takes to learn, set up, shuffle up and play. Though it takes minutes to learn, new players can play competitively almost immediately.  This gives A Battle of Onin re-playability. Most of the time, we don't just play one game. We play 2 or 3.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Storyline:&#10;&#10;Scientists now knew it was the end of the world. They predicted that a scourge of natural disasters would hit the earth getting increasingly more dangerous until they wiped out all life on earth. The nation's government leaders came up with a solution to build a giant government facility larger than any structure on earth capable of withstanding these natural disasters and producing all the energy they needed to sustain human life. Taxes rose drastically that year as the nation's people raced to outpace the disasters and finish the massive project. It was finished with almost no time to spare but, that was when the government announced that the citizens who paid for the construction were not allowed to stay in the bunker. The now corrupt government even kicked citizens out of the main city and built a wall protecting it so that the government could hoard the cities valuable resources. You are in charge of a small group of survivors that were kicked out of the city and the disasters start tomorrow. Your only chance to survive the end of the world which is happening in only a few weeks is to break into the government facility and overthrow the government. In the meantime, though you will have to build makeshift bunkers using resources to protect yourself against natural disasters, get valuable provisions to keep your survivors alive, and repair weapons, vehicles, and tools to improve your chance of survival and help you defend yourself against other groups of survivors looking to overthrow the government before you do. This is Outpaced.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: &#10;Each round is split into three phases. Exploration, Fortification, and Catastrophe.&#10;&#10;In the exploration phase players have 1 minute indicated by a timer to quickly roll dice that allow players to move around the city, collect resource cards from various locations, destroy gates that allow players to access more of the map, and make it back to their bunker before the timer runs out if players don&rsquo;t make it back to the bunker in time they lose 1 of their five lives and all of their resources from the natural disaster that occurs in the catastrophe phase.&#10;&#10;In the fortification phase players take turns spending their resources to fortify their bunker, buy more dice, and/or craft builds like weapons, vehicals, and tools to gain an advantage in the game.&#10;&#10;In the catastrophe phase players draw a disaster card. The disaster card weakens players bunkers and destroys various locations on the map effecting gameplay in the next round. If the disaster destroys your bunker you will also lose one of your 5 lives.&#10;&#10;Disasters will get increasingly harder every round until all players die or a player destroys all the gates on the map and breaks into the governments bunker in the center of the map.&#10;&#10;If more than one player makes it to the government facility it turns into a battle where the player that rolls the most combat dice wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Forest Adventure is a new game what take you to new level of gaming.&#10;The game has multiple difficulty levels, from child mode to strategic mode.&#10;&#10;Two playing way!&#10;&#10;1.Movement by Dice:&#10;&#10;The game is started by the player who rolls the most dice. Successive players move clockwise.&#10;&#10;If more than one player is on the same space, nothing happens. After completing your move, if you are standing on a square with a crate, take a card from the deck of adventure cards and follow the instructions on the card. If you stood on the action space, you execute the command from that space.&#10;&#10;Rolling 6 points each time entitles you to extra move. Only rolling a different number of spots ends the turn.&#10;&#10;2.Movements cards:&#10;&#10;On strategic mode you use movement cards to move around the board - cards marked with dice.&#10;This will give you connection between board game and card game with new oportunity of gameplay.&#10;&#10;&#10;You went on a trip with friends. After setting up the camp, it turned out that on the way you lost a basket with provisions.&#10;Additionally, one of the backpacks was torn and protective equipment against insects and other items helpful during the trip fell out of it.&#10;You decide to find the lost basket with food in order to play by the camp fire in the evening.&#10;&#10;The forest is full of surprises. You can stand face to face with a dangerous bear or meet poisonous snakes on your way.&#10;However, not all obstacles are dangerous, be careful not to get distracted and get lost while listening to the beautiful voice of singing birds.&#10;During the journey, you will also meet harmless animals, observing them and not disturbing them can help you find your way faster.&#10;You will also have to cross dangerous canyons and swamps.&#10;&#10;Some facts about the game, I think you should love it  :&#10;&#10;Game rules&#10;&#10;The game is started by the player who rolls the most dice. Successive players move clockwise.&#10;If more than one player is on the same space, nothing happens. After completing your move, if you are standing on a square with a crate, take a card from the deck of adventure cards and follow the instructions on the card. If you stood on the action space, you execute the command from that space.&#10;Rolling 6 points each time entitles you to extra move. Only rolling a different number of spots ends the turn.&#10;To complete the game, in the last move you need to roll as many stitches as you have left to the basket.&#10;&#10;Difficulty level&#10;&#10;With this game you can play on several difficult levels what make game more interested and tageted to everyone.&#10;You can play with your yungest child 3+ or play with advanced players in strategic, coop or rivalry mode using standard dice or movement card.&#10;The game can take 10 minutes on child mode or even couple hour on maximum difficulty level.&#10;&#10;Normal level - Variant 1&#10;&#10;In the basic variant of the game, the difficulty level is on the normal level - 5/10.&#10;&#10;You play in classic style:&#10;throw the dice -&gt; move -&gt; get the card if you stand on field with chest -&gt; follow the instruction -&gt; end turn&#10;&#10;The length of the game oscillating about 15-30 minutes but depends on the player's luck and skill in throwing the dice, meetings with forest inhabitants and the collected equipment.&#10;&#10;Some of example other level in game:&#10;&#10;Child mode&#10;&#10;Difficulty level - 1/10&#10;This is the fastest game timeand can take 10 minute or less. This level is for everyone who want fast end or have children who can't sit on place more than 10 minute&#10;The goal of the game is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible. You don't use any cards, all action spaces are neutral and nothing happens on them. The crossroads are also neutral, and you choose your own direction of travel. If your move ends in a space that has been occupied by another player, you occupy the next empty space.&#10;&#10;Meeting mode&#10;&#10;Difficulty level - 6/10&#10;You win only when collect all animals you will meet - 15 animals - one card per each. You take adventure cards from the pile of cards only after you have finished moving on the field with the box.&#10;But be careful, if you lose on action fields - ants, bees, swamp, rock pillar, suspension bridge and ponds, you lose all collected card.&#10;When you end your move on basket with food, next turn you will begin on camp and lose all equipment cards and map card.&#10;All your lost cards you need to return the bottom of the pile of cards.&#10;&#10;Card mode - strategic&#10;&#10;Difficulty level &ndash; 9/10&#10;This mode offers the possibility of strategic thinking and planning, but the game time increases significantly, so it is recommended for players who like the highest level of difficulty in games.&#10;In this mode, you play the base game.&#10;During the game, you only use the dice when you encounter animals. In this mode, you use movement cards to move around the board - cards marked with dice.&#10;At the beginning of the game, shuffle the movement cards and deal 5 cards to all players so that the other players cannot see them. Leave the rest of the cards on the pile.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you may use one of your cards to move and reveal it to the players. However, if neither card meets your strategic plans, you choose the first move card in the pile, which ultimately determines your move.&#10;Each used movement card is returned to the bottom of the movement deck.&#10;After you have used all your movement cards, on the next turn, you take the first 5 cards from the pile and continue the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Death Guard are the greatest champions of the Plague God, Grandfather Nurgle, his favoured spreaders of his bounteous gifts. Look upon them and see the signs: pus seeping from festering wounds that never heal; miasmic smogs of corrosive, stinking gas hanging thickly in the air wherever Nurgle&rsquo;s chosen tread; the wriggling, lamprey-mouthed tick-leeches that clamp on to their rotting flesh; the droning billions of plague flies that swarm the battlefields they stalk and the ships in which they course through the stars.&#10;&#10;Few armies offer such a rich canvas for painting and modelling as the Death Guard. Every miniature is riddled with gruesome details and grisly flourishes, showing the blessings they have received from Nurgle, and in turn how they will spread the Lord of Decay&rsquo;s infections. With them you can craft a truly head turning &ndash; not to mention stomach turning &ndash; force that can terrify your enemies and be disgustingly powerful on the battlefield. This book is the ultimate guide to the Death Guard, featuring in depth lore and background and the rules that you need to field them in Warhammer 40,000.&#10;&#10;Inside this book, you'll find:&#10;&#10;&ndash; Background on the reunification of Mortarion with the Death Guard during the Great Crusade, his eventual fall into heresy, and the process inflicted upon the Death Guard as Nurgle's Destroyer Plague took them.&#10;&ndash; Information on the organisational structure of the Death Guard following the Horus Heresy and how their cohesion meant they were better able to enact war upon the galaxy.&#10;&ndash; Incredible photography of units, single miniatures, and armies on terrain, both on their own and as part of battle scenes.&#10;&ndash; Datasheets that cover every unit fieldable by a Death Guard army.&#10;&ndash; Death Guard-specific Stratagems, Warlord Traits, Relics, and psychic powers.&#10;&ndash; In-depth Crusade rules that let you grow your force as it spreads diseases and plague across the galaxy.&#10;&ndash; And more!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The success of the Oppai Go tournament has even reached the realm of Tengu, animal gods that have been watching over Japan for centuries. Four animal-featured girls have decided to walk the Earth and compete in the funniest strip challenge in human history. Make your purr&hellip; uhm, better!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).&#10;&#10;The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:&#10;1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side&#10;2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)&#10;3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)&#10;4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)&#10;5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)&#10;&#10;The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.&#10;&#10;Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.&#10;&#10;The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.&#10;&#10;The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.&#10;&#10;This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.&#10;&#10;This is a new version of Oppai Go that is stand alone but can be combined with the previous game to extend games up to 5-6 players.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal as the Kids is to keep the house in good shape and keep the pets from wrecking the place. The Pets attempt to destroy as much stuff as they can and make a huge mess. Players only have 10 turns to accomplish their goals as best as possible.&#10;&#10;The Pets will consist of four dogs and four cats. The dogs and cats can eat food, then poo and pee in the house, or leave muddy footprints, which all earn points at the end if not cleaned up by the kids. Dogs can break things and chew stuff up, cats can shred stuff and knock things over. Cuz Cats.&#10;&#10;The Kids have a Babysitter, Brother, Sister, and a baby. Each kids has a special power. The biggest dog will always protect the baby, and follow the baby around. The sister likes to chase the cats, and can drive them away. The brother and babysitter can fix and clean stuff, and wrangle the dogs.&#10;&#10;At the end of 10 turns, the parents get home. The side that scores the most points at the end wins. That's the general gist of it, there is a floorplan of the house, standees, counters and player mats to keep track of your side's abilities.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The center of the board is filled with a map of Warsaw from 1933.&#10;&#10;Don't wait, roll the dice, make a move, make transactions and make a fortune in the world's first retro edition of Monopoly!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Burrow is a whole series of draw-free annihilation games based on the general concept of capture-templates. To begin a turn, a player takes one of his pieces and captures-via-replacement some enemy piece. Some aspect of the capture provides a template whereby the piece may perform further captures. The template can be the minimal bounding box containing the move, the directions used to achieve the capture, or even the number of friendly pieces in the line-of-sight. Burrow is meant to be a game system and the only presiding rules, aside from the objective of annihilation, are that the template informs all further captures, that the capturing piece must keep moving until it has no available capture according to its template and the mechanism of movement must allow unlimited translation in both dimensions of the board in making the initial capture. Also the game is played on an 8x8 board with a regular alternating pattern of pieces. I invite anyone to put on their designing caps and suggest their own Burrow games. Here are some of my own.&#10;&#10;Note: as a general rule in these 4 Burrow games there is no jumping over pieces of any color. However in others jumping may be allowed.&#10;&#10;Box Burrow: this is closest to the original. In Box Burrow the template is the minimal bounding box containing the capture with the capturing piece's initial position, and the initial piece to be captured being at opposite corners. A Further convention is that the capture is achieved by a number of orthogonal steps. Further captures can be made, as long as for each, movement is entirely within a bounding box of equivalent dimension and as with the first capture the next piece to be captured is at its opposite corner.&#10;&#10;Sweep Burrow: By far the easiest of the variants so far, Sweep Burrow's template is simply the two orthogonal directions involved in making the initial capture. The only further convention here is that if the capture was made with just movement in one direction, you cannot employ a second direction.&#10;&#10;Tumburrow: Tumburrow has the most distinctive template of these. The template is to count the number of friendly pieces (aside from the capturing piece itself) a queen's move away from the first capture. The other convention is that every capture must only involve movement in no more than two directions (orthogonal and diagonal) however these directions do not provide template data.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a time far from now, the 115th Space Infantry Company of the Empire&rsquo;s Colonial Guards are under attack on colony world Tau 17 in the deep periphery. An alien race is known only as XX1120 has made planetfall and has begun consuming the colony&rsquo;s population. Added to this, the forces of the Mercenaries have come to bury the 115th, blaming it on this new alien threat. Particle Beams flare and drop engines roar as each force plays for supremacy. Good luck!&#10;&#10;Lock 'n Load Tactical Series now heads in the world of Science Fiction adding the Space Infantry Above and Beyond as an expansion game for Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical and fought on fictional hexagon maps based on Tau 17. You will test your tactical acumen as the determined Space Infantry and Colonial Guard advisors of the Imperium, the ravenous hordes of the Flesh Eaters, or the brutal Mercenaries looking to take advantage of the chaos.&#10;&#10;Space Infantry Above and Beyond introduces a number of new Support Weapon and Weapon Team variants to the Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical (LnLT) game system like the Motion Tracker, the special issue M-3 body armor, the M-40 Plasma Grenade, and a host of new vehicles and automated units. These rules will have an icon next to them and will operate in ways completely new to the LnLT system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Downtown Chase is a semi-cooperative, card play, conflict resolution, dice rolling board game where 1-4 players play against the game and against each other, at the same time. Players move around the city streets trying to acquire the right location and the right weapon to eliminate Johnny the Quick &ndash; the guy nobody in town likes!&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. The goal of the players is to eliminate Johnny the Quick (JTQ). JTQ is not controlled by any player, it is the game itself. JTQ moves around the board using a combination of dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The players draw cards from three decks, trying to acquire the right combination of location card and weapon card needed to attack Johnny the Quick. When they move to the right location and have the right weapon in their hands and they get close to JTQ, they can attack. The attack is resolved on a separate board called The Assassination Chart, where the players try to eliminate JTQ using the weapon&rsquo;s field of impact and dice roll.&#10;&#10;Apart from playing against the game, players also play against each other. That is why they draw cards from the third deck, with a lot of options allowing players to gain some advantages or create some disadvantages for the other players. If two players find themselves on the same field, they enter the duel, which is a street fist fight. Each player has a particular set of skills which can be upgraded by drawing the right card from the decks.&#10;&#10;The player who eliminates the JTQ wins the game. If JTQ is still alive at the end of 10 rounds, victory points will decide who is the winner.&#10;&#10;However, each player wants to be the one who will pull the trigger, as they all have some personal issues with our Johnny. &#10;Looks like a chase is about to start and it won&rsquo;t be just any chase. It will be the Downtown Chase&hellip;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

You might choose to play the cooperative variant, either playing solo or teaming up with your friends to take on a mighty Shadowlands warlord. Or, you could embrace the darkness in a challenge variant, allowing one player to lead the forces of the Shadowlands into battle against two to four other players.&#10;&#10;Whether you battle the rising darkness together with your friends, challenge them to fight the Shadowlands hordes under your command, or use this expansion&rsquo;s clan cards in your stronghold or skirmish games, Under Fu Leng&rsquo;s Shadow is packed to bursting with exciting new content for every Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game player.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hussite Trilogy the Adventure Game is a strategy board game, in which 2-4 players will test their tactical prowess in a plenty of missions. Explore two game modes (Adventure Mode and Competitive Mode) and embark on a journey in medieval Europe full of fantasy!&#10;&#10;HTAG is a board game adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series. Events told in the books and the game happen in Year Of Our Lord 1420 in Silesia and Bohemia, torn apart by conflicts of political, religious and utterly private nature. In HTAG you can recruit a company of heroes known from the novel and pursue dangerous quests. Adventure Mode allows you to recreate events told in the novel (or even to change their course) - follow the footsteps of Reynevan and his friends! Competitive Mode will give you an opportunity to demand a trial by combat and challenge other players in several missions, i.e.: rescuing a prisoner, treasure hunt or drinking contest at a local fair.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in HTAG is based on a character activation system and d6 rolls, which are supplemented by decks of Adventure Cards. Both players alternate in activating their respective characters, performing actions in order to acquire objectives. Opposing teams meet in combat based on an intuitive system in which characters' Attributes are tested through d6 rolls. Players can also strengthen their attacks or weaken the enemy with Adventure Cards played from their hands. Soon a cautious player will discover a potential of combining characters' Abilities with their faction's Adventure Decks. This knowledge will be your power over friends and foes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Troy is an easy to learn and quick to set up 1 or 2 player game of strategy, with the aim of the game being to break through the opposition&rsquo;s defence and destroy their defences.  Suitable for ages 9+.  As with the famous Trojan war told through Homer&rsquo;s Iliad, the game pits the Trojan army against the Achaean army that has traveled far and wide to reclaim their pride after Helen was taken from them.  The game includes a large number of the armies that are written about in the war and also many of the heroes and leaders in the battle such as Hector, Achilles, Agamemnon and Odysseus.  There is also the addition of the Greek gods that play their part.&#10;&#10;Game play:  You take charge of either the Trojan or Achaean armies.  Defences are set up (both sides have four) and you make the decisions of which armies to defend the wall/stockade.  Then you have the option to level your armies up to make them stronger, choose a leader to improve their abilities or attack the opposing armies.  Attacking is done through dice rolling strategy as armies have improved abilities when fighting specific enemies.  All armies have the ability to defend each attack and this is done through dice rolling.  The leader's capabilities can be even better if they are linked to their respective armies. There are also divinity cards which can be played at any time.  These can help to improve the strength of an attack of assist with defence rolls depending on their capability.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to defeat the enemy army in front of their defences and destroy their wall.  The first side to destroy all four levels of the defence of their opposition is the winner.&#10;&#10;The solo version of the game follows a set of rules for your opposition to follow, using a simple numbered system.  Be prepared to not always win tough!&#10;&#10;",

The game takes 15-25 minutes to play and you can play again to try and beat your best score!&#10;&#10;Tudor Trail requires logic and reading skills as well as basic sorting and simple maths.
