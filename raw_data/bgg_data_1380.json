Cards to the left of the Insert card are referred to as the &quot;normal&quot; cards, which can be used to lead to a trick or when a player cannot follow suit.&#10;&#10;However, cards to the right of the Insert card are the &quot;refuse&quot; cards.  These can only be played when a player could follow suit, but announces that they refuse to.  Moreover, the number of &quot;refuse&quot; cards chosen also becomes a player's bid.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot play a card because they are out of &quot;normal&quot; cards when they need to play one, they are eliminated from the round.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, points are awarded based upon 3 factors, including how many players were eliminated and how close a player came to hitting their bid.  After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ju 87 Stuka Ace allows you to simulate Junker 87 (Stuka) operations throughout the course of World War II, from the beginning of the Blitzkrieg in Poland to the anti-tank operations in the Russian campaign.&#10;&#10;What makes Stuka Pilot special is the brand-new game engine, built around what made the Stuka unique, the dive-bombing. This method of attack is very different from the standard bombing operated by other aircraft, and Ju 87 Stuka Pilot fully reflects this uniqueness. This is the attack sequence in JU 87 Stuka Ace: select the bomb release height, proceed with the dive, consider the current formation height and visibility, release the bombs at the set height and then execute the delicate pull phase. Each of these phases will be managed by making optimal use of the action cards in the player's hand, but you must carefully plan your play since you don&rsquo;t immediately draw a new card after playing it.&#10;&#10;Ju 87 Stuka Ace will allow you to fly your Ju 87 in almost all the theatres where the Stuka were used: Poland, France, England, Norway, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Italy, and Russia. The missions in the different theatres will have very different objectives: infantry units, artillery positions, tanks, transport ships, battleships are just some of the examples. Terrain and weather conditions will also play an important role in the missions; poor visibility, the scorching heat and the sand of the desert, and the frost and snow in the Russian winters: are elements the player will have to consider to succeed.  Ju 87 Stuka Ace includes even night operations: special rules will allow simulating Ju 87 D-5N attacks in Italy as members of &quot;Night Battle Group&quot; NSG9.&#10;&#10;Nine Stuka models will be available to the player depending on the mission or on the progression of the campaign, including Ju 87 A, Ju 87B-1, Ju 87 R-1, Ju 87 D-3, Ju 87 D-5, and Ju 87 G-1. Depending on the capabilities of the aircraft, it will be necessary to select the most appropriate bomb load for the mission objective, evaluating both the number and the type of bombs to be used. And when flying the Ju 87 G-1, your pilot will use the Bordkanone 37 against the Soviet tanks: to better represent the Ju 87G-1 tank-buster role, a specific attack procedure has been introduced, always leveraging the player Action Cards.&#10;&#10;If you have just a limited amount of time you can play single missions, choosing your preferred theatre of operations. If you are instead looking for a campaign game, Stuka Pilot has been designed to represent the entire career of the pilot, starting from his role as &quot;rookie&quot;, then moving on to the roles of Kette Leader, Staffel Leader, and finally Gruppe Leader. As squadron or group commander, the player will have to coordinate the operations of his formation, defining the best approach to the attack, while still remaining in command of his aircraft; the outcome of the mission is always based on the result of your individual attack, do not expect to remain an observer while your formation is executing its dive attacks. As the campaign progresses, you will not only be able to climb the ranks of the Luftwaffe, but also improve your skills (customize your deck of Action cards) and get the coveted medals. The Golden Leaves are waiting for you aboard your Ju 87.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, as happens to the common cavalry troops, their weakness lies in staying locked in prolonged combat.

    "Description": "Overview&#10;&#10;You and your family are quietly walking around your neighborhood. Suddenly you hear a commotion around the corner. It seems that EVEYRONE is pouring into a house! One of your neighbors has suddenly left and they are having an ESTATE SALE!  You and your family jump on the opportunity to pick up some art; books; furniture; silverware; and clothes from the home. Over the course of the day you all explore the house in an attempt to find long lost treasurers and some hidden gems. You also stop to participate in some instant auctions against the other families in the home. Of course, one person&rsquo;s trash is another person&rsquo;s treasure as you learn to dumpster dive for some discarded items. No matter what, you always have to remember to move and buy wisely! At the end of the day the family that scores the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;Summary&#10;&#10;Estate Sale is a 1-6 player table top game involving buying; auctioning; and acquiring different items from an estate sale. Players represent families competing against one another to score the most victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;What is an Estate Sale?&#10;&#10;An estate sale is a method of selling ALL (or most) of the contents of a home. Estate sales usually happen after the death of an occupant or other event that causes the inhabitants to quickly move away from the home. Estate sales usually take place over several days and are generally open to the public. An estate sale is like a garage sale or a tag sale. The main difference is that an estate sale is meant to dispose of all of a home&rsquo;s possessions in an orderly manner. Estate sales are much more than a yard sale as EVERYTHING has a price tag. Everything is up for sale.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It has thirty-one scenarios, a mix of historical battles, like the Sino-Japanese War, near-historical (&ldquo;almost happened&rdquo;), and fictional scenarios.&#10;&#10;The latter include a series of scenarios called the Great Maritime War of 1899, by William Le Queux, one of the many &ldquo;war scare&rdquo; books of that period (the techno-thrillers of that age). The story line was converted into playable scenarios by the knowledgeable Bob Eldridge, who unfortunately passed away in 2017. Mike Harris, his co-author, has finished the work.&#10;&#10;In addition to the scenarios, the book includes annexes covering all the ships and weapons required to play them.&#10;&#10;",

Powerful by themselves, only by socketing them with magical gems will you acquire mighty abilities that allow you to prevail in a duel with another Gemwielder.&#10;&#10;Gemwielders is designed around interaction from the ground up. The innovative combat system allows the attack and defense cards to clash each turn and interact meaningfully. You need to consider your attack patterns and draft decisions carefully, taking the strategy and defense setup of your opponent into account.&#10;&#10;Each game you adapt to the cards that appear and craft a new deck with a unique color combination. You form a plan on the fly, discover synergies that match your play style and go well with the abilities of your favorite Gembearer. If you keep an open mind and seize the presented opportunities, you will be rewarded.&#10;&#10;All you need to play a game of Gemwielders are two Gembearers and five Gems, as included in the Core Set. While new Gems and Gembearers are introduced, the number of Gems used in a single game remain the same. Through random combination of the available pieces, never seen situations emerge each game.&#10;&#10;All cards are illustrated traditionally in pencil, ink and watercolor, giving the game a unique and mature feel. Combined with the haptic and visual satisfacition of gems being placed on Gembearers, this makes for a truly exceptional playing experience.&#10;&#10;",

The card will be one of three types of cards: List, Category or Lightning Round. Every card also has a Beginner side (blue) and an advanced side (red). The reader gets to decided which difficulty they want the players to play that round.&#10;&#10;List cards offer a list of a number of items (e.g., the &quot;Cheeses&quot; list card lists Brie, Jack, Colby, goat, etc.). To score points the other players must provide three more items that fit the list's category, but are NOT on the card.&#10;&#10;For Category cards, the reader slowly reads each item in the list as the other players shout out guesses as to what the category is&mdash;for instance the reader could be reading &quot;lookout&quot;, &quot;thief&quot;, &quot;map&quot;, &quot;parrot&quot;, and so on, and if a player correctly guessed &quot;pirates&quot;, they would earn points.&#10;&#10;The Lightning Round cards simply provide a subject (e.g., &quot;Celebrities&quot;) after which players take turns quickly providing a thing that matches the subject. If a player can't come up with something quickly enough they are out. The last player to provide a timely answer gets the points.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to score 5 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The flashes of light from the explosions on Mars could be seen clearly in the night sky. Terror reigned on Earth as it became obvious that the solar system was under attack by an alien menace. If the general populace knew the true nature of the threat, their fears would have become almost incapacitating. Mars was under assault from alien beings who apparently have existed in the universe for trillions of years and have evolved over that period to become technologically superior to humans &ndash; as well as every other lifeform in the galaxy. This alien race had become known as the &ldquo;Fermitians&rdquo;, named after the astronomer Enrico Fermi and author of the Fermi Paradox. And that&rsquo;s because these beings were essentially the answer to the paradox. They brazenly demonstrated that the reason we have been unaware of other alien species for so long is simply because the Fermitians have been exterminating them! And next on their &ldquo;hit list&rdquo; is humanity and its entire solar system. Their initial target was the newly populated planet of Mars, but there are also rumors that a secondary alien invasion fleet has been secretly deployed to seize a celestial body much nearer and dearer to Earthlings &hellip; the Moon.&#10;&#10;The only force capable of dealing with this threat is the famed 324th Volter Regiment, an elite fighting formation that was created just for this kind of mission. With the support of the Starcruiser &ldquo;Skybreach&rdquo;, the Volters have been sent to Mars and the Moon to stop the Fermitians from destroying these critically important places with their Doomsday Devices. Can you put an end to this threat, Commander? It&rsquo;s up to you&hellip;&#10;&#10;Volters Lead the Way! is an exciting solitaire/cooperative game in which you, as the Commander of the 324th Volter Regiment, must lead your troops across the map board, defeat defending alien forces and stop the countdown that has been set in motion. If the Doomsday Device goes off, Mars and its colony settlements, or the Moon and its research stations, will be destroyed. Godspeed and good luck!&#10;&#10;Volters Lead the Way! uses a unique &quot;push-your-luck&quot; game mechanic that drives the action and challenges you to balance risk and reward. The game is highly re-playable with two maps (Mars and the Moon), variable alien and terrain setups, nine types of alien units, four types of Volter units, customized Volter Companies and random events. The game includes three Scenarios each with three Difficulty Level options (Easy, Standard and Brutal). Though primarily a solitaire game, there are also 2-player and 3-player cooperative play options.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each card examines the current state of the game and selects the appropriate action for the active faction. A single, faction-specific table then determines where that action will occur. The same table is used to select spaces for Operations, Special Activities, and Events, minimizing the need to flip between multiple player aids.&#10;&#10;Playing against Calixto feels like playing against a human opponent. It is unpredictable yet responsive to strategic needs, it goes after its enemies while keeping an eye on its ally, and makes moves until now limited to human players&mdash;like choosing a Limited Operation to block an opponent&rsquo;s Event. Calixto can take the place of any faction in a Cuba Libre session and can be used in any combination of player and non-player setups.&#10;&#10;",

They are playing their own color, so they are playing the trump suit.&#10;Other players have to provide purple and have to rise (to play a higher value card). If they cannot rise, they have to play a lower value card, and if they don&rsquo;t have any purple card either, they must discard any card from their hand.&#10;Now let&rsquo;s imagine our first player, still Artemis, playing yellow. Other players have to provide the lead suit (yellow), but they don&rsquo;t have to rise, since it's no longer the trump suit.&#10;&#10;     Another exemple: a first player doesn&rsquo;t have a yellow card, they must ruff with a purple card and therefore start the next trick.&#10;     New situation: a second player doesn&rsquo;t have a yellow card, either they have a trump suit card and must over-ruff (play a higher value card from the trump suit), or under-ruff if they have only lower value ones (play a lower value card from the trump suit). If they don&rsquo;t have any card from the trump suit, they must discard any card from their hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the higher value card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;There are special cards in each suit: the Monsters which can cancel a trick under certain conditions and the Heroes who disables the Monsters.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;At the end of the round, the players count the points they scored during it.&#10;The player with the most point gets 3 gems, the second only one, and the others take none.&#10;The first one with 12 gems wins the game, and become the new god of gods.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a children's race game that casts players in the roles of characters from Lewis Carroll's popular novel &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.&quot; Alice, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, and/or the Queen of Hearts each follow their own single-color 80-space path to the finish, similar in nature to &quot;Peter Rabbit's Race Game&quot; (1917).&#10;&#10;Although the game is built for 2 to 4 players, some editions accommodate up to 8 in teams of two (with two of each character's playing token provided). Alternatively, it is suggested that single players may use both identical tokens, always taking care to move the rear-most of the two.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to score as many resource points as possible before the end of the game. But your opponent might have other ideas. Both players have to decide when to return back to the ship with the current resources or press your luck, trying to weather the events and retrieve a much bigger load.&#10;&#10;Your ship has five expeditions to send out and collect resources. When it is time, collect the resources and return back to your ship and count the booty. Events may alter the success of your expedition. The longer you stay on the island the greater the chance you have to deal with these events (good or bad!).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Petrify is a finite territory game for two players: Blue and Orange. It is played on the spaces (squares) of an initially empty square grid (board). The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 10x10 squares.&#10;&#10;Both players must have access to a sufficient number of disks of their own color and a sufficient number of neutral blocks.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is a disk along with all other like-colored disks one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent disks of its color.&#10;&#10;Similarly, a patch is a square not occupied by a block along with all other such squares one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent squares not occupied by blocks. Note a patch may contain any number of groups, as well as empty squares.&#10;&#10;The size of a group or patch is the number of squares it spans.&#10;&#10;A mound is a set of four blocks occupying a 2x2 area of the board.&#10;&#10;A barricade is a set of three adjoining blocks in a straight diagonal line.&#10;&#10;Mounds and barricades are illegal formations. For the purpose of spotting them, the edges of the board count as lines of blocks. In other words, the real board is considered to be the middle section of an imaginary board with sides two squares longer, and all edge squares on this larger board are considered to be occupied by blocks.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlue plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, make exactly one of these board plays:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a disk of your color on an empty square.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move a disk of your color any number of squares in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any blocks or enemy disks, to a square occupied by an enemy disk. Then, remove this enemy disk and place a block on the square from which you just moved your disk, without forming a mound or a barricade. Note a disk can jump over friendly disks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you have no board plays available on your turn, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, for each patch on the board, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from it until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over in a patch owns the patch. Empty patches are owned by neither player.&#10;&#10;The player with the higher score in the resulting position wins. Your score is the sum of the sizes of the patches that you own. If there is a tie, whoever made the last board play loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means Orange will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Blue instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;",

Gridiron All-Stars does away with the complexities and randomness that have become a staple of sports games; instead relying upon abstracted movements and euro-mechanics to deliver an authentic and quick-playing sports experience that takes mere minutes to learn yet many games to master.&#10;&#10;Gridiron All-Stars relies upon action programming and resource management to create a deep tactical experience that captures the feel of the sport without getting bogged down in its nuance.  Before each drive, choose a Play to determine what Actions your team will take on that Drive (action programming).  Once the ball is snapped, you can use a limited pool of Action Cards to supplement or upgrade those actions to try to score a touchdown or tackle the opposing team&rsquo;s ballcarrier.&#10;&#10;Start playing the Base Game in 10 minutes.  Captain a seven player Gridiron team in the local leagues to develop your favorite Plays, learn to manage player positioning, and how to maximize the impact of your Action Cards.  When you&rsquo;re ready for the primetime, unlock the asymmetric aspects of the game by taking control of one of one of the pre-made teams or create one of your own.  Add Star Players and specialized Team Cards to unlock new levels of strategic and tactical depth.&#10;&#10;Most importantly, Gridiron All-Stars plays fast.  There are no dice.  There are no charts.  There is no waiting for your opponent to decide whether to block your action.  Play moves quickly back-and-forth emulating as much as possible the speed with which the actual sport is played.  Play as fast as you want &ndash; think speed chess &ndash; with a full game playable in 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Werewolf Which, phonetically Jin-roh Docchi), a kind of a One Night Werewolf game, each player picks one of the two role cards for their hidden role for the game, and place the other face down on the table. This makes each player knows a role that should NOT in the town, in addition to their role, making deduction and bluffing more interesting.&#10;&#10;As in One Night Werewolf, during the two discussion phases in a game, Civilians (non-Werewolf players) try to deduce who the Werewolves are, and Werewolf players try to hide/bluff their identity. There are special actions done before/between the discussion phases depending on the role, ranging from Seer or Cop to see the cards, or even DJ to exchange a player's role card to their unused card.&#10;&#10;Then one and the only voting in the game is held to decide whom to expel from the town. Civilians win when a Werewolf gets most of the votes, otherwise Werewolves win.&#10;&#10;",

To earn more points, players should try to raise the tower on which they have invested more and sabotage other towers. The game ends at the end of the third round with the construction of 5 towers in the third neighborhood, and the investor with the most points will win.&#10;&#10;In Build &amp; Blast, there are several tiles, each representing a floor of a tower. In each neighborhood, 5 towers with 5 different designs and colors will be built. Some tiles belong to one or two specific towers, and some tiles can be placed in the body of all towers. A few special tiles, without being inserted into the body of the towers, will make changes to the building plans.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nordic teams love a good fight above all else - and that's certainly what they do best on the field! The Nordiques spend their entire lives in the cold north, which makes them very tough. These hardened players excel at scrimmaging, making blocks in all directions as they punch their way into the end zone - and presumably the tavern just beyond!&#10;&#10;Of course, it's not just about causing a midfield brawl; there's also that crucial detail of scoring touchdowns. The Nordic teams work best when they can use their generous fighting skills to punch a hole in the opponent's defense, so that their Valkyries can use their impressive speed to get through and win.&#10;&#10;This kit consists of 120 plastic pieces with which you can assemble the Norsca Rampagers, a Nordic team to use in your Blood Bowl matches. The team consists of 6 Norse Raider Linemen, 2 Beer Boar, 2 Norse Berserkers, 2 Ulfwereners and 2 Valkyries. It also includes 2 double-sided Blood Bowl pieces, 2 turn and raise counters, 4 balloons, and a sheet of 292 decals.&#10;&#10;These figures come unpainted and require assembly.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Playing in such hostile conditions presents many unique dangers to Blood Bowl players &ndash; from spectacularly skidding and face-planting on the frigid pitch, to falling through the ice itself!&#10;&#10;Players will need to tread carefully on this dangerous skating rink, or risk the chilling waters below. The Frozen Lake pitch has two sides &ndash; one depicting the pitch in fair weather, with the lake covered in a thick sheet of ice. The other side depicts the pitch after some disaster or another has caused the ice to break apart, exposing the freezing waters below.&#10;&#10;You'll also find a pair of matching double-sided dugouts to complete the theme. Each dugout features score, turn, and re-roll trackers, plus Reserves, Knocked-out, and Casualty  boxes.&#10;&#10;Rules for using each side of the pitch in your games of Blood Bowl are included.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Last Hundred Yards Vol. IV: The Russian Front is the fourth game in The Last Hundred Yards series.  It covers major campaigns and missions from the second half of the war in the east, introducing the Russian army to the series for the first time. A series of missions simulates actions from the October 1943 fighting in the Ukraine near Krivoi Rog, while others feature fights during the Russian 1944 summer offensive, Operation Bagration. All major Russian armor from late 1942 onward is covered, plus some additional late war German armored vehicles.&#10;&#10;The unique feature of this module is how Russian army behavior is modeled at the tactical level, particularly in its lack of local command-and-control flexibility and general indifference to casualties when fulfilling its missions. Make no mistake, playing the Russians will require a different mindset. The challenge will be in understanding the Russian behavior modeled in LHY and transitioning that into solid tactical applications. The Russians need numbers to make up for their lower tactical flexibility, but &quot;quantity has a quality all its own,&rdquo; and they generally do get those numbers.  While the period of the war covered by the module was one of overall Russian initiative, it still featured numerous German counterattacks, and module missions feature plenty of German attacks against Russian defenses as well as the reverse. Another set of new tactical challenges in the module stem from the frequently more open terrain found in the western Ukraine.&#10;&#10;The Last Hundred Yards (Base Game) and Volume II (Airborne Over Europe) are core volumes for the rest of the European LHY series. Thus, players must own both Volumes I and II to play the Russian Module, Mission Pack 1, and future modules in the series.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beat to Quarters, Vol III (Blue Cross, White Ensign) is an official expansion to Blue Cross, White Ensign by GMT Games, LLC and requires a copy of that game to play.&#10;&#10;One of the most common criticisms of the Flying Colors system is the clutter of status markers on the map and that they may detract from game play. This concern can be minimized somewhat by using status sheets and a handy pencil to keep track of things on paper. This, however, adds a separate record-keeping aspect that the design of the game goes out of its way to avoid.&#10;&#10;Beat to Quarters provides the ultimate way by which to keep track of the status of individual ships through the use of individual tracking cards that are kept conveniently near the map and that are laid out to conveniently hold a variety of status markers such as Broadsides Fired, Sail State, Rigging Damage, and Hull Damage. The cards are designed to be printed at a standard 3.5 by 2.5 inch size so that they can be slipped into card protectors for extended usage.&#10;&#10;Individual tracking cards are included for all 231 individually named ships included with Blue Cross, White Ensign. But that&rsquo;s not all!&#10;&#10;As a bonus, Beat to Quarters also includes the print-and-play components for an entirely new way to play Blue Cross, White Ensign. Drawing from games such as Naval War, Modern Naval Battles, and (in particular) Enemy in Sight, Beat to Quarters can be played with just the ship tracking cards, a special set of markers and 8.5 x 11 inch tracking board, and the status markers from Blue Cross, White Ensign. The ship cards are organized into squadrons that maneuver and fire against the opposing fleet within a relatively small playing area. With Beat to Quarters, you can play the huge battles without the space requirements for several game maps.&#10;&#10;NOTE: This volume of Beat to Quarters only includes marker sheets for the British, French, and American fleets. There are insufficient Spanish, Venetian, and East India Company ships to form a fleet, but these ships can be included in the fleets of the other nationalities as desired or added to the cards from the first volume of Beat to Quarters.&#10;&#10;With Beat to Quarters, you can either enhance or completely change your enjoyment of Blue Cross, White Ensign!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
