The aim is to help children develop their skills in logic and recall. Most children will easily handle 50% of the questions, within their age level. However, since the game is won by the roll of the dice, all players have an equal chance of winning. The player who gets to the end of the track first, wins.&#10;&#10;Players roll the dice to determine the number of spaces they will move on the board if they answer their question correctly; the questions are colour-coded into three levels of difficulty according to age.&#10;&#10;Includes a plush die, five plush playing pieces, and a cloth game board (all washable) as well as a set of question cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bloody Retribution: The Battle of Inkerman is a two-player Grand-Tactical level board-wargame of the largest Russian offensive of the Crimean War. Even so, both players have the necessity of both attacking and defending. It uses the alternating-actions system introduced in Paper Wars issue no. 93 Wagram and issue no. 98 Alma games.&#10;&#10;The emphasis is on players&rsquo; mastery of overall operations rather than the minutiae of tactics. In effect, they role-play the supreme commanders, not the whole chain of command as is common in most complex tactical-level games. It&rsquo;s a mechanically simpler approach that is at the same time more realistic, given the fact no individual in such situations would have the timely knowledge needed to make detailed decisions.&#10;&#10;The battle was personally ordered by the Czar as a final attempt to break the Allied siege lines along Sevastopol&rsquo;s southern perimeter. The British were initially caught by surprise along the steep slopes of Mount Inkerman. Both sides threw in everything they had available, hoping for a decisive victory. That made for a fierce day of back and forth combat characterized by soldier-level heroism and high-command incompetence. In the end the Russians retreated, but it was a near-run thing that could&rsquo;ve gone either way.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents 200 yards (183 meters) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver are brigades, regiments and battalions. Each full turn represents one or two hours of real time. The first two turns were dominated by dense fog across the whole battlefield; therefore they each represent two hours to take into the account the inescapably slower tempo of operations under such conditions. Artillery is represented abstractly via bombardment markers. There is one full sheet of 228 medium-size (5/8&rdquo;) iconic counters. Playing time is about three hours, and complexity is low-intermediate.&#10;&#10;Published in Paper Wars issue 100&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fantasy Commander is a strategic board game set in the fascinating world of Signum, where ancient empires clash with new alliances in epic battles. Here, powerful armies led by seasoned commanders face not only the tactical brilliance of their adversaries but also the unpredictable forces of magic. On the battlefield, monstrous creatures rise to fight alongside legendary heroes blessed by mighty gods, creating a rich tapestry of conflict and adventure.&#10;&#10;Originally launched through a successful Kickstarter campaign, Fantasy Commander hit the shelves in November 2023. The core game introduced players to two factions: the Empire of the Undead Styx and the Iron Nest Empire. Since then, exciting expansions have been released, adding two more playable factions&mdash;the Blackmarsh Horde and the Underdark, Union of Spider&mdash;as well as additional units for the base factions. This ongoing support ensures that the game remains fresh and engaging, with regular updates and new content to explore.&#10;&#10;The game features high-quality, highly detailed resin miniatures at a scale of 20mm (1:72), for an exciting gaming experience on the tabletop. Each miniature is crafted with precision, bringing the vibrant characters and terrifying monsters of the Signum world to life.&#10;&#10;While Fantasy Commander is primarily designed as a two-player duel, it also offers various modes to set more players. Additionally, players can challenge themselves in a single-player Narrative Campaign, perfect for mastering the fundamental rules of the game while diving deeper into the lore of Signum.&#10;&#10;Join the battle and forge your destiny in Fantasy Commander!&#10;&#10;",

Each turn starts with the player rolling two dice, giving a number between 2 and 12, and they can play if they have a card in their hand in the correct times table.&#10;&#10;Special rules if you roll a 7, 11 or a double add an extra layer of both strategy and luck. Feedback from customers is that the children are so engrossed in trying to work out whether they can play that they don't realise they are learning maths by stealth.&#10;&#10;All packs come with &quot;times table checker cards&quot; for children (or adults) who are less confident with their times tables.

You will try to make your way over a recent flow field of smooth, glassy p&#196;&#129;hoehoe lava without hurting yourself. If you can make it to Highway 130, then maybe you&rsquo;ll get picked up and taken to a shelter in the nearby town of Pahoa.&#10;&#10;DETAILS: You roll dice to determine the journey the cat will take across lava. Along the way, you draft abilities by playing &quot;akamai&quot; cards. These allow you to change the path of your journeys, to avoid losing life points or whiskers. After six rounds, your score (whiskers multiplied by life points) reflects how well you survived the overall journey.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players are able, and encouraged, to write and/or draw on their Creation Cards.&#10;&#10;The Core release, between website and rule book rules, contains 5 different games; Kingdrin, Minkingi, Fwords, Creca, and Pazuuru.&#10;&#10;In Minkingi, 2 (or potentially more) players use Creation Cards to battle on what is known as the Active Field, vying for the most board control by the end of the game. Players take turns placing one of their cards into an open Active Field space, rotated in any direction to fit the orientation of the space, then declaring battles with other spaces. The player who controls the most Active cards at the end of the game, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Kingdrin, however, plays completely differently! 2, 3, 4 or even 5 or more players pool their Creation Cards to one pile, then everyone draws 7 cards. Players take turns declaring and playing cards on top of the Ditch, matching different symbols or numbers to the top ditch card, drawing when they can't. Things get intense when players add 'The Kingdrin Speed Rule' card; and turn order is replaced with players playing as fast as they can! The player who runs out of cards first is the winner.&#10;&#10;Creca, while similar to Minkingi, is a much deeper dive into player engagement. Deck and drafting construction, Skills and abilities, as well as heavier gearing towards Card Layouts and new Fields. It uses the Active Field as well, but instead players are racing to control the first five Active Cards at the end of a turn. Creca also implements longer player turns, with different steps in each turn, giving players more choices (and hard decisions!) to deduce optimal plays from.&#10;&#10;With player made content (on cards or in games), different games running under one engine (and many more in the works!), and expandable content through Card Layouts like Alt Rule Cards, Source Cards, and Token Cards; the potential is actually endless.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Asteroid Field X, you play as one of four factions mining an inhospitable asteroid belt.  The object of the game is to build and upgrade mining infrastructure to both keep your colony alive and protected and to mine and sell as much precious ore as possible.  The faction that accumulates the most Creschins (money) from their sales will win the game.  However, there is an &ldquo;X-factor&rdquo; in play: buried somewhere in the uncharted regions of this asteroid field is a mysterious alien artifact that emits terrifying forms of energy.  It is of great value in this hyper-capitalist world, and of equally great danger.  If you unearth it and manage to transport it back to your base dome, you can sell it to the ore transport ships for an enormous profit.  But given the difficulty of handling it, someone else might steal it before you can accomplish this!&#10;&#10;Asteroid Field X is a limited edition game by Zach Horton.  It is based upon a prototype he designed in 1992.  It functions as a prequel to Supernova, an origin story about a civilization&rsquo;s extractavist excesses, when mining colonies supplied the raw materials to fuel a powerful but fragile empire&mdash;before Object X caused their home star to become unstable, leading to the desperate conditions of Supernova.&#10;&#10;Players build and upgrade mining infrastructure in order to extract base metals (not very valuable, but needed to manufacture equipment), premium metals (the chief export of the mining colony, but also used to manufacture some items), and volatile compounds (substances needed to maintain your colony such as water and minerals).  Beyond strategizing between the payoffs of these substances, you need to maintain transportation networks to return your ore safely to your base dome.  You may build various other units to be used for sabotage, protection, or direct attacks.  Asteroid Field X makes extensive use of hidden movement, and ships can be equipped with cloaking devices to render their locations invisible to other players.  Many cargo cards offer special capabilities to players who develop and play them.  Some of these are played covertly and revealed anonymously, to often unpredictable results.  Combined, these mechanisms allow players to pursue secret campaigns of sabotage, openly hostile actions, and peaceful diplomacy, often all at once!&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turn, each round ends with a &ldquo;diplomatic phase&rdquo; in which players simultaneously manufacture new units, deploy covert cards that will be revealed in the next round, and decide how much ore to sell to the waiting merchant ships.  The base prices of metal ore fluctuate during the game, as they are tied to a semi-randomized timeline of market cards.  The final price that each player receives for their ore, however, is determined by how much total ore is dumped on the market that round by all players.  Thus betting and bluffing play a significant role, as players attempt to manipulate the market to favor their own interests. After 12 rounds (each represented by a Market card), the game ends, with the player who has received the most money declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The player who plays The Teams Courtyard tile will be able to place an additional farmer in the yard if he wishes to.&#10;&#10;",

In doing so, we have encapsulated elements of the global Covid-19 pandemic such as the recommendation to use a protective mask to minimize the spread of the virus, and the need for self-isolation among those who may have been in contact with it.&#10;Thus, the meeple with stars between the two roads depicted on the tile symbolizes the geographical context of the championship and the exceptional situation in Europe, and throughout the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;The Roads of Europe tile should be mixed in with the other tiles as usual&#10;&#10;How to use the tile&#10;&#10;Following the basic rules for laying tiles, proceed as normal according to the following cases.&#10;&#10;In 2-player games, promote a more competitive use&#10;&#10;When a player draws this tile and places it such that it extends a road (or roads), any meeple(s) occupying these roads must immediately be removed from them without scoring. These meeples have been in contact with the virus and must go home to self-isolate! The active player must then place each removed meeple into separate incomplete and unoccupied cities of his choice, somewhere on the landscape. Meeples may not be moved into any city that is already occupied.&#10;If there are not enough unoccupied cities available to accommodate all removed meeples separately, the active player chooses which meeples to place and which to return to their owner. After all removed meeples have either been moved to cities or returned to their owners, the active player is granted a bonus turn and must draw a new tile and place it according to the usual rules.&#10;If the tile is placed on an unclaimed road (i.e. one without a meeple), it may not be claimed by the active player and no bonus turn is given.&#10;The road may be extended on subsequent turns, but may not be claimed until such time that it is completed. The player that completes the road may choose to claim and score it, as per the usual rules, as long as they have at least one meeple in their supply.&#10;&#10;With 3 or more players, promote a more playful and fun use -&#10;&#10;The rules for games with more than two players follow the same rules as outlined above for games with two players, but with one exception: when the road is closed, all players who have not closed the road will lose as many points as there are tiles on the road.&#10;&#10;Special cases&#10;&#10;&#10;     While meeples may never be placed as thieves on any of the road segments on the special tile, the fields are safe from the virus and may be claimed according to the usual rules by a meeple as a farmer.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     There may be a situation where the placement of the special tile automatically closes a road. In that case, if there are meeples on it, they would return to their owners and the player who placed the tile would not be able to claim the road and the other players would not lose points either.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In the case of playing with expansions, all the tiles with special effects would disappear as part of the road expansion before closing. In any case, the tokens could still be used as normal tokens. Example: The mini tunnel expansion contributes to the expansion of the road without adding any special effects, but the princess and the dragon or inns and cathedrals contain symbols that are canceled when they are part of the road.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beat to Quarters, Vol II (Serpents of the Seas) is an official expansion to Serpents of the Seas by GMT Games, LLC and requires a copy of that game to play.&#10;&#10;One of the most common criticisms of the Flying Colors system is the clutter of status markers on the map and that they may detract from game play. This concern can be minimized somewhat by using status sheets and a handy pencil to keep track of things on paper. This, however, adds a separate record-keeping aspect that the design of the game goes out of its way to avoid.&#10;&#10;Beat to Quarters provides the ultimate way by which to keep track of the status of individual ships through the use of individual tracking cards that are kept conveniently near the map and that are laid out to conveniently hold a variety of status markers such as Broadsides Fired, Sail State, Rigging Damage, and Hull Damage. The cards are designed to be printed at a standard 3.5 by 2.5 inch size so that they can be slipped into card protectors for extended usage.&#10;&#10;Individual tracking cards are included for all 255 individually named ships included with Serpents of the Seas. But that&rsquo;s not all!&#10;&#10;As a bonus, Beat to Quarters also includes the print-and-play components for an entirely new way to play Serpents of the Seas. Drawing from games such as Naval War, Modern Naval Battles, and (in particular) Enemy in Sight, Beat to Quarters can be played with just the ship tracking cards, a special set of markers and 8.5 x 11 inch tracking board, and the status markers from Serpents of the Seas. The ship cards are organized into squadrons that maneuver and fire against the opposing fleet within a relatively small playing area. With Beat to Quarters, you can play the huge battles without the space requirements for several game maps.&#10;&#10;NOTE: This volume of Beat to Quarters only includes marker sheets for the British, French, and American fleets. There are insufficient Spanish, Venetian, and East India Company ships to form a fleet, but these ships can be included in the fleets of the other nationalities as desired or added to the cards from the first volume of Beat to Quarters.&#10;&#10;With Beat to Quarters, you can either enhance or completely change your enjoyment of Serpents of the Seas!&#10;Card play modifications to Flying Colors.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Zeus has granted you the ability to wield his Thunderbolts in a Tournament of the gods. You&rsquo;ll capture mythological creatures as you build an army to command in an epic contest for fame, fortune and most of all, bragging rights in Mt. Olympus. In this mystically veiled bidding and battling game, the god that scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This is a fun, fast paced action game that is played in three distinct phases, the capture, command and scoring phases. As part of the game, there is a hidden god role card that each player has assumed. Only the gods know when you'll reveal your god identity and how your divine power will be used to enhance your play and stifle others.&#10;&#10;In the capture phase, using a bidding style mechanic, you&rsquo;ll use your limited supply of Thunderbolt tokens to capture mythological creatures from around the table. Gathering information is a key element of this phase because each player will only be allowed to see the creature&rsquo;s strengths on other players stands. Their own creature card will be on a stand facing away from them and therefore unknown. So, if you surrender, you&rsquo;ll need to take the lowest strength creature you can see.&#10;&#10;After the capture phase, each player will then command their army of mythological creatures one at a time to battle for treasures! This phase is an epic competition for various treasures (gold, armor, valor, temples and worshippers) that only interest the gods. Treasure cards have different point values that range between 1 - 10 and various symbols that are part of your set collections and end game scoring. But be aware that worshippers, the 9 and 10 point value treasure cards, don't have any symbols while the golden Apple, the 1 and 2 point value treasure cards, have a wild symbol that can be used in any one of your set collections.&#10;&#10;After all the battling and treasure collecting is done, it&rsquo;s time to move into the scoring phase and tally up your scores. Unused thunderbolts, treasure cards, set collections (combination of creatures and treasure cards) and any god card bonuses all count towards your grand total. The player, or Olympian god with the most points wins and gets bragging rights in Olympus... for now.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s rare that you&rsquo;ll have the same die every turn.&#10;&#10;Each die has its strengths and weaknesses, and physical skill at dice spinning makes a difference. It&rsquo;s surprising how easy it is to learn how to spin dice though. Some dice are more likely to earn you a cube when rolled, some are better at spinning, and you choose each turn to roll or spin. Either way you end your turn by rolling the swap die and doing what it says to swap dice with other players.&#10;&#10;",

In the metropolis of Tokyo, cooks compete fiercely for the best ingredients so they can satisfy their customers' needs and desires.&#10;&#10;In Ramen Chef, you are at the forefront of this battle. Play as one of up to four chefs who run their soup business with sophistication and brains in order to become Tokyo's greatest ramen chef. Your greatest weapon? Your smart head!&#10;&#10;Ramen Chef features a literal flip of a classic memory game. You are trying to match ingredients from a 3x3 grid, and collect ingredients that match a secret objective. However, all of the ingredient tiles are double-sided, meaning you need to remember both sides of the tiles in front of you. On your turn, you must verbally state the ingredient you see BEFORE you flip, then flip the tile to reveal the opposite side. If after the second flip, your two tiles (on their opposite sides) now match, you are able to collect one of those tiles for your restaurant and work towards fulfilling your secret objective tile. The player with the most tiles &mdash; both ingredients and completed objective tiles&mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;But be careful! If the opposites sides of your target tiles do not match, you collect nothing, and may leave a combination of tiles that your opponent can now use instead. Surprisingly tactical and shockingly difficult for only nine tiles, Ramen Chef is sure to leave you questioning your memory abilities and hungry for ramen!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Filled with chunky wooden charms featuring the joys of Tokyo, this stacking game challenges players to build two wobbly towers at the same time. Choosing which piece to place next is critical as it may leave your opponent with some of the hardest (and heaviest) pieces for the top of the stack.&#10;&#10;In addition to two unique modes of play, you may enjoy keeping these charms as decorations in between games.&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;Players gradually stack wooden figures with Japanese motifs onto the two &quot;Little Tokyo&quot; Skyline base pieces. If any piece falls or if one of the tower collapses, the player that caused the fall loses a point. The game ends when all pieces have been stacked OR someone has collected three negative points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In order to escape, you must explore the labyrinth's &quot;corridors&quot; and collect the &quot;soul fragments&quot; of those who have entered the labyrinth in the past. However, depending on the &quot;corridors&quot; you explore, you may have to take in the &quot;witch's stain&quot; which is a negative point. You will have to explore many corridors to collect more soul shards than anyone else and escape the labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Each year, only a select few are allowed to return from the ritual.&#10;The chosen young people who have just come of age enter the labyrinth. The labyrinth is said to be inhabited by a witch with the head of a cow. Those who return are honoured as heroes. And the next day, some of those who had disappeared in the labyrinth would return. All of them have the gift of heroism and will later achieve some success.&#10;&#10;The game features&#10;Explore the corridors of the labyrinth and collect the &quot;soul fragments&quot;! Only the player who has more search pieces than anyone else can search.&#10;&#10;However, only the player who holds more search pieces than anyone else will be able to search, and in addition to the search pieces, he can also hold the &quot;sign of the witch&quot;, which is a negative point. If it is held by another player, the searching player must take back the negative witch's stain.&#10;&#10;The value of the soul can be increased by collecting soul pieces of the same colour and leveling them up. So collect as many points as you can and win!&#10;&#10;Game Overview&#10;The player becomes one of the young people who participate in the ritual and explores the &quot;labyrinth&quot; where the witch with the head of a cow is said to live. In this game, you have to explore the labyrinth one corridor at a time to collect the soul shard tokens. In order to do so, the player has to reveal more pieces than anyone else in order to be entitled to explore the corridors. (The player who reveals the second most pieces also gets the right to explore.) However, depending on the corridor explored, the player may have to take a negative point, the &quot;Witch's Stain&quot;. You will have to explore many corridors and collect soul shards tokens while avoiding them. With the collected soul fragment tokens, you can achieve the &quot;oracle card&quot; and get more points to escape the &quot;labyrinth&quot;!&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#132;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#184;&#229;&#143;&#130;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#139;&#165;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#137;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#160;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#163;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#232;&#191;&#183;&#229;&#174;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#191;&#183;&#229;&#174;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#187;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#142;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#191;&#183;&#229;&#174;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#233;&#173;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#172;&#160;&#231;&#137;&#135;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#187;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#169;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#178;&#162;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#187;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#233;&#173;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#172;&#160;&#231;&#137;&#135;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#232;&#191;&#183;&#229;&#174;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#132;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#184;&#176;&#233;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#175;&#142;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#191;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#232;&#139;&#165;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#191;&#183;&#229;&#174;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#130;

    "Description": "&Eacute;douard Plantagen&ecirc;t, better known as the Black Prince (1330-1376), was the eldest son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainaut. The origin of his nickname is uncertain. Some associate it with the colour of his armour; others refer to his reputation for brutality on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;The Black Prince's &quot;ride&quot; in 1355 was a devastating raid. In Carcassonne, the upper town (city) remains untouched, but the lower town disappears in flames. In Narbonne, the suburbs, devoid of defences, were destroyed. Retracing his steps, &Eacute;douard took the Chemin de Gascogne, set fire to Miremont, destroyed Carbonne, Gimont and returned to his Bordeaux lands without difficulty.&#10;&#10;Here, the Black Prince's army is represented by a wooden black tower figure (a black chess rook). The black tower will move around the playing area like the dragon (see Expansion 3 - The Princess &amp; the Dragon), destroying any towers it encounters. It will capture all the followers placed on them.&#10;&#10;Towers cannot capture any follower placed on the same tile as the black tower. The black tower cannot be removed from the game even by the dragon.&#10;&#10;",

The playing area is a large wooden board showing a fir tree with ribbons, which stands propped up at an angle (much like a stepladder). Players take turns placing toys and gifts on the tree, starting from the bottom and working up.&#10;&#10;There are some horizontal lines across sections of the tree. If a gift is placed so that it crosses a line, decorative balls and ribbons can also be hung on the tree. The game ends when a placed object falls from the tree.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players can work out a score and see how well they did in decorating the tree. If they are careful, they will complete decorating the tree with a Santa and a golden star at the top.&#10;&#10;The designer has specialised in highly ornate games made using woodburning techniques. The game features a large number of intricately designed, hand-made pieces, brightly coloured to produce a highly attractive design. As a result, only a few copies are made, and sell for a high price (approx $400). &#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each subsequent bid must increase the number of words or the word length.&#10;&#10;Each player has a scant few seconds to make a bid and each bid is an opportunity to drive the next player to unwisely overbid -- a core strategy.  The top bidder has a minute to fulfil his bid.&#10;&#10;Words with greater lengths garner higher scores.  To counter Aunt Edna's dictionary memorization, however, the game includes a clever mechanism that enables a would-be thief to steal the bid score!  After each player has rolled three times (with the middle round in reverse order), the player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
