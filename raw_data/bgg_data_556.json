    "Description": "This is the 2nd Lone Canuck scenario pack that covers WW II actions that involved airborne troops and paratroopers.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules are required.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;Rotterdam, Holland, 10 May 1940:The Allied Forces of Britain, France, Belgium, and even neutral Holland had drawn the majority of their forces up to their borders with Germany in preparation for the seemingly enviable attack by the Germans. The attack on Rotterdam was carried out by 700 Fallschirmj&auml;gers and in a most astonishing and daring attack, a dozen Heinkel HS 59 seaplanes ferried 120 men of the 16th Infantry Regiment into the centre of the city, where they landed on the Maas River&ndash; disembarking the men on the quayside at either end of the bridge...&#10;  &#10;Southwest of Carentan, France, 13 June 1944: The Battle for Carentan lasted three days and by June 12, the 101st Airborne Division had encircled the town in a bold pincher movement. However, just as the American paratroopers were entering the town, the German commander, Major Von der Heydte, facing encirclement and short of ammunition, had that morning ordered his forces to withdraw, and set up a new defensive line southwest of Carentan. Von der Heydte and his Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment 6, were now under command of the just arrived 17th SS-Panzergrenadier Division &ldquo;G&ouml;tz von Berlichingen&rdquo;, whose commander was enraged at Von der Heydte&rsquo;s withdrawal; ordered an immediate counter-attack on Carentan... &#10; &#10;East of Le Mesnil France, 7 June 1944: The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion regrouped at the Le Mesnil crossroads during the night of June 6, where it received a resupply of 3-inch mortars, which it lost in the marshes during the previous night&rsquo;s drop, and much-needed ammunition. The next morning, a strong German infantry force from the German 857th Grenadier Regiment, supported by tanks and self-propelled guns moved into position for an attack; however, were driven off by a salvo of PIAT bombs and bayonet counter-attack by B Company. The Germans withdrew 200 yards back up the road, seeking refuge in a small-fortified farmhouse, from where they continue to harass the Canadian&rsquo;s position with machine-gun fire...&#10;&#10; &#10;Riethorst, Holland, 18 September 1944: For Operation Market-Garden, the 82nd Airborne Division had the onerous tasks of seizing the bridge over the Maas at Grave, the railroad bridge over the Maas-Waal Canal, the bridge over the Waal at Nijmegen; and thereafter, hold and secure, the dominating feature located southeast of Nijmegen- the Groesbeek Heights. Because of the threat of imminent attack from the Reichwald, the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s Commanding Office, Major Talton &ldquo;Woody&rdquo; Long responded by sending reinforcements to assist in the defence...&#10; &#10;Nijmegen Holland, 19 September 1944: By early afternoon of 19th, the German forces defending the two Nijmegen bridges were formidable- over 2,000 men, four 88mm guns, and numerous light anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns. Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick &ldquo;Boy&rdquo; Browning, commander of the 1st Airborne Corps told the 82nd&rsquo;s General Gavin, &ldquo;The Nijmegen Bridge must be taken today. At the latest, tomorrow.&rdquo; Gavin immediately ordered the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment to move into Nijmegen and capture the highway and the railroad bridges over the lower Waal. The Western Force responsible for the capture of the railroad bridge was comprised of Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment; a troop of tanks from 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, and a platoon of infantry from the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards...&#10;&#10;&#10;South of Hamminkeln, Germany, 24 March 1945: For Operation Varsity, the British 6th Airborne Division would drop and land on the northern half of the area. Its objectives were the high ground east of Bergen, the town of Hamminkeln, and certain bridges over the Ijssel. The 1st Battalion, The Royal Ulster Rifles of the 6th Airlanding Brigade was tasked to land on LZ &ldquo;U&rdquo; to the south of Hamminkeln and seize the bridge over the Ijssel River on the main road to Brunen. D Company, commanded by Major Tony Dyball, landed on LZ &ldquo;U1&rdquo; which was astride the Ijssel, his own glider touching down in the lead about 150 yards from the bridge, which was the objective. As it landed, it came under fire from a machine-gun 75 yards away &hellip;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This scenario pack covers actions that involved airborne and paratroopers units.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules is required.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;Sola Airfield, Norway, 9 April 1940: The Germans&rsquo; plan for the invasion of Norway and Denmark was code named &quot;Operation Weser Exercise&quot; and was under the command of General von Falkenhorst; it would be the first major combined air-land-sea effort in history. In a bold and daring plan the First Battalion of Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment 1, under the command of Major Erich Walther, would attempt to capture four objectives; Aalborg airfield and the Vordingborg Bridge in Denmark and Norwegian airfields at Sola and Fornebu... &#10;  &#10;Gorki, Russia, 14 October 1941: Early in October 1941, the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s Army Group Centre drove 200 miles in five days, its panzers crossing the Berezina and Dnepr Rivers. However, these panzer spearheads had also outraced their supply lines; forcing some 300 panzers of Heinz Guderian&rsquo;s 2nd Panzer Group to hold while their supplies caught up. Seizing upon this opportunity to destroy the German panzer force while it sat with its fuel tanks dry, the Soviet Western Front Headquarters ordered its IV Airborne Corps to detach a brigade for a special operation...&#10; &#10;Northeast of Gela, Sicily, 11 July 1943: Just over a year after its activation, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under the capable leadership of Colonel James M. &quot;Jumping Jim&quot; Gavin, made its first regimental size combat parachute attack as part of the Allied Invasion of Sicily known as &quot;Operation Husky.&quot;  The 505th&rsquo;s objective was to drop behind enemy lines around Gela, close off roads leading to beaches and secure the drop zone for further use...&#10;&#10;&#10;South of St. Come-du-Mont, France, 7 June 1944: Shortly after midnight on June 6, paratroopers of General Maxwell D. Taylor's 101st Airborne Division became the first Allied soldiers to touch French soil during the Invasion of Normandy. The 101st had been assigned the initial mission of securing Exits 1 and 2 from Utah Beach and having secured them on D-Day, Taylor immediately dispatched the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment southwest to conduct a reconnaissance towards the road junction south of St. Come-du-Mont...&#10;&#10;&#10;Bois de Bavent, France, 29 June 1944: By late June, the British 6th Airborne Division had settled into a defence role east of the Orne River; despite this role, the division continued to patrol aggressively, seeking and wreaking havoc upon the enemy wherever possible. At no place was this havoc more evident than in the forested area called Bois de Bavent, where a cat and mouse game was taking place between the division&rsquo;s patrols and the German&rsquo;s outposts...&#10;&#10;&#10;North of Heelsum, Holland, 18 September 1944: As Operation Market-Garden commenced, ad-hoc German defences were asked to oppose some of the initial paratroop landings.  One such case occurred west of Arnhem, where NCOs from an SS-Officer Cadet school, personnel from a Kriegsmarine unit and Luftwaffe ground crews attacked the 1st Airborne Airlanding Brigade...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The small 6-scenario pack covers actions from the eastern front of WW II.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some modules is required.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;&#10;    1) Borodzatyn, Russia, 22 June 1941: The sounds of incoming artillery heralded the attack of Panzer Division 4, attacking across the Bug River south of Brest-Litovsk. The Grenadiers of Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 33, supported by a platoon of tanks from Panzer Regiment 35, marched eastward along the main road into the town. German panzers duelled with Soviet light tanks, while German grenadiers stormed the heavily defended municipal building&hellip; &#10;&#10;&#10; &#10; &#10;    2) Bobruysk, Russia, 25 June 1944: The radios of the Soviet Don Tank Corps crackled with the words &ldquo;Storm Five-Five-Five!&rdquo; The all-out offensive against the salient of Army Group Centre had begun. However, east of the Bobruysk Bridge over the Berezina River waited a worthy opponent. The reinforced II/Panzer Regiment 21, Panzer Division 20 was well placed and could be employed against either a northerly or southerly Russian thrust. The battalion was superbly equipped, with about one hundred battle worthy Mark IVs. However, Major Paul Schulze, in command of the regiment, had received no orders... &#10;&#10;&#10; &#10; &#10;    3) Staryy Bykhov Russia, 4 July 1941: The German Blitzkrieg was still in full swing and Heniz Guderian&rsquo;s Second Panzer Group&rsquo;s spearheads had crossed the Berezina at Bobruysk and Borisov and were now making for the Dnieper. Fortune favours the bold, and Guderian&rsquo;s or Fast Heniz, as he was known as, wanted to cross the Dnieper. Guderian&rsquo;s advanced detachments discovered the Russians had fortified and were strongly holding the principal Dnieper crossings at Rogachev, Mogilev, and Orsha&hellip; &#10;&#10;&#10; &#10; &#10;    4) Berlin, Germany, 3 May 1945: Despite the Germans&rsquo; pyrrhic victories of Seelow Heights and Diedersdorf, the Red Army broke through the German defences along the Oder River and advanced towards the German capital. On 27 April, Sturmartillerie Brigade 249 successfully broke through the Soviet encircling ring before the Red Army had been able to consolidate its position, and the brigade&rsquo;s assault guns took up positions within the Berlin defensive perimeter&hellip; &#10;&#10;&#10; &#10; &#10;    5) Northeast of Kharkov Russia, 17 May 1942: The Germans had to eliminate the Soviet bulge on both sides of Izyum, which represented a permanent threat to Kharkov. As the Russians sped forward towards Kharkov, huge supplies stored in warehouses in Kharkov were about to fall into the Russians hands of unimaginable quantities. Timoshenko's northern pincer raged forward towards Kharkov. The Soviets launched the 28th Army with 16 Rifle, and Cavalry Divisions, 3 Armoured Brigade, and 2 Motorized Brigades&hellip; &#10;&#10;&#10; &#10; &#10;    6) Gorodok Russia, 12 January 1943: The Neva River had been frozen since 7th January. The Russians unleashed from 4500 barrels a hurricane of fire over the German positions. The shell burst and heavy mortar fire was reinforced with the weight of the Red Fleet in the Leningrad harbour. Then across the perfectly flat, snow-covered ice of the Neva, charged in close line abreast, the men of the Soviet 13th Rifle Division. Their objective was the hospital in Gorodok where Leutnant Winacker had set up his command post of his 2nd Company, Engineer Battalion 240, transforming the smouldering block of buildings into a spitfire fortress&hellip; &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the Lone Canuck scenario pack that covers WW II actions from Operation Autumn Mist.  The pack contains 18 scenario cards.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;16 December 1944..... The village was defended by Company B, 1st Battalion, US 110th infantry Regiment and M36 tank destroyers from the 630th Tank Destroyer Battalion. Company B was well dug in and the German assault companies assaulted the village but were unable to pierce the perimeter and were forced to infiltrate the woods north and south, heading for their primary objective, Clervaux.&#10;&#10;&#10;16 December 1944..... The German Volksgrenadier Division 212, made a successful and relatively uneventful crossing of the Sauer around Bollendorf in the early hours, overrunning small American outposts along the river line without giving them a chance to radio a warning. Although Colonel Chance commander of the US 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division immediately opposing them was aware because of reports from the US 28th Infantry Division further north that an attack was in progress. Even though speed was of the essence, the German assault companies of Volksgrenadier Regiment 423 with their objectives the American command post in Consdorf and artillery positions in Scheidgen. Partially ignored orders to bypass pockets of resistance became involved in costly and time-consuming battle for the insignificant villages of Berdorf and Lauterborn.&#10;&#10;&#10;17 December 1944..... General von L&uuml;ttwitz&rsquo;s orders required Volksgrenadier Division 26 to establish bridgeheads across the river Clerf by nightfall on the 16th, so any enemy resistance had either to be subdued quickly or bypassed. As it turned out, the biggest stumbling block turned out to be the Company K, 3rd Battalion, 110th Infantry Regiment and Company B, 103d Engineer Battalion in Hosingen. The American defenders were simply too well dug in to be shifted easily and the close-range battle, with dozens of individual hand-to-hand encounters, swayed backwards and forwards all day. In the evening, four Shermans arrived from the 707th Tank Battalion, but failed to bring any rifle ammunition with them. The constant delays imposed by the defenders in the handful of villages along Skyline Drive forced KoKott to unleash his reserved Grenadier Regiment 78 whose 1st Battalion was thrown into the struggle for Hosingen, supported by a few Jagdpanzer 38(t) from Panzerj&auml;ger Abteilung 26.&#10;&#10;&#10;17 December 1944..... Screened by the mist which aided all of the Volksgrenadier Division 352&rsquo;s assault companies, the leading two battalions fortuitously struck at the junction between the US 109th Regiment&rsquo;s 2d Battalion, whose Company E was in F&uuml;hren and the 3d Battalion&rsquo;s Company I deployed in front of Bettendorf. Lt. Colonel James Rudder, the commanding officer of the US 109th Infantry Regiment immediately drew upon his meagre reserves and sent A and B companies of the 1st Battalion supported by 1st Platoon Company C, 707th Tank Battalion into a counter-attack. Although progress was slow by nightfall Company A was in sight of Longsdorf and Company B was overlooking Tandel. The morning of 17 December brought as series of uncoordinated attacks by 2nd Battalion Volksgrenadier Regiment 915 against F&uuml;hren while the 1st Battalion had its hands full with the Americans counter-attacks at Longsdorf and Tandel.&#10;&#10;&#10;17 December 1944..... Alerted by the Seventh Armee&rsquo;s preliminary artillery barrage, Colonel Rudder moved Company G up on the right of Company F, replacing it in Brandenburg by Company C from the 109th&rsquo;s reserve 1st Battalion, which was stationed in Diekirch. During the night remembering his orders to avoid confrontation and leave American strong points to be mopped up by the reserve Fallschirm Regiment 13, Oberst Gr&ouml;schke took advantage of a wooded defile to continue advancing west in between the 109th&rsquo;s companies F and G. But early on the 17th the 2nd Platoon from Company C, 707th Tank Battalion moved into position to block the regiment. By daybreak on 18 December the GIs were completely cut off, even though they had not been attacked Colonel Rudder ordered them to fight their way out south to Diekirch helped by the tank platoon.&#10;&#10;&#10;17 December 1944..... Before dawn on 16 December the engineers of the Fallschirm-Pioniere Battalion 5 began ferrying the assault companies of Fallschirm Regiment 14 across the Our. Their instructions were to head as rapidly as possible west to the river Clerf, establish a bridging site near Kautenbach and press on west to Wiltz to establish a blocking line behind the river S&ucirc;re south of Bastogne. Their line of advance actually lay at the intersection of Lt-Colonel James Rudder&rsquo;s US 109th and 110th Infantry Regiments and immediately in their path at Weiler was Company I, 3rd Battalion 110th Infantry Regiment. Generalmajor Ludwig Heilmann&rsquo;s orders to both his 14th and 15th Regiments called on them to bypass any pockets of resistance in the villages. Leaving those to be mopped up later by his reserve 13th Regiment. One such village was defended by six 105mm and three 75mm Shermans from Company C 707th Tank Battalion and a part of the 110th Regiment&rsquo;s anti-tank company.&#10;&#10;&#10;19 December 1944..... By early evening Volksgrenadier Regiment 916 had command of the heights in the Our/S&ucirc;re triangle and Volksgrenadier Regiment 914 taking up its place in the centre of the division&rsquo;s line, could begin to make more headway. The US 109th Regiment with Colonel Rudder&rsquo;s command post back in Ettelbruck was now formed in an arc in front of Diekirch. However, it was a sadly depleted regiment. So far the Volksgrenadier Division 352 was handsomely repaying Colonel Rudder for his audacity on Omaha Beach six months earlier.&#10;&#10;&#10;20 December 1944..... While Panzer Lehr was still struggling toward the Clerf River on 18 December, Panzer Division 2 was rolling west across the river through Clervaux. In the van, was the reinforced Aufkl&auml;rungs Abteilung commanded by Hauptmann von B&ouml;hm. Taking the road which skirt to the north of Donnange and Lullange, the Kampfgruppe ran into the first of the Bastogne roadblocks at the Antoniushof farm road junction a task force from CCR/9th Armored Division. The next opposition lay at Baraque d&rsquo;Allerborn, where a second task force of CCR/9th Armored Division was waiting. Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm attacked here at dusk and within 15 minutes destroyed 24 Shermans. Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm had its last encounter with the Bastogne roadblocks at Herbaimont on 20 December, which was manned by an outpost of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.&#10;&#10;&#10;20 December 1944..... General der Panzertruppe Eugen Walter Kr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s LVIII Korps encountered difficulty when the Aufkl&auml;rung-Abteilung 146 found that the bridge over the river Ourthe west of Bertogne had been blown. Kr&uuml;ger then ordered Panzer Division 116 to retrace its footsteps and head northwest through Houffalize towards La Roche and Sam&eacute;e instead. The US 7th Armored Division&rsquo;s trains were at La Roche, but their main supply depot had been moved to just outside Sam&eacute;e. Early in the afternoon of 20 December, Panzer Grenadier 60 began assembling in the woods south of Sam&eacute;e while Panzer Grenadier 16 prepared to attack straight down the road, with Volksgrenadier Regiment 1129 on its right. The US 7th Armored Division&rsquo;s quartermaster delayed destroying the supply dump because he was told a task force from CCR/3rd Armored Division was on it way to Sam&eacute;e. CCR was only able to send a small armoured force commanded by Major John Tucker and consisted of a company of Shermans, a troop armoured Cars, a platoon of light tanks and a battery of M7s. Task Force Tucker moved into Sam&eacute;e from the north.&#10;&#10;&#10;20 December 1944..... After helping Oberst Heniz Kokott&rsquo;s Volksgrenadier in their final assault against Holtzthum, Oberst Paul von Hauser&rsquo;s Kampfgruppe 901 followed the rest of Panzer Lehr, which had already crossed the Clerf at Drauffet. The division&rsquo;s reinforced Aufkl&auml;rungs-Abteilung, Kampfgruppe von Fallois and the following Kampfgruppe 902 had had a brief skirmish at Eschweiler just north of Wiltz but Bayerlein left the subjugation to this thorn in the division&rsquo;s flank to the following Volksgrenadiers and Fallschirmj&auml;gers. However the Bastogne defences, which a day earlier had lain wide open were now being rapidly reinforced as the 101st Airborne Division deployed. Company I, III/501st Parachute Infantry Regiment started entering the village of Wardin from the northwest, unseen in thick morning mist. Part of Panzer Lehr&rsquo;s Aufkl&auml;rungs-Abteilung moved into Wardin from the northeast at the same time and the two groups inevitably collided in the middle.&#10;&#10;&#10;23 December 1944..... The biggest problem faced by Oberst Hans-Joachim Kahler&rsquo;s F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade, is that it was committed piecemeal and unable to launch a full-scale counter-attack against either of the American III Corps&rsquo; division it ran up against, the 26th in the west and the 80th in the east. Called out of OKW Reserve on 22 December the brigade was originally intended to cross the S&ucirc;re at Ettelbruck and then head directly to the support of Fallschirm Division 5 around Martelange but the threat posed to Ettelbruck by the arrival of the US 80th Infantry Division caused this to be amended. Kahler put one company of F&uuml;siliers apiece into Eschdorf and Heiderscheid and sent two south with a platoon of Panthers to Grevils-Br&eacute;sil hoping to establish contact with the leading Regiment of the Volksgrenadier Division 352. The American 80th Divisional Commander, Major-General Willard Paul, had decided earlier that the ground was unsuitable for tanks so for once it was the GI&rsquo;s who had no armor support.&#10;&#10;&#10;24 December 1944..... Recognizing that Fallschirm Division 5 was out on a limb and although Volksgrenadier Division 352 had finally captured Diekirch that a wide and dangerous gap had opened between the two divisions. Heersgruppe B Commander Field Marshall Model reassigned the former to LII Korps on 22 December and reinforced it with the F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade. At the same time he also released Oberst Alois Weber&rsquo;s under strength Volksgrenadier Division 79 from reserve and assigned it to Kniess&rsquo; LXXXV Korps. The village was weakly defended by Colonel Bandy&rsquo;s 2d Battalion US 319th Infantry Regiment who had captured in a fierce fight the night before from the F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade. The F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade StuG&rsquo;s and Sdkfz 251&rsquo;s would spearhead the attack.&#10;&#10;&#10;24 December 1944..... The Battle of the Bulge was only days old and Fritz Bayerlin&rsquo;s Panzer-Lehr Division pressing westward throughout the day. Kampfgruppe von Poschinger took St. Hubert without any resistance late that night. The advance continued towards the important road centre of Rochefort. Early the 23 December the town was shelled and a German reconnaissance patrol was sent in and reported that the town was empty. Rochefort was in fact well defended by some of the US 3rd Battalion, 335th Infantry Regiment reinforced by with Regimental anti-tank guns and one platoon each from the 638th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 309th Engineer Combat Battalion and 29th(Separate) Infantry Regiment. At about 0200 hours, Panzer-Lehr Division resumed the advance and was stopped by intense crossfire. Bayerlin was forced to set up a systematic and time-consuming attack. The American defenders fought back stubbornly from house to house. The Panzer Lehr&rsquo;s field guns were brought up to pound the eastern approaches. Then supported by weight of Panthers the Grenadiers of Poschinger&rsquo;s Kampfgruppe launched their assault crossing the L&rsquo;homme River by early afternoon.&#10;&#10;&#10;24 December 1944..... The intention was to cut the Hotton-Marche road capture Marche and advance toward Ciney on the right flank of Panzer Division 2. Brigadier General Boiling&rsquo;s US 84th Infantry Division had deployed along a 12-mile defensive front from Hotton to Jamodenne west of Marche. Von Waldenburg began his attack towards the Hotton-Marche road by infiltrating two companies of his Aufkl&auml;rung-Abteilung 146 through the woods southwest of Verdenne on a ridge just to the north of the village. This lay at the junction of the 84th Infantry Division&rsquo;s 334th and 335th Regiments outflanking them both. They were detected and thrown back in an American counter attack at noon on Christmas Eve. At the same time Oberst Voightsberger&rsquo;s Panzergrenadier Regiment 156 supported by five panzers from I/Panzer Regiment 16 launched the main assault against Verdenne.&#10;&#10;&#10;25 December 1944..... By midday of 23 December, Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm had reached Buissonville and by nightfall was just outside Ach&ecirc;ne, only 20 kilometres from the Meuse at Dinant. Montgomery was given command of Allied ground forces in the northern sector of the bulge, had begun deploying British forces to support the American defences and the under strength 3rd Royal Tank Regiment was now at Dinant. During the night 23-24 December, patrols scouted out the positions of Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm and shellfire began rain down around Foy-Notre-Dame. Sherman Fireflies with high-velocity 17-pounder guns took a toll on the Panthers on Christmas Eve blocking von B&ouml;hm&rsquo;s planned attack towards Anseremme, just south of Dinant. For Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm things turned from bad to worst as low on fuel and ammunition and now cut off with no realistic chance of resupply, the Allies struck.&#10;&#10;30 December 1944..... The forces immediately facing Generalleutnant Karl Decker&rsquo;s XXXIX Korps were the under strength US 134th Infantry Regiment of the 35th Infantry Division around Lutrebois and the US 137th Regiment around Villers-la-Bonne-Eau with companies K and L actually in the village itself. The attack on Villers-la-Bonne-Eau began at 0445 hours on 30 December with Fallschirm Regiment 14 leading companies closely following the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s attached 501 schwere SS-Panzer Abteilung seven Tiger II&rsquo;s.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The 2nd Lone Canuck ASL scenario module for the famed German Grossdeutschland unit.   These 8 scenarios cover actions on the eastern front.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules required.&#10;&#10;1 July 1942... 0630-hrs Panzer Battalion Grossdeutschland had already successfully repulsed the early morning Soviet tank attack. When the 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron reached the high ground to the north of the small village of Kulewka. There it observed a force of seven Russian light tanks laden with infantry moving into and occupying the village. The German halftracks loaded with infantry roared into the opposite end of the village...&#10;&#10;&#10;2 July 1942... Infantry Regiment GD 2 of the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland reported no significant combat operations along the southern flank. This was soon too change. A divisional order, which was issued during the night of 1-2 July, ordered Infantry Regiment GD 2 to eliminate a dangerous flanking threat to the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland and Panzer Division 24 prior to them proceeding with the advance. Early on the sunny morning of 2 July, the infantry moved towards Gorschetschnoje from the north...&#10;&#10;&#10;22 September 1942... The Operation was named &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; and was undertaken by the 2nd and 3rd Companies of the Sturm-Pioniere Battalions GD and supported by the Artillery Regiment GD. The artillery observers were directly assigned to accompany the pioneers on the assault and would then be able to call in fire in support immediately, meanwhile the Sturm-pionieres, armed with satchel charges, hand grenades, flamethrowers, spades and knives would clear out the bunkers..&#10;&#10;&#10;30 September 1942... This would be last day Infantry Division 72 and the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland would carried out offensive operations, albeit with limited objectives. On the right was Kampfgruppe Grosser consisting of the 1st and 3rd Battalions of Infantry Regiment 2 GD supported by the Panzer Battalion GD. The infantry moved forward as the artillery opened fire. Despite heavy defensive fire from the other side, the attack made good progress. Oberst Garski personally directed the infantry's assault on the position from the turret of a command tank, using it's radio to direct the artillery on the dug-in Soviet positions...&#10;&#10;&#10;27 November 1942... The Soviet offensive began on 24 November 1942 as expected without immediately revealing its points of main effort, however. Instead, the Soviets applied pressure all along the German Ninth Army's front, hoping to find the weakest spots in the German main line of resistance. These were revealed in the afternoon, when alarming reports of significant breakthroughs came in from the area south of Bely, in the Luchesa Valley. The result of the large number of reports coming in from all sectors of the XXIII Army Corps was the hasty alerting of the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland and an order to send individual Kampfgruppe as Fire Brigades to the threatened points...&#10;&#10;&#10;1 December 1942... Saw the heaviest fighting for the Grossdeutschland Division in the Luchesa Valley. Three Soviet Divisions began attacking at dawn. Following very thorough artillery preparation the tanks and infantry began their advance against the German strongpoints. Numerous Soviet tanks, some with mounted infantry streamed out of the woods. The way to main road, the lifeline not only of the Grossdeutschland Division, but the entire German Ninth Army again appeared to be open before the Russian advance...&#10;&#10;&#10;10 February 1943... On 14 January 1943, the Soviet launched their third attack across the Don towards the Donets, the full weight of which mainly struck the Hungarian Second Army. The desired breakthrough was achieved quickly simultaneously roll up the Hungarian divisions along the Don north of the breakthrough point from the south. The Soviets spearheads veered north and Northwest on a broad front, placing the German Second Army in extreme danger...&#10;&#10;&#10;14 March 1943... The Red Army's assault which came in during the bitterly cold night of 18 February struck and rolled over the remnants of a Grenadier company of the Grossdeutschland. The Soviet juggernaut continued to advance along a string of victories towards the Dnieper. Victory had beckoned to them across that great river...&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But also fun to play with adults.&#10;&#10;Every player has a hen house with nests in four different colours, each filled with 1, 2 or 3 eggs. There are two dice: one with numbers and one with colours. In the middle of the table lies the egg.&#10;On your turn you throw both dice. Each player who has a nest that matches colour and number of eggs and still without a chicken, tries to grab the egg in the middle. If so he can put a chicken on the nest. If someone catches the egg by mistake, he has to return a hen. When the die shows a feather, the player can take a chicken from an opponent.&#10;&#10;The first to bring nine chickens in his hen house is the winner.&#10;&#10;Content: 4 hen houses, 36 nests, 36 hens, 2 dice, 1 egg.&#10;&#10;",

Weeks ago, military authorities at (the new) Fort Bent sent out a small party of six cavalry soldiers to punish raiders for stealing sheep, kidnapping women and children, and murdering men from American settlements. But it's been too long, and the cavalry soldiers have not returned. It is your job to find them, or at least find out what happened to them.&#10;&#10;Your first stop is the Smith settlement, one of the victims of the raiders. There you will meet Mrs. Smith and her four children and garner whatever information available.&#10;&#10;It is now October 15, and by November 30th, you must be passing back southward through the Smith settlement to escape the raging blizzards of winter. It has already snowed in the highest mountain passes, and travel may soon be curtailed, if not shut down completely. You must move quickly, before it is too late.&#10;&#10;Beginner: 32 point characters&#10;&#10;",

Do you red-line your car and risk blowing your engine, or do you subscribe to the theory &quot;slow and steady wins the race&quot;?  Do you take the corners sharply, risking a spin-out or worse, a blow-out?  Will you pit and repair or go for broke on the hopes your car holds out?  The choices are yours to make.  Going The Distance combines the edge of your seat thrills of auto racing with easy, yet strategic, boardgame mechanics.&#10;&#10;Going the Distance is a dice-driven auto racing game.  Each player controls up to three cars that have mechanical and tire attributes recorded on a roster sheet.  The players elect to roll between three and five specially marked six-sided die to generate movement and maneuver for each phase of a turn.  Unique to this racing game is an &quot;all move&quot; portion of the turn sequence where all cars advance on a designated six-sided die roll.&#10;&#10;The game can use either stock cars or open wheeled racing cars as playing pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Soldier Chess rules modify Olde Chess to transform your pieces into a modern US Army Brigade, with you as the Brigade Commander. These rules can be used selectively to tweak the game a bit, or to overhaul the entire look and feel of Olde Chess. While playing, you will learn valuable US Army tactical concepts like Relative Combat Power, Combat Resolution, Decision Points, High Payoff Targets, Fragmentary Orders, Named Areas of Interest, Priority Intelligence Requirements, Fragmentary Orders, flank and rear attacks, counter-attacks, supporting an assault by fire, and the positive effects of good Non-Commissioned officer leadership. You will have a greater appreciation for the effects of terrain, and a greater understanding of the contributions of the various Battlefield Operation Systems. The effects of Murphy&rsquo;s Laws of War will ensure that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong... and level the playing field between new and experienced players.&#10;And you don&rsquo;t have to play all the rules all the time! Negotiate with the Enemy Brigade Commander and play just the rules you want.&#10;&#10;Description taken from http://s2company.com/chess/&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tarot Probability is played with cards 1-21 and the Excuse, or Fool, from a typical tarot deck.  Deal is determined randomly.  There are four phases in each round.  In the first phase, five cards are dealt.  The player to the dealer's left bids on how many tricks she can take.  Bidding continues for all players, clockwise, until the dealer is reached.  The dealer can then bid any number of cards, EXCEPT whatever number would make the total number of bids equal to the number of cards dealt.  For example, in the first phase of a four player game, player one bids 2, player two bids 0, and player three bids 2.  Player four can then bid any number but 1, as that would equal five total bids, which is the number of cards dealt.&#10;&#10;The player sitting to the dealer's left also throws the first card.  Tricks are taken by the highest numerical card.  The Excuse can either be played as a &quot;win trick&quot; or &quot;lose trick&quot;.  Players who bid correctly gain 10 points, those one trick off from their bid score 0, those two tricks off score -10, those three tricks off score -20, those four tricks off score -30, and those five tricks off score -40.&#10;&#10;Phases in odd numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 5 cards, 4 cards, 3 cards, 2 cards, and 1 card placed on the forehead for all players but the card holder to see.  Even numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 2 cards placed on the forehead, 3 cards, 4 cards, and 5 cards.  The deal changes between each round.  When 2 cards are placed on the forehead, cards are still played singly, with the first card chosen randomly.&#10;&#10;Game length is variable, but typically ends after everyone has dealt twice.  The player with the most points wins.  In the event of a tie, a final two cards are dealt and placed on the foreheads of the tied players.  The final places are determined by the outcome of that hand.&#10;&#10;",

The box says it's a &quot;fascinating game&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each corner or the game board is marked - Bill, Button, Nannie, or Stubbie. There is a double-armed spinner.&#10;&#10;Each player selects two men of the same colour and places them in the corner to his right on the board. The aim is to get both men into the centre of the board first.&#10;&#10;The player with lowest sum total on the spinner starts the game.  Each player must spin a 5 on one arm of the spinner, or a total of 5, to move. Double 5s means he can move both men.&#10;&#10;A man moves out on a 5, then forward as many spaces as shown on the other arm of the spinner. Once out, the man is moved according to the numbers on one or both arms of the spinner. Certain spaces on the board allow a player to split the total of his spinner count. Exact count on both arms of the spinner is required to bring a man home.&#10;&#10;Landing on an opponent means he is &quot;butted off&quot; and has to start again, while the &quot;butt-er&quot; man moves forward 20 spaces. Like Ludo, if a player manages to get both men on the same space it is called a Block and no other player can pass. There are penalty spaces on the board (miss a turn, go back). Spinning a double allows a second turn. Three consecutive doubles sends the man closest to the centre of the board home again. And there are a few other rules to apply during play.&#10;&#10;",

Will you figure out how to neutralize it before it eats you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Space Monster is a cooperative exploration / suspense / combat game for one to five players. Your goal is to figure out the space monster&rsquo;s weaknesses and stop it before it eats everyone on the space station &ndash; including you! This brings up an important point: The game is actually only mostly cooperative. if things get really dire, you can make a run for the sole one-person escape pod. If you escape and the monster eats everyone else, you win!&#10;&#10;During play, you search the outpost for weapons and items to help you neutralize the monster.  You may also have to go to specific rooms to perform tasks, like restarting the failing generator, pumping up the life support system, or overriding the safety systems on the airlock.  Each player gets one action per turn and an allotment of movement points.  The monster also gets at least one action and move every turn.&#10;&#10;Space Monster uses a modular, card-based board, special powers for each player, a deck of special powers for the monster, and an unusual deck-based hit point system for the monster.  When the monster takes damage, it loses cards from its health deck.  When all damage is dealt, the instructions on the card on top the the discarded health cards tells you how the monster reacts.  If you draw the special Dying Gasp card, you know the monster is almost dead.&#10;&#10;Space Monster is a fairly complex game. As such, it is appropriate for ages 14 and up. A 4-player game takes about 60+ minutes to play, although your first game may take significantly longer.&#10;&#10;The rules, cards, and tokens you need to play are all available as a 240 KB PDF at http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/139/&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'The area that the Odyssey&sup2; may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of board and video games: The Master Strategy Series. The first game released was The Quest for the Rings!, with gameplay somewhat similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and a storyline reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings'. (from Wikipedia).&#10;&#10;Without explicitly mentioning names, this game presents itself as a playable sequel to the 'The Lord of the Rings'.&#10;&#10;This semi-cooperative game is a 'DVD' type board game (but done before invention of the DVD). The game is played on a game board, but battles are resolved using the Magnavox Odyssey&sup2; video game console.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, one player is determined to be the evil Ringmaster player: that player sets up the game board by strategically hiding the 10 'Ring' tokens under the (four secret types of) Castles, accompanying some of them with 'Nightmare' or 'Dragon' tokens.&#10;&#10;The game board is used to track the locations of the 10 hidden Rings, the castle types (dungeon, crystal cavern, shifting hall, or infernal inferno), and the monsters. Dragons, once revealed, can be moved to adjacent unoccupied castles by the Ringmaster. Movement on the board is point to point (city to city, or port to port).&#10;&#10;The (cooperating) hero players have a set number of turns (tracked via a token on the game board) to recover the 10 Rings of power; if they cannot, the Ringmaster wins.&#10;&#10;At the start of a battle, buttons are pushed corresponding to the state of the tokens on the game board: this programs a configuration (location and enemies) for each battle. The players have to choose which characters to use (max of two: wizard, warrior, phantom, or changeling) to enter each battle. The Ringmaster can spend from a limited supply of 'Possession' tokens to take over a character for a battle.&#10;&#10;In the two player version, one of the players plays both the Ringmaster and a hero, and has a modified rule-set for his allowed behaviors.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;Rulebook (full color)&#10;Game board (laminated hardboard)&#10;23 'Castle' tokens (raised-plastic): printed on underside as 4 types: Dungeons, Crystal Caverns, Infernoes, Shifting Halls - there is room under each Castle for two stacked metal tokens.&#10;17 round tokens (raised-metal !): 3 Dragon, 3 Nightmare, 10 Rings, 1 Quest&#10;1 rectangular 'Hourglass' token (plasticard?)&#10;8 rectangular 'Possessions' tokens (plasticard?)&#10;1 Keyboard Overlay (laminated)&#10;1 Magnavox Odyssey&sup2; game cartridge&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "San Ren Xiang Qi is a variant of Xiangqi with a special board for three players.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is mentioned in H.J.R. Murray's book &quot;A History of Chess&quot; on pages 133-134.  He writes:&#10;&#10;There are also enlarged games of chess in China.  One of these is the San-kwo-k'i, or Game of the Three Kingdoms, which is described by v. M&ouml;llen-dorf.  It is supposed to illustrate the war of the Three Kindoms, wei (blue), Shu (red), and Wu (green), A.D. 221-64.  I give a diagram of the board; it will be noticed that the lines are not straight throughout, and that each kingdom faces the other two.  The pieces consist of the usual 16 with, in addition, 2 new pieces [F] in each of the three armies.  These are called: Red, Chuo (fire); Blue , Ch'i (banner); Green, Feng (wind).  Their move is an extended Kt's leap, viz. two steps vertically or horizontally and then one diagonally.  The game is said to be very complicated and difficult, but is not considered as interesting as the ordinary chess.  When one of the Generals, who are named Wei, Shu, and Wu after the names of the three kingdoms, is mated, the player who has mated him removes the King from the board and adds the remainder of his army to his own.&#10;&#10;The diagram he mentions can be found in the images section of this games entry page.&#10;&#10;",

Every unit in the game gets a 1 to N action points that allow it to fire a weapon, do forward observation, move at top speed or even do electronic warfare. Movement does not require action points.&#10;&#10;The game also provides the players with a pool of Command Points that can be transferred from the commander unit  automatically if within Auto Comms radius or by using a communications event. Communications events can be stopped by using Electronic Warfare's Electronic Counter Measures with a unit that has ECM equipment. Electronic Warfare, Attacks and Defense are based on opposed skill roll. The skill ratings translate to the number of dice rolled with the highest number being the result (two sixes translate to seven, three sixes to 8, etc.).&#10;&#10;The game is well supported by DP9 and its fans. There are design tools available in the the DP9 website. The miniatures available for the game are of the highest quality and they have actually been nominated for awards. The game provides and abstracted system for aircraft and artillery support.   It could have been called Heavy Gear Blitz 2.0, but it is sufficiently different from the original Heavy Gear Blitz to merit the Locked and Loaded subtitle instead of a 2.0.&#10;&#10;Major differences from the original are:&#10;&#10;1) Only one weapon per unit per turn even if it has more than one action.&#10;&#10;2) Top speed movement now requires an action point.&#10;&#10;3) STUN counters to signify results of a stunned pilot.&#10;&#10;4)  Drones have been simplified and now become extra characteristics of the controlling unit&#10;&#10;5) Army building is now based on the allowed units for a particular Priority Level.&#10;&#10;6) Priority Levels also define Support Points that can be used to buy Aircraft, Artillery, Defensive Structures or even more Command Points.&#10;The rulebook is very well organized and the support in the forums in the DP9 websites help the neophyte players immensely.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game was published by Club Nathan in 1981, was for 2-4 players, 10 years and up and took about 30 minutes to play.  The principal mechanic is memory/memorization.  On turn, a player would roll the dice and pick up one of the disks, attempting to MATCH the number underneath with the value of the dice roll.  The disk would then be replaced on a different spot than the one it was picked up from.  If successful, the player would move the same colored tile down one row towards the bottom and go again.  Get 3 tiles off the board to win.&#10;&#10;The numbers on the disks were 4 to 10.  Rolls of 3 and 11 permitted a peek underneath any disk.  A roll of 2 would allow a match of any low numbered disk (4,5,6) and a roll of 12 allowed a match of any high numbered disk (8,9,10).&#10;&#10;",

Had the empire somehow survived the Great War, through diplomatic or military means, she would have entered the crisis of 1939 as a considerable force at sea. &#10;       &#10;Imperial and Royal Navy is a Second World War at Sea supplement exploring the possibilities of this alternate history. It has everything you expect in a naval game supplement: scenarios, ship data sheets, and playing pieces.&#10;&#10;The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by this unlikely fleet. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bomb Alley to enjoy most of the scenarios, and Eastern Fleet, Arctic Convoy and Bismarck to play all of them.&#10;&#10;Imperial and Royal Navy was originally sold exclusively via PDF download.  In 2011 a printed edition with die-cut counters was published.  The supplement will be re-implemented in 2014 as SWWAS: The Habsburg Fleet, adding more ships and a set of scenarios aligned with the Second Great War at Sea story arc.&#10;&#10;",

This is a game of intrigue and suspense with every play a challenge of wits and skill From the Hawaiian Eye synopsis: Set against the beautiful tropical landscape of Honolulu, Hawaii, this series centered around the cases of Hawaiian Eye Private Investigations and the two handsome, slick, tough-guy detectives who ran the firm - Thomas Jefferson Lopaka (Robert Conrad), or Tom for short, and Tracy Steele (Anthony Eisley), a Korean War veteran and former city police detective. They operated out of a swank office at the Hawaiian Village Hotel, where they were also the house detectives. Assisting them occasionally was a funny, ukelele-strumming Hawaiian taxi driver named Kazuo Kim (Poncie Ponce), whose wardrobe - consisting of a straw hat and crazy Hawaiian shirts - and numerous relatives living all over the Hawaiian Islands willing to help his employers if they needed it, provided invaluable comic relief. They were also aided by a dim-bulbed, scatter-brained, flippant nightclub singer and photographer named Chryseis &quot;Cricket&quot; Blake (Connie Stevens).&#10;&#10;",

It portrays historical events in Japan, Korea, and China from the collapse of the Han Dynasty shortly before 200 until around 1500. It is designed for 3 to 5 players. Regional powers like the Mongol empire, the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Nippon, Annam, Nanchao, and several Chinese dynasties can be depicted in the game.&#10;&#10;The game uses plastic playing pieces to represent armies, fleets, temples, monuments, cities, independent kingdoms, and tribute collected from a conquered province. The map uses area movement with terrain features including the Great Wall, forests, and mountains.&#10;&#10;Protector of the Empire is not intended to be a strict simulation of history but it attempts to capture the flavor of this fascinating period.&#10;&#10;The game contains familiar concepts common to many strategy games and is slightly more complex than Risk or Axis &amp; Allies. However, rules which might seem quite simple can often present subtle challenges to even the most experienced wargame players.&#10;&#10;",

The inventor, Zheng Chenggong (1624-62), a general of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), stationed his army in Xiamen. Zheng was determined to recover Taiwan, which was occupied by Dutch invaders since 1624.&#10;&#10;When the Mid-Autumn Festival came, the soldiers naturally missed their families but fought with heroic determination to drive off the aggressors.&#10;&#10;General Zheng and his lower officer Hong Xu invented bo bing to help relieve homesickness among the troops.&#10;&#10;",
