If one of them fails, the turn is immediately passed on to the next player. If you turn over a green tea tile, take that tile and turn over another tile again. The obtained green tea tile can be used to inspect another tile at any time during the player's turn. When one player completes the number of sushi set according to the number of people, one round ends, and the person who earned the specified goal round score first wins the game.&#10;Sushi holic comes in two editions: 'Maguro edition' and 'Tamago edition' which have different material tiles but same rule.

The players use their cats and magical items to advance and hope to win the race. After several races, the player with the fewest negative points wins.&#10;&#10;Players move by using poker-style hands: two pairs, three of a kind, three card straight flush, and four card straight flush. Players draw cards from a draw deck or in order from other players' discard piles. The players can use their cat to reserve cards for their next turn.&#10;&#10;The winner of a race earns no points.

As the hordes multiplied, conflict became commonplace, splintering the population into rival citadels. Eventually, war, greed, and the depletion of resources pushed Fantos to the brink of destruction, and in response to the planet's cry for help, Zodraz, the Cosmic Warden, intervened, sentencing the planet to a great cull to be survived by only a single worthy citadel.&#10;&#10;Fate of Fantos: The Iridium Wars is a tableau-building card game with competitive and co-operative elements for 3-6 players, each assuming the role of a unique citadel of Fantos. Each are responsible for hiring acolytes to manage their affairs, with the ultimate goal of obtaining the most Iridium, and therefore the most favorable position when Zodraz finally arrives.&#10;&#10;Citadels must manage their Iridium harvesting strategically, however, as it further contributes to the pollution of Fantos, revealing new trials along the way. Zodraz also unleashes plagues, summons cosmic creatures, and forces dissent between the citadels as the game progresses. Citadels must choose whether to resolve them together as a planet, or watch as rival citadels struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Sheets &amp; Giggles Game is a party game for adults with 4 rounds of hilarious, inappropriate, action-packed word play and innuendos considered offensive by most. You and your team will describe outrageous words and phrases, act them out, give one-word hints, then act them out again under a sheet. Score points by quickly getting your team to guess cards correctly while using the rule for each round.&#10;&#10;FOREPLAY: SETTING UP&#10;Step 1:&#10;Split into teams&ndash; ideally 2 teams of 3 to 6 people.&#10;&#10;Step 2:&#10;The game should consist of about 45 cards total. To start, everyone gets 10 random cards and places a few of their favorites face down in a pile until there are enough.&#10;&#10;HINT: Don&rsquo;t share your cards with anyone, even the other players on your team!&#10;&#10;HINT: The number of olives indicates the dirtiness of the card. The more olives, the dirtier it is.&#10;&#10;Step 3:&#10;Combine and shuffle all chosen cards from both teams into one pile &amp; put them face down on a table, in a bowl, or in the box. All cards, regardless of who chose them, will be used by both teams.&#10;&#10;Step 4:&#10;Choose your least favorite people to keep score and time.&#10;&#10;DOING IT: HOW TO PLAY&#10;Each Sheet Head gets a 60 second turn to try to get their team to guess as many cards as possible using the rule for that round. Once a card is drawn, it must either be guessed correctly or returned to the pile when time expires. Teams take turns guessing cards &ndash; every member of a team should take their turn as Sheet Head before any teammate repeats.&#10;&#10;Each of the 4 rounds end after all cards are guessed correctly. To start the next round, reshuffle all the cards and continue in the order you left off.&#10;&#10;HINT: If your memory sucks, read the cards aloud after the first round.&#10;&#10;THE POSITIONS&#10;Round 1: Sheet Talking&#10;Sheet Heads get their team to guess the card without saying any part of the words on the card.&#10;&#10;Do&rsquo;s: Speaking &ndash; Like texting, but with your mouth.&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;ts: Act, gesture, rhyme, spell, abbreviate, say any part of a word on the card.&#10;&#10;Round 2: Be Charade, Be Very Charade!&#10;Sheet Heads get their team to guess the card by acting. This should sound familiar.&#10;&#10;Do&rsquo;s: Act, Gesture, Point.&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;ts: Talk, make noises, spell with your hands.&#10;&#10;Round 3: The S-Word&#10;Players get their team to guess the card by saying only ONE word. This is more challenging than you Sheet Heads think.&#10;&#10;Do&rsquo;s: Say ONE word, use different Inflections, use accents.&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;ts: Say another word, mouth other words, gestures, rhyming, Use a word or part of a word on the card, suck.&#10;&#10;Round 4: Sheet Show&#10;The Sheet Head puts a sheet over their head and acts out the clues.&#10;&#10;Do&rsquo;s: Act out the card under the sheet, you Dumb Sheet.&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;ts: Talk, come out from under the sheet, make noises.&#10;&#10;THE CLIMAX: HOW TO WIN&#10;The team with the most correctly guessed cards after all 4 rounds wins. We don&rsquo;t care how you keep score, but tally scoring or collecting correctly guessed cards does the job.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A stolen ATE card is two points. A skipped ATE card (The Mandator is only allowed to skip one ATE card per turn) is minus two points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when each player on a team has performed as the Mandator twice.

    "Description": "Summary:&#10;&#10;The king has organized a royal ball, at the end of which the princess is going to finally choose a husband. Players begin with 4 cards each, playing 1 card on the table each round. The cards in the deck represent different guests attending the ball, each with their own unique ability. Use these to peek at, trade, or steal cards from other players. The two players holding the &quot;Princess&quot; and &quot;Prince Edward&quot; cards during the final round are declared the winners.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by anywhere from 4 to 8 people, but some cards are used only if you have enough players. This means bigger groups will result in new abilities, forcing players to change up their strategy.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;1. Deal 4 cards to each player.&#10;2. The player holding the &quot;Princess&quot; card must flip her over so everyone can see.&#10;3. All players choose 1 card from their hand and place it face down on the table.&#10;4. The player holding the &quot;Princess&quot; flips over their chosen card and carries out its ability.&#10;5. Continue clockwise around the table, each player activating their card's ability.&#10;6. Once all players are finished, the round ends.&#10;7. Repeat steps 3-6 two more times.&#10;8. When all players have 1 card remaining, everyone places their cards face-up on the table. The 2 players holding the &quot;Princess&quot; and &quot;Prince Edward&quot; cards during the final round are declared the winners.&#10;&#10;Will you aim for the &quot;Princess&quot; knowing everyone at the table can see exactly where she is? She is sure to draw the attention of other players, moving back and forth just like she would in a dance hall.&#10;&#10;Or will you instead try your luck and search for &quot;Prince Edward&quot; instead? Some guests will give players the ability to pinpoint where he is hiding!&#10;&#10;&#10;Various card effects:&#10;Baron: All players take a random card from the hand of the player to their right.&#10;Wizard: Trade your entire hand with another player.&#10;Foreign Royal: Choose a card from your hand and trade it for the Princess.&#10;Priest: You are exempt from all actions that affect a player's hand until your next turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description by Raw Potions Publishing, publisher of the English localization&#10;&#10;",

The darker the shadow becomes, the worse the world gets until the Destroyer of Worlds finally emerges from the Void to devour and destroy everything. Are these the end times as foretold? &#10;Perhaps. Perhaps not.&#10;&#10;Across the lands of R&ucirc;l, great patrons have come forth to answer the threat of the Eternal Shadow in a desperate bid to throw back the darkness and seal the rifts to the Demon Lord&rsquo;s realm. The Great Druid rouses the forests to fight back against demon and cultist, while the Queen of the Fey rallies the last of her children to stand against the horrors loosed by the growing unrest. These and others come together to find the light that is needed to safeguard Urth for the rest of time.&#10;     &#10;     In this game, you play a patron, one of the great powers of R&ucirc;l, working to halt the demonic threat. You do this by recruiting heroes and sending them into deadly circumstances, to defeat demons and the vile cultists who summon them, to slay beasts, and to protect the failing light in the face of the encroaching shadow. &#10;     You win the game if the light reaches its goal before the shadow. You lose if the shadow reaches its goal before the light, or if four breach cards are in play.&#10;     Against the Shadow is a cooperative game, best played with two to five players. A typical game takes about an hour to finish.&#10;&#10;",

The highest card played in a non-lead suit will win the trick, with the tie going to the later card.  The winner collects all cards played to the trick.&#10;&#10;The cards won go towards increasing the size of that player's &quot;slime&quot;.  However, at the end of a hand, players will score points for the size of their slime (sum of the collected ranks) in relation to 100.  Points earned can be 0, 1, 2, 4 or 6.  For instance, if the sum of the player's cards won is larger than 100, the slime has collapsed and a player only receives 1 point.  If multiple players have a size less than 100, then the smallest of these is declared the Worst of the Small Slime and earns 0 points.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 3 hands and the player with the highest cumulative points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Players that don't want to or cannot play a costumed mascot play a visitor instead, face-up as a discard. The winner of the auction collects visitors fom the other players, and sets the next trump colour.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the players get points for the visitors they have earned, and a bonus for colour majorities.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of cards 1-15 in 4 colors. Ranks 1-8 are &quot;Visitor&quot; cards, and ranks 9-15 may either be a &quot;Visitor&quot; card of rank 9-15 or rotated 180 degrees to be a &quot;Costumed&quot; card of rank 1-3. The game also comes with bidding chips which are distributed to the players.&#10;&#10;The lead player has the option of starting a &quot;Visitor&quot; trick or a &quot;Costumed&quot; bid. A &quot;Visitor&quot; trick proceeds as a standard trick-taking game with players each playing a card from their hand (following suit if possible), and the winner being the player that played the highest ranked trump card, and if none were played, the highest ranked card in the lead suit.&#10;&#10;In a &quot;Costumed&quot; bid, any player, including the lead player, that plays a &quot;Costumed&quot; card, plays it face down. Such players can also add up to 3 of their bidding chips to their card. Any player who does not want to or cannot play a &quot;Costumed&quot; card instead plays a &quot;Visitor&quot; card face up. At the end of the trick, the highest combined value of chips and &quot;Costumed&quot; card takes the trick, with the latter played breaking ties. The trump suit for &quot;Visitor&quot; rounds is determined by the last &quot;Costumed&quot; card color to win a &quot;Costumed&quot; trick.&#10;&#10;The winner of the &quot;Costumed&quot; trick chooses between scoring all &quot;Visitor&quot; cards played to the trick that match the color of the winning costume or acquiring cards of this color from in front of the other players.&#10;&#10;Players play a predetermined number of rounds, with the rules suggesting 3. Points are earned based upon the visitors scored during &quot;Costumed&quot; tricks and the number of colors of visitors obtained during &quot;Visitor&quot; tricks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Baratheons have held dominion over the Seven Kingdoms since Robert Baratheon seized the Iron Throne in open rebellion. This makes House Baratheon the most powerful House in Westeros, but it also means the Baratheons must constantly guard against the schemes of those who would threaten their throne. The threats come not only from other Houses, but also from within: as Renly Baratheon raises an army in the south, his brother Stannis turns to a new faith on Dragonstone. But if you can unite the brothers under your command, Westeros is sure to be yours!&#10;&#10;Fury of the Storm is a deluxe expansion for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game that shines the spotlight on House Baratheon, the rulers of the Seven Kingdoms in the opening of George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series. This expansion provides you with 156 cards, including new versions of powerful characters like brothers Robert, Stannis, and Renly Baratheon and cards that explore the King and R&rsquo;hllor traits. But the Baratheons are the only ones to gain new tools. Every House in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is represented here, gaining new House cards and a collection of neutral cards that any leader can use to their advantage.&#10;&#10;Now, as Westeros threatens to fall into chaos, House Baratheon will come together bring their full force down upon those who would defy their rule. They will not surrender their power, and all who stand against them will see that theirs is the fury!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description by the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The scenarios all include German units from the 1st SS Panzerdivision Leibstandarte Division Normandie&#10;&#10;These scenarios tend to be a mix of medium and large numbers of troops.

The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte is rushed into a blocking position unseen by Allied observers and waits in ambush, directly in the path of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment.Map Boards: 2, Overlays: 3, Turns: 7&#10;     LSSAH 43 - Solders, France, 18 July 1944: Despite heavy losses, Operation GOODWOOD continued to grind its way forward, the battlefield littered with burning hulls of the British 11th Armoured Division. Shortly after midday, the 2/Fife and Forfar Yeomanry is ordered to capture the Bourg&eacute;bus Ridge; simultaneously, the 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte is ordered to counterattack. Map Boards: 3, Overlays: 1, Turns: 7&frac12;&#10;     LSSAH 44 - Tilly-la-Campagne, France, 25 July 1944: The Americans had launched Operation COBRA, at the same the Canadians had launched Operation SPRING; its objective to capture Point 122. On route the Canadians had to first clear Tilly-la-Campagne, where hidden among the smoulder ruins were the Pioniers, Panzergrenadiers, and Panzers the 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte. Map Boards: 2, Turns: 7&#10;     LSSAH 45 - Saint Barthelemy, France, 7 August 1944: The Germans launched Operation L&Uuml;TTICH, its objective to recapture Avranches and cut-off Patton's 3rd Army spilling into Brittiany. In the foggy morning hours, 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte drove into Saint Barthelemy fully expecting the village to be cleared earlier by 2.Panzerdivision; but as the fog lifted, the lead elements found themselves fighting in close quarters with GIs of the 117th Infantry Regiment. Map Boards: 4, Overlays: 1, Turns: 7&frac12; &#10;     LSSAH 46 - Saint Barthelemy, France, 9 August 1944: The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte attack ground to a halt.

The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte received orders to hold open the narrowing corridor to allow the what was left of the 7th Army to withdraw out of the collapsing pocket. Map Boards: 4, Turns: 7&frac12;&#10;     LSSAH 48 - Saint-Lambert, France, 20 August 1944: The Allies' noose was tightening about the neck of the Falaise Pocket.

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player.

The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins. Watch out, though -- because an animal can charge and wound you if you get too close! A few special cards can spice things up, too.&#10;&#10;Both players secretly &ldquo;bid&rdquo; on which of two areas they want to visit. To do this, they choose one or two Animal cards with coins to influence their safari guide.&#10;&#10;The card(s) are then revealed and the player with the higher total of coins chooses where the hunt will take place; i.e., which area will be visited. This player then plays another Animal card from his hand, which must match the chosen terrain, and rolls the die. If it falls within the range (1, 1-2 or 1-3) on the card then his shot is successful and he retains this card and its VPs, visible to both players.&#10;&#10;Play continues over three decks, and a winner is determined. A 3-point bonus goes to a player if he shoots all of the Big Five.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Our humorous illustrations bring the cards to life.&#10;To win, you must get rid of all of your cards, while holding on to the Rotten card. This proves you are the most rotten of them all!&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;This game is for 2-4 players, ages &quot;18&quot; and over. &#10;Every player is dealt with five cards. The rest of the deck is placed face down. Keep space next to the deck for the discard pile.&#10;&#10;How do you play?&#10;The most rotten person starts the game and the gameplay follows a clockwise direction.           &#10;For your turn, you can play any card in your hand by putting it in the discard pile. You take the action that is on the card. If you don't have a card that you want to play, then you draw from the deck as your turn.&#10;&#10;When you start the game, the rotten card can only be one of 3 places. In your hand, in someone else&rsquo;s hand or in the deck. During your turn, you will play a card in your hand and do that action. So if you think that one of your friends has &quot;the rotten card&quot;? You can &ldquo;steal&rdquo; a card or &ldquo;swap hands&rdquo;. If you think that the card is in the deck? You can play &ldquo;Grab Four, you whore!&rdquo; and take 4 from the deck in hopes of pulling the rotten card. &#10;What if you have the rotten card? It&rsquo;s time to try to get rid of all of the other cards.&#10;Maybe play a &ldquo;dump&rdquo; card and give your shit to someone else. Oh and remember, if you have the rotten card, it&rsquo;s best to keep a poker face&#10;&#10;How do you win?&#10;You WIN when the only card you have left is the ROTTEN card.&#10;&#10;To get the ROTTEN card: you will steal cards, draw cards, swap cards, grab cards, dump cards, burn cards and do whatever it takes to get&hellip;.and keep the ROTTEN card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

He's one of the largest Big Guys available to any team, and the fact he stands with Halflings only makes him more impressive. Though his services don't come cheap for an up-and-coming team, if you want to win with the Greenfield Grasshuggers you'll find his strength and toughness too tempting to pass up.&#10;&#10;This finely-detailed resin model is supplied in 25 components, including a 40mm round base. You'll enjoy looking for tiny details tucked away in various nooks and crannies, hinting at both his venerable history, and the forests he calls home. Deeproot Strongbranch is only available to play for Halfling teams. You can find all the rules you need to use him in your games of Blood Bowl in the 5th issue of Spike!

However, this Hall of Famer forged his legend on the gridiron, cracking skulls and tearing off limbs with nothing more that brute strength and a hyper-belligerent attitude.&#10;&#10;Lord Borak is an excellent all-rounder on the pitch, with a Strength to rival Big Guys and an Agility that means even ball-handling isn't out of the question. The miniature sees Borak giving a thumbs up to his adoring fans. Around his neck is his lucky set of talismans, displaying the symbols of the four Dark Gods and a Chaos Star.&#10;&#10;Lord Borak the Despoiler is a 10-part resin miniature and is supplied with a 32mm Blood Bowl Round Base and a resin Blood Bowl token, with Lord Borak's icon on one side.&#10;&#10;Coaches of Chaos Chosen and Nurgle teams can recruit Lord Borak the Despoiler using the rules found in the Blood Bowl Almanac 2018.&#10;&#10;Key Features:&#10;&#10;     One of Blood Bowl&rsquo;s most (in)famous Star Players&#10;     Can be included in Chaos Chosen and Nurgle teams&#10;     A strong but well-rounded player&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game will come with several full-fledged campaigns and can be played from 1 to 10 players (or more). The campaign is built in such a way that the players can play different stages at the same table or individually at home, and update the state of the game/world based on their progress. It's possible to drop out or jump into any game at any time, as each player controls their own army/faction. The game can adapt to any situation on the fly, without the need to restart or wait for each other. The game will come with an app, so you will be able to engage in a campaign with anyone around the world.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on a never before used (in boardgames) high-fantasy IP that will be revealed later next year.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Following the nation's fate, the Navy was also split in two.
