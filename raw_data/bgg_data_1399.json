Its max speed is only 1 and its armor values are V, IV and III. On the front, it has a turrent with a double-barreled gun that shoots in three directions and has a value of V and in the back there is a smaller turret with another cannon (III) that shoots in three directions backwards. Like the Twin-gun Tank, the UT can also shoot at two targets simultaneously. On top of that, being a heavy means that it can destroy tree-type obstacles.&#10;&#10;The Armed Off-road vehicle (AO) is the fastest piece in the game (max. 7 speed). The AO movement is different from the other pieces: it does not lose movement steps due to turning. Because of this, it can move even further, but at the same time it cannot rotate in place. Therefore, in each step this piece can move to a square that is right in front or to the squares that are left or right to that square.&#10;When moving backwards, just like any other piece, Armed Off-road vehicle can only move once to the square that is right behind. But in this situation it may also turn at 45 degrees simultaneously (left or right).&#10;The AO does not have any armour (0, 0, 0), and it has a recoilless gun that can shoot only right in front due to the mounting. The gun is weak(it has a value of I) and its range is limited to 5 squares (even though it can shoot over obstacles), which is another distinctive feature.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rules&#10;&#10;",

The rules are intended for battles between 15 and 30 tanks per side, plus 4 or 5 HQ tanks. This means, in game terms, that each player will command one or more companies of tanks organized into several platoons.&#10;&#10;In Armoured Storm, you take the role of a commander first and a gunner/driver second. Your ability to give the right orders at the right time and bring your available firepower to bear more efficiently than your opponent, are more important at the level of command you&rsquo;re representing. Out-thinking your opponent by being clear about your goals and through clever use of the Tactics Chart will bring you success.&#10;Armoured Storm is in part inspired by the historical armoured battles of the Desert War &ndash; there are some excellent first-hand accounts of this &ndash; but also by the gung-ho action encountered in British and American comics.&#10;&#10;THE &lsquo;YOU COMMAND&rsquo; SERIES&#10;&lsquo;You Command&rsquo; is a series of light wargames by Daniel Mersey. When you play a &lsquo;You Command&rsquo; game, your goal is to defeat your opponent by out-thinking them tactically using the innovative Tactics Chart, and then by out-fighting their model army on the tabletop battlefield.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But, if an Unluckable absorbs too much, they turn from playful candy loving creatures into trick playing pranksters.&#10;&#10;Adopt Unluckables, play tricks, activate unique abilities and do your best to avoid the perils of Unluck.&#10;&#10;The first player to end a round with 13+ Skellies, wins!&#10;&#10;(additional win conditions included for increased challenge and excitement)&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;Each player will choose a uniquely colored Home card, which always produces 1 Skellie, and set it face up on the table in front of them. This table space will now be referred to as your &ldquo;Home.&rdquo; All adopted Unluckable, as well as certain Luck or Unluck cards with the &ldquo;Hold&rdquo; symbol, will be played into your Home.&#10;&#10;Congratulations! If you are the first person at the table to read these instructions, you are now designated as the First Player. Deal 3 Luck cards face down to each player. They may look at their cards, but must keep them secret from all other players. After the first player ends their turn, play will continue clockwise around the table until all players have performed their actions. At the start of each new round the First Player will rotate clockwise.&#10;&#10;STARTING THE GAME:&#10;Starting with the First Player, you have 3 actions to perform each round. Available actions are:&#10;&#10;Draw: Draw the top card of the Luck deck and add it to your hand.&#10;&#10;Play: Play a Item, Trick or Support card from your hand.&#10;&#10;Adopt: If you are able to meet the Skellie cost of an Unluckable indicated in the star symbol on the top left of the card, place it into your Home. You must draw and resolve Unluck cards up to the number indicated in the bat symbol on the top right corner.&#10;&#10;Release: Discard any number of Unluckables and reduce the cost of adopting by their Skellie value until the end of your current turn. (adopting will require performing another action)&#10;&#10;Activate: Perform the ability of an adopted Unluckable with an Activation  symbol. You may only use an adopted Unluckable&rsquo;s ability once per round.&#10;&#10;Trade: Trade any number of cards with another player. An action is only performed if another player accepts the trade, allowing you to make multiple offers without risk of losing actions.&#10;&#10;After you&rsquo;ve performed all of your available actions, the next player may begin theirs.&#10;&#10;HAND SIZE:&#10;Each player starts with a hand size of 5 cards, however there are ways within the game to increase your hand size. Players with more cards than their hand size must discard down, but only at the end of a round. This allows players to hold cards higher than their hand size for a brief, and hopefully beneficial, period of time.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION:&#10;When adopted Unluckables are providing any player(s) with 13 or more Skellies at the end of a round, the player with the most wins!&#10;&#10;ALTERNATE WIN CONDITIONS:&#10;Adopt 8 Unluckables in consecutive order of cost (1-8, 2-9 or 3-10) or attach all 6 unique items to adopted Unluckables for an instant win!&#10;&#10;Play each win condition independently, or all at once.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player bids the number of Tricks he thinks he will win this Hand. Each player in turn then lays down a single card into each Trick.  The player who played the highest ranking card of the led suit (or the Trump suit) wins the Trick and takes the cards.  After each Hand, points are given for Tricks won, with bonus points given for correctly predicting the number of Tricks won.  The game ends after the maximum Hand size is reached, and the player with the highest score wins the game!&#10;&#10;________________________________________________&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsTrick = The cards on the table after each player has played a card.&#10;&#10;Trump = The trump suit card determines which suit Trump is.  Trump cards win Tricks over cards of other suits.&#10;&#10;Follow Suit = Players must, if able, play a card that has the same suit as the first played card of the Trick.&#10;________________________________________________&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rules of Play1) Setup &#10;A player is chosen as scorekeeper and writes the names of the players on the score sheet.  He then shuffles the cards and deals 1 to each player, this is the first Hand.  After each Hand, the player on the dealer's left becomes the new dealer.  The stack of undealt cards are placed face down on the table, and the top card is flipped over and placed next to the pile.  This is the Trump suit card, it determines the starting Trump suit for the current Hand.  If a joker is turned over, continue turning over cards until a suited card is revealed.  (In the extremely rare event all the undealt cards are jokers, hearts is the starting Trump suit.)&#10;&#10;2) The Hands  &#10;In the first Hand, each player is dealt 1 card, giving 1 Trick available to win the first Hand.  When a Hand is over, the cards are reshuffled and dealt, with each subsequent Hand increasing by 1 card.  So, in the second Hand, each player is dealt 2 cards, giving 2 Tricks available.  In the third Hand, each player is dealt 3 cards, giving 3 Tricks available.  The maximum number of cards that can be dealt evenly to the players (while leaving at least 4 undealt for the Trump suit pile) will be the final Hand.&#10;&#10;For example: With 9 players, the final Hand will have 10 cards apiece.  There will also be 8 cards undealt, in a face down pile, to determine Trump.&#10;&#10;3) Bidding&#10;After the players have sorted their cards by suit and rank, each player considers how many Tricks he will win this Hand.  Beginning with the player to the left of the dealer and continuing clockwise, each player states their bid prediction for the Hand.  The scorekeeper notes the bids on the score sheet.&#10;&#10;4) The Tricks&#10;The player to the left of the dealer plays the first card in a Hand.  Play continues clockwise, everyone playing a single card into the center of the table.  If the led card has a suit, everyone must Follow Suit, if they can.  If the first card (or cards) played is a joker, the first suited card played sets the suit and all remaining players must Follow Suit.&#10;If a player does not have a card of the suit led, he may play anything he likes, including a Trump card, or a joker.&#10;&#10;5) Jokers&#10;When jokers are played, they modify the trump suit.  Jokers cannot win a Trick, unless there is nothing but jokers in the Trick; in that case, the first played joker wins the Trick.  There are two types of jokers&mdash;four with 2 dots and four with 4 dots.&#10;&#10;When a joker with 2 dots is played, the trump suit changes immediately.  Flip over the top undealt card until a different suit is revealed; this is the new trump suit.  (In the unlikely event that there is not a different suit in the undealt card pile, or if the whole pile is flipped over, the trump suit changes to the next lower suit, ranked mushrooms, hearts, diamonds, clovers, crosses, horns.)  This trump suit remains until the end of the Hand, or another joker is played.&#10;&#10;When a joker with 4 dots is played, there is no trump suit immediately.  Flip over the trump suit card so they are all facedown.  Only the lead suit can win a trick.  There will be no trump suit until the end of the Hand, or a 2-dot joker is played.&#10;&#10;6) Winning the Trick&#10;The player who played the highest card in the suit which led the Trick, will win the Trick, unless a card in the Trump suit is played.  If a Trump card is played, it will win the trick.  If several Trump cards are in the Trick, the highest ranking Trump card wins the Trick.&#10;&#10;Each Trick won by a player should be placed in separate piles, so it is always known how many Tricks each player has won to this point.&#10;&#10;The winner of a Trick opens the next Trick by playing a new card from their Hand.  When each player has no more cards in their Hand, the Hand is over and points are scored.&#10;&#10;7) Scoring &#10;After a Hand is over, each player receives 1 point for each trick they won.  They also receive 10 points if they correctly predicted the number of tricks they won, unless they bid 0.  If they bid and won 0 tricks, they only receive 5 points.  The total number of points is recorded on the score sheet.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game EndThe game ends after the largest Hand possible for that many players, leaving at least 4 cards undealt for the Trump suit pile.  So, for 10 players, there will be 9 Hands&mdash;with the final Hand having 9 cards.  9 players, 10 Hands.  8 players, 11 Hands.  7 players, 13 Hands.  6 players, 15 Hands.  5 players, 18 Hands.  4 players, 23 Hands.  3 players, 32 Hands.  (With smaller number of players, you may want to use the Skip Up variant below.)&#10;&#10;After the final Hand is played and scored, the scores for all 10 Hands are added up.  The player with the highest score is the winner!&#10;&#10;If there is a tie, the player who scored the most points the final Hand wins.  Still tied?  Flip a coin for the winner!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsSkip Up: For a shorter game, add 2 cards to each Hand.  So, the first Hand will have 1 card, but the second will have 3 cards, the third Hand will have 5 cards, and so on.  This is especially useful when playing with 5 or fewer players.&#10;&#10;Hose the Dealer: The total number of bids may not equal the total number of Tricks available.  For example, in the fifth Hand, with 5 Tricks available, the total number of bids by all players may not equal 5.&#10;&#10;Hidden Bid: Every player records their bid on a piece of paper.  When everyone has finished bidding, bids are announced and recorded by the scorekeeper.  This keeps the bids unaffected by competitor's bids.&#10;&#10;Secret Bids: Every player records their bid on a piece of paper.  The bids are only revealed after the last Trick of the Hand is taken.  Therefore, it is unclear during the Hand how many Tricks each player would like to win.&#10;&#10;Shooting the Stars: If a player wins all the Tricks in a Hand, he receives 2 points for each Trick taken, instead of only 1.  This includes the first Hand, with only 1 Trick available!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Splatter! is a trick taking card game based off of the theme of the ever-classic amphibious arcade game. But the twist is that instead of playing the frog, you are the car. For that matter, all players are cars-competing to splat that blasted frog!&#10;&#10;Players play tricks, earning and building up their stock pile of ammunition and weapons to better help them splat that frog once and for all. Of course the frog, Splatter, comes with 6 lives so he can handle quite a bit. Players earn victory points by winning the trick when they are in position to do so (by being next to the frog when they win a trick). If a player wins a trick and is next to the frog, they eliminated one of the frog's lives and earns a pink wedge victory point.&#10;&#10;The game is over after 10 rounds or when the frog is out of lives, whichever comes first. Whoever has the most 'froggy bits' (pink wedge pieces) wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the middle is a kopje to fight for possession of. The winning command is the first to occupy the 5 squares framed with the color of the command. 9 figures of each color are required, which are placed on the spaces marked by colored discs. A move consists of either moving a piece one space, in any direction, or letting the piece make a single jump or a continuous jump. Only your own pieces can jump up to the squares of your color, where you have to pass between the enemy pieces, you naturally also jump over the opponent's pieces. If a command has succeeded in occupying one of the 5 squares of its color with one of its figures, the opponent loses a figure. Pieces that have already been placed on the squares of his color may not be removed. So it can only happen five times that one opponent takes pieces from the other, and that's the end of the game, because the command that only has 4 pieces left in the field can no longer occupy the kopje completely.&#10;&#10;The game is set during the second Boer War (South African War 1899-1902).&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, they place tiles to enlarge the cathedral and create areas of a single color while placing builder pawns to gain advantages and control areas. In addition, players execute orders to move or remove builders, increase abilities, block spaces, or tear down previously built cathedral parts. There are four tile colors in the game. Players' goals are to create the largest possible areas representing a single color and to have more pawns in these areas than their opponent.&#10;&#10;Basilica designed by &#197;&#129;ukasz M. Pogoda was first published in 2010 and further developed by the expansion Festum Fatuorum in 2012.

Those who hit the center of a disc that is already occupied, remain there until the next throw and receive 1 token from the till as a consolation prize.&#10;If a player gets to 48, he has to start over and loses the disc figures he already has placed, but not the tokens he received for them.&#10;The last throw must show so many points that you just reach 70, otherwise the player returns from 70 as many squares as he rolled over 70. Whoever gets to 70 first gets 2/3 of the contents of the till, the rest goes to the person with the most disc figures.&#10;&#10;",

Players divide into two teams and share a play deck and group hand. Each individual player has asymmetric abilities from their venture (Tech Deck cards) that can develop over time. Teams compete to assist customers from the Customer deck. Successfully assisted customers can be used to: 1. build up their team's deck, 2. develop individual ventures, or 3. score. Rules for odd-number of players and solo-play are included. The theme of the game is a 21st century modern setting. Players on a team cooperate together. Teams may choose to cooperate and negotiate and assist customers (semi-cooperative) leading to lively group discussion and dynamics. The game uses simple math and card melds to determine who successfully assists customers. There are three mutually-exclusive competing objectives: 1. to develop your team's deck, 2. to develop individual player's venture and 3. to score customers. Teams compete to assist customers and then the team must choose how to use that customer card towards these three objectives.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE &ndash; Teams are trying to score points from assisting customers while building up their team&rsquo;s deck and ventures.&#10;GAME PLAY &ndash; During a turn, players can uses game effects from their hand cards and their ventures. Both teams try to assist customers in the customer row drawn from the customer deck. The game ends when there are no more cards left in the customer deck.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of the most numerous and nightmarish of all the void creatures are the HellBats; swarms of slithering demons with leathery bat-like wings that darken the skies and bring ruin on worlds that they infest. HellBats are hatched from grotesque Spires of gnarled muscle built by a Brood Mother, housing countless mucus covered eggs. With a supernaturally fast gestation cycle, these Spires can hatch thousands of HellBats in a matter of days, and are only limited by having a steady supply of fresh flesh to feed upon. When that supply runs dry, the Spires simply go dormant until a new supply can be found, awakening the Spires once more.&#10;&#10;An Enemy Swarm Pack is a new themed set of cards focusing on fighting swarms of a particular Enemy Type, as well as a new set of Spawners for that Enemy Type. In this case, the pack focuses on fighting large swarms of HellBats, and has Hatchling Spires that spawn new HellBats during a Fight.&#10;&#10;This pack also includes Enemy Record Sheets for the OtherWorld variants of HellBats (BogBats, LavaBats, and LungBats), with the stats and modifiers worked into the Enemy Record Sheet itself, as well as new themed Elite Charts and Brutal sides for these variants.&#10;&#10;A new Mission, HellBat Infestation, allows the Heroes to go on an adventure to clear out an infestation of these demonic creatures that is plaguing the area. This set assumes you have access to the HellBat Enemies (miniatures and cards) from the Swamps of Death Core Set, and does include an additional set of 6 HellBat miniatures, giving you a swarm of at least 12.&#10;&#10;Hatchling Spires are a new Enemy introduced in this set, that act as Spawners for HellBats. Tall towers of ridged and gnarled demonic flesh, covered in large leathery eggs, the Hatchling Spires twist and sway as the creatures of the Void rapidly gestate inside before bursting forth. At the end of every Turn, each Hatchling Spire in play rolls 2 six-sided dice to Spawn new HellBats. This creates a new goal within the Fight for the Heroes to battle their way to the Hatchling Spires and take them out before you are overwhelmed by the flood of HellBats. This can be dangerous though as the Acidic Burst ability showers nearby Heroes with deadly acid every time a Spire takes damage from an Attack. In addition, the Spongy Sacks of the Hatchling Spire grant it +2 Defense against all Ranged Attacks made from half Range or greater of that Attack.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     4 Large Enemy Record Sheet &#10;     3 Large plastic Hatchling Spire miniatures&#10;     6 plastic HellBat miniatures&#10;     1 Rule Sheet with new Mission &ndash; HellBat Infestation&#10;     15 Game Cards&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It's a challenge to hold onto your Candy though: You never know when a Trick-or-Treater is going to pop-up. When they do, you'll need to give them Candy and score points or else deal with the consequences of whatever trick they play on you.&#10;&#10;The expansion adds 72 cards, including monstrous Neighbors, thematically spooky yard decor, Tools, and Pests, and a ton of new Events. The expansion accommodates 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For this dice game you will need 6 dice and three chips or tokens for each player. You don&rsquo;t even need a paper and pen to keep score.&#10;&#10;Lucky Charm&#10;First, everyone picks a number to be their lucky charm. It is okay for more than one player to have the same lucky charm number. Once the number has been picked, it stays the same for the whole game. Next, the first player rolls all six dice trying to roll a 6. If he is successful, the dice with 6 on it is set to the side and play moves on to the next player. Instead of rolling a 6 a player can also use more than one dice to add up to the number. For example, if rolling for a six and no six was rolled but a 4 and a 2 were rolled they can be used to add up to six. In this case, both the 4 and 2 dice are set aside. Next, the player on the left rolls the remaining dice to try to roll a 5. Play keeps going in this fashion until 1 is reached. If 1 has been reached and rolled, then play starts over at 6 with the next player.&#10;&#10;Missing the Mark&#10;On the other hand, if a player does not roll the number that she is trying for and can not add any dice to make the number, she is in jeopardy. She is standing on the edge of the volcano, waiting to see if she will survive or be sacrificed. She has one turn to roll the same dice that she just rolled and try to get her lucky charm number. If she rolls her lucky charm, she is safe. Play starts over at six with all six dice with the next player. If she doesn&rsquo;t roll her lucky charm then she is sacrificed and thrown into the volcano. She loses one of her chips. Play starts over with all six dice and then next player.&#10;&#10;When a player loses all of his chips, then he is out of the game.&#10;Play continues until all the players but one have run out of chips. This last player is safe. The Volcano Powers are satisfied with the sacrifices. This player is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The theme of this game is investment capitalism. Purchasing minor, major, or complete equity control in apartment housing regions and company sectors (i.e., airline services, legal and accounting services, and two different public services) will help a player win the game in multiple ways.&#10;&#10;For example, a player with a designated sum of cash on hand and no loans or who owns two complete sets of equity control in an apartment housing region or company sector and no loans wins. Other winning methods involve parameters outlined in the ruleset and agreed on by players before the game starts (i.e., timed games or when players wish to stop playing).&#10;&#10;First, players use a 12-Sided-Die to roll and move around spaces on the game board. Then they choose to buy or pass on investment opportunities. These choices affect their passive income (salary) and income from other players (penalties). Along the way, the owned investments grow, and players may collect additional revenue from drawn cards (one free set and one set that is not). Players may also collect cards that can get used in place of rolling the 12-Sided-Die.&#10;&#10;Fear not the dilemma of non-trading players HODL'ing (holding on for dear life). A significant equity control (50%+) allows players to take over entire housing regions or company sectors by rolling the 12-Sided-Die higher than a competitor.&#10;&#10;Please do not play it like Monopoly, or you may lose. So be the one who wins intelligently and earn the right to boast about your strategy (and luck).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Despite its small size, short rules, and bunch of dice, it offers a surprising amount of tense tactical moments and thematic tie-ins. At the beginning of each round, or volley, both players roll nine dice concealed behind their hands. Players alternate making a play on the ball by placing a die on their side of the court that exceeds the value of the last played die. The volley continues until one player can't make a play. Here's the exciting part: every space on the court has a special action that is activated when a die is placed. Actions are things like reroll a die, boost its value, or mirror an adjacent die. You&rsquo;ll have to activate the right ability at the right time if you want to keep the volley going!&#10;&#10;Scuttleball contains three different courts to accommodate different skill levels and game preferences: backyard (casual), beach (standard), or gymnasium (expert). There is also a free downloadable file to design your own court!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

An Adventure is played out as a series of Turns where you choose Actions, such as Exploring or Investigating.&#10;&#10;After each Action, you may encounter an Enemy and consult the Enemy Booklet. In an Adventure, you need to Defeat an Enemy that begins as unknown but by taking Actions and gaining Knowledge to find out what has been happening, you will reveal the Enemy. However, the Enemy is never idle and always getting closer to completing their plans. You will have to track the current Danger in the Adventure and you will lose an Adventure if the Danger total is ever 20 or more.&#10;&#10;Defeating an Enemy will gain you Victory Points, which is the way you can win the game.

Koala Kraze is for 2-8 players ages 6 and up, and you'll learn to play in 2 minutes. The game's 100 cards fit in a small box, so you can take it with you anywhere you go!&#10;&#10;We commissioned some amazing hand-painted koalas just for this game, and their personalities burst through the cards!&#10;&#10;Ready for Extreme mode? Start with the Junior mode to keep it simpler for younger kids, or try Extreme mode for older kids and adults!&#10;&#10;Koala Kraze is a family-friendly game where the goal is to use your Koala Friends to discard all your cards first. If you've played Uno, Crazy Eights, or any other card-shedding game, you already know how to play!&#10;&#10;Shuffle the deck, deal some cards out, and you're ready to play! Each turn, you'll play a Number card or a Koala card. Number cards can be played if they're one above or one below the Number card on the discard pile. If a Koala card's on top, play any number card you like! Each Koala card has a special power to help you play or discard more cards. Use the Burglar to switch hands with another player, or play the Big Boss to make a player discard a Koala card.&#10;&#10;You can play two modes with the same cards. The simpler 'Junior' version is all about getting rid of your cards first, which is great for younger kids. A game like this is great for teaching colors and numbers, or for recognizing colors and numbers as the game gets fast!&#10;&#10;If playing with older kids or adults, the 'Extreme' version adds a bit more challenge while keeping the core gameplay the same. As you play, pay attention to the scoring icons which say 'plus' or 'minus'. Sometimes the card you want to play will cost you points, so be careful! Some Koalas (like the Disk Jockey) will help discard those cards so they won't hurt your score, and a waypoint system ensures you can't go below certain milestones once you've achieved them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game board consists of four pyramids broken down into individual small pyramids. At the beginning of the game, each player makes a throw and places his piece on the small square of one of the four pyramids that has the same number. This space, occupied at the beginning, forms the foundation stone of the pyramid to be built by the player and the number indicated on it shows the &quot;base number&quot;. The player who rolled the base number 1 is king or queen and begins. There can be multiple kings in the first game. However, if no 1 is thrown, the next lower number begins. Corresponding to the rolling, the game piece is then placed as many spaces further sideways as eyes have been thrown. When the end of a row is reached, the player moves on to the next higher row until he reaches the top of the pyramid. If a player throws his basic number, he is not allowed to move, but rather has to wait until it is his turn again. If the player rolls more points than he needs to fill the capstone, he must move back from the top of the pyramid by as many squares as he has rolled points too many. This is repeated until he manages to get to the keystone. The king or queen make an exception to this. These may occupy the capstone immediately as soon as they reach it or have rolled beyond it. Whoever is the first to finish building his pyramid receives the first prize and becomes king for the next game with the basic number 1. Whoever throws the basic number 1 in the next game must exchange it for 2, since the king number is then only one player may own. If several players finish in a round, the one who threw the lowest cornerstone at the beginning of the game has priority, i. h. started building the pyramid with 1 or the next lowest square.&#10;&#10;",

The more a player succeeds the higher their Star Gear Tracker will go, but one wrong move and their Star Gear goes back to the start.&#10;&#10;Every successfully grabbed Jaxx a player gets goes onto their Constellation Card.

With their ships they brought many animals that neither the dragons nor the dodos had set their eyes on before: rats, dogs, pigs... All these creatures hunted the dodos and ransacked their eggs. Unworldly and peaceful in mind, the dodos hadn&rsquo;t been able to stand their ground against these reckless invaders. Can you help the dodos to hatch as many eggs as possible and save them from extinction?&#10;&#10;'O Dodo!' is a push your luck game in which you must constantly choose between low risk and high reward. During your turn you alternate in playing a card from your hand and a blind card from the draw pile. You add the cards to one of the nests and the value of the cards you play must go higher and higher. Make the nests as big as you can, so you can hatch as many eggs as possible at the end of your turn. But also know when to stop. When the card you draw from the draw pile is too low or when your hand is empty and you can't hatch the eggs in one of the nests your turn is over and you&rsquo;ll see another player profit of your hard work.&#10;&#10;Thanks to the many included variants, the dodos continue to surprise and challenge you even after a long time. A few of the included variants:&#10;- Add ruse cards that will activate a special effect.&#10;- Gather the loot so you can return cards from the discard pile to your hand.&#10;- Add effects to the nests that you can use once during your turn to activate a special effect.&#10;- ...&#10;&#10;The game also includes a solo variant and a solo campaign where you have to earn enough points each game to buy a ruse card that you can use from the next game on. The more ruse cards you buy the more chances you have to increase your score. Try to unlock them all and go for the magical score of 100 points to save the dodos from extinction!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;This game is part of the 'World of Draghan'-series.&#10;Part 1: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284585/world-draghan-once-upon-dragon&#10;Part 2: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/285208/world-draghan-sneaky-ol-dragons&#10;&#10;",

Mages will battle devious enemies and tower chaos magic to find treasures and new spells. As a collective, the Mages work to ascend the Tower and receive the highest marks of wizardry!&#10;&#10;Rogue Mana is a classic dungeon-crawler, great for newbies and veteran gamers alike. The growth of power format allows Rogue Mana to be played as a campaign over seven sessions. During each session, the Mages enter a new floor of the Tower that they must conquer until they defeat the 7th and final floor to receive their marks. There are 14 levels for variation and deployability.&#10;&#10;During each turn, players collect Mana Crystals which are used to cast spells in your hand. These spells may harm an enemy, allow you to assist a fellow player in need, or manipulate the environment around you. As players draw mana or cast spells, a Rogue Event may be triggered by the Tower, which is known for its chaotic tendencies. Fate (i.e., dice) then decides whether a boon is given the mages, spikes fly out of the wall, or a barrel of fish randomly appears (for example). Once the players turn is done, then the enemies have their turn. They target the mages with unending ambition, though they may have weaknesses that the mages can exploit.&#10;&#10;In Rogue Mana, each floor has its own unique layout, enemies, and challenges. Beyond just surviving, the mages can try to collect 3 additional accolades (up to 4 total); two by collecting specific treasures, and one for collecting a magical orb. The more accolades collected upon completing the level, the more talented and powerful wizards they will become once they defeat the tower.&#10;&#10;The campaign/game ends once the mages defeat the final level in the tower.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player pays 5 coins in the till and take turns to roll and move. Only one die is used. If a player rolls 6 eyes, de don't move any further, but pays a penalty because he is too eager. On some spaces events hinder or benefit the players. Only the one who throws 1 and thus comes to space 1 can start the journey.&#10;The first to the summit of the Zugspitze gets half the contents of the till. Those who have reached the summit can start their way back without any obstacles. Only those who get to 5 are eliminated from the game due to fatigue. Whoever gets over space 1 first gets all the rest of the till.&#10;&#10;",
