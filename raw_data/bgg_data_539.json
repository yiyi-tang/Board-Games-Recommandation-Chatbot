Depending on the strategies, alliances and also luck the game can last from an hour to easily more than 2.&#10;&#10;Distinctions can be made with types of property you buy or its distribution over the playing field, but the game pretty much resembles its predecessors.&#10;&#10;The main aim of players in this game is to roll for their movement around the board, buy properties which can bring them money afterwards (when someone else steps on them). Collecting sets of properties can bring even more money as the player can then buy subsidiaries and concerns, which mean higher payments from other players.&#10;&#10;There are also the usual Jail, Risk and Cash areas over the board. Jail means you skip your turn(s), Risk can give, but also take money from you and Cash usually means some Win for you.&#10;&#10;Player elimination is part of the game - when you run bankrupt because you cannot pay your debts and/or tolls, you are out.&#10;&#10;",

Two situation maps and two sets of markers for plotting intelligence results and operation reports are provided. Two may play, or the computer will act as an opponent, capable of playing either side.&#10;Design &amp; art by J.Kula.&#10;&#10;A type of game which was shortly popular with the upcoming of the home computer in the early 80's. Designers were still exploring the possibilities of uses for a home computer, and a few games have been published in that era where your computer was used as an Aide de Camp for boardgames. Avalon Hill's Tanktics is probably the best known.&#10;&#10;Sieg in Afrika is particularly outstanding in the fact that fog of war is simulated by 2 identical maps and counter sets. Against a human player, the moves and actions are typed in the computer for resolvement purposes only. In 1 player mode, the computer also gives output on where the computer counters are placed. The software can be run on an Apple ][ or a Commodore 64.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "POLEMOS - FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR&#10;&#10;When Emperor Louis Napoleon declared war on Prussia in Summer 1870 he was at the head of an army that most contemporaries regarded as the leading military force in Europe. No doubt he had plans of recreating the Glory of his illustrious namesake Uncle. What actually happened was a campaign that saw the Prussians invading France and the Imperial army capitulating at Sedan. Louis Napoleon abdicated and the French carried in the war under the auspices of the Third Republic.&#10;&#10;As a wargames period, the FPW remains largely unexplored. There seems to be a general myth that the uniforms are boring, the battles one-sided and that information is just too hard to get to those of whose language skills do not include French and German. As it happens, nothing could be further than the truth than these stereotypes. The French can have a large variety of brightly dressed and colourful units, ranging from the Imperial Guard to the Zouaves and the North African Turcos. You can even field the French Foreign Legion! The Prussians number a significant contingent of allied German troops who all add their own colour and variety to the army, especially the large contingent of Bavarians. Infantry battalions still fought carrying their colours into action and the deployed armies make a brave show on the wargames table. The Prussians may have their superb artillery arm, but the French Infantry were armed with the Chassepot rifle. Tactics were in state of flux as armies were coming to terms with the change from Napoleonic tactics to ones more suited to the greater range and lethality of rifles and artillery. No greater example of this can be seen than the presence of Cavalry units whose purpose was still to charge the enemy with cold steel as their fathers and grandfathers had done.&#10;&#10;If you've not considered 1870 before then it is well worth a second look!&#10;&#10;Although the war involved unprecedented numbers of soldiers, there was a great deal of variety in the size of the battles. the French army that fought at Wagram was ten times the size of that which fought at Vimiero. It is a lot to ask of any single;e set of rules to cope with such diversity.&#10;&#10;Polemos FPW is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, Commandant de Battaile will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Kommandant der Armee will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period.&#10;&#10;The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal - only the nominal scale will differ.&#10;&#10;Polemos FPW aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;[u]Basing and Representation[/u]:&#10;The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos FPW is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position and number of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.&#10;&#10;[u]In Commandant de Battaile[/u]:&#10;A 60mm x 30mm base of infantry represents an infantry battalion - about 500-1000 men. &#10;A 60mm x 30mm base of cavalry represents a regiment or three to four squadrons. &#10;A 30mm x 30mm artillery or mitrailleuse base represents two batteries each of 6 guns.&#10;A 30mm x 30mm Officer base is use for Generals, Corps and Divisional commanders&#10;&#10;[u]In Kommandant der Armee[/u]:&#10;60mm square bases are used. These can be formed by using two CDB bases, butted up one behind the other or a single larger base which allows a more creative and dioramic approach.&#10;A 60mm square base of infantry represents a brigade or division of 1500 to 3000 men.&#10;&#10;A 60mm square base of cavalry represents a brigade or division of 750 to 1500 men.&#10;&#10;A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents 18 to 36 guns,&#10;&#10;All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.&#10;This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organised on this basis.&#10;&#10;",

Crown points are earned by successfully attacking other knights and holding certain territories.&#10;&#10;While described as a family game, there are some more serious aspects of the play that make this questionable. Knights must be trained before they can be brought into your army, and having access to on oasis is necessary to make this happen. This requires planning and a strategic eye toward how others are building their resources. There are different rules for attacks based on the relative location to the palace. Attacks are made using cards, and this is true when attacking other knights or trying to conquer the tower.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rechenk&ouml;nig (a.k.a. King of Numbers) is a collection of number-learning games using a base set of cards that are cleverly designed. One set of cards has a simple equation, like &quot;2 + 1&quot; or &quot;9 -7&quot;. Another set has solutions, like &quot;=3&quot;.&#10;&#10;The cards have two special features. First, on one side graphics are shown with the numbers, while on the reverse the graphics are not shown. This allows the games to played at different levels based on the age of the children. Second, each card has a hole in it, and the placement of this hole aligns with its solution cards so that when the proper answers are placed together, a wooden &quot;king of numbers&quot; figure fits precisely into the combined hole; if the king doesn't fit, the answer is wrong. The wooden King piece doubles as a pencil holder, which is helpful since some of the games require scorekeeping on a piece of paper.&#10;&#10;Using this card set, the rules describe seven different games of increasing difficulty. One of these is a solitaire game, the others are for 2, 3, or more players. Each is interesting and the variability of the play with the unique cards keeps the game interesting through multiple plays and useful for children.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While there are probably thousands of variations of the standard &quot;memory&quot; game, this one distinguishes itself because the matches are made by sound rather than visually. The game includes 20 identical-looking bears, but there are 10 different sounds when shaking them based on the material inside the bear. The bears are placed on the board, and in turn players shake on bear and then must find its match. Like other memory games, if they get a match they keep going, otherwise the turn passes to the next player. The bears are nicely made and the some of the sound differences are subtle enough that it requires concentration as well as memory to get the pairings correct.&#10;&#10;The title means simply &quot;Bear Hearing Memory&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Along the way there are spaces that direct the player to go back spaces or sail to a different port before resuming course.  Landing on an opponent sends him back 10 spaces.  The shorter routes have more penalty spaces. The game comes with 6 beautifully crafted clippers (2 extra) in low relief that are painted in semi reflective paints.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Polemos - American Civil War&#10;    &#10;The American Civil War was fought between two fledgling armies with little experience, over a vast area and with little knowledge of the technologies that would be brought to bear over the course of the war.&#10;&#10;Inexperienced armies and generals, state driven mobilization and a belief that with one battle it would be over added, to the mixed and muddled beginning to the war. However with the emerging use of mass production for weapons, ammunition and supply there were some compelling reasons why this would not be so. With both the Union and Confederate governments aiming to mobilize, train and arm the volunteers and militias to the field within a few months gives us the opportunity to re-construct battles that were, in the main, very unpredictable.&#10;&#10;This mixture of inexperience and technology would directly affect the course and length of the war. Both forces involved were made up of Regulars, Volunteers, and Militias that varied in size, experience and term of service. The protagonists also relied on conscription to add more troops to their armies as the war progressed and the volunteers began to dry up.&#10;&#10;With Polemos, American Civil War (ACW), the opportunity to produce two sets of rules in one book is irresistible. This set of rules will allow the war gamer to re-fight the larger battles of the period such as: Lee versus Meade at Gettysburg or Bragg versus Rosecrans at Chickamauga fighting with armies of well over 50,000 men each.&#10;&#10;The other allows the war gamer to fight Division or Corps sized actions and re-create smaller engagements within larger battles like Breckinridge&rsquo;s final assault on the high ground at the Battle of Stones River (Murfreesboro) in January 1863, or the battle that lost Arkansas to the Confederates, Prairie Grove in 1862.&#10;&#10;Polemos ACW is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, On They Came will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Crisis of Allegiance will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period.&#10;&#10;The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal - only the nominal scale will differ.&#10;&#10;Polemos ACW aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Basing and Representation:&#10;The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos ACW is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position and number of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.&#10;&#10;A 60mm x 30mm base of infantry represents an infantry regiment - about 300-500 men. &#10;A 60mm x 30mm base of cavalry represents a regiment of 300-500 men and horses.&#10;A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents two batteries each of 4 to 6 guns.&#10;A 30mm x 30mm Officer base is use for Generals, Corps and Divisional commanders&#10;&#10;In Crisis of Allegiance, 60mm square bases are used. These can be formed by using two OTC bases, butted up one behind the other or a single larger base which allows a more creative and dioramic approach.&#10;&#10;A 60mm square base of infantry represents an infantry formation of between 1200 and 2000 men. This may represent a brigade or division, depending on the size of the army being modeled.&#10;A 60mm square base of cavalry represents between 1200 and 2000 men. This may represent a brigade or division. &#10;A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents 16 to 24 guns,&#10;&#10;All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.&#10;This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organised on this basis.&#10;&#10;",

It involves a hot dog eating contest where the contestants are the players.&#10;&#10;Rounds begin with the first player flipping over a hot dog to attempt to eat.  The hot dog has stats that match the five tastes (sweet, sour, spicy, salty, bitter).  Play proceeds to the left with the next player playing a topping card on the hot dog to attempt to make the first player lose their lunch.  Toppings include everything from lemons to fish heads.  Play proceeds until all of the opponents have had a chance to play a topping or pass.  Then the initial player has a chance to play negative toppings such as pepto or antacid to make the hot dog edible.  If they can't (the hot dog has a higher level than the character in at least one state), they lose their lunch.  Play proceeds to the next player who then flips over a hot dog to eat.&#10;&#10;Play continues until a player has earned the specified number of points to win.  Each hot dog eaten also offers a bonus to stamina and points toward victory.&#10;&#10;By the way, did I forget to mention it has BARF cards?  When played as a topping, the player automatically loses their lunch!!!&#10;&#10;Hot Dog Hooligans is now available at www.gurkengames.com.&#10;&#10;",

If the two cards are a match, meaning both good for their respective decks, the first player to hit the Squeaker gets to see if they guessed correctly. The cards are placed next to each other, and depending on how the gray bands on the cards match, the cards are either both good, one is good and one is bad, or both are bad. If both are good, the player gets to draw two puzzle pieces from a bag. Other actions let players exchange pieces, and the first to collect all none of their pieces wins. Through the game, children learn about which foods are healthy and which are not, and which activities lead to a healthy lifestyle versus those that don't.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Poke is a two-player multi-genre card game invented by Sid Sackson and discussed in his book A Gamut of Games. It combines strong elements of Poker with trick-taking games, and adds scoring reminiscent of Bridge.&#10;&#10;Like bridge, score is kept on a pad split down the centre both across and down; points &quot;above the line&quot; count for the final total, whereas points &quot;below the line&quot; are intermediate. The game is also played until a rubber, or best of three games, is completed.&#10;&#10;A hand of Poke is played in two phases; in the first phase, players draw cards to better their Poker hand, and in the second phase the players proceed to take &quot;tricks&quot; with their hand. Points from the first phase go above the line; points from the second go below the line, with some exceptions. Once a player has twenty points below the line (which may take more than one deal), the game is over, bonus points are added, and the points above the line are tallied to determine the winner of that particular game.&#10;&#10;Play is as follows:&#10;    * The dealer passes out five cards to himself and his opponent.&#10;    * The opponent may elect to stand pat, or not take any more cards. They may also discard from one to three of the cards in their hand and draw replacements. This doubles their hand; during the trick-taking phase, their opponent will now receive two points per trick won instead of one. After doubling, they may elect to stand pat, or discard from one to three cards again and draw replacements. This is a redouble, and their opponent will now receive four points per trick. They must stand pat at this point.&#10;    * The dealer acts similarly, except for the fact that they get one &quot;free&quot; discard-and-redraw; they may also double and redouble afterwards, for a total of three possible discards-and-redraws.&#10;&#10;This ends the first phase. Next comes the trick-taking phase.&#10;&#10;* The non-dealer leads by playing one or more cards from their hand. If more than one card is played, they must be of the same rank; in other words, only singles, pairs, three-of-a-kinds, and four-of-a-kinds are allowed as a single play. Their opponent must beat the cards on the table. If it is a singleton, a card of higher rank will suffice; if it is a pair or greater, the opponent must play the same number of cards, and can only beat if their own cards are all the same rank and of higher value. If they do not have a pair or higher, they can simply toss off other cards, which will not beat what is on the table. If the cards played have the same value, the leader wins them.&#10;    * Note that suit is irrelevant at this stage; there are no trumps, and one does not have to follow suit to beat.&#10;    * Players keep their own cards, turning them face-up if they won the trick or face-down if they did not.&#10;    * The winner of the last trick leads for the next one, following the rules above.&#10;&#10;After all five cards have been played in tricks, points below the line are determined. Each player gets one point below the line for every trick they take if their opponent did not double or redouble; they get two points for every trick if their opponent doubled but did not redouble, and four points for every trick if their opponent redoubled.&#10;&#10;If a player took all five cards in tricks, they have performed a sweep, and receive a bonus of 250 points above the line.&#10;&#10;Next, both player's hands are considered as Poker hands. The player with the highest Poker hand received points above the line as follows:&#10;&#10;* Pair: 50 points&#10;    * Two Pair: 100 points&#10;    * Three of a Kind: 200 points&#10;    * Straight: 300 points&#10;    * Flush: 400 points&#10;    * Full House: 500 points&#10;    * Four of a Kind: 600 points&#10;    * Straight Flush: 750 points&#10;    * Royal Flush: 1000 points&#10;&#10;Deal then passes, and a new hand is dealt. However, if either player reached 20 points below the line, that game is over, unless there is a tie in the number of points below the line, in which case a tiebreaker hand is played. Once a clear winner has been determined, that player gets a bonus of 100 points above the line, and all points below the line are canceled.&#10;&#10;When a player has won their second game, they receive the 100 point bonus mentioned above, plus 750 points above the line if their opponent did not win a game in the rubber, or 500 points above the line if their opponent won one. At this stage, the points above the line are tallied, and the person with the most points above the line wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Five Stones is an ancient game played in various forms in most countries throughout the world.  The rules vary slightly but typically they involve 5 to 10 stones or tokens of some type.&#10;&#10;The modern game of Jacks, using metal caltrops and a ball, is a descendant of this game.  Unlike Jacks, Five Stones games require only pebbles or tokens.&#10;&#10;The game may also have been played with astragals, or sheep knuckle bones, but instead of being used as randomizers for wagering they're used in place of stones for tossing.&#10;&#10;Five Stones requires only a handful of small stones, although many variants use stylized tokens instead of stones.  The stones or tokens normally have irregular or cubic sides to allow scattering in a small area.&#10;&#10;In Korea 5 small octagonal prisms or polyhedrons are used, in the traditional Jewish variant 5 cubes are used, but the only real requirement is 5 irregularly-shaped pebbles.&#10;&#10;Typically the game involves casting the stones and then tossing one stone in the air and picking up another and catching the first before it strikes the ground.  In some regional variants the stones are caught on the back of the hand, either for scoring or during play.&#10;&#10;Related to: Knucklebones&#10;Re-implemented by: Jacks&#10;&#10;",

But navies were just as important to victory (if not more so); and it was on the seas that the conflict truly became a World War. From the North Sea to the Mediterranean, from the Black Sea to the South Pacific, battles raged across the globe.&#10;&#10;So, go ahead: swap your energy shields for armor plating and the blackness of space for the wine-dark sea, and see if you have what it takes to rule the waves!&#10;&#10;In addition to data cards for one hundred ship classes from eight different navies of the early twentieth century, Dreadnoughts adds brand-new options to the Starmada X game, including flotillas, wet-navy style movement, and dual-mode fighter flights, which can be used individually or collectively to enrich any setting. Also included are six historical scenarios, allowing players to re-fight various naval actions of the Great War.&#10;&#10;Dreadnoughts is not a stand-alone product; ownership of the Starmada X Admiralty Edition Core Rulebook is required.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Starmada X&#10;    Starmada: The Admiralty Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;",

After resolving combat, units that remain adjacent to enemy units may attack again. Stuka counter increases odds column by 1. Units have 1 side step reduction. Object of the game is to take cities and kill enemy units. Points are awarded for both. Weather in Operation Typhoon is handled in a very interesting way. As weather gets worse, movement points are deducted. Simple and effective. A typical game should not last more than 30-45 minutes at the longest. 4 pages of rules. Combat is resolved with a d6 die on the combat matrix CRT.&#10;&#10;This is an EXCELLENT game for introducing a beginner. or to simply kill some time when both space and time are an issue.&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Canal Age and the Industrial Revolution that birthed it produced several new transportation systems, one of which was a circular canal network known as the Cheshire Ring. Narrow boats were pulled around the ring carrying stone, coal, and iron for use in development of the landscape. The boatmen were paid for delivery and paid the expenses of the trip from this amount. One of the largest expenses was tolls, which were set not only on the amount of goods but also the type of goods carried. Clever but unscrupulous boatmen soon learned that by mixing loads they could fool the toll keepers to help reduce their expenses.&#10;&#10;Each player owns two narrow boats and use actions to move their cargo from one market to another along the canal. As they move through the toll houses (the signature Stratamax colored dice), the house owner must be paid. It is up to the toll house owner to decide whether to take the toll offered or use an action to inspect the load in case the boatman is trying to rip him off. If caught in a deception, the boat owner pays a fine. However, if the boatman was honorable then the toll house owner gets a penalty for the time and delay caused.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the manufacturer:&#10;&#10;&quot;A Game of Action and Thrill, developing unexpected situations and startling climaxes so rapidly that you are constantly 'on edge' with suspense.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game consists of a deck of cards, all of one 'suit,' and a pair of six-sided dice with the six on each replaced by a check mark. Nine cards are dealt to each player, with the four remaining cards forming the discard pile. The dice are thrown by each player in turn, and on each throw all players may discard one card corresponding to the total number thrown.&#10;&#10;When a check turns up, the player throwing must take the top card from the discard pile rather than discarding, though other players may discard a card which equals the number thrown on the other die. When two checks are thrown, the throwing player must take two cards. When one player runs out of cards, each other player pays him one cardboard chip for each card remaining in their hand. Players play to &quot;100, 200 or any agreed number of points.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ever since the mock Iranian attack with four Fast Attack Craft upon USN ships sailing though the Straits of Hormuz in January 2008, the USN had been on alert. While American intelligence, in theory, could predict the technological level of the Iranian weaponry, and their own wargames showed USN vulnerabilities, there was always the chance element. The USN had always been on a heightened alert when traversing the Straits, especially when they knew the Iranians had at least 70 anti-ship missiles within range. Not to mention their capability of launching ASMs from aircraft platforms. Not to mention, their Chinese FACs with ASMs. The threat had always been real. The USN continued to have confidence, perhaps wrongly, that their superiority in higher technology could and would keep their ships out of harm&rsquo;s way.Iran had decided to attack using &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; tactics. The USN had itself used such tactics in their own wargames with devastating results. It was found out that using swarm tactics greatly increased the likelihood of Iranian success, even when only Fast Attack Craft were used. That was then. Now, apply the same tactics with ASMs and the scenario was even more horrific. The USN would not make a preemptive strike, that would be political suicide on the world stage. Iraq was still combative as ever. All the USN could do was remain vigilant at all times while moving through the Straits and into the Persian Gulf. If Iran attacked, they would have to make it count as America&rsquo;s response would literally demolish the Iranian forces in and around the Straits.&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;- 2 11&quot; x 17&quot; maps sheet depicting the battle area.&#10;- One set of 280 die cut &frac12;&quot; playing pieces representing ground combat units.&#10;- One rulebook&#10;- 4 sheets of Charts and tables&#10;&#10;",
