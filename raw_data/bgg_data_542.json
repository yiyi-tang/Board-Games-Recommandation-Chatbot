All players start at the same starting point.&#10;&#10;Each game round, one of the players takes a card and reads out loud one of the questions (yes-no type) on it. Each player then answers the question with yes or no, by putting his yes/no card in front of him/her (hidden for the other players). &#10;The card reader then reads out loud the correct answer, which is printed on the back of the question card. One by one, each player announces whether he/she answered correctly or not. If the answer was correct, the player may move his pawn one step towards the finish line.&#10;&#10;A player may lie about his answer. The card reader however has the right to check whether a player is sincere by asking to show his/her answer. If a player lied, his pawn has to move back two spaces. If the player was sincere, the card reader has to move his pawn one space backwards.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the finish line wins the game. If two or more players reach the finish line at the same time, it's a draw.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Watubi, an African Strategy Game, is an abstract 2-player game played on a hexagonal board, in which players try to regroup their own scattered tribe-stones, using Halma style movement rules.&#10;&#10;Players each place their own set of 13 tribe-stones onto the predefined starting places. These tribe-stones have two sides: one side with a tribe-symbol, and one without. All stones start the game with the tribe-symbol face-up, but every time that a stone is jumped over, it flips over, either hiding the tribe-symbol, or revealing it again. A stone that jumps over another stone always ends its move with the tribe-symbol revealed.&#10;&#10;To win the game, a player must get at least 7 own stones into a single grouping. This can be anywhere on the board, with the catch that only stones that show the own tribe-symbol count, and all of them must touch.&#10;&#10;Movement rules are simple. A stone either moves to a free hexagon immediately next to the field it occupies, ending its movement with the same side face-up. Or it hops over a neighbouring stone, regardless of who it belongs to, flipping every stone it jumps over, and ending its movement with its own tribe-symbol face-up. Like Halma, hopping is only possible if the field directly behind the jumped stone is unoccupied, and you are allowed to keep hopping over other stones if the board allows it, as long as you never pass the same hexagon twice. You are not forced to jump over a piece if you don't want to, and you can stop jumping at any point that suits you.&#10;&#10;The board is made out of felt, the tribe-stones come in 2 colours and are made out of wood.&#10;&#10;ADDITIONAL INFO:&#10;&#10;     language skill needed: language neutral. Game comes with German rules.&#10;     english translation: &quot;Watubi&quot; is Swahili for &quot;repentant.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There are no complex charts or book-keeping and accounting required as Carnage &amp; Glory II maintains all the relevant information regarding the status of the combat units and general officers within the system database. Complex concepts such as variable weather and ground conditions, heat exhaustion, ammunition usage, mental and physical fatigue and variable morale are easily accommodated by the system. By eliminating the emphasis on dice and charts typical of more traditional wargames, the sole focus of the game becomes the tactical movement and engagement of the forces under your command. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable and stimulating wargame experience.&#10;&#10;",

The sudden onslaught stunned the Poles, who offered little resistance to the Germans' panzer divisions. The invaders quickly penetrated into the into the interior, reaching Warsaw in just over a week. The rapidity of the German troops advance was in large part due to support from the Luftwaffe. Under attack by both air and armor, the Polish army and air force slowly collapsed. On September 17th, 1939, the USSR attacked Poland, shattering the country's morale. The campaign was effectively over in just three weeks, long before France and Britain could fulfill their promises to come to the aid of Poland.&#10;&#10;&quot;Down in Flames&quot; series is a card-driven game that simulate WW2 air combat.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is a cross between regular chess and Mark Steere's Dipole.  The game is won by either capture your opponent's King instead of checkmating, or by having your opponent not be able to move any pieces.  This is done by restricting non-capture movement to only moving forward (straight or diagonally), rather than laterally or backwards.  Castling remains the same as in normal chess, and pieces may capture as the do normally, including laterally or backwards.&#10;&#10;This small change in the results results in a game that last only a finite number of turns, and with one side guaranteed a win.  Even though the game is more restrictive in some regards over normal chess, it is still a deep game.  Due to the game being a cross between Dipole and normal chess, it bears the name Dipole Chess.  Fans of chess and Dipole should consider checking this game out.&#10;&#10;The latest version of the game rules for Dipole Chess can be found here:&#10;http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSdipolechess&#10;&#10;A Zillions adaptation of the game can be found here:&#10;http://www.zillionsofgames.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/90451?do=show;id=1617&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Downey Games website:&#10;&#10;La Grande Boucle (The Big Loop) is the nickname given to France&rsquo;s biggest sporting event, the Tour de France.&#10;Year in, year out, the route followed by the riders for 3 weeks broadly follows a loop around the country, hence the name of our game.&#10;&#10;La Grande Boucle has been a labor of love for designer, Phil Riviere, for many years. Phil had released versions prior to partnering with Downey Games that were &quot;highlight based&quot; games. The Downey Games release of La Grande Boucle is a departure from previous designs. Rather than continuing the &quot;highlight based&quot; game engine, Phil has developed a full-blown simulation of the Tour de France.&#10;&#10;Phil recently commented, &quot; Although sharing the same name as previous versions, the latest incarnation is a completely different concept. No highlights here as the game system covers the action on the full length of each stage. Every single aspect of Road Racing is covered. There are also options for tactical choices.&quot;&#10;&#10;La Grande Boucle is the ONLY full simulation of the Tour de France. Every stage, time trial, and rider is included in the game.&#10;&#10;In game terms, the Tour de France is quite challenging a subject because of, the huge quantity of riders taking part (around 200) and the difference in the character of the 20 + stages which form the race. However, Phil has risen to the challenge. La Grande Boucle not only gives accurate results, but you'll feel as if you are taking part in the actual Tour de France.&#10;&#10;We do want to reiterate that this is not simply a relabeling of an old game. La Grande Boucle version 4 is a completely new design.&#10;&#10;Phil asked me to close with the following: &quot;The game is meant to be played over several sessions. This is definitely not a fast or quick replay game. The flat stages are fairly quick to replay and will be slotted in one seating. Mountain stages, however, will take much longer to complete.&#10;&#10;Not wishing to discourage you, but finishing this replay will be like finishing the Tour: Difficult but Rewarding. Be warned and enjoy the racing.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game ships with the ratings for the 2004 Tour de France.&#10;&#10;The printed game features individual, die-cut cards for all 189 riders; charts printed in full color, a complete rule book, Team lists in full-color, Replay data in full-color, dice, and a sturdy game box.&#10;&#10;Note: The game is also available in a e-book version (print and play) for a lower price.&#10;&#10;",

As in regular football, the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game uses a custom deck of cards made up of seven types of cards: Run, Pass, Kick, Blitz, Offense, Defense, and Special. Cards are played to gain Field Position Tokens which represent the offensive player&rsquo;s position on the field, from the player&rsquo;s goal line (zero tokens), to midfield (three tokens), to a touchdown (seven tokens). Down Tokens are used to track change of possession on downs, which occurs after the Offensive Player accumulates five of the tokens. Whenever the Offensive Player gains a Field Position Token, all but one of the Down Tokens are discarded.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with a hand of five cards, and draws three cards at the start of each turn. The Offensive Player declares whether there will be a regular play, punt, or field goal attempt. The Defensive Player may play a Blitz Card. If the Blitz Card cannot be countered by the Offensive Player, the play is over. If a regular play was declared, the Offensive Player then declares either a running play or a pass play, and plays either a Pass or Run Card. If the card is not countered by the Defensive Player, the Offensive Player can play one additional card to increase the yardage of the play. A Run Card can be used to extend either type of play, but a Pass Card can only be used to extend a Pass play.&#10;&#10;When an Offensive Player accumulates seven or more Field Position Tokens, a touchdown is scored and the Offensive Player receives six points. The point after touchdown attempt is governed by a die roll, as are punts, field goals, and kick offs.&#10;&#10;",

Along the entire front, hordes of refugees have flooded into Allied camps all telling the tales of the dead coming back to life. Something has gone horribly wrong and zombie German Army humanoids, known as Kroids, are attacking with organized military efficiency.&#10;&#10;- Who is leading the Kroids?&#10;At this time we have no idea who, or what, is controlling or leading these Kroid forces. Reports have led to speculation that the leader of the Kroids is a summoned demon that was resurrected or awakened by the experiments of the SS Project Diabolus team at Castle Wewelsburg in Germany.&#10;&#10;- Where do the Kroids come from?&#10;All we know at the moment is that they are the reanimated remains of fallen soldiers or zombies &ndash; but not the mindless zombies seen in the Dracula movies we watched in the theaters as kids. Instead, these zombies appear to independently think and communicate. As they attack and kill our troops their ranks grow in numbers. What we do know is that a dead soldier, in any condition, burned, missing limbs or shot all to hell will, if not 'finished,' rise as a Kroid within 24 hours. A 'finished' corpse is one that has had its head removed.&#10;&#10;- Why are the Kroids here and what do they want?&#10;Sadly we have no idea. We believe this is the result of same wacky Nazi secret weapon experiment gone horribly wrong and we will just have to deal with it as best as we can. We do know that a Nazi machine called the Cyclomatron was built and activated by a team of SS scientists and engineers working at Castle Wewelsburg in Germany. Somehow this machine is the power behind these Kroids.&#10;&#10;- How do we defeat the Kroids?&#10;To date our strategy has been one of attacking the Third Reich's ability to wage war. We have been very successful in dismantling their infrastructure by destroying factories, refineries and transport. We have denied them the ability to manufacture and deploy the tools of war. The Kroids have no supply lines and they pick their tools of war up off the ground. They do not need to eat; they do not need to sleep. Their machines do not run on gas and ball bearings. Simply put, we have to change our entire strategy. As commanders you must think with your head. A casualty in your command is a new recruit for the Kroid army. The orders you have already received detail our current strategy, which is one of containment. Until further notice we are going on the defensive.&#10;&#10;",
