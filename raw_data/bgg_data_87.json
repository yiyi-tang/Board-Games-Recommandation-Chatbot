    "Description": "Team up with fellow wizards to vanquish the sinister monsters that lurk in the dungeon, and save the nearby village. This is a noble and honorable quest, and... oh, who are we kidding? In reality, you're a greedy wizard who is all about fame and personal gain, and your fellow wizards are cut from the same cloth! Prevail over your opponents by learning the best spells and using that knowledge to outmaneuver and kill-steal in the dungeon, so you can gain admiration of the townsfolk, fame across the realm, and achieve Pixel Glory.&#10;&#10;In the first phase, the town phase, players will be drafting spells using an auction mechanic. Players will then take their decks into the second phase, the dungeon phase, where they will work together to defeat monsters; however, only the player that deals the lethal blow will get the fame for it. There is a lot of interaction and engagement due to players fighting over learning the same spells as well as fighting over fame.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "To set up the two-player abstract strategy game Kamon, shuffle the game's 37 tokens and fill the hexagonal grid with one token on each hex. The tokens consist of one blank token and 36 tokens in six colors and six symbols, with each combination appearing once. (In earlier versions of the game, tokens were valued 1-6 in each of six different symbols, with one hex being left empty.) The blank token fills space and serves only as a barrier.&#10;&#10;To start, the black player places one of their pawns on a perimeter space that touches only one side of the hex. The token on this space, e.g. the red fish, indicates where the white player must place one of their pawns on the next turn, either on a red token or on a fish token, and the white player's pawn constrains where the black player can next place a pawn. Players continue taking turns in this manner, and the game ends immediately when one of three victory conditions are fulfilled:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A player connects two opposite edges of the grid with their pawns (as in Hex).&#10;     A player surrounds one or more hexes with a loop of their pawns without regard as to whether those hexes are empty or occupied by the opponent's pawns.&#10;     A player prevents their opponent from placing a pawn, e.g. by occupying the yellow mountain when no more yellow tokens or mountain tokens are available.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player holds a hand of eight white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes more) to the round boss, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The round boss determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent a point, and then the player to the left of the Round Boss becomes the new Boss for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, or until they are thrown out of the pub, at which point the player with the most Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Kampf gegen das Spie&szlig;ertum is the German adaption of Kampf gegen das B&uuml;nzlitum, a Swiss party game by Angela V&ouml;gtli and is a hommage to the popular Cards against Humanity.&#10;&#10;It features all new cards with German celebrities, places and topics of interest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The tiles representing the performers are placed in these marketplaces in such a way as to establish local dominance hierarchies, which are resolved by kicking the loser out on the street and promoting the winners to higher-class sections of Muscat.  Eventually, once can reach the Sultan's palace, and when enough performers have everyone scores points according to how high their performers have advanced up the board.&#10;&#10;There is more to it than that, of course.  The performers kicked out on the street want to get their revenge, and they can be placed back on the board or used to take 3 special actions which add a great deal of complexity to the game.  Although there is some randomness (in which tiles you pick when), this is essentially an abstract of the &quot;brain-burner&quot; school, and should be enjoyed by those who like that kind of  game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Message to the Czar&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Try also to collect Batteries to activate the Machine rooms of your boat, or Food to feed the new healthy Humans&hellip;&#10;&#10;In Precognition, you must truly see the future to win the game. That comes from understanding a new card mechanism: the Dual Select System. In addition to being innovative, the Dual Select System fits perfectly with the theme because, among the two cards that you will let pass, one of them will come back to you on the next turn. You have 12 turns to make the right choices.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to have the most Healthy Humans at the end of the game. To keep the Humans you take in while working your way downstream, you will need Food, Doctors to treat them and Protectors to fight the Banes you&rsquo;ll encounter. Good luck!&#10;&#10;The game is played over 12 rounds. A round consists of 3 distinct phases. Each phase must be done by all the players at the same time.&#10;I &ndash; Decision phase (secret): draw and choose cards according to the Dual Select System.&#10;II &ndash; Action phase: Activate your cards to earn resources. If any of your powered machines can be used, benefit from its effects.&#10;III &ndash; Maintenance phase : manage your Banes if you have suffer any, heal all possible contaminated Humans and move forward on the Great River from which you reveal and apply the event of the River tile.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, move forward by flipping over the River tile in front of the Progress pawn to discover the end-of-turn event. Each player applies that event&rsquo;s effect. Every three rounds, it is the end of a season and it is when you feed the new healed Humans. Make sure you have enough food for everyone.&#10;&#10;At the end of the third season, after feeding the Healthy Humans you have saved, count them. The player with the most Healthy Humans wins the game. If tied, the player with the most Healthy Humans and Contaminated Humans wins the game.

It is possible to harness their large political prowess in order to make quick gains, but at the cost of becoming less and less moderate, which may eventually hamper your possibility to win the long game.&#10;&#10;The map represents the political reality of Europe in the Interbellum, divided in six scoring regions (Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain and the Little Entente of Yugoslavia, Romania and Czechoslovakia).&#10;&#10;Play progresses over three periods: The Roaring Twenties, followed by the Great Depression and finally the Appeasement period.&#10;&#10;Europe is in Turmoil again!

    "Description": "Every year in the realm of Wild, the first snow of the season brings new life to the land and the creatures who inhabit it. High atop the tallest peaks, the sun beats down on this fresh blanket of white, creating a rushing river that floods the magical valleys below.&#10;&#10;In River Wild, you must carve out the most harmonious land possible, plotting the river's course to create protected valleys for local wildlife to thrive. A protected valley is defined as a valley completely surrounded by river or mountains with no card gaps.&#10;&#10;Each turn, select one of the three river cards on display and add it to your land to extend your river. All cards must be played below the source card so that your river extends &quot;downstream&quot; (toward you). When choosing a card, you may look at and play either side of a card. Refill the display, then choose again, continuing play until all cards have been added to your land or until you are unable to play any more cards.&#10;&#10;Unprotected valleys don't score, and protected valleys score based on the wildlife (dragons, jackalopes, toads, and unicorns) and scoring goals contained within it. Make matches to score as many points as possible.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the Funkoverse Strategy Game, you combine your favorite characters and go head-to-head in four exciting game scenarios. Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Game of Thrones 100 is a standalone game that includes the characters Daenerys Targaryen, Night King, Jon Snow, and Arya Stark. Game of Thrones 100 also introduces two brand new 4-player Free-For-All Scenarios along with the first ever companion character, Ghost! This set may be combined with others, giving you the ability to assemble the team you want!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Here you'll see dolphins jumping, lovers holding hands, and children playing in the sand...always in pairs.&#10;&#10;Twin Palms is a beach-themed escape from your traditional trick-taking card game. At the start of each of the game's 5-8 rounds, you bid the number of tricks (0-5) you think you'll claim with the ten cards in your hand. Wait, ten cards = five tricks? Yes, because each time you play to a trick, you play two cards at once!&#10;&#10;You play the game with 1-3 suits of cards depending on your desired level of difficulty and the number of players at the table; each suit has cards numbered 0-10 and a wild, with each card appearing twice. The strongest play is a pair of cards that are the same number, with high numbers beating low ones, and with palm trees beating dolphins, which beat sunglasses, which beat pairs that are of different suits. If no one plays a pair, then whoever played the highest single card wins the trick. After five tricks, you score points if you've met your bid exactly. (If you bid a non-zero number of tricks but missed, you still score 1 point per trick taken.)&#10;&#10;What's more, if you want to play risky, you can place bets on your bids, giving you an additional way to win (or lose) points. Whoever has the most points after the designated number of rounds wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the fall of 1941, the German Blitzkrieg was ready for one more final grand effort: the conquest of Moscow. Code-named Typhoon, Germany expected this final offensive to destroy all Soviet armies in front of Moscow in a classic double-envelopment by the Panzer divisions. In short, the Germans expected Typhoon to end the war in the east. Spearheading the German attack was Army Group Center, General Guderian's PanzerArmee, with some 900,000 men in 70 divisions. Facing them, blocking the way to the Soviet seat of power, were over 800,000 Soviet troops in 95 divisions.&#10;&#10;The German assault was ferocious and incessant and came within sight of the Moscow Kremlin. Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected. After suffering huge losses in the opening battles, the Soviets reinforced the front line with Siberian and other reserves numbering perhaps 1.2 million men.&#10;&#10;The battle for Moscow proved to be one of the decisive battles of the Second World War.&#10;Now, you can replay this epic struggle for supremacy in the east. The game's easy-to-play system allows the players to focus on the critical matters of operational maneuver and force coordination, while adding just enough chrome to faithfully recreate the key elements of the campaign. See if you have the skill to crush or save the Soviet Empire in 1941.&#10; ---COUNTERS-----------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;4 1/2 Countersheets totaling 1080 full-color two-sided counters&#10;&#10;-Countersheets 1,2,3,5 are full sheets of 240 counters each&#10;-Countersheet 4 is a half sheet of 120 counters&#10;&#10;---MAPS---------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;-3 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;&#10;---OTHER--------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;-1 D10&#10;-1 24-page Rule-book&#10;-1 24-page Play-book&#10;-1 Typhoon!

All players have to face this threat, while pursuing their individual Achievements. If they fail to constrain the rise of Corruption, everyone loses the game. Collecting the most Achievements, while avoiding this fatal outcome, allows one player to win the game.&#10;&#10;Players guide different Tribes of Weybits, the youngest sons of Faeriell. They are tiny and industrious humanoids, with the common goal to preserve the environment from Corruption and help the Great Guardians, the giant keeper animals that watch over the land since remote times. The customization of the Weybit Heroes starts from the beginning with the selection of their Tribe Masks, original items which can be worn by the minis. Each color of those masks provides a different specialization. New Heroes can be dressed and upgraded during the game with the acquisition of Perks, additional abilities that make every character unique. Weybits can become the most efficient helpers to the Great Guardians, mastering the knowledge of nature and learning to fight Corruption.&#10;&#10;As an additional thrill to the game, one player can choose to change sides, get corrupted and gain the Corruption Sower as a new Hero, becoming able to win in the event Corruption defeats all others.&#10;&#10;Strategic choices lead to multiple endings, making every game a different story to be unfolded.&#10;&#10;",

Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Back to the Future 100 is a standalone game that includes the characters Marty McFly and Doc Brown.

Once the attacker is finished with all of his or her actions, the defender now gets their action phase.&#10;&#10;The final phase is the Combat phase. This is when your warriors fight.

The goal is to have the lowest sum of points at the end of each round, accomplished by swapping, stealing, and getting rid of cards. Points are scored after each round, with the game continuing to an agreed mark when the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, players have ONE opportunity to look at any TWO of their own cards, returning them to the same face-down position. Players should remember their value and location.&#10;&#10;Over a series of rounds, players will draw 1 card and chose to keep the drawn card, exchanging it for one of their own face down cards or immediately discard it, possibly triggering a special ability allowing them to peek at, swap or give additional facedown cards to other players.  When any player feels as though they have the lowest hand of cards in front of them, they call Archduke which triggers the final scoring of each round.  The lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pack of Heroes is a two-player card game set in a fun parallel universe of vintage comic books. Each player picks his team from the 30 different heroes in the game, then takes on his opponent in an exciting tactical battle with all sorts of crazy super powers! Combat is resolved with the unique &quot;power card&quot; system, which is designed to have all the excitement of dice-based combat but with far less randomness. Whoever has the last hero standing wins control of Power City!&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the hero cards. They represent one hero in the game and are modelled after vintage trading cards. On the front side is a picture of the hero, and all the gameplay info about their powers; on the back are fun stats and an origin story!&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player assembles his team. You can either pick one of the set starting teams or draft your team. Drafting allows you to put almost countless sets of heroes together to try out all sorts of crazy combos and synergies. Drafting works almost like a mini-game before the main event, as the players try to put their best possible team together. Once you have picked your team, it's time to fight. The players take it in turn either bringing a hero into play, or using their hand of power cards to trigger one of their heroes' amazing special abilities!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nanolith is a cyberpunk-dungeon crawler with heavy rpg elements. The game is played in two books (the encounter- and the storybook) which present the players with the fatalistic story of the four main characters and their quest to retrieve their lost memories. In the encounter book artworks, scenario maps, and comics tell the progressing story of a human civilisation on the brink of extinction. Scenario outcomes, items the players get during the encounters and player decisions reference text sections in the storybook which advance the surprising and creative novel situated in the world of nanolith. Depending on player decisions and the outcome of scenarios the narrative paths of the story diverge greatly.&#10;&#10;The mechanics used to bring the unique skill sets of each character to live provide a deep tactical, cooperative experience. Through the use of five six-sided activation dice movement, item activation and special skills can be activated by the players. But fear not the bad luck of rolling a hand full of dice! The clever mitigation mechanics using aggro to manipulate the value of your rolled dice guarantees, that if you really need to power up your mightiest abilities you will be able to do so. But every power comes with a price. The more you push your luck the harder your character may fall. Overusing the nanomachines your body produces you will at some point overcharge and set free the power of the nanolith inscribed in your DNA. You will get nanoshocked and be able to use a mighty character specific nanoshock ability once for free. But the more often you do this the closer you bring your precious character to the threshold between live and death. So choose you weapons wisely.&#10;&#10;Most importantly Nanolith is a game of adventure and storytelling. The world in which this game plays out is different from any generic science fiction world you ever visited before. Player decisions do have a heavy impact on the story and the prose written for this game is much more than decorative attachment. It's a cyberpunk novel in which your characters are the main protagonists. Your decisions seal the destiny of Neo Eden. So don't hesitate any longer. The Nanolith awaits you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game portrays the differences between North Vietnamese divisions and the Rangers/Marines/Parachutists and other units of the South Vietnamese. Air power and desertion are also featured, with the whole thing being completed by event cards that give the game great replayability. An ingenious mix that provides a game on tenterhooks right up to the last turn! If, at the end of any turn, the North player controls Saigon province the game ends with a North victory. The South player wins by successfully defending Saigon until the end of Turn 8.&#10;&#10;Solo Rules&#10;In the solo mode, you play the South, while the North is controlled by a deck of cards (AI). There is not a lot of difference between the solo and two-player modes in terms of the rules and the winning condition. During each turn, there are phases (movement, attack, etc.) where the AI draws one card and does a specific action.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Moon Base is a two-player abstract game set on the moon, proceeding over six rounds. The player replenishes the 'Ring Module' at each round, and builds the moon base while placing and stacking on the crater. The player uses their three-color ring well to advance their color. At the end of each round, it will be a point to construct a 'residential zone' and 'resource facility', but while aiming to move the 'mobile research building' effectively, players will also aim for bonus points that can be earned at the end of the sixth round . Finally, the player with many total points wins.&#10;&#10;Game Abstract &#10;Moon Base is a 2 player abstract game about Moon Development. There Are 6 Rounds. Each round, players choose a set number of ring modules to place on the craters, or place on top of each other to develop the Moon Base. Using the three different colors of the rings, players try to build in a way that their colors will gain the upper hand. At the end of each round whoever has the highest total points wins the game with the highest points by gaining bonus points at the end.&#10;&#10;5 Features of Moon Base&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#156;Feature 1&#239;&#188;&#158; Unique Game Board&#10;&#10;The impressive craters on the lunar board are the squares of this game. Craters overlap, so if you put a ring in one crater, the other one overlapping it also gets eliminated, and vice versa if you put a ring on the other. Depending on which crater you are placing a ring on, the situation on the board changes and affects your game plan. First come, first served, so if you really care about placing your ring on a specific crater, make sure you do it earlier than your opponent!&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#156;Feature 2&#239;&#188;&#158; A 3D Stacking Game&#10;&#10;The ring modules that make up Moon Base can be stacked to 2 or 3 layers, and the position where they are placed impacts the subsequent turns. It&rsquo;s a strategic game, and there are aspects of analog games mixed into it. Regret joyously. &ldquo;I should have put this ring a little more inside!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#156;Feature 3&#239;&#188;&#158; Random Setup&#10;&#10;Although it is an abstract game, the ring modules are prepared randomly. But once the game starts, you must rely solely on your choices and decisions. All ring modules are disclosed, so make your best judgment on which ring to choose. Have future rounds in mind, read your opponent&rsquo;s prospective moves in the next round, and change randomness into certainty.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#156;Feature 4&#239;&#188;&#158; A game that gets more exciting towards the end&#10;&#10;Players alternate with each player having 4 turns across 6 rounds = 24 hands (placing 1 ring each turn). Bonus points can be earned depending on the situation at the final round, so the battle will get more competitive towards the end. Each player aims to find an unexpected move to turn the game around.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#156;Feature 5&#239;&#188;&#158; Think about the future on the completed lunar base&#10;&#10;The game ends when the moon base is complete. The spectacular sight on the board that was created at the end of the competition is a collaborative work you&rsquo;ve created together with your opponent. After the game, take a moment to look up at the moon in the night sky and think about what we might expect in the future.&#10;&#10;",

You can build majestic pagodas and Shinto shrines, learn ancient eastern wisdom, explore the world, or fight ancient monsters &mdash; or all of the above. This is a sandbox-style game, and how you play is up to you!&#10;&#10;In Floating World, you play as one of six unique characters from Edo Japan, each with a unique power and a mysterious secret. The game plays simultaneously over three phases that repeat until one player has gained a victory condition. All phases occur simultaneously, and they are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Draw Phase: Draw six cards from your deck, then pass them to another player. They take these cards, discard one of their choice, then separate the remaining five cards into two piles, one containing two cards and one containing three. You do the same for another player, then take your two piles, discarding one of them and playing the other.&#10;    The Collect Phase: Collect items and bonuses indicated on the cards in your hand. You may also pay time tokens to perform extra actions in the next phase.&#10;    The Action Phase: Simultaneously take actions based on your cards in hand and those that you chose in the collect phase. Disputes caused by the simultaneous nature of these actions are resolved using the influence track, where the player at the top of the track chooses the outcome; choosing in your own interest, however, drops you to the bottom of the track.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rounds continue in this way until a player gains any of the seven victory conditions available, such as collecting all four ganbaru tokens or discovering another player's secret location and achieving any two of the ganbaru tokens.&#10;&#10;Philosophia: Floating World contains over 200 tarot-sized cards and 12 intricate miniatures and is filled with beautiful Ukiyo-e style Japanese art, all digitally remastered to regain the original vibrance of the era.

The corpses of pixies, goblins, unicorns, cyclops, and dragons have begun to pile up, so you've got your work cut out for you. Manage your private crypt and the communal graveyard, each with different placement rules. Keep the place organized as you bury corpses in different areas of the graveyard, or it's your own grave you'll be digging!&#10;&#10;You earn points based on how well-organized you keep your private crypt and the communal graveyard, grouping corpse types together. You also earn points at the end of the game for the number of different corpse types you've scored on during the game. Whoever collects the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Two teams, each consisting of 2-3 heroes, face off in fast-paced duels on one of six battlemaps.&#10;&#10;Battlecharged uses a unique energy charging system in which every character has a different fighting style: a melee skirmisher like Rayla recharges when she darts in and out of combat, while a defender like Soren charges when you attack him or his adjacent ally.&#10;&#10;The base game includes eight characters: Rayla, Ezran, Callum, Amaya, Janai, Viren, Claudia, and Soren. Each is represented with a high-quality miniature, a hero card, and a 16-card deck.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The island of Luzon &mdash; the largest and most populous in the Philippines &mdash; poses a series of challenges to those seeking to build a railroad network and profit from it. The island's topography is difficult to work with as large mountain ranges collide with wetlands, and an already established shipping industry means that coastal cities will be profitable only to rail networks that have already established effective routes.&#10;&#10;In Luzon Rails, players are rail investors. They buy stock in companies, seek to improve those companies, and amass wealth when company dividends pay out.&#10;&#10;This game differs from cube rail games you may have played before. Variable company start locations mean that companies can feel quite different from game to game. Actions are selected by playing action cards either from hand or from a central pool, which leads players to make tough decisions and risky moves. How would you proceed in a round where it looks like there will be few auctions? How would that affect your own bids?&#10;&#10;Some features on the board try to encourage varied rail types. Landlocked cities grant a long term bonus to companies that then connect to coastal cities. Manila provides a one-off dividend payment for investors who can make a company rail reach that far. And the Southern peninsula creates tight conditions if more than one company has ambitions on the cities down there.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter edition comes with an official solo-mode and the Private Companies expansion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

One player plays the &ldquo;Hako Onna&rdquo; (the Woman in the Box), and the rest are &ldquo;Visitors&rdquo;, who are trying to escape from the mansion. As Visitors, you&rsquo;ll try not to make noise as you search the shadowy rooms of the mansion for items to protect yourself, for information, and for a way to escape what you do not see, but know is there. But if you stumble upon the Hako Onna, you&rsquo;re dead. Players who discover the Hako Onna become a Hakobito, one of her servants, and wake up with her to move throughout the house.&#10;&#10;During most of Hako Onna's turn, the human players must keep their eyes closed so they cannot see where she moves to or what action she has done. The game also features a unique optional dexterity element that adds to the game's overall tension and dread. Before a visitor can take their turn, they need to avoid making noise by stacking a small disc on top the previous ones; if the tower collapses, they've made noise and it instantly becomes Hako Onna's turn.&#10;&#10;Hako Onna can win the game in two ways:&#10;&#10;    If all visitors are turned into Hakobito, or&#10;    If she has made it impossible for the visitors to win.&#10;&#10;&#10;The human players can win in one of three ways:&#10;&#10;    If they manage to kill Hako Onna after finding her only weakness,&#10;    If they find the secret exit, while in posession of the key ring hidden inside the safe, or&#10;    If they can bring peace to Hako Onna by bringing the remains of her body to her precious doll, Mary.&#10;&#10;&#10;Since its original publication in Japanese, Hako Onna has reached its fourth edition, and has been republished in English by WizKids. The English edition features all-new cards for players to use as they experience the thrilling horror of this thematically-rich game.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#155;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#231;&#167;&#176;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#239;&#188;&#134;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#128;&#230;&#128;&#168;&#233;&#156;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#168;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#168;&#170;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#168;&#170;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#156;&#183;&#229;&#177;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#168;&#170;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#168;&#170;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#230;&#157;&#161;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#232;&#168;&#170;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Players collect different alchemical ingredients, called reagents, over the course of the game and combine them in a series of experiments in order to discover the mysteries of the Philosophers' Stone. The Discovery Matrix is where all of these experiments are conducted and the random selection and placement of Research and Discovery cards in the matrix insures that no two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;Earn the gold you need to purchase your reagents, gain experience from your failures and knowledge from your successes, transmute the physical and mystical elements into the Philosopher's Stone and you will go down in history for your Magnum Opus.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "December 1757: Not since losing Silesia in 1742 had Austria come so close to regaining the province. With the recent Imperial victory at Breslau (November 22) Austrian forces under Prince Charles of Lorraine and Field-marshal Daun, the victor at Kolin, were only a battle away from that goal. They expected to fight this battle in the new campaign year which would begin in the coming spring.&#10;&#10;For King Frederick II the loss of Silesia would not only be a devastating blow to his prestige but deprived of its resources, revenue and manpower Prussia's ability to continue the war would be desperately compromised. Rather than to allow the enemy to go unchallenged Frederick marched his remaining army of 40,000 men composed of Rossbach veterans and Breslau survivors against Charles' nearly 60,000-strong force of Austrians, Hungarians, Imperials, Bavarians and Wurttembergers.&#10;&#10;On a frigid December 5th, in a season when armies usually sought the comfort of winter quarters, the opposing forces met on the snow covered fields surrounding the Silesian village of Leuthen. After deftly maneuvering around Prince Charles' flank Frederick's Prussians attacked with unprecedented fury collapsing the enemy line. However, despite this initial crushing blow the Austrians were able to reorganize their front and fight the Prussians to a standstill leaving the battle's final outcome still in doubt. Only after a climactic cavalry charge did the Habsburg army finally break and retreat to Breslau. Two weeks later the city capitulated and the Austrians evacuated Silesia. Although the war would continue for another six years Frederick would never again attain the level of success he did at Leuthen, his greatest victory.&#10;&#10;Leuthen (Battles from the Age of Reason, Vol. 3) presents both gamers and students of the period with a colorful and meticulously detailed simulation with which to explore the actual events and possibilities of this definitive battle. Included is an historical commentary written especially for the game by the period's leading authority, Prof. Christopher Duffy. This narrative contains many previously unpublished aspects of the battle and includes maps, diagrams, statistics and his analysis of the 1757 campaign in Silesia.&#10;&#10;",

The game comes with three Space Marine Scout squads and six Tyranid Warriors.  It has rules for including several miniatures from the old WH40K Space Marine and Tyranid range. (Rules were also published in White Dwarf for using an Imperial Guard or Ork force instead of Space Marines).&#10;The game mechanics are very simple: Space Marines move and fire and then the Tyranids move and fire. The map is built gradually by the Tyranid player from a complete layout he keeps secret as the Space Marines explore the ship. The space marines explore the bioship in search of its vital organs, hoping to survive the waves of aliens as they head deeper inside.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns placing a die on the game board, and once all the dice are gone, the round ends.&#10;&#10;You will invite guests to stay at your hotel, with them paying you at the end of a round and ideally staying additional nights so that you don't have to find more guests. By placing tiles on your board, you upgrade the hotel, increasing bonuses and earning more income. Dice can also represent employees, who gain you resources with their work time; additional dice can be earned, both permanent and part-time.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one of the talent cards, giving them unique powers during the game. By using this power and their dice, players can fulfill goals and projects or attract VIP guests.&#10;&#10;In the end, whoever earns the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Based on the epic &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles&quot;-System, (further upgraded to the Library of Napoleonic Battles): it shows 480 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn, 400-800 men per strength point. Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 20 turns. The Full campaign links the individual battles.&#10;&#10;This game contains five battles from the opening phase of the 1814 Campaign in France following the Battle of Nations, which was fought just half a year before at Leipzig.&#10;&#10;Napoleon has just arrived at the front. At their first encounter the French surprised Bl&uuml;cher's Prussians and Russians during a snowstorm. The Battle of Brienne was a short-lived success, however, for just two days later the Prussians triumphed at La Rothi&egrave;re and wrote-off the enemy as a spent force, advancing hell-for-leather across the Marne and onto the highway to Paris. Ten days later Napoleon seized his opportunity when &quot;Marschal Vorw&auml;rts&quot; allowed his advancing columns to get dispersed and defeated in detail, in rapid succession in three short sharp combats.&#10;&#10;BATTLES SIMULATED &#10;Brienne Unskilled Fury, 29-30 January. &#10;The raw conscripts under Napoleon and Ney chased the Russians and Prussians from the town. Bluucher himself was almost captured.&#10;&#10;La Rothi&egrave;re A Defeat on French Soil, 1 February. &#10;Reinforced with troops from the Army of Bohemia, Bl&uuml;cher was ready to fight again. Napoleon, not realizing the enemy's overwhelming superiority, advanced. At Noon Bl&uuml;cher attacked, taking 54 guns and inflicting 6,000 French casualties.&#10;&#10;Champaubert, 10 February. &#10;Marmont ran into an isolated corps of 4,500 Russians commanded by Olsufief. Marmont attacked and dispersed the Russian corps, capturing its commander.&#10;&#10;Montmirail, 11 February. &#10;Mortier pinned down Yorck and Kleist's Prussians to the front, while Napoleon separated Sacken's Russians from their allies, sending them streaming back towards Ch&acirc;teau Thierry.&#10;&#10;Vauchamps, 14 February. &#10;Marmont held Bl&uuml;cher's Prussians in check while Napoleon made a flank march through the mud, sending Grouchy's cavalry round to the rear to cut their retreat to Ch&acirc;lons.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;Three 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps&#10;560 counters&#10;100 cards&#10;2 rulebooks&#10;15 player aids&#10;Box&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM: &#10;The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series&quot; &#10;- scale = 480m/hex, &#10;- time = 1hour/GT,&#10;- strength = 500-800 men/SP.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SOCCER BLAST is designed to bridge the gap between highly detailed soccer games that play in the 90-120 minute range and quick-play games which are primarily designed to generate realistic scores. PLAAY Games has taken the basic game engine from its hockey and lacrosse games, and modified it to capture the more refined nuances of classic football. The result: a sports board game that gives fans everything they love about watching soccer, captured in a 30-45 minute game window.&#10;&#10;Despite the quick playing time, SOCCER BLAST provides surprising detail and the genuine sense of witnessing a full, realistic football match from start to finish. Individual players' true-to-life abilities are captured simply but realistically, using a series of easy-to-understand symbols and descriptive qualities. These individual performances synch together to create realistic team results that will make you feel like you're in the stands watching the game for real!&#10;&#10;SOCCER BLAST was created in such a way as to place an emphasis on story and context. Yes, the statistics are important, and we think you'll be pleased with the numerical results. However, this game is more than just numbers. The usual assortment of drama-inducing elements and game mechanics that PLAAY Games have become known for have been built into this game as well. For example, referees can affect play--and BE affected by play. If somebody says the wrong thing to a ref, his team might have to pay for it. In SOCCER BLAST, you'll occasionally see a subjective referee call that should have gone the other way, and you'll experience that palpable sense of joy, or disgust, depending on your leaning!&#10;&#10;The game offers many other features. The advantage of playing on one's home pitch is very real, but not over-stated. Injuries will play a factor, and you may be chagrined to see your star player carted off the field with the match hanging in the balance. Fatigue is a factor, too--you'll face the same challenge with late-game substitutions that a real soccer coach faces, and you'll need to plan accordingly. And, the game comes with a full complement of unusual and rare results waiting to add memorable twists to your tabletop sports archives.&#10;&#10;Finally, SOCCER BLAST Pro Soccer Game allows you to rate your own teams with its &quot;How-To&quot; guide, made available at a nominal extra charge. The world is filled with soccer teams and every country has its own league or leagues. Ordinarily, this poses a problem for game companies because while many of these leagues have devoted fan followings, they're not large enough to warrant the time and energy of creating cards for them. If you have your OWN favorite team or league, you won't have to depend on PLAAY Games to make cards for you&mdash;you'll be able to make them yourself!&#10;&#10;",

The monks may move from tile to tile and in addition to building work they can also study, toil or pray. In the &lsquo;icon&rsquo; game monks can also make use of the special properties of some of the tiles.&#10;&#10;The tiles vary in value ranging from 1 point field and path tiles to 5 point Chapter House and Library. The higher the value of tile the more monks are needed to build it. Players can build independently, but often they are required to work collaboratively.&#10;&#10;The game spreads over two days of monastic life, with turns being allocated as time for study and toil or for services in the abbey. At each service a new abbot is elected and apart from going first in the turn the abbot also has some significant powers.&#10;&#10;In order to win the game players must collect the letters of the abbey&rsquo;s motto &lsquo;Libera Nos Quaesumus Ab Omnibus Malis Amen&rsquo;. The letters become progressively more expensive and players must decide whether to buy letters or recruit extra monks.&#10;&#10;Points at game end are also awarded for the &lsquo;blessings&rsquo; which players can collect throughout the game.&#10;&#10;",

American and German troops scramble from their bases to try and delay the Soviets, for if they get through, they will drive all the way to the Rhine.  Over two thousand tanks will meet in the decisive engagement of the war.&#10;&#10;The Corps Command system returns with a modern twist!  Asset chits allow players to bring in reinforcements and influence the battle space with gunships, chemical attacks and electronic warfare.  New defensive fire rules give an attacker a reason to sweat and encourage players to match their units to the right terrain.  All of this with the same lean, mean and simple system as the first game in the series, Corps Command: Totensonntag.&#10;&#10;The Soviets hit hard but fold fast - as their units wear down they lose initiative, making them less and less capable, and the clock is against them.  The NATO (American and German) forces defending the Gap are highly capable but are outnumbered and playing for time.  Both players are being asked to do the impossible - to win the greatest tank battle of all time.&#10;&#10;The game ships with:&#10;&#10;A 17&quot; x 22&quot; map that beautifully depicts the lush, West German landscape of the Eisenbach Gap.&#10;&#10;136 colorful, 5/8&quot; counters, representing the battalions and brigades that fought the first battle of World War III.&#10;&#10;Easy to learn, quick to read, rules.

Collect colorful koi fish and choose whether to place them in your pond or in your house. You'll score points only for the *lower* number, though, so keep your pond and house as balanced as you can. Your pond is public, but your house is secret. To win, you have to be...coy!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players take turns drawing a card from the face-down deck or from the face-up &quot;lake&quot; until everyone has three new cards in hand. Then all players simultaneously choose from amongst their entire hand one card to add to their personal pond and one to discard to their personal &quot;river&quot;. Cards in your river will eventually go to the lake, so choose carefully.&#10;&#10;After six turns, the round ends. Score points by comparing the total number of koi of a suit in your pond and your house. Score points equal to the *lower* number. Score each suit of koi in this manner. If a crane, housecat or turtle is in your pond, you score bonus points for koi of that noted suit in your opponent's pond (crane), house (housecat) or river (turtle). Which opponent depends on the number of players and the current round.&#10;&#10;After each round, ribbons are awarded to the player with the most koi of each suit in her river. Ribbons grant bonus points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To maximize your koi score, you have to carefully balance the populations in your pond and house. A turtle, housecat, or crane earns points from an opponent's hard work, but they also take valuable space in your hand. Sending high value koi cards to your river earns more ribbons, but also makes them available to all players in the next round. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Millionen von Schwalben is a (fairly satirical) soccer-themed game. Each player manages several soccer teams in a world championship tournament, trying to become rich. Matches are played with cards and die rolling, and different teams have different abilities. The action and country cards allude to many real-life events in soccer.&#10;&#10;Even though team success in the tournament is rewarded, the 'big money' is made through betting on the matches. Interestingly, the referee (another player) places bets, as well...&#10;&#10;The game also contains 54 soccer-themed cards for Game: Anno Domini published independently as Anno Domini: Fussball WM.&#10;&#10;Available microbadge: &#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "GD '40 - The Battle for Stonne, France 1940, is game 5 in the Tactical Combat Series by The Gamers and covers the battle for Stonne, France in 1940. It is the first in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II.&#10;&#10;The German breakthrough at Sedan opened the way for Guderian&rsquo;s dash to the English Channel. What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash. It is not an understatement to say that had the French significantly threatened the Sedan bridgehead, the 1940 campaign could have developed quite differently. The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD&rsquo;40, players have the chance to change history. A successful French player may cause OKW to put the brakes on Guderian&rsquo;s advance, which could give the French army time to react to the surprise German blow at Sedan. Failure will allow history to take its course&mdash;one of the most decisive victories of modern time. GD&rsquo;40 is the first in a series of TCS games which will portray the Grossdeutschland throughout the war&mdash;from an infantry regiment in 1940 to a Panzer Corps in 1945. (Note: Just so that no one continues any misconceptions...the Grossdeutschland was a German Army unit; it was not in the Waffen SS.)&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters&#10;Units: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color maps&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 28-page TCS version 3.0 system rulebook&#10;One 8-page Grossdeutschland, 1940 specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-page TCS version 3.0 Charts &amp; Tables folders&#10;Four Player Aid cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 6-20 hours&#10;&#10;",

The resident in each tower is revealed to all players, when their current location is visited &ndash; but if that resident was part of the active players&rsquo; mission, the resident including the tower changes their position. The player who cleverly plans their travels, remembers the residents&rsquo; locations and fulfills three mission first, wins.&#10;&#10;With accessible rules Fabulantica challenges players from age 6 and up to make the best out of their hand cards, to pay close attention at all times so that no residents &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; again, and move efficiently to succeed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pacific Tide: The United States versus Japan, 1941-45 is a compact, Strategic-level board wargame covering the struggle between the United States (including some Commonwealth forces) and Japan in World War II by game designer Gregory M. Smith. This game utilizes a unique and fast-paced, card-driven combat/build system revolving around carrier operations which will provide players with a multitude of decisions. While extremely competitive as a two-player game, Pacific Tide can be enjoyed again and again in Solitaire play format with its unique, &ldquo;personality&rdquo; driven bot system.&#10;&#10;Despite the Strategic level of the game, there are operational and even tactical nuances, as players must decide when and how to commit their carrier forces, land-based air, and even their intelligence assets. To a degree, the Japanese player is racing against the clock. The quality of his pilots degrades over time, and starting in 1943, he also loses the strategic initiative as he becomes the second player. The US Player is also fighting the clock, as he cannot sit back and take a relaxed approach to defeating Japan. If he doesn't win by 1945, he doesn't win at all. Tension build as both sides race toward decisive carrier battles and seizure of key geographical objectives.&#10;&#10;The card-based combat/build system is a different take on the &quot;normal&quot; event/operations points driven systems. Separate card decks are provided for the U.S. and Japanese player. Each year, the players receive that year's cards for free&hellip;but must use build points to repurchase older cards. This will cause the player a few agonizing moments, as he typically cannot afford to re-buy every card he needs (or thinks he needs). Players must also decide which aspect of cards to use &ndash; many have multiple but exclusive uses (such as, &quot;Do A or do B&quot;) and these uses sometimes give very different results based on operational or strategic needs at the time. To help ensure a tense and dynamic game, the system forces players to make many choices and decisions throughout play.&#10;&#10;Units comprise five different types:&#10;&#10;&bull; CV units represent individual carriers or small groups of escort carriers&#10;&bull; INF units represent all types of ground combat troops, including Marine and Army units&#10;&bull; Naval Air units represent carrier borne aircraft&#10;&bull; Land Air units represent bombers and fighters based on land&#10;&bull; Partisan units represent the Filipino resistance, which grew to considerable size by the end of the war&#10;&bull; Campaign set up and reinforcement codes are printed on the counter&#10;&bull; Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts&#10;Control and Entrench markers are also provided for play.&#10;&#10;Special rules are provided for amphibious attacks, repair of fleets, supply effects, and guerillas. Bidding rules determine which side one will play in a tournament-style play format.&#10;&#10;As a bonus for solo players, Pacific Tide features a solitaire assistant &ndash; commonly known as a &quot;Bot&quot; &ndash; which gives guidance to the player for either side during solitaire play. The assistant acts differently based on the &quot;personality&quot; it's been given...aggressive, defensive, or balanced. All game cards have a rating which the assistants will prioritize differently for play. While extremely competitive as a two-player game, Pacific Tide can be enjoyed again and again in solitaire play format with its unique, &ldquo;personality&rdquo; driven Bot-system.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 3 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: Single Year Turns with alternating, multiple cards plays per player&#10;Map Scale: Area map&#10;Unit Scale: from individual carriers or carrier groups, fleets, army-level infantry, air groups&#10;Players: one to two, best with two&#10;Playing Time: two to four hours&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;One map (17&quot; x 22&quot; map size)&#10;One Countersheet of 9/16&rdquo; unit-counters&#10;52 Game Cards&#10;Rules booklet&#10;16 Six-sided Dice&#10;Box and Lid&#10;Game Credits:&#10;&#10;Designer: Gregory M.

As you gather the story tiles, you can exchange them for a song or legend that makes sense of the seemingly random fragments. In the end, the player with the most points gleaned from song and legend cards and opal moon tiles &mdash; and with the fewest leftover story or joker tiles &mdash; wins!&#10;&#10;",

Another rule variation is to allow capturing of an opponent's bead when a line of four is made.&#10;&#10;The game was first sold commercially by Funtastic.

    "Description": "Villagers of The Oak Dell is a dynamic euro-style roll-and-write game in which players embark on the development of a new village. By constructing roads and structures, expanding the population, and mining precious resources, players compete to create the most magnificent settlement. Be cautious, though, as lurking marauders can strike your village at any unpredictable moment!&#10;&#10;The game lasts for twelve rounds. At the start of each round, one of the players rolls four dice and then assigns them to specific sections on a special Dice Sheet with symbols. If any sword symbols are rolled (representing marauder attacks), all players mark them on their sheet. If players don't recruit knights by the end of the game, these swords will result in negative points.&#10;&#10;Afterward, players simultaneously and independently choose one die each, and after placing their pawn next to it, they use the resources indicated by the die on their Village Sheet. Each die can be chosen by any number of players.&#10;Unless the sword symbol is rolled, the die provides two resources, the first from the outer circle and the second from the inner circle on the Dice Sheet.&#10;Throughout the game, players have opportunities to acquire additional resources by constructing buildings, finding resources in the mine, etc.&#10;Every few rounds, special actions are triggered for certain buildings (with red flags).&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds, players tally their points, which are earned by building structures, gathering resources in the warehouse and achieving other scoring conditions.&#10;&#10;The game will also have a campaign mode and a cow.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;The game will be funded on Kickstarter from October 16th to November 1st, 2023.&#10;&#10;",

To become bigger, fish must eat plankton. When you move to a space where there is a fish of the same size or smaller than you, you capture it. Small fish are fast but vulnerable; they can capture small fish but can be captured by any fish, and they are the only ones that can go through shipwrecks. Medium fish can capture small and medium fish, and they can't go through shipwrecks. Big fish can capture fish of any size, and they can't go through shipwrecks.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you move one of your fish two spaces or two of your fish one space each. Fish can move orthogonally, and you must resolve the action of a space before taking your second move. Move into a space with plankton, and your fish grows in size; land on a birth space, and you add a little fish from your reserve to the board. The shipwreck serves as a tunnel for small fish, and the &quot;?&quot; space makes you draw a tile, take its action, then discard it. You might rotate part of the board, put a fisherman to work, or have an unexpected birth. Race to eat five fish first!&#10;&#10;",

It focuses on the core gameplay of Warhammer Underworlds: Shadespire, without the spellcasting introduced in Nightvault, the hunter/quarry mechanics of Beastgrave, or the hunger and primacy of Direchasm. The 36-page rulebook has been written to be fast and easily comprehended, while incorporating some of the terminology employed in later 'seasons' of Warhammer Underworlds to ensure consistency with the latest editions of the game.&#10;&#10;This set serves as a streamlined core set for players and includes two double-sided game boards that feature maps previously released for Shadespire. 90 tokens required to play are included as are 8 black and white combat dice.&#10;&#10;Two warbands new to the system are included and can be used in other games of Warhammer Underworlds. Drepur's Wraithcreepers are represented by four glaivewraith miniatures and their associated fighter cards while Storm of Celestus offers three Stormcast Castigators and their gryph-hound to oppose the nighthaunts. Miniatures are designed as easy-to-build push-fit models. Each warband comes with a pre-made deck of 32 upgrade, ploy, and objective cards exclusive to their faction.  These cards have a stylistic re-design from previous Warhammer Underworlds releases but retain identical card backs and functionality. There are no universal cards in this starter set.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 Learn to Play Rulebook&#10;4 Push-fit Storm of Celestus Minis&#10;4 Push-fit Drepur's Wraithcreeprs Minis&#10;2 Double-sided Game Boards&#10;5 Attack Dice&#10;3 Defense&#10;Fighter Cards&#10;Warband-specific Cards&#10;Tokens&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Drive on Paris, is a game simulating the first 100 days of fighting on the Western Front during World War I.&#10;&#10;The mobile campaign of 1914 in the west was the result of more than a generation of staff planning on both sides. The German General Staff had prepared the Schlieffen Master Plan of a giant right hook into France which its namesake had hoped would result in a Cannae-like battle of annihilation of France. The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.&#10;&#10;Both plans failed.&#10;&#10;Drive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds. Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.&#10;&#10;Both side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.&#10;&#10;This system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual &quot;one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it&quot;. Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to &quot;win&quot; ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).&#10;&#10;Drive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series. These games are designed to be easy enough for novice players, yet meaty enough to retain the interest of veterans. It violates two principals of game design at the same time: Easy games are dumb, and the converse that interesting games are hard. The SCS challenges these bogus assertions...and has successfully done so for eight years now.&#10;&#10;Part of the Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 6.2 miles / 10 Km&#10;Units: Brigades to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheet (420 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook&#10;One 24-page Drive on Paris specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-12 hours&#10;&#10;",
