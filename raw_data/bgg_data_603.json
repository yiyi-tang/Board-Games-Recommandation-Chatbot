The first player to fill his wheelbarrow and return to his animal's stall wins the game.&#10;&#10;Additionally, every time the player passes another player he must make his own animal's sound.  Whenever he passes an animal shown on the board he must make its sound.

If the moving player wins a region, he or she is allowed an additional token placement.&#10;&#10;The first player to score more than 12 votes wins the election.&#10;&#10;",

The objective of the game is similar to that of tennis. For example; if your opponent does not reach the ball before the second bounce, it will be a point in your favour.&#10;The game is played with two teams of two pelotaris (Jai Alai players) and can be played with 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;",

To reach that goal, the heroes deal with a variety of crises like burning buildings, derailing trains and cats on tress.

The fame is needed to win the game, while the experience may be traded for even more super powers, slowly building the hero to be more formidable.&#10;&#10;While the game has some cooperative options, in the end only one hero will be the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;In the 17th century, the Dutch built powerful fleets to protect their overseas trade, particularly the riches flowing from the Spice Islands &mdash; the region that would become known as the Dutch East Indies and eventually Indonesia. In 1880, the discovery of oil in the archipelago made them once again a potential source of enormous wealth.&#10;&#10;But as oil became the underpinning of 20th century economies, the Netherlands this time failed to build the naval strength necessary to guard the islands from predatory enemies. Conservative economists clung to the gold standard in the 1930s, dooming the Dutch economy to a prolonged Depression. By the time the Navy began to see increased funding, it was much too late to change the outcome of the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies.&#10;&#10;In the 1930s, Dutch shipyards stood at the leading edge of naval technology: Dutch submarines first deployed the schnorkel breathing device, for example, and Dutch warships boasted the sophisticated Hazemeyer fire control system that would be enthusiastically copied by the Royal Navy and others. The Netherlands had the means to create a large and modern fleet, and the oil wealth of Borneo and Sumatra provided the motive. But by seeing deficits as a more lethal enemy than the Axis, the government doomed both the home country and the colonies to defeat and occupation.&#10;&#10;Spice Islands is a Second World War at Sea supplement exploring the alternate history possibilities had the Netherlands built the necessary naval and air forces to defend the East Indies and its oil: ships and planes within its financial and industrial capability.  The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by the Royal Netherlands Navy against the Japanese. The pieces represent modernized versions of the dreadnought battleships planned but not completed, and some of those planned or discussed but never built. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Strike South to play most of the scenarios and Midway to enjoy all of them.&quot;&#10;&#10;Spice Islands was originally sold exclusively via pdf download.  Starting in 2011, it was made available as a printed and spiral-bound booklet with die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;There are 210 counters, 70 long &quot;ship&quot; units, and 140 smaller ship, aircraft and fleet / base units.&#10;&#10;",

You will need to grow an army of pyramids, make best use of your hand of cards, and even invoke the powers of the board itself. Can you retain your stake at victory against your opponents&rsquo; competing endeavors?&#10;&#10;Dectana reimplements the Icehouse games Zarcana and Gnostica (which use Tarot cards) for use with the Decktet. As in Zarcana and Gnostica, cards are played to create an abstract network of territories.  Players use card powers from their hand or the board to manipulate their pyramid minions.  The four suits of the Tarot are replaced with the six suits of the Decktet, making for more and different suit powers.  The endgame is triggered when someone hoards, then discards, three Aces.&#10;&#10;Complete rules and player aids available at:&#10;http://ceruleansgames.tripod.com/dectana.htm&#10;&#10;",

If this takes one shake it is also a hole-in-one, if two it is worth a score of two on a hole, and so on.&#10;&#10;However, there are also &quot;red joes&quot;. These cancel par dice and jumping jacks when three are rolled in one shake, and the player is issued a penalty stroke due to being in a hazard. For example, if this occurs on an initial shake, the player earns two strokes for that shake instead of the usual one.&#10;&#10;Scores are tallied for 18 holes, based upon the par rating for each hole on the scorecard.&#10;&#10;",

During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space. But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place. The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins. This set includes dozens of different variant rules gathered over the years to keep the game interesting.&#10;&#10;Tante Tarantel (Aunt Tarantula) scoots round her web, gobbling up your insects as they try to escape. The web is a spiral, you roll the die and move Auntie, then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood, if she runs into a bug or bugs, they go back to her larder. But as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs push others into Auntie's path to certain death!&#10;&#10;",

This is also a good way to progressively introduce players to more complex train games.&#10;&#10;The game was created for a publishing contest launched on BGG by Chad Ellis ($1,000 Budget Design Contest: Get Published!).&#10;It requires submissions to fit in a ziplock format, using at most 5 5x7&quot; cards for the complete game.&#10;&#10;This format requires a very streamlined rules set, so this game is not a true member of the 18xx family of train games, hence the 'pocket'. It does however bring a full featured train game on the table, with network building, locomotives evolution, and if the $tock Market Expansion is used, an alternance of stock rounds and operating rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Like Die Siedler von N&uuml;rnberg and the other historical expansions, it features a fixed map board. The geographic features (resource hexes) and cities mirror the approximate location of their real-world counterparts. &quot;Harbors&quot; ring the playing field.&#10;&#10;The rules of Bavaria cleave closely to those of standard Catan, with a few departures to keep things interesting. Players may only build cities in the round intersections denoting actual cities. Because some of the cities are only one hexside apart, the spacing rule requiring two roads between settlements is not in effect. Having built a road to a hex with a settlement, one cannot build a road leaving it until one has build a settlement on the hex. Finally, to obtain the benefit of a harbor, it is only necessary to lay a road on the hexside shaded in red.&#10;&#10;Part of the Catan series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "War of the Ring Collector's Edition is a strategic wargame in a fantasy setting where one player takes control of the Free Peoples, and the other player controls Shadow Armies.  As with the standard version of this game, one can win a military victory, either as Sauron and the Shadow Armies if he conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or with similar conditions when playing as Fellowship and Free People. The game may also be won by the Free People by completing the quest of the Ringbearer and trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Hidden movement prevents Sauron's awareness of the real intention of his enemies and keeps him looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring. The Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Limited and different choices are offered each turn through the roll of action dice which dictate the type of actions may be performed.  The choices range from personal character actions to political and military decisions through which to develop your winning strategies.&#10;&#10;The War of the Ring Collector's Edition brings all that was in the base game and introduces factions, new characters and new events from the expansion, including Galadriel, the Balrog, the Ents, Dunlendings, Siege Towers, Catapults, Corsairs, and more. It is a complete game with updates to the original game rules and incorporates the expansion rules and cards to allow for new strategies to play out.  This increases both the offensive options of the Shadow Forces and defensive options of the Free Peoples.  This all-in-one version of the game is deeper, more comprehensive, and offers both more, and more difficult, choices of what path to pursue to victory, and where to spend one&rsquo;s resources. The additional armies and characters of this version also enrich the theme and make it more true to the entire Tolkien saga of the Ring War.&#10;&#10;",
