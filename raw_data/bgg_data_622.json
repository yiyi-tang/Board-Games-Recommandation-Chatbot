    "Description": "The battle by Union forces to retake the planet Bey was difficult at best, a slaughter at the worst, as the resistance encountered against the robotic Morpheans proved to be more difficult than expected.  After months of fighting, the Unions 15th  Combined Army commanded by Marshall Jean Baptiste, managed to break the Morphean siege lines among the hills and mountains of the sprawling Blade River valley.&#10;&#10;The Blade River valley ran for hundreds of miles, and at dozens of locations throughout it, fierce battles took place for possession of key locations.  Bridges, power-plants, military training bases, and transportation docks were its lifeblood and the focal point of the fighting.  The 15th CA was reinforced by Union shock troops and mechs, enabling them to push the Morpheans back and eventually out of the valley area.  Mustering it's reserve units, the Morpheans responded in force, not willing to concede defeat to the inferior humans.  Wave upon wave of Morphean aero-fighters and bombers swept up the river valley in a final attempt to re-secure their dominance.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Bomber Run on Blade River is a 1-8 player game where the player or players take on the role of the skeletal Morphean robots with their aero-fighters and bombers, or the defending Union force with their missile equipped infantry squads, armored walkers, anti-aero guns and counter-fighters.&#10;&#10;Attack on Blade River Valley is a free PnP consisting of a 9 page rulebook, 4 map pages (when all are combined), and a sheet of unit counters.  In addition, the player will need about 6-8 d6.&#10;&#10;The game was designed to be played at work station or table, depending on how many of the map pieces the player/s wish to use.  When all the map pieces are placed together they cover an area the size of 4 sheets of 8.5x11 paper.  The simplest form of the game uses just one sheet (To be added shortly).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A wild Party game that is tame enough to play at almost any adults only party, but goes the distance for even the most non-vanilla players. It is intellectually and physically challenging for both couples and singles, and is overflowing with thought provoking and sexually stimulating challenges.&#10;&#10;Designed for all Genders and Preferences&#10;Includes non-gender specific game play that allows for comfortable play among homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual players. The cards have been carefully written so that all contact events can be played with your monogamous partner whether or not he or she is on your team. For non-monogamous players, there has never been a better ice breaker.&#10;&#10;Great for Team Competition&#10;Split the party into teams and let the battle begin. Play girls vs. the boys and find out which gender is sexually smarter and braver. Or break down the teams and go couple vs. couple to discover which couple has the best sexual relationship.&#10;&#10;Great for Couples&#10;Every Thought card is carefully designed to engage the party in constructive conversations regarding the most common sexual and relationship problems. Every Action card was designed to reveal the most common sexual fantasies of both men and women. Playing this game with your spouse might just stoke the flames and teach you something about your partner that you never knew before playing.&#10;&#10;Great for Singles&#10;From college students to retirees, anyone who admits to being a sexual being can learn something from playing this game. In one hour of playing this game, you'll learn more about your sexual compatibility with other players than you could in a solid week of blind dates.&#10;&#10;Directions:&#10;Divide the players into teams. Separate the cards into the four decks of &quot;Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Actions&quot;, &quot;Sex Survey&quot;, and &quot;Daredevil&quot;. The first player on the first team chooses one card from the four decks and completes the challenge. If the other team thinks they have a better answer they may challenge. Each completed card counts as one point. Daredevil card points are marked individually.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one deck is fully depleted and each team tallies their score to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;",

All players can move all pawns. The choice of pawn and direction is limited by two coloured dice. After rolling them, you have to move a pawn of one's colour along a line of the other's colour.&#10;    Sekundus Ludus. You roll dice to move along a path. Depending on the field you reach, you either gain or lose sticks. If you reach the finish with insufficient sticks, you have to do another round.&#10;    Tertius Ludus. An easy roll-and-move game, in which you have to get around the board with 3 of your 4 pawns. Similar to Pachisi, you may return other pawns to the start, too. The mechanic that makes the game special is the unlimited number of rolls you can make each turn. If you choose to roll another die, you can add the new score to your movement rate, but if you have bad luck, you lose everything and can't move this turn.&#10;     Quartus Ludus. A card game based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanic. A joker beats rock, paper, and scissors. Every time you lose to another card, your pawn is advanced. The one who reaches the end fist, loses the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Romantic Sensations is a card game that combines and reinforces our senses of touch, taste, scent, sound, and sight to create a wonderful romantic experience.&#10;&#10;To start, players read the list of prizes--romantic, sensuous activities to be enjoyed together. The cards are shuffled and dealt. Players then take turns picking a card from the deck, reading it aloud, and responding. Some cards ask for verbal responses, positive and supportive. Others suggest gentle touching, some playful, some subtle and ambiguous. When like cards are matched, they are placed down. The first player to match the required number of cards wins.&#10;&#10;Note: the game box includes two small bottles of lotion (&quot;sensuous massage lotion&quot; and &quot;bath gel&quot;) in addition to the question card deck.&#10;&#10;",

The remaining deck is placed aside.  Players pick up the cards and hold them in their hands or place them face-up on the table.  Using the alphabet letters on the cards, players create and writes down the word with the highest number of points.  Alphabet letters can be used more than once.  A player declares his/her words to the others, who then confirm each word and tally the points for that word.&#10; In the advanced game, players may choose to discard cards from their hands and re-fill with new cards from the deck.&#10; For example the word MUST:  M = worth 7 points, U = worth 11 points, S = worth 10 points and finally T = worth 11 points tally = 39 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Made in the USA is different than any other game you have ever played; it combines elements of card and board games and dominoes. Players create four lines of play using the four different patriotic suits. Players have the freedom to play as many cards as connect, or unit, to each other. For example, you may play a Seven, Eight and Nine of Stars, then play an Eight of Eagles. Play cards that connect to other players' cards. But when you change lines/suits then you will need to draw a &quot;Changes in the Wind&quot; card - so even when you think you have won, the round might not be finished.&#10;&#10;User review: Each player is dealt a hand of cards. The number of cards dealt to each player varies with the number of participants. In turn, a player can add to the cards in the array in the middle of the table. Cards of the same rank are placed in the same row. The cards must be ranked in ascending order from top to bottom. Cards of the same suit must be placed in the same row. Event cards may be played at the beginning or end of one&rsquo;s turn. The &quot;Changes in the Wind&quot; cards are a separate draw pile. These cards are drawn whenever a player begins a new row.&#10;The hand is over when one player&rsquo;s hand is depleted. The other players are penalized for cards remaining in their hands. The game is over when someone has been penalized 500 points. The player with the lowest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Cardiff Bay will replace Mayfair and the Menai Straits will take over from Park Lane.&#10;In welcoming the new Welsh-language version, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Minister for Heritage, said: 'We are extremely pleased that the Books Council have been able to support the Welsh-language Monopoly and its success will not only bring pleasure to many this Christmas, but will also enable families across Wales to play this popular board game through the medium of Welsh.'&#10;Winning Moves, who have produced a number of versions of the popular board game based on different regions of Britain, are pleased to add a distinctive Welsh-language version to the collection, with the players winning or losing their fortune as they travel the length and breadth of Wales.&#10;The company invited the Books Council to assist them in selecting appropriate names for the game board, and the Council sought the assistance of the leading language expert D. Geraint Lewis, who has published numerous dictionaries and grammar books.&#10;'We were delighted to be able to work with Winning Moves to produce the Welsh-language version of this popular board game,' said Gwerfyl Pierce Jones, Director of the Welsh Books Council.&#10;'The Welsh-language version of Scrabble proved to be a best-seller and we are sure that Monopoly yn Gymraeg (Monopoly in Welsh) will have similar success amongst Welsh speakers and Welsh learners of all ages. The whole process was a most pleasing challenge and D. Geraint Lewis's contribution as a consultant was a key factor in ensuring that the game reflected all the different regions of Wales.'&#10;A set of both English- and Welsh-language rules are included with each game, to assist Welsh learners.&#10;D. Geraint Lewis added: 'Nothing gives me more pleasure than seeing people playing board games through the medium of Welsh, and to know that these games are of the highest quality.'&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Peter the Great ordered a 'scorched earth' policy to deny supplies to the Swedish invaders.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In September of 1708 Tsar Peter learned that a Swedish force protecting their supply train was separated from Charles XII and the main Swedish army. He pounced. Peter lead a flying column to attack the Swedes while the main part of his army blocked Charles' path to Moscow. The battle took place near the village of Lesnaya.&quot;&#10;&#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&#10;&#10;While the fast play rules are relatively straightforward, they still manage to encompass a number of historical aspects that affected the battle. The rules cover unit formations, terrain, charges, morale, commanders, and differences in the battle tactics of the Russian Dragoons and Swedish cavalry.&#10;&#10;",

The start player draws a Seller card to see what they have to sell and the selling price for the item and then a Spectator card to see if they draw a person willing to buy whats for sale. If they get that combination of an item and a willing seller the player takes the amount of money shown on the Sellers card out of the 'bank'. Some cards show 'no sale' There are also two 'pretty girl' cards, one will buy and one will sell. There is also a 'constable card' which if drawn, the player drawing the card is immediately arrested and so losses his/her turn. When the seller cards are exhausted the game ends and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",
