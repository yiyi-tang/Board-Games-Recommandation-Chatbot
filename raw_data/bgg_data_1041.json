It works like this:&#10;&#10;All players have 8 cards. These 8 cards are the same 8 cards as everybody else has in their hands. Each turn the players select a card and once everyone has selected their card, the cards are revealed at the same time and compared. Depending on the number of people who played the card, the outcome changes. Based on the number of players with the same card, positive outcomes can become negative, the target of the card may change and even special actions must be performed.&#10;&#10;As the head of your expedition, your role is to figure out when others will play each card, bluff about when you're going to play your cards, and deduct when it's safest to play your cards based on what's been played already.&#10;&#10;It's a game of reason, strategy and sometimes just plain luck to figure out how to build the best reputation and win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What is Rabbit Trails? Rabbit Trails is card game for all ages (especially students!) involving play with word association.&#10;&#10;How do you play it? Play starts with each player being dealt 7 cards. Then the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over. Each player takes turns laying a card this is easily associated with the card showing. For example: The card flipped at the start of the game is, &quot;Rabbit&quot;. Player 1 plays, &quot;Carrot&quot; (because rabbits eat carrots). Player 2 plays, &quot;Chef&quot; (because chefs can cook carrots). Player 3 plays, &quot;Astronaut&quot; (because both chef and astronaut are professions). And player 4 plays, &quot;Grape&quot;. Wait! Grape?? Grape clearly doesn't match with &quot;Astronaut&quot;. The other players hear out Player 4's reasoning and vote on whether or not to allow the card to stay in play. They vote for the card to be removed. Player 4 has to draw a new card as a penalty and play continues. The winner is the first person to get rid of all their cards. If a player cannot play (and does not want to try and fool the others by playing a less than perfect card), the player can draw and, if the card will work, play it right away.&#10;&#10;But that's not all! There are also action cards featuring various ways to foil the plans of the other players and get you closer to winning the game.&#10;&#10;What are the benefits of Rabbit Trails? Benefit #1, Rabbit Trails is an awesome game. Seriously! I have been designing this game over the past couple of years and have been getting bogged down with requests to make this game available from friends, family, and even people who see us playing it while out around town. After refining the cards and getting the rules nailed down, this game is finally ready for prime time! But that isn't all... Benefit #2, is related to education. It's not often that fun and education go together, but Rabbit Trails bridges that gap. Because the aim of the game is to get players to find connections between words, it makes students use higher order thinking, like analysis and evaluation to be successful, which are at the top of Bloom's taxonomy.Benefit #3 [Bonus], Rabbit Trails is great to test your English language skills if you are currently learning English or use English as a second language. It makes English language learners think critically about words and their multiple meanings!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Early colonization efforts of Mars have been successful. With dozens of outposts scattered across the surface, a new challenge awaits: providing infrastructure to the red planet and moving goods to where they are needed most (while making a tidy profit of course). Fortunately the abundance of precious metals will help with this task by allowing upgrades to the transport vessels over time.&#10;&#10;Tracks on Mars is a light-weight family crayon rail game. It has been designed specifically for two players. Drawing the tracks, loading goods onto the pawns, and over sized dice all work together to make this a very tactile experience. Luck is a major factor but can be mitigated by re-rolls and catch-up mechanics. On a strategic level, players have to balance network building, transportation, and equipment upgrades.&#10;&#10;The core mechanics are Yahtzee-style dice rolling and resource allocation. Matching dice rolls are converted to currency which is then used to either claim new routes or move the player's pawns to pick up and deliver goods. Victory points are ultimately  scored depending on the distance that goods have been transported. Players have to decide whether they want to make multiple short runs for few VPs or spend turns building a long route for fewer high value transports.&#10;&#10;This is a print &amp; play title comprised of five dice, 40 resource cubes, currency token cards, an 18&quot; x 18&quot; board, and four 3D printed pawns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Instead, they were only available in special 20th Anniversary-related items of merchandise, which included Mythical Pok&eacute;mon Collections and Red &amp; Blue Collections. Each Mythical Pok&eacute;mon Collection comes packaged with 2 Generations packs, in addition to a special Full Art promotional card and collector's pin featuring 1 of the 11 Mythical Pok&eacute;mon available as part of the 20th Anniversary distributions during 2016.&#10;&#10;The Japanese Starter Pack emulates the original both in terms of design and the random nature of the cards included. While the cards contained in each deck can vary, they are grouped based on evolutionary family and type. The deck can be broken down into two sections, which are packaged separately. The first section will always contain one of two Mega Pok&eacute;mon, either M Venusaur-EX or M Charizard-EX, in addition to a fixed selection of Pok&eacute;mon and Energy cards relative to its type, plus multiples of Trainer cards for a total of 27 cards. The second section contains 3 different groups of Pok&eacute;mon containing an evolutionary family of 1 type, plus 1 other Pok&eacute;mon of the same type, matching Energy cards, and a selection of single Trainer cards for a total of 33 cards. None of the cards available as part of the pack have rarity symbols. A special Blastoise version of the Starter Pack (Japanese: &#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175; &#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;ver.) was later made available, initially exclusive to venues hosting the Kamex Mega Battle in Japan during May 2016, followed by a more general release from the Pok&eacute;mon Center Online store in June 2016. This version substitutes the Grass or Fire-type cards available in the first section of the regular version with Water-type cards. These cards appear in the core Generations set, but are classed as secret cards in the Starter Pack. The Starter Pack also comes with an exclusive Chansey coin.&#10;&#10;-- user summary obtained from: https://leonhartopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Generations_(TCG)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When a tree is old enough, it starts to make flowers. The flower is a message from the tree to you, the pollinators. Calling you to come by day and by night &ndash; to drink its nectar, to pick up its pollen grains, and to transport these to another tree of the same species. Because it&rsquo;s ready to breed.&#10;&#10;Flight of Pollen is a semi-cooperative game where you pollinate as many trees as possible by visiting them with a variety of different New Zealand pollinators, with different pollinators being more successful under different weather conditions.  Rounds are split into day and night segments, with different pollinators active during the day versus the night.  Each pollinator must move from one plant to the next of the same species, moving pollen between them until all of the plants of the target species are pollinated- if any are missed, the game is lost.  One or more different native New Zealand plant are the focus for each of the four rounds, and as the rounds progress more pollinator species are added, as well as more plant species with more challenging pollination requirements.  If all of the required plants have been pollinated, then the team that collected the most berries wins the game.&#10;&#10;Over each of the four levels different trees send out differing messages in their flowers. You&rsquo;ll need to work together to complete each level, moving as the elements allow.&#10;&#10;As flowers pollinated by you (or the wind) become seeds or berries, teams can collect the resulting berries.&#10;&#10;Locally made, with recycled materials and FSC card&#10;&#10;",

But watch out for Snarf--Simon's half dog, half ogre sidekick--or he'll slow down your quest to defeat Simon!&#10;&#10;To get around, players roll a die. Pimple Spell spaces and Snarf spaces can limit players' movement but can be gotten around with Obsidian tokens and Obsidian Spell Phone tokens, which can reroll dice or use the spell phone instead of rolling. Other spaces can call every player to a specific space. The Spell Phone included with the game decides what happens when it's landed on or rolled via a text message that appears on the screen.&#10;&#10;The objective is to be the first player to collect all 5 Gem tokens and defeat Simon in the final showdown.&#10;&#10;Based on the Trollz toyline and cartoon by DiC Entertainment.&#10;&#10;",

Proudly made in the USA, components include a game board, coloured wooden chips, dice, scoring pad, and instructions.  Designed by Jackson Robinson, and published by Kings Wild Project.&#10;&#10;To set-up: Players all get 25 chips in their colour plus a single gold coin, and dice are rolled for a random set-up that adds five chips per player to a 6x6 game-board.&#10;&#10;To play: In clockwise order players take turns to: (a) move a chip or a chip stack of their colour in a straight direction on the board; (b) place a new chip with the location determined by a dice roll. The game ends when someone has played all their chips and cleared all chip stacks under their control.&#10;&#10;To win: The aim of the game is to score the highest number of points.  Points are scored by clearing a stack (when a stack under your control reaches 5 or more chips, with gold chips being worth 5 instead of 1 point each).  Your final score is the total number of &quot;cleared&quot; chips minus any of your unplayed and uncleared chips at game end.&#10;&#10;",

Then place the tie breaker die(clear with a small blue die inside it) in the tiebreaker area(5 circles) To start out each player rolls 2 of their dice and places them in the first row. Then the player can choose to either keep his/her row and try his/her luck or they can lower a die&rsquo;s number by one and roll another die. The objective is to have a higher sum for each row than your opponent. The max capacity for each row is five die. At the end of the turn both players add up the die and the larger number is subtracted from the lower number. Next the Difference is taken away from the losing army. If a tie is to occur then the clear die with a blue die in it is rolled by each player and the sum of the two die is added to each player&rsquo;s side based on the roll. Keep doing this until there is no tie. If you have a one in your row at the end of a turn change the one to a six before you add up. If you end up calculating before changing the one to a six the one stays a one for the remainder of the game. If you lose then you can roll the 20 sided die and re roll the captain. Place the same number of added die to your side of the military and try to beat your opponent.&#10;&#10;Things to remember: &#10;&#10;     If you roll a one with your general, it stays a one&#10;     Lower each die one at a time&#10;     The game stops after you completely lose all of your die and roll the failure die&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

One deck represents a happy baby, another a sad baby, and the middle a neutral baby. A baby status token moves between the decks, indicating the current climate of the infant and also defining from which deck the next card should be drawn. Cards are only seen by the player playing the role of the child, and upon them are depicted up to two different needs of the five in the game: hungry, poopie, sleepy, restless and crying wolf (ie. nothing's really wrong). Depending on the card the player will then place face-down tokens showing the baby is upset but not visibly indicating what the cause is. These needs can be resolved with different parent tokens, such as feeding, diapers, carrying, music and playing. While the need tokens don't come in multiples and therefore can't &quot;double up&quot; on the same time the parents only have a limited number of each of their tokens so they must use them wisely. After each step of the game (child expressing and then parents attempting to solve it) the baby status is always move to indicate the new state of the child. If a card should be drawn from an empty deck, the game has ended and the players all win if the status of the baby is happy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The 18th century in Europe saw a massive development in weapons and tactics. The musket was refined into a flintlock, smoothbore with a socket bayonet. Although accuracy was low, which limited effective fire to very short ranges, volume of fire improved considerably and units were capable of firing three and sometimes four rounds a minute. The infantryman was now capable of combining the roles of musketeer and pikeman in one. And to maximise firepower, formations became wider. The aim was to move a formation to within range of the enemy and then overwhelm them with firepower. Only rarely was a bayonet charge needed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;Units of 3 bases represent an infantry battalion or cavalry squadron. Suggested basing sizes are given for 6, 15, and 25/28mm figures.&#10;&#10;Players take turns activating one brigade at a time. Each brigade commander is rated as Poor, Average, or Excellent, which allows the commander to activate 1-3 groups of brigade units. After all brigades have activated, combat occurs.&#10;&#10;The game includes army lists for various 18th century wars: Great Norther War, American Indian Wars, War of Spanish Succession, Wars Against the Turks, Jacobite Risings, Seven Years War, American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary Wars.&#10;&#10;",

The players need to have skill, attention and a bit of luck in order to gather on the board the three parts that are needed to complete each profession drawing. Besides the different drawings, the background color for each profession is also different in order to help the younger players to identify each of the parts for each of the professions so they can easily put together the complete set.&#10;The winner will be the one who can complete the most profession drawings.&#10;&#10;",

The players assume control of one of four great clans - Uesugi, Mori, Tokugawa, or Shimazu - and attempt to defeat their opponent to become the Shogun.&#10;&#10;Shoudo is a terrain-based strategy game. The board, which consists of 40 cards, is shuffled and laid out in a random 5x8 configuration at the start of each game. Each player controls 3 armies which they may use to &quot;burn&quot; enemy lands and attack enemy armies and castles. The first player to destroy their opponent's Daimyo castle wins the game.&#10;&#10;To win, players must engage in combat. When attacking an enemy army or castle, combat is fought over 3 rounds. Each round, both players roll a 6-sided combat die and add the strength of their unit and its terrain bonus - the higher roll wins the round, and the first player to win 2 rounds wins the combat.&#10;&#10;Special clan abilities, inspired by the traditional clans, affect gameplay, giving each clan a unique advantage. These abilities can give tactical advantage or greater sustainability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There are reports from the countryside of strange soldiers with glowing eyes, but they seem distant and harmless.&#10;&#10;Scythe: The Rise of Fenris, the conclusion to the Scythe expansion trilogy, enables two different options for any player count (1-5 if you have Scythe; 1-7 players if you have Invaders from Afar):&#10;&#10;&#10;     Campaign (8 games): The story of Scythe continues and concludes with an eight-episode campaign. While the campaign includes surprises, unlocks, and persistent elements, it is fully resettable and replayable.&#10;     Modular (11 modules): Instead of&mdash;or after&mdash;the campaign, the new modules in The Rise of Fenris can be used in various combinations to cater to player preferences. These modules are compatible with all Scythe expansions, and they include a fully cooperative module.&#10;&#10;&#10;While the exact nature of the episodes and modules will remain a mystery (most of these components are in 5 secret tuckboxes and on 6 punchboards), the components in this expansion include a detailed episodic guidebook, 13 plastic miniatures, 62 wooden tokens, 2 custom dice, 25 tiles, and 100+ cardboard tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
