Juega con cuidado y usa los ingredientes a tu favor: podr&aacute;s a&ntilde;adir ingredientes que  aumentar&aacute;n el valor de tus porciones de pizza, pero otros ingredientes lo reducir&aacute;n... y si la situaci&oacute;n se pone dif&iacute;cil y necesitas ayuda adicional, siempre puedes contar con los trucos especiales de los Sabuesos del Caos y las misteriosas artima&ntilde;as de los (casi) todopoderosos Mapaches M&iacute;sticos.&#10;&#10;&iexcl;Caninos! es un juego familiar moderadamente estrat&eacute;gico en el que deber&aacute;s evaluar tus posibilidades, tomar decisiones y gestionar tus cartas con sabidur&iacute;a para convertirte en el mejor ladr&oacute;n de pizza de todos los tiempos.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&iexcl;Caninos! is a pizza card game where you will compete to steal more pizza than anybody else. Be the first to score 50 points worth of pizza slices and you'll win the game. But how?  You may ask. Don't worry, we got you covered; you'll count on the amazing skills of super powerful dogs that are more than eager to steal pizza for you, and they're the best at it too! Not only can they get you pizza, but they can also do amazing tricks that will make things harder for your opponents and put you ahead of the game.&#10;&#10;Be mindful though, other players will try to stop you with tricks and reaction cards meant to scare your dogs away. Tread lightly and use toppings to your advantage: upgrade toppings will increase the value of pizza slices while downgrade toppings will lower it... and if push comes to shove and you need some extra help you can always count on the special tricks of the Hounds of Chaos, and the mysterious ways of the (almost) almighty Mystic Raccoons.&#10;&#10;&iexcl;Caninos! is a mildly strategic family game where you'll need to evaluate your possibilities, make some decisions, and manage your cards wisely to become the greatest pizza thief ever.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There must be millions stored in each. Your job is to find those vaults, stuff as much money down your pockets, and get out before you get busted. The police are stationed all around the bank. So you have to be careful. For the entire year, we can make this bank our primary target. So what do you say, are you in?&#10;&#10;Welcome to The Big Job. The card game that tests your luck and greed to become rich. Are you lucky enough to hit the jackpot and avoid detection? Drawing the million dollar card and leaving with what you've got sounds like a lucky way to get rich. Or do you hunger the greed and adrenaline rush of taking hostages and pulling off some big time cash while dodging the police? Clearing out all the vaults and ransoming up a hostage for millions of dollars sounds right up your alley. Just try not to get busted in the process. It's going to cost ya! Grab your crew and lets head out for the big job!&#10;&#10;If you're looking for a snatch and grab game to play with family and friends that requires no strategy, just sheer luck and greed, The Big Job is the perfect game for you. The Big Job is very easy to learn and play with others. Setup 4 decks and then just take turns pulling cards. Sounds very simple right? If only pulling money from a deck of cards was real. While the chances of getting caught are slim your greed will be your demise.&#10;&#10;As The Big Job may seem like a very simple game with no strategy what so ever, it will keep you immersed with greed and other players&rsquo; demises. Trust us the only player that can hurt you is you. So make sure you choose wisely, whether it&rsquo;s to keep drawing money or to just call it quits.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It's a game in puzzle form in which the tiles must be used to assemble a square by laying out square tiles in a way that adjacent tile edges show the same symbol. The pieces are &quot;reversible&quot; and each figure is &quot;coded&quot; so that one knows what there is on the other side of the card without having to turn it. There are multiple solutions. There are two difficulty levels: the Simple Gogo and the Supreme Gogo (more difficult).&#10;&#10;Gogo Challenge can be played alone or against opponents with a timer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Continent Race by Byron&rsquo;s Games is a world geography board game that features the national flags of countries throughout the world. The game is for 2+ players, ages 7 and up. It&rsquo;s a race, and the first player to collect the required number of country cards from each continent wins the game. Supporting materials include Maps, Mystery Continent cards, Antarctica wild cards with special privileges, and there is an option to do a one-on-one challenge between 2 players to enhance the learning. The game is color-coded for easier access for children and allows for younger players to take part too. Continent Race is a collaborative way to learn world geography and promotes problem solving skills, goal achievement, and focused play. Continent Race is the recipient of 4 game awards.&#10;&#10;For the basic level of play, the game is complete once a player collects the necessary number of country cards for three continents. Two cards must be collected from Australia/Oceania and four cards each from Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. For the advanced level of the game is complete once a player collects the required number of cards for five continents. At this level, Orange Mystery cards can be shu&#239;&#172;&#132;ed into the deck to increase the level of di&#239;&#172;&#131;culty. Players must first determine which continent a Mystery card belongs to (using maps and other players as resources), then use the card as you would any other country card to complete a continent group. Also at the advanced level, Challenge play is an option, where one player invites another player to face o&#239;&#172;&#128; with cards that feature the Challenge symbol. Each challenger gets to review the Continent List or Map and then, from memory, each player must name as many countries as s/he can recall from that continent by taking turns saying the names of countries aloud, until one player gets stumped. The winner of the challenge gets to draw additional cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay starts with the dealer dealing 7 cards, face down, to each player. On each turn, a player draws one card and discards one card face up. Each time a player discards, s/he must announce the country name and continent of the discarded card. On each turn, a player selects one card from the draw pile and decides if they want to keep it or discard it. If a player picks a country card that matches one of his/her continents and the country card completes one of the continent groups, then the player has successfully completed a continent group and must place the continent group on the table, face up, and announce the names of the countries in the continent group. (You can review phonetic pronunciations on our site.) Next, the player must replace, from the draw pile, the number of cards s/he laid down in order to bring the player&rsquo;s hand back to 7 cards. Then, it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;The &#239;&#172;&#129;rst person to collect the required number of country cards for each continent group is mere steps from winning the game! To fully complete the game, the winner MUST call out and locate on the maps the countries they&rsquo;ve drawn throughout the game. Others may continue playing for 2nd, 3rd, 4th place&hellip; for an enhanced learning experience.&#10;&#10;Continent Race was created by young Byron, just 6 years old at the time, during a month-long stay at a children&rsquo;s hospital. Not only was Byron receiving treatment for an unexpected illness, he was receiving something else entirely: The inspiration to help kids like him learn and have fun through their hospital stay and beyond. Byron&rsquo;s dream came to life in December 2018&mdash;with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, we sent Continent Race to over 130 children&rsquo;s hospitals nationwide. NBC covered the story on Byron and his game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It also covers the early wars of Louis XIV of France up to the end of the 1600s.&#10;&#10;The historical period covered by Close Fire XVII is one of transition from medieval to early-modern warfare marked by the increasing ascendancy of infantry and the transition from pike to shot.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the rule mechanisms is the concept of Disorder Points (DPs). These were invented by Andy Callan for his American War of Independence rules and have proven to be an enduring and elegant way of reflecting the variable state of morale and combat effectiveness.

    "Description": "Malbrook s'en va-t-en Guerre are wargames rules designed to re-fight big battles of the War of Spanish Succession with 15mm or smaller scale miniatures. They are derived from my original Close Fire &amp; European Order rules which cover the same time period but were designed for smaller engagements with a larger ground scale.&#10;&#10;This big-battle variant of Close Fire &amp; European Order allows players to fight out a full scale battle of&#10;the War of Spanish Succession with a realistic ground scale and without getting bogged down in the minutiae of small brigade actions.&#10;As it is the case with Close Fire &amp; European Order, many of the rule mechanisms have been developed from Andy Callan&rsquo;s American War of Independence rules- Loose Files and American Scramble, which were originally published in Wargames Illustrated no. 1.&#10;&#10;In Malbrook, the basic game unit represents a brigade of 3-12 battalions of foot or 6-36 squadrons of horse. These brigades will need to be deployed into commands of several lines, as they were historically, in order to give support if the first line gets into trouble. The simple yet subtle command and control rules encourage players to keep their brigades together in historically realistic formations.&#10;Brigades in range of their leader will usually act as the player wishes, however, if a command becomes broken up then the player will loose control and brigades may start doing things other than what he might wish.&#10;In this period, effective musketry took place at 50-100 yards, In order to re-fight big battles, this distance is reduced to 1-2 inches on the games table. Therefore, musketry is incorporated into close combat.&#10;At the heart of the rule mechanisms is the concept of Disorder Points (DPs). These were invented by Andy Callan for his American War of Independence rules and have proven to be an enduring and elegant way of reflecting the variable state of morale and combat effectiveness. A brigade will incur DPs for manoeuvre, receiving artillery fire, close combat and morale, and they will lose them by halting to redress ranks or through the intervention of a leader. The system is easy to use, does not require any paper work and dispenses with the need for lots of morale checks.&#10;&#10;Designed with 15mm in mind, rules can be adapted for other scales.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rules introduction&#10;&#10;",

Clues, in the form of attributes, are revealed and players use them, or lack thereof, to guess who has what item.&#10;&#10;The box of lasercut components includes: &#10;&#10;     450 &ldquo;items&rdquo; on 45 cards&#10;     105 attributes on 35 cards (describe items)&#10;     60 indicator tokens in six colours&#10;     3 special revelation cards &#10;     12 &ldquo;Take a Guess&rdquo; cards&#10;     2 gameboards&#10;     20 deduction forms (more on our website).&#10;&#10;&#10;After a brief setup, the game play folllows:  &#10;&#10;     A player pulls an Attribute card and places it into the Attributes grid in an unused slot &ndash; one without indicator tokens&#10;     Each player whose mystery item matches one of the attributes on the card must place their coloured token on the card without revealing the actual attribute&#10;     Players will record any deductions on their forms.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players can make guesses of other players&rsquo; items at any time, although you shouldn&rsquo;t do so until enough attributes have been exposed &ndash; no need to waste your limited &ldquo;Take a Guess&rdquo; cards.&#10;&#10;Attributes describe item qualities and categories. All items will have at least three attributes. Some items will have ambiguous attributes out of context. For example, CHEDDAR is both a CHEESE and a CITY while MERCURY is a GOD, a LIQUID, a PLANET, ROUND, METALLIC, SILVER-coloured and in the SOLAR SYSTEM.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Details of other conflicts during the period will be available later.&#10;&#10;The rules are for large battles of this period. &#10;The players will usually command a Corps or other large part of a full army, if not the whole army.&#10;&#10;One base usually represents 600 infantry, 300 cavalry or 12 guns. &#10;A unit is usually 3 to 12 bases and represents a brigade.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In fast-action fashion, the other players must lay a card from their hand that does NOT match the face of any of the dice. The last player to do so must take his card back into his hand. And if the Scout spots any cards that DO match the dice he gets to claim that card as a trophy and the player who laid it must take a penalty card. The first player to play of their cards will end the game and then players will tally their scores. Trophy cards are worth 1 point, and any cards left in their hand are worth negative points.

Or perhaps you'd rather be the chief of a band of Assassins, a charismatic preacher of pilgrims, the boss of a marauder band, a Muslim emir, an African mercenary captain, the Lady of a castle defending her people, a Mongol commander, or a Byzantine or Armenian officer! This expansion brings them all to life.&#10;&#10;The Crusader States were the product of the First Crusade, and became a unique meeting point for people and military forces from all over Europe and the Middle East, but also as far afield as Asia and East Asia. Since these groups not only fought against, but also often with each other, it is possible to create assorted warbands or multiplayer games.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes historical information, new upgrades (from Greek fire to holy and magical characters and items), and twelve factions with unique features and special abilities from all groups that fought in and around the Crusader States. It also comprises scenarios that re-enact stories from medieval sources by Western, Byzantine, Armenian and Muslim authors. They have been selected in order to represent highlights in the story of the Crusader States and their neighbours, from the siege of Antioch in 1097-98 to the fall of Acre and the final execution of the Holy Land in 1291.&#10;&#10;-Description from cover&#10;&#10;",

When the king can no longer reign, the queen becomes regent.  Mariana Vit&oacute;ria did not like the Marquis de Pombal because of the way he had handled the Tavora affair, in which a noble and powerful family, friends of the queen, were accused of attempted regicide and then executed in public by the marquis, without a fair trial, solely to gain political power. In 1777, immediately after the king's death, she dismissed the Marquis by royal decree, and exiled him to his hometown, Pombal.&#10;&#10;",

Model aircraft of any scale from 1/600th to 1/72nd, can be used. If necessary you could also use card counters. Minimal bookkeeping is required because Markers or Tokens are used to indicate the status of aircraft during the game. Furthermore you do not need to use a hex mat.&#10;&#10;The capabilities of aircraft within the game have been calculated, taking a common aircraft type of average performance as the base line, in this case the Hawker Hurricane. All other aircraft capabilities relate to how they compare with this aircraft. It is possible that the performance of this or that aircraft might not match your expectations based on anecdotal evidence. We make no apology for this as we are not trying to create a simulation. The resulting data has been kept to a simple format, which enables a Player to control several aircraft during a game, and the overall gaming experience will be improved if multiple Players attempt to &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo; on each side.&#10;&#10;The abilities of pilots and crew are represented by having Skill Factors. These determine how well they fly their aircraft, their chances of hitting the target when shooting, and avoiding serious damage if their own aircraft is hit. Pilot skill is vitally important in air combat, and Players will need to learn where to position their best pilots, as well as to protect their novice aviators . In the case of aircraft with several crew members, Skill is determined for the crew as a whole. You do not need to keep track of individual crew.&#10;&#10;To carry out any action other than level flight requires the expenditure of one or more Orders, which may also require a successful Skill Test. Orders are generated each turn and better leaders generally mean more Orders. Scenario rules are provided covering simple dogfights during an Encounter, for attacking surface targets, and to represent missions where the aim is to get a force of bombers across the table.&#10;&#10;Altitude represented during the game assumes that the main combat is taking place in roughly the same area of the sky, and it is possible to climb or dive to gain an advantage, or try to escape.&#10;&#10;Players alternate the activation of their aircraft. Optional Tactical Cards can be used during the game to provide additional detail.&#10;&#10;Game Data is provided for most aircraft that saw action during the Second World War. We have not included experimental aircraft or those produced in small numbers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Yes, the dead have come to life and they walk the land. The fleeing residents are exhausted from running for their lives day and night with very littel rest. Some sought sanctuary with the wild elves of the forests and were shot down with whistling arrows from unseen archers for their troubles.&#10;&#10;The Elves have so far maintained a vigilant watch and slaughter any undead that enter their forests from lofty vantage points high in the tree-top canopy. Some refugees fled down the river in boats, rafts and some just floated along on doors, luggage, dead animals anything that floated. The once flourishing human town of Riverhead has become a harbor of corpses and all who fled there were consumed by the dead.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once Lord Goldenmane, of the Dawning Sun warpride, was informed of a large dwarven force marching upon his vulnerable rear he ordered a general withdrawl from KinGrave Hold, vowing to return and finish what he started. During the height of the Battle for KinGrave Hold, King Snori Halfhelm sent his fastest messengers to the other dwarven holds to warn them of an impending attack and to send reinforcements if they could spare any. King Thargold Hardgrin, of StoneGate Hold, sent a hundred of his best warriors via the Underway that runs between mountains.&#10;&#10;King Thargold would not be sitting out the battles with the treacherous Leonids. One of the emissaries that the commander of Bloodsea Castle had executed had been a distant relation to the King and a dwarf would see blood spilled as payment for such an affront to his families honor. King Thargold immediately ordered that the clans assemble on the field of war outside the massive stone gate of the hold. Five thousand warriors answered his call to war and the dwarves marched upon Bloodsea Castle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They manage to make landfall on a strange island and immediately came into conflict with strange monsters who inhabited the forests of the island chain. The small green creatures were vicious and cruel but could not stand up to the hedgehog of spears presented by the Greek phalanx. Eventually the Greeks dug out a fort and raided nearby islands and the mainland for women and provisions. They have not only survived but thrived in this strange land.&#10;&#10;A Greek army is centered around the heavily armored hoplite and supported by archers, slingers, javelin wielding peltasts and cavalry. They also bring with them priests of the Olympian Gods who have found that they can wield divine powers in the cause of their gods. The Greek army is slow and dependent on the phalanx to hold formation long enough to drive the foe from the field so the cavalry and skirmishers can run them down and slaughter them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When the Celts where transported to the Known World they quickly adapted and thrived int he deep forests and plains. They are a hardy and industrious folk. Oddly enought hey found themselves cloe to thier ancient enemies the Romans though the two cultures have found a way to work together there are occasional flare-ups of animosity.&#10;&#10;A Celtic Warband favors fast moving bands of warriors and cavalry supported by chariots and druids. They can make chainmail and the wealthy nobles and more adept swordsmen use it regularly. Celts are a an undisciplined lot and will try to make a name for himslef in battle which is counter to small unit tactics where each man works together.&#10;&#10;Get Some! Fantasy Warfare is about getting your models out and playing an enjoyable wargame for a couple of hours with your buddies. It is NOT about WAAC (Winning at all Costs) but about designing an army that fits your collection and play style as well as the background for the Universe you are playing in. Tactics and Command should play the pivotal roles in the battel as well as a little bit of Luck and NOT pimped out units. Armies should be a mix of Melee, Ranged and Magical/Monsterous units. Each should check some of the power of the others in the rock, paper, scissors kind of way, which is similar to actual warfare.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Crusaders initially invaded Outre Mare in order to cleanse the countryside of foul monsters that had overrun the area and killed the local villagers in droves. Some nobles within the Confederate Kingdoms answered the call by the Church of the Old One to rid the land of these monsters. They formed into crusading bands which eventually conglomerated into small fiefdoms once the area had been cleansed of the foul beasts that had inhabited it.&#10;&#10;The Crusaders nobles prefer to fight from horseback clad in heavy armor and use sword and lance. They are supported by blocks of heavily armored men at arms wielding spear and tower shields. Archers armed with various bow and crossbows provided ranged fire support for the knights and Men at Arms. Peasant levies and mounted Hobilars are also not uncommon. The crusaders rely on the venerable catapult and trebuchet for their heavy support in a siege. The Crusaders are also joined by priests of the Old One who provide spiritual guidance and support.&#10;&#10;Get Some!

    "Description": "On the edge of the Leonid Empire, btween the Sand Kings and open savannah, lies the realm of the Dunelords. They are close cousins of the more civilized Leonid clans but prefer the open sky to cramped urban living. They do not build machines of steam and magic and instead work together with many natural species to form a more harmonious existance. They are a nomadic people by nature and do not dwell in one place very long. Instead they chose to follow the herds in their timeless wanderings from watering hole to grassland and back. While the Dunlords are not very cosmopolitan they are not stupid and instead of machines they rely on the large and sometimes vicious beasts that roam the trackless wastes and tall grass of the plains. The Dunelords and their Beast Lords have a natural affinity for animals and the large hunting cats in particular.&#10;&#10;The Dunelords often go their own way even if they are nominally auxiliaries to the Imperial purple. They guard the western approaches to the Empire and fight a near constant battle with the undead Sand Kings of Necrokahara. The Dunelords are constantly fighting among themselves as well as external enemies even though they have no imperial ambitions or delusions of conquest. They are a fractitious, stubborn and warlike people. They are also loyal, honorable and courageous to the core.&#10;&#10;Get Some!
