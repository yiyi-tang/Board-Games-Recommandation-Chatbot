    "Description": "Can you spell faster than your opponents by grabbing the correct vowel piece? Can you lay down correct vowel cards or spot matching vowels faster than your opponents? Or maybe the only way to win is by yelling&hellip;AIEOU! (pronounced as AY-YO)&#10;&#10;AIEOU is an educational spelling game that incorporates multisensory elements. Playable in 4 different ways, AIEOU offers 4 different games catered to children from as young as 7 years of age to adults. Each game stimulates different faculties such as hand &amp; eye coordination, mental &amp; physical reflexes, analytics and memory. The 4 games are as listed below:&#10;&#10;i) Grab It!&#10;It&rsquo;s helter-skelter in Grab It!  Players rush to be the first to grab a specific missing vowel in the word of a played card. But beware! If that missing vowel matches the top vowel card on the deck, yell AIEOU (pronounced as AY-YO) instead! Player with the most cards wins. Grab It! sharpens a player&rsquo;s eye, hand and mental coordination as it combines picture-word recognition and spelling with logic deduction and motor reflexes.&#10;&#10;ii) Speed Spells&#10;Picture playing musical chairs&hellip;but through spelling! In Speed Spells, players race to lay down correct vowel cards to spell out the word of a played card before grabbing any vowel piece for themselves. However, the last player to do this is left without a vowel piece to grab and is penalised with the card instead. Player with the least cards wins. Speed Spells combines picture-word recognition and spelling with fast physical reflexes in an exciting and fun manner.&#10;&#10;iii) Match&rsquo;em!&#10;What do you get when you combine the classic game of Snap with spelling? Out comes Match&rsquo;em! In this game, players try to identify matching vowels in played out cards. When a match occurs, players rush to grab a centre vowel piece. The player who manages this wins the pile of cards that have the matching sets of cards on top of them. Player with the most cards wins. Match&rsquo;em! stimulates players to quickly observe and analyse played out words.&#10;&#10;iv) Memory Buzz&#10;Can your mind stop buzzing around and focus on memorising? In Memory Buzz, players attempt to memorise not only the objects of the played cards, but also the number and sequence of each object. A player can be challenged by shouting out AIEOU if he or she is caught recalling objects wrongly. Player with the least cards wins. This game trains players to focus and memorise in a fun-filled way!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

We are getting some exceptional data from every run you programs complete.&#10;&#10;I see you are already starting to look through your code, that&rsquo;s great. I like the initiative. There are two ways to win:&#10;&#10;Manipulate the loop to be the first to break through the encryption and override the system. &#10;Or, figure out a way to disable the other programs. Either way is fine, it&rsquo;s all just ones and zeros to us. &#10;And it&rsquo;s go time! Get in there and make us proud. Oh, and uh, pick a new filename too!&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;&#10;In Quantum Loop, players are programs competing with each other to win the simulation. To do that, they&rsquo;ll need to race around the loop manipulating and activating modules in order to override the system or disable their opponents. Modules can trigger other modules, resulting in a chain of events that can turn the tide of battle in a nanosecond!&#10;&#10;Win the game by disabling your opponent&rsquo;s program or by overriding the system.&#10;&#10;Starting with the first player and proceeding in clockwise order (alternating between teams), players take turns performing actions. On your turn, you can do the following in any order.&#10;&#10;Move [required]&#10;Move your character 1-2 spaces in the direction shown on your character card. You may not end your movement on top of another character and you may not skip over a space that an opponent is on. You must move every turn unless you are blocked from moving to a free space. If you are blocked, your character takes damage instead, and you skip the Move action this turn.&#10;&#10;Swap [optional]&#10;Use the swap ability listed on your character card. This allows you to swap a specific set of cards.&#10;&#10;Flip [optional]&#10;Flip the card in front of you, which triggers any ability that is listed.&#10;&#10;KEY CONCEPT: Anytime you flip a card, you trigger that card&rsquo;s ability. If that ability flips another card, then that triggers that card&rsquo;s ability, and so on.&#10;&#10;Attack [conditional + required]&#10;If all core modules are active at any point during your turn, you trigger an attack. The next opponent in front of you immediately takes 1 damage. Then, deactivate all core module cards&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "STORY:&#10;Titania, Queen of the Fae, has grown tired of humanity&rsquo;s disdain for nature&rsquo;s splendor. She plans to liberate Gaia, and has summoned you, her High Council of Sorcerers to manifest her will.&#10;&#10;Work together to consult the heavens and read runes. Mobilize Titania&rsquo;s loyal Fae and port them to Gaia, where they will recover her crown from the six hallowed citadels. Will you divine the path to victory? Gather your golems! Summon your sirens! The Earth trembles before... Titania Ascending.&#10;&#10;GAME OVERVIEW:&#10;Titania Ascending is a cooperative &ldquo;flip and write&rdquo; (and write) game for two to six players in which you and your friends become Titania&rsquo;s trusted High Council, coordinating the liberation of Gaia. In phase 1, you will populate your map with the units you want to send to Gaia; in phase 2, you will use your completed map to support the invasion.&#10;&#10;FILL IN YOUR MAP:&#10;In phase 1, Divination, you arrange Fae and Dragons, recruit aides (special assistants), and select the hallowed units who will seize the 6 hallowed citadels and secure the Shards of Gaia for Titania&rsquo;s crown. Take turns choosing which unit everyone will draw on their maps (map/player board), coordinating with other players to divine hallowed units, and recruit aides to earn rule-bending abilities. The phase succeeds when all six hallowed units have been divined. You fail if everyone passes before you complete this goal.&#10;&#10;USE YOUR MAP:&#10;In phase 2, Ascension, you open portals to Gaia (Earth) and send Titania&rsquo;s units into the field, using your hallowed units to seize the hallowed citadels. Take turns selecting missions to launch and shading in areas on your map that meet the mission requirements; meanwhile, the other players fill in similar areas on their maps. After you launch each mission, you can also send your hallowed units to capture the hallowed citadels. If you capture all six citadels, you restore Titania&rsquo;s crown, she ascends the throne of Gaia, and you win.&#10;&#10;WINNING AND LOSING: &#10;You win together by divining six hallowed units during the Divination phase, then by capturing the six hallowed citadels in the Ascension, thus taking control of Gaia and saving the humans from themselves.&#10;&#10;The whole team loses together in two ways:&#10;In phase one, Divination, you lose if all players pass before the six hallowed units have been divined.&#10;In phase two, Ascension, you lose if all players pass before claiming all six Shards of Gaia.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

In Heroic Echoic, you collect echoic cards and use them to bid for superhero cards. The aim of the game is to be the first to win 5 heroes, but each hero you win before that gives you a power to help you win more, so it's worth taking risks to win heroes early.&#10;&#10;You're thinking 'Do I have more echoics for The Chemist than she does? I've seen her pick up a few. Hmmm but look how shifty she is. Maybe I can bluff and make her think I've got more than she does and she might as well not bother!' Then when the bidding begins, you'll be shouting things like 'BIFF!' and 'BLEUGH!' and 'SPLAT' and 'AH HA!' across the table and wondering how it came to this.&#10;&#10;There are 88 echoic cards and 27 hero cards. With thousands of different combinations of powers that you can try out or take on, each game plays quite differently, ensuring maximum replayability.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Medium-weight, set collection, action allowance plus secret action programming game, where you play as a genetic engineer with the goal of completing genetic sequences to fix troublesome mutations in the human genome, first extracting chains of 3 cubes from a shared sequence, and then, creating different chains to complete public objectives.&#10;&#10;All players build onto the same shared chain; therefore, they&rsquo;re constantly getting in each other&rsquo;s way, requiring a secret action programming mechanic that lets them modify or rearrange the sequence to their benefit.&#10;&#10;Public objectives vary in points according to their difficulty, and players can also combine private objectives onto longer sequences to get more points.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each turn, you have a set number of actions, initially 4. The ones in your color are called edit tokens, while the generic white ones are called extra action tokens.&#10;It all starts in the manufacturer, where you can use 1 action to place 1 cube of any color. You&rsquo;re looking to create the sequences that you have on your CRISPR cards, so that when the cubes get transferred to the shared sequence, you can extract them.&#10;Since the cubes are added to the same queue by all the players, you can use 1 action to play an Edit card, marking it with the edit token. This will allow you to change what&rsquo;s being built.&#10;When all the spaces are full, the first half gets transferred to the shared sequence, but the edits are resolved first, letting the player remove, replace, duplicate the cubes, etc.&#10;As edit cards are used, they go to the spent side of your board. To recover them so you can use them again, you&rsquo;ll need to spend 2 actions.&#10;&#10;Once the cubes are on the shared sequence, you can use 1 action to extract the cubes from the sequence, matching the cards in your hand.&#10;In the same action, you can chain more than 1 card, or even overlap them, to extract a longer, uninterrupted sequence.&#10;To get more cards onto your hand, you can use 1 action to draw 2 cards and keep 1, or you can use more than 1 action to, for instance, get 6 cards and keep 3.&#10;&#10;After claiming them, you place the cards below your board, face up, and you take the sequence of cubes onto your private sequence.&#10;If there are cubes there already, you may insert them on any position, to get other sequences that you need.&#10;You can also discard an extra action token to remove any number of cubes from your sequence.&#10;&#10;From your private sequence, you may match 3 consecutive cubes, and discard them to turn them into an amino-acid, or codon, placing one of your edit tokens onto the corresponding space.&#10;Some of the amino-acids have an &ldquo;extra action&rdquo; icon &ndash;the first person to place an edit cube there, gets an extra action token, but they can be claimed more than once by the same or different players.&#10;To unlock more edit tokens from your reserve, once every turn you may spend two actions to get a new token. However, you may only have 4 edit cubes available on your board or at the manufacturer.&#10;&#10;While extracting CRISPR cards and claiming codons, ideally you should be trying to complete the public objectives, getting each of the letters shown, either from your collected cards, or from codons marked with your tokens. To claim an objective, discard the cards and remove the tokens, using one of them to mark the objective &ndash; The first player to claim it gets a few extra points, as shown in the single space, but the objective can be claimed any number of times, by the same or different players.&#10;&#10;When a player has no edit tokens left at the end of their turn, the end of the game is triggered &ndash; every OTHER player gets 1 more turn, and then the game ends.&#10;Players get the points from each completed objective, plus the points from each amino-acid with one of their tokens, plus 1 point for each collected CRISPR card, plus 1 point for every 2 action tokens of either kind still on their board.&#10;&#10;The winner is simply the player with the most points.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Three years after the German invasion, the Red Army stands as battle-hardened troops, ready to finally push the fascist invaders out of Mother Russia! A screaming barrage of shells and rockets signals the beginning of Operation Bagration, and Soviet Rifle Corps charge forward to capture the fortress towns of Vitebsk, Orsha and Mogilov. The Red Army smashes through German Army Group Centre&rsquo;s front line and then relentlessly advances westward across Byelorussia to threaten Minsk. The Red Army&rsquo;s goes on the offensive all across the front, from Finland and Estonia in the north to Poland, Ukraine, Romania, and eventually across Hungary to lay siege to the city of Budapest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, a player can play as few or as many cards as they wish, they may also discard as many cards as they like. Cards are played face down to the board- and once played, are not looked at until the end of the round. Player may then draw up to three cards (only from the deck, not the discard pile), with a 7 card maximum hand size.&#10;&#10;Each space is dedicated to one specific poker category, and may be completed in one or more turns. Once a space is filled with the number of cards needed to make the listed hand, a chip is placed to mark that space as complete. Once all 10 hands on a board are completed, a player can call &quot;full board&quot;, giving players 1 last turn each (discards may be reshuffled and made into a new draw deck as many times as there are players- the round ends immediately when a player can't draw cards, which is common with 3 or 4 players as a full board takes 40 cards to complete). The spaces are then checked. For each space, the player with the strongest completed hand scores the value of the space:&#10;&#10;Any two cards (high card, no pair)- 3 points&#10;One pair- 5 points&#10;Two pair- 7 points&#10;Three of a Kind- 8 points&#10;Straight- 10 points&#10;Flush- 15 points&#10;Full House- 20 points&#10;Four of a Kind- 30 points&#10;Straight Flush- 40 points&#10;Royal Flush- 60 points (must be natural- no jokers)&#10;&#10;Ties in any space split the points rounded down. No score if the hand is incorrect or incomplete. The player who called &quot;full board&quot; scores 25 points if all 10 hands on their board are correct (even if some don't eventually score). If they called incorrectly, they lose 25 points. Play as many rounds as needed for someone to get 500 points.&#10;&#10;Solitaire is played with one deck plus jokers- player gets 7 cards, plays exactly 3 at a time to spaces or discard, then draws 3. After going through the deck once or completing the board, player scores value of correctly completed hands plus 10 points for each card in hand or remaining in draw pile, minus 10 points for every card discarded.&#10;&#10;",

In hostile places on primeval planets, where a lasergun in your holster is the only law, will you be the one who prevails and claims all the glory?&#10;&#10;To play a game of Battedrill, you will need miniatures with their stat cards, dice, measure widgets (or a measure tape) and a table that will represent the battlefield of the skirmish between two opposing crews controlled by the players. Controlling your crew means performing available actions with your miniatures, such as moving, attacking or taking special actions. We have kept the rules simple and straightforward to provide dynamic battles, but also not to reduce the challenge and the tactical aspect of the game. Every model has a set of unique statistics and abilities, whose wise use is the key to victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ever since its discovery, magic has been a source of conflict accross the Realm. Over time, factions have used it to tame the elements of their land, repel invaders and conquer enemies. When war finally erupted, the world was plunged into darkness for decades. Peace seemed unattainable until leaders agreed on the foundation of the Magic Council, a committee in charge of legislating the use of magic across the Realm and prohibiting it during warfare.&#10;To elect members of the Council, a representative of each faction was sent as their champion to compete in a tournament called Arena. In this tournament, champions used all their magic powers to battle each other in an epic clash. The winner claimed the throne of the Magic Council, while the others were assigned a title proportional to their performance. Arena became a tradition and remains to this day how members of the council are elected every year.&#10;&#10;Tales of Arena is a 3-round arena skirmish game. It can be played by 3 to 4 players.&#10;To start the game, each player is assigned a champion and a map is set in the arena. Each round starts with a market phase where players provide their champion with gear. Then, players unleash their champion&rsquo;s magic powers to defeat each other during the arena phase. Fortunately, champions can not die in the arena. When they are drained (0HP), they are removed momentarily but come back their next turn by their starting gate. This is made possible by the soul pool, a device that can exchange souls to save champions. It has a finite number of souls though, so when it is emptied, the round ends and Victory Points are given to each player. A new map is then set, and players can further equip their champion during the following market phase. After three rounds, the player with the most Victory Points wins the game, and as such their champion wins the throne of the Magic Council!&#10;&#10;",

A player takes a card and separates it from the rest and indicates what data must be located as indicated by the rocket pencil on the back of the removed card.&#10;How to play:&#10;When all the players are ready, one player turns over the top card of the deck. All players at the same time and without touching the card will have to search for the data. The first to say it out loud and cover the letter will get the letter set aside as a point.&#10;The letter that was face up is left to one side, but in this case face down in order to see what the rocket pencil indicates.&#10;The data to look for in the charts are the following:&#10; Red (number): the emotion that is repeated the number of times indicated by the card (joy, sadness, surprise or anger)&#10;Purple (sex): the largest group represented on the card (boy-girl). In the event of a tie, &ldquo;tie&rdquo; must be indicated.&#10;Blue (hair): it will be necessary to discover which hair color is the most numerous in the group of boys and girls on the chart.&#10;&#10;When there is only one letter left, it will be turned over to check what data to look for (what the rocket pencil marks). When everyone is ready, it is turned around again and the players try to be the fastest to discover the data.&#10;&#10;Game over:&#10;When the deck of cards is finished the players will count the cards obtained. The participant who has collected the most cards will be the winner. In case of a tie, all are winners! Shall we play another?&#10;RECOMMENDATIONS: It is highly advisable to play the first few times with a single data to search, that is, it is always the same data for the entire game. You can start looking in the cards for hair color, the next game look for the majority in sex and in the third look for the coincidence in the number of repetitions of the same emotion that indicates the back of the card.&#10;&#10;Un juego para conocer y reconocer las principales emociones con diversos modos de juego&#10;&#10;",

The basic thought behind the Adaptive Combat System is: the more power in arms your army &ndash; the &raquo;Heller Haufen&laquo; &ndash; is  able  to  mass,  the  more  aware  the  targets&rsquo;  defenders  will  become  of your armaments. So they will most likely adapt!&#10;Thus battle against the important fortified towns will become more challenging than ever (and regardless of your actual attack's potential). After you have computed your strength you determine the difficulty-level against which to compete with the help of a rotary dial and a dice roll. Each difficulty-level (the basic copper ~, the silver ~, the gold ~, the palladium ~ and the plutonium level) comes with its own set of Battle Cards and with its own die. So, in the hardest case you've to compete against a D16 with a lessened probability of rolling the lower values (but also, of course, of rolling a total failure). Thus, with increased difficulty the luck-factor (or bad-dice-roll-factor) decreases.&#10;This Mini Expansion is meant to be optional and for all who want to try a new challenge when going into battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
