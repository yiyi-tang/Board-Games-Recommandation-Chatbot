In OOgal, players roll the special dies in an attempt to build words with the greatest point score. Unique 20-sided dies contain all the consonants, while the custom cubes contain all fo the vowels. If OOgal eyes on the special black die is rolled, an OOgal occurs and the score is doubled. A 60-second sand timer keeps the action going while a player races through multiple rolls to build the greatest scoring word. Multiple words, slang terms, and proper names can also be spelled at the discretion of the players. Great game for the entire family at home, at camp, or on the go. Makes a perfect gift!&#10;&#10;",

Your score for the turn is the number letters in your set times the number of words you formed with them.  On your next turn you think of another set of letters and do it all over again.  The game ends when both players pass and the player with the most points wins.  There&rsquo;s some other stuff, like challenge rules for made up words, a limit on the number of times you can use the letter S, and a pie-rule for the first turn of the game, but that&rsquo;s the gist of it.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

When a player receives a card he must instantly say &quot;Thank you&quot; otherwise some one will immediately call &quot;Pepper&quot; and take all his cards.  The fun of the game consists in securing and completing the various families, and even more particularly in the constant capturing of cards by calling &quot;Pepper&quot; and in the efforts of those who have lost their cards to again get into the game.&#10;&#10;The pack is made up a number of Families, each family consisting of five cards:  the MAN, his WIFE, SON, DAUGHTER and a fifth card showing an ARTICLE indicating the family.&#10;&#10;For example, in Sir Peter's family the 5th card is a servant.  Thus:  The Sir Peter Peppercorn Family consists of Sir Peter, his wife, son, daughter and servant.&#10;&#10;There are 9 sets of families.&#10;&#10;",

As its name implies, LI deals with combat on the ground in the same period. The kings of the battlefield are huge fighting machines, the Ironclads of the title, which cross the landscape on tracks, wheels or even primitive mechanical legs, dealing destruction wherever they go. Small steam-driven machines, known as contraptions and akin to the tanks of the First World War, scurry between the hulking ironclads creating their own smaller form of mayhem. More conventional infantry, cavalry and artillery units, albeit augmented with all manner of fantastic weaponry, add to the confusion. Giant aeronef, dirigibles and winged aircraft fight their own battles in the sky while raining down bombs on the units below.&#10;&#10;",

The vibrant setting draws inspiration from comic books, pulp books and all sorts of nostalgic sentiments while using a very modern and fast gameplay mechanics.&#10;&#10;After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014, Pulp City: The Supreme Edition upgraded the game experience even more.&#10;&#10;- Choose your team from 100+ unique Supremes (characters), there is very few restrictions standing in the way of building the team you love,&#10;- Recruit spandex vigilantes, aliens, robots, undead or dozens of other unlikely heroes and villains,&#10;- Test them in a Plot &amp; Agenda driven games!&#10;&#10;Pulp City uses a couple of unique mechanics that make the games blockbuster:&#10;&#10;- Roles: A lot like in the video games, each Supreme covers one (or more) battlefield role: from crucial Supports through Leaders, Blasters, Brawlers, Tanks and Infiltrators to mighty Powerhouses. Right composition of the team is the key to winning the games.&#10;&#10;- Action Points management - a team shares the pool but the pool is rebuild each round based on the number of surviving Supremes and modified through presence of Support characters,&#10;&#10;- Supremes stack dice thanks to the simple system of combat bonuses - winning the Opposed Roll is just a first step, the more high rolls you have, the more FX (think Special Effects in the movies) you cause. From simple extra Damage to hurling your opponent 15 inches back through the battlefield.&#10;&#10;- Smart cards system: front of a card is used to recruit a Supreme, back is used during the game and has all of the information requiered - so you will never have to flip the rulebook.&#10;&#10;Quickstart rules are available as a free download (http://pulp-city.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/QSGQRS_digitallyreadable.pdf), each miniature comes with a card that has all of the gameplay information (online store has all cards as pdfs for you to try out for free).&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.pulp-city.com&#10;&#10;",

Each move is a random length and takes a random time (rolled on two separate dice); the game starts with 72 hours before the eclipse - the duration of each move is deducted from each player's personal 'clock'.  In the process the players also have to earn money by doing bits of casual work here and there in order to have the &pound;50 entrance fee that admittance to the &quot;optimum viewing site&quot; requires for admittance.  If time gets tight the players even have the opportunity to visit Merlin's Cave at Tintagel to be sent back in time after completing a task for him.&#10;&#10;It's a strange game, probably more interesting as a curiosity/souvenir than for gameplay.  The quality of components and printing is very good, although most of the graphics used in the game appear to be royalty-free clip art, along with a rather varied selection of fonts.&#10;&#10;",

The game scale is 1&quot;=50m and one turn about 15-30 minutes.&#10;&#10;The standard basing is 3&quot; wide stands and depth as deep as necessary.  The authors recommend using two vehicles or guns per stand and about 12 infantry figures.&#10;&#10;The game turn is divided into two phases.  In the first phase, each company, battalion and brigade HQ rolls a six-sided dice, which represents when each formation may activate.  In the second phase, a player draw cards from a deck composed of values 1-6 (with each card represented twice:  one black suit and one red suit) plus one joker, which ends the turn and causes the cards to be reshuffled.  When that card appears, all units of both sides with HQ die rolls matching the current card may act:  move, fire, conduct indirect fire, assault, etc.  There is no simultaneous action.  In the case of multiple units having the same die roll, the stands must roll for first activation.&#10;&#10;Many of the chartless systems (e.g., morale) rely on the use of special dice for effect.&#10;&#10;In each section of the rules there are optional rules and designers notes.&#10;&#10;Yahoo Group:  http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/looksargenocharts/&#10;&#10;",

Twenty five circular cardboard dustbin-lid counters are placed face down on the moon; on the reverse of each dustbin-lid is a picture of a specific Clanger or other denizen of the moon.  (Clangers lived on the moon and used dustbin lids as doors - just accept it.)&#10;&#10;The players (there's no upper limit stated) are dealt out the twenty five cards in the deck, taking turns to turn over a dustbin lid and if the revealed character matches a card in their hand, they take the token.  The player with the most tokens/dustbin lids wins.&#10;&#10;An unusual inclusion in this game, however, is the &quot;whistle sound chip&quot; device - a battery-powered gadget that when pressed plays an extract of the extremely distinctive whistle-like 'Clanger speech'.  Whenever a player matches a token and card they get to press the Clanger whistle...&#10;&#10;",

The lists include infantry, paratroopers, and armored units, as well as aircraft.&#10;&#10;The rules allow you to use whatever 20-28mm miniatures with 1/72 scale being the recommended choice by Matthew Sprange, the Battlefield Evolution system's designer.&#10;&#10;The rules are easy to learn and fast-paced.  The game has a built in &quot;Reaction System&quot; which allows you to react to your opponent's nearby &quot;Move&quot; or &quot;Shoot Actions.&quot;  No more sitting around staring at the wall during your opponent's turn.&#10;&#10;Easy as the rules are, they allow for great tactical flexibility, and will require critical decision making at every turn.&#10;&#10;The World at War rules are fully compatible with the future of the Battlefield Evolution line, including the forthcoming Battlefield Evolution: Modern Combat, due later this year.&#10;&#10;Details direct from Mongoose Publishing:&#10;&#10;&quot;Using the latest generation of the fast-playing Battlefield Evolution rules, this is the action-packed rulebook that brings World War II to your tabletop.&#10;&#10;Battlefield Evolution: World at War is a portal into World War II, providing everything you need to stage small firefights in far flung villages, or massive confrontations involving massed infantry, armour and air units, as the struggle for territory reaches a fever pitch.&#10;&#10;The main rulebook covers Late War armies in the European theatre, with future expansions introducing new campaigns and different armies.

Then play one Action Card. At the end of your turn, draw enough cards to fill your hand up to (5).&#10;&#10;Infection Cards: are a person, place, or thing that spreads the epidemic. Each Infection Card has two symbols. An Epidemic grows as cards are placed adjacent to the initial Infection card. Cards can only be placed adjacent to another card if the symbol in the corner facing that card matches.&#10;&#10;Example: A Rock Star card has the LIPS symbol in both corners. The Big Bear Biker card has LIPS in the lower right corner, so it can be placed on the left-hand side so that the LIPS symbols touch, thereby spreading the infection and growing the epidemic.&#10;&#10;Outbreak Cards: are wild cards that allow an additional card to be played. The Outbreak Card DOES NOT count toward the (5) cards needed to complete and Epidemic.&#10;&#10;Action Cards: are objects or items that either: (1) stop or slow an Epidemic by blocking or killing an infection. (2) enhance or accelerate an Epidemic by making the infection immune to the effects of a block&#10;or kill card.&#10;&#10;Block Cards: block one side of an Epidemic. If both sides are blocked, the Epidemic is contained, then discarded.&#10;&#10;Germ War Cards: weaponize a virus making it able to spread on any edge of the Germ War card. The Germ War Card DOES NOT count toward the (5) cards needed to complete and Epidemic.&#10;&#10;Special Action Cards: are objects or viruses that can be played on anyone&rsquo;s turn. They include the Frysol and Super Germ card.&#10;&#10;Frysol Cards: kill one infection.&#10;&#10;Super Germ Cards: nullify the effects of Frysol&#10;&#10;Global Containment: ends the game. Note: Can only be played after (3) Epidemics are completed by any (1) player.&#10;&#10;Vapor Bomb: Destroys all Epidemics IN PLAY. Completed Epidemics are NOT destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

Murray invented his own variation on it in that year.&#10;  It is an unusual game in that any number of people can play, almost without limit.&#10;&#10;It is played on a square grid, whose size is 15 to 18 squares on a side.  It is essentially a multi-player solitaire, where a player can make multiple jumps as in draughts.  The winner is the person who has captured the most pieces when no more moves are possible.&#10;&#10;In the original, pre-1898 version, the pieces are undifferentiated.  In Murray's 1898 version, pieces have colour to denote scoring, some pieces being more valuable than others.&#10;&#10;",

Most images in the game are signed Carl-B&ouml;rje (real name B&ouml;rje Nilsson, cartoonist and comic magazine editor), the cartoonist who drew the comic, and the whole game could probably be credited to him (given that there is no original gameplay).&#10;&#10;The six playing pieces are pictures of main characters from the comic, Pelle Svansl&ouml;s (the hero without tail), Maja Gr&auml;ddnos (his girlfriend), Feta Trisse (fat and smart cat), Elaka M&aring;ns (mean main enemy of Pelle), Frida (the scatter-brained one) and one of the twins Bill and Bull (the funny and dumb duo, sort of like Dupont and Dupond). A few more characters show on the gameboard and on the cover: Tusse Batong (policeman), Gullan fr&aring;n Arkadien (another good-looking girl-cat) and Murre fr&aring;n Skogstibble (farm cat). There are also some anonymous extra cats on the game board. All pictures follow the comic style perfectly, certainly a main feature of the game at the time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A wargame about the unsuccessful Russian offensive in May 1942.  This is the second attempt by the Russians to gain strategic initiative and to liberate Kharkov. The 1st unsuccessful probe had taken place in March and had been turned into a catastrophe few days later by a German operation, which broke out along the whole Russian front. As a  result of this battle the Germans reached Stalingrad in autumn 1942.&#10;&#10;The game uses rules of the &quot;WB95&quot; (Great Battles 1939-1945); I-go-you-go system designed for dealing with large battles of World War II. Counters represent regiments (Germans) or divisions/brigades (Russians), one hex represents about 2500m, one turn represents one day.&#10;&#10;The game has much maneuver and is rich in dramatical moments.&#10;&#10;",
