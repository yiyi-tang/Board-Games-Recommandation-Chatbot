    "Description": "Game of the Generals is an educational war game released in the Philippines in the 1970s. Its Filipino name is Salpakan. It is designed for two players, each controlling an army, and a neutral arbiter (sometimes called a referee or an adjutant) to decide the results of &quot;challenges&quot; between opposing playing pieces that like playing cards have their identities hidden from the opponent.&#10;&#10;The game simulates armies at war trying to overpower, misinform, outflank, outmaneuver, and destroy each other. It optimizes the use of logic, memory, and spatial skills. It simulates the &quot;fog of war&quot; because the identities of the opposing pieces are hidden from each player and can only be guessed at by their location, movements, or from the results of challenges. The game allows only one side's plan to succeed, although a player may change plans during the course of the game. In addition, there are two different ways of winning the game. Certain strategies and tactics, however, allow both sides the chance of securing a better idea of the other's plan as the game progresses. Players can also speak or gesture to their opponents during matches, hoping to create a false impression about the identity of their pieces or their overall strategy.&#10;&#10;--Information collected in July 2020 from Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Generals&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The classic detective game!  In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the &quot;Silver Line&quot; edition of Hasbro games. In addition to the distinctive black and silver motif, it includes &quot;invitation&quot; cards and the extra poison weapon from the 50th Anniversary edition. It also has new custom dice that trigger &quot;Clue&quot; event cards, and Dr. Orchid in the place of Ms. White.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the Barbary Coast, a Wild West mess of saloons, dance-halls and gambling dens in Old San Francisco. In this elimination card game players try to avoid being Shanghai'd - using &quot;Upstairs Ladies&quot;, &quot;Old Shellbacks&quot; taking advantage of &quot;Drunken Sailors&quot; or just by plying opponents with &quot;drinks&quot;. &#10;Other players gang up against a Shanghai'd player with Rowing Gangs or Shanghai Boss cards and there's a price to pay if the Shanghai fails. &#10;This game has local interest, but isn't only a San Francisco game. The game features good player interaction, it plays fast, eliminated players aren't out for long, less than 5 minutes for the average game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beyond The Saale is a fictional Seven Years War campaign that depicts a drive into Prussia by Austrian and French forces in an effort to keep Prussia off balance after they knocked Russia out of the war.&#10;&#10;While fictional in nature, the commanders and force strengths represent what would have been available for a possible campaign.&#10;&#10;Although designed to use the campaign system in the Warfare in the Age of Reason supplements, gamers could basically use any campaign system that they want.&#10;&#10;The forces are given in terms of strength points, which could be used to represent units for the set of rules that players choose to use.&#10;&#10;For those familiar with the Age of Reason army lists you simply convert the forces (given in strength points or SPs) into the percentages shown in the army lists.&#10;&#10;This is a unique campaign in that both sides will know where the French and Austrian forces are entering from.&#10;&#10;At this time in the Seven Years War both of these armies were not exactly know for their rapid movements, but once on the campaign map they could strike in several different directions.&#10;&#10;The French and Austrian armies will have the advantage in numbers during the early stages of the campaign, which is offset by the Prussian movement and tactical ratings of the commanders.&#10; With multiple paths to victory the campaign has pretty good replay value and our gaming group has already played it twice over the years.&#10;&#10;In the end, it tries to do what most miniatures campaigns do and that is to provide unique and interesting battles that you would not ordinarily see on your regular gaming night.&#10;&#10;- Description from the ruleset&#10;&#10;",

Some of the players are secretly loyal to the Illuminati, and will sabotage these missions when it is strategically sound to do so. The Illuminati know one another, while the rest of the players are left in the dark.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into years. The Lodge sends out missions in January, April, September, and November. In December, the Factory owners elect a new Alderman, who has minimal power.&#10;Every June the Lodge will elect new officers who will be responsible for assigning the committees that go out on these missions. The Secretary will select where these committees will go (from limited options presented to him), and the Worshipful Master will nominate a committee to send. If the Lodge consents, that committee will go, and their actions will determine the loyalty of that city. Some cities will be visited more than once over the course of the campaign.&#10;&#10;After four years (sixteen missions), check for the following endgame conditions:&#10;&#10;     All eight cities have picked a side of this fateful conflict&#10;     Six or more cities are on the same side&#10;&#10;&#10;If both conditions are met, the game ends, and the team with majority control wins.&#10;If either of the conditions is not met, then the game continues one more year.&#10;At the end of that final round, if neither side has six cities, the Elector, Karl Theodor, will outlaw both the Illuminati and Freemasonry, and the Rosicrucian wins alone.&#10;&#10;In addition to your secret roles (Loyalist/Illuminati/Rosicrucian), players are given public roles which limit when they can travel, limit the travel of others, allow them to learn the loyalty of another player, or allow them to manipulate committees before they begin their missions.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Addition to the classical game of chess. A new strategy element consisting of 48 cards which are used for movement of the pieces. There are 15 pawn cards, 7 knight cards, 7 bishop cards, 5, rook cards, 5 queen cards, 3 light pieces cards, 3 heavy pieces cards, and 3 strategy cards. The game is played on a regular chess board with standard rules (including castling, en passant etc), but before you can play a move, first you must play a card that matches the piece you are moving (example: to play a pawn you must play a pawn card). At the beginning of the game, each player receives 20 cards from the deck. After both players have used all of their cards, the deck is reshuffled and each player receives 20 cards again. Beside regular cards (each for one type of piece) there are also three kinds of special cards - light, heavy and strategy. &quot;Light&quot; can move either a knight or a bishop, &quot;heavy&quot; either a rook or a queen, and &quot;strategy&quot; can move any piece on the board. If, at some point of the game, a player has no card by which he can move the remaining pieces on the board, he must move his king. To move a king a player can play any card from the deck, but he place it face down on the discard pile. If a player doesn't have a card to move any of the remaining pieces, and his king is unable to move (due to check threat), that player immediately loses the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bonaparte is wargame system to land battles in the Napoleonic Wars on 6mm to 20mm scale.&#10;&#10;The basic fighting unit is a company or a battery of artillery. &#10;These are grouped into battalions.&#10;&#10;Turns are performed by alternate activation of battalions, with the quality of the commanders determining some issues. &#10;Basic unit types are; infantry, cavalry, artillery and special units (General, Officer, Banner, Skirmisher).&#10;&#10;Points system for units and army lists for points based games. &#10;The army lists can be used to convert historical orders of battle, into lists for games.&#10;&#10;The objective is to provide an easy, agile and adaptable rules system for the simulation of combat in the Napoleonic Wars.&#10;&#10;The definitions of range of weapons were based on historical sources and serious publications, in particular the book &ldquo;Weapons &amp; Equipment of the Napoleonic Wars&rdquo;, by Philip J. Haythornthwaite.&#10;&#10;Likewise, the rules for combat formations and for the historical characteristics of each army were also the target of research in specialized bibliography on the subject.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out. At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.&#10;&#10;Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.&#10;&#10;Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value. If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.

Moon Over Thelgrim comes in eight different army packs: The Draco Wing (Dragonkin), Frothan&#039;s Ghouls (Undead), The Groman Guard (Knights), The Sons of Triamlavar (Elves), Zocrab&#039;s Marauders (Orcs), The Hammers of Urth (Dwarves), The Knives of Q&#039;aro Fenn (Uthuk), and Waiqar&#039;s Sundermen (Acolytes). Each pack has four set flats of that faction and four random flats.&#10;&#10;What's New in Moon Over Thelgrim:&#10;&#10;     Terrain - The expansion includes new rules for terrain, as well as six new Terrain Disks.&#10;     Champions - These unique new hero Disks add power to your &quot;pure&quot; armies.&#10;     New Disk Abilities - Dozens of the new Creature Disks feature new abilities to add variety and strategy to your game.&#10;     New Scenarios - No Diskwars expansion would be complete without new scenarios, and Moon Over Thelgrim gives you several from which to choose.&#10;     A New Faction - The mysterious wilds of the Thelgrim Peninsula are home to strange new faction that does not appreciate outsiders invading its homeland.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

During the game you will gather items and allies to help you as well as encounter dangerous events.&#10;&#10;When exploring the map players draw tiles of a threat level based on how far they have traveled from the base. The tile revealed will then either have the player draw and resolve an event card, or draw a dinosaur from a threat level bag of the same level.&#10;&#10;Five dice are then rolled to determine successes at events and capture attempts. Different colors are needed for different rolls, like capturing a carnivore or a herbivore. But be careful, if you are knocked out before returning to the gate base tile your dinosaurs will escape! How far will you press your luck when the other players can sabotage you or even cause carnivores to attack?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

For the Bloody Mummers, they have decided that every aspect of their look must be as flamboyant as possible. That doesn&rsquo;t just mean bright clothing for themselves, but even to the animals that they ride in combat. Not content with the various horse breeds, they have instead opted to ride zorses, a combination of a horse and a zebra.&#10;&#10;The Bloody Mummers Zorse Riders unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives commanders a bright new cavalry unit to use in combat. Being a Neutral unit, they can be taken by most commanders. The Zorse Riders are masters at flanking maneuvers. When catching an enemy in the side or rear, they get several different bonuses, both offensively and defensively, potentially ruining an enemy&rsquo;s plans before they even begin.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You must issue commands for Lexomatic, a spy robot that has been dropped into the enemy base in order to steal secrets. However, due to various design faults and bugs in the operating system, controlling Lexomatic may not be as easy as you had hoped.&#10;&#10;Lexomatic is a robot whose operating system accepts any word in the English language as a command word. Each letter in the word corresponds to a movement direction or an action (Activate electromagnetic shield; Open door; Grab item; Disable laser; Remove letter from buffer). Each turn you roll dice to add one or more random letters to the buffer. You then issue a command word that contains those letters in order, attempting to make Lexomatic negotiate the map, collect as many items as possible and escape intact. Finally, you resolve each letter in the command word. Invalid commands cause Lexomatic's temperature to increase, eventually leading to failure due to overheating.&#10;&#10;The game includes an introductory mission, plus a campaign of 5 missions with new elements on each map and a small legacy element.&#10;&#10;Designed for the 4th Roll &amp; Write Game Design Contest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The people of your small hamlet of Felwort are threatened by a mysterious evil power emanating from the dark tower on the other side of the forest. Legend says that an evil warlord once lived in the tower, and terrorized the entire realm. There are now whispers that this warlord, known as Bram, has returned. Your town has chosen YOU to go to the tower and stop this threat. It is said that within the garden outside Bram&rsquo;s Tower lies the key to stopping him - the ORB of ICE. If you can navigate the garden and find this orb, survive the deadly crypt, navigate the fortress, and defeat Bram, you may be able to save your town. But those who enter the Fortress of Terror never return...&#10;&#10;Fortress of Terror is a solitaire roll-and-write adventure game in which you, a simple peasant, become the humble hero sent by your village to enter the terrifying fortress of the evil warlord Bram in order to stop him from terrorizing the realm.  You do this by making your way through four chapters, or sections, of the game.  Each chapter places you in a maze that you must explore and escape from, collecting powerful Relics and other goals that you must achieve to win.  You move around each maze using a pool of dice that are rolled each round. However, you can never retrace your steps, as Bram has cursed the earth and floors of the fortress to crumble beneath your every step. If you manage to fulfill the chapter objective and escape the maze, you will advance to the next chapter, until you reach the final battle with Bram himself.&#10;&#10;Fortress of Terror is the first adventure module in the Roll-With-It system, a modular, solitaire roll-and-write adventure game system with endless possibilities for adventure. The simple yet solid core mechanisms in the basic game system allow it to be very flexible, supporting just about any theme.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Likewise, it will include two Master Scenario Books - one for solo/co-op and one for competitive play.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     2 new, alternate empires. Similar to existing, but different. They have fighters that don't need carriers. If the original game had fighters that were like TIE Fighters, these are more like X-Wing. They don't have boarding ships or Titans, but have a new class of ships. The other ships have slightly different stats/costs.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Variable, but balanced home systems. Everyone has the same home system for balance reasons. However, knowing what you are going to find is something that has always bothered many people. This will fix that.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Scenario Cards. Around 30 cards and 1 or 2 could be flipped to change the overall galaxy conditions for the game. A couple of these are from the scenario book, but most are new.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Missions. Missions are Resource Cards that can't be just played, but require a player to complete something on the map to gain a larger benefit. Think of the plot of a simple Trek episode.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Deep Space Planetary Attributes. The NPA planets in deep space will now have a bit of personality. Some will be harder or easier to take. Some will really be worth fighting over.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Crew Cards. Not everyone will always want to play with these, but they will bring even more personality into the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Facilities Game. Two new facilities are added. This will really complete the facilities game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Everything else. Extra cards of every type, Starbases, Defense Satellites, Cyber Armor, New Terrain, more terrain to support larger scenarios (more terrain is needed anyway to support larger scenarios so new terrain types are also included).&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Reveal card 0 of the scenario and read the intro out loud. Aside from explaining the current situation, this card will tell you a) how many info tokens of each type must go in the bag, and b) on which positions of the alert track must the police cars go. Place the rest of story cards in order, face down and without looking at them, next to the story track, making sure that the arrow points at the position indicated on the&#10;back of each story card.&#10;&#10;GOAL:&#10;The goal of the game is to collect enough info tokens to reveal all the story cards and overcome the final challenge before the alert track reaches the limit.&#10;Each story has their own cards that will change some game mechanics, introduce new ones, and will also tell you what the final challenge is. At any time, if the alert track reaches its limit, the players will have until the end of the round to reach their goal, or they will lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

Everyone counts the cash they have left and the player with the most cash wins. Just like real life!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;The game takes a somewhat cynical view of toxic waste disposal, offering players the choice between legal handling of the waste and illegal actions such as violating truck weight limits and illegal dumping. But such actions carry the chance of significant penalties if taken.&#10;&#10;Players have movers in the shape of flatbed trucks on which they carry the toxic waste drums.  They move along spaces on the large vinyl mat, some of which offer services, such as fuel.  These spaces may be bought and then earn income for the buyer as in Monopoly.&#10;&#10;The game comes in a large cylindrical metal can, labelled to look like a toxic waste drum.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

EETenki: The Queen Himiko Chronicles, each player is a priestess-king who can master sorcery and skillfully read the changing weather. They perform rituals and direct agriculture to bring wealth and power to the nation they lead. Players race to get the most victory points by growing rice coins that represent rice plants. These rice coins will grow or rot depending on the weather. On a turn, you perform two actions:&#10;&#10;1. Use your sorcery to predict the weather.&#10;2. Push your luck to plant some rice coins, or wait for the next day.&#10;&#10;When the weather is good, planting rice coins can yield a better crop and earn you victory points. However, if the weather is bad, your coins will level down (rot) or be lost. Level up (grow) your rice coins efficiently and occasionally buy trade goods to earn victory points. When the fourth sunny card is revealed, players finish that round, then the game ends. The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;This game involves some strategic luck pushing based on previous information, such as calculating probability, but also bluffing and poker face to read your opponent's expressions.&#10;&#10;-description via designer's translator&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Der Tag, 1916 is a solitaire, strategic level game covering the North Sea campaign of World War I between the fleets of Great Britain and Germany set during the pivotal year of 1916. &#10;The player takes the British, and the game system handles the German side (optional rules allow you to reverse roles if desired).  &#10;The game does not posit that Jutland must happen.  &#10;Rather, it allows for varied German activity by their High Seas Fleet (Raid, Tip &amp; Run, Ambush, etc.) represented by Action Cards for the turn.  &#10;Some turns may have No Action at all, some might involve a Bombardment of the English coast, with the British Grand Fleet--based in four main anchorages of Scapa Flow, Cromarty, Rosyth, and Dover--making appropriate responses.  &#10;If Der Tag (&quot;The Day&quot;) occurs, the Germans come out with every ship available, as what happened with Jutland, and the fate of the entire war would hang in the balance.  &#10;Ship combat is resolved by a simple process which, while remaining authentic, makes even large battles resolvable within a matter of minutes.  &#10;Ships on both sides are differentiated by type (2nd generation dreadnought battleship, dreadnought battleship, battlecruiser, pre-dreadnought battleship, and armored cruiser), with named counters provided for each.&#10;&#10;Includes:  17 page instructions containing standard and optional rules, set of Action Cards, set of ship counters (60 British, 34 German), small game map, game tables, and Designer's Notes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Available separately or in Panzerschreck #17&#10;&#10;",
