    "Description": "Mia Mouse and her friends play hide and seek in the forest. Look through the peep holes in the forest and help Mia Mouse search! Wasn't there just a rustle behind the tree? And there are footprints in this puddle. Who could they belong to? Maybe Ronja Deer, Suri Dormouse, and the rest of the gang in the dense leafy undergrowth?&#10;&#10;Discover Free Play and Details&#10;In Forest Friends your child can engage with the game materials during free play. Play along! Discover the pictures on the game materials together and talk to your child about them. Ask your child what they recognize and encourage them to name things. Talk to them about which animals they have already seen or heard in the forest. And just like that you're already role playing with your child.&#10;&#10;Game 1: Little Forest Explorers&#10;One child gets Mia Mouse. Read out a task. The child searches for the solution. Sometimes the correct answer is visible on the outer walls, sometimes only through the peep holes. If the child can't find the correct answer, help them. Once the child has found the solution, they receive a star and place it in front of them. Mia Mouse is passed on to the next child. It's now their turn. The game is over once all 5 stars have been collected.&#10;&#10;Game 2: Play Hide and Seek&#10;Before starting the game, everyone may look into any two holes. Every child tries to remember which animal is where. Whoever was last in a forest goes first and moves Mia Mouse one animal tile forward in a clockwise direction. The child names the animal that they see on the tile. Now it's time to think about which hole they can see the animal through. They choose the hole they think the animal is hiding in and look through it. If right, the child can take a star from the starry sky as a reward. The game ends when all the stars have been taken from the sky. The children now stack the stars they won on top of each other. The child with the highest star stack wins.&#10;&#10;",

Two players take over the positions of the signalmen and handle the closing and opening of the railway barriers. One party starts at C, the other at D. The players take turns rolling the die and moving. After the first throw has fallen, the work of the signalmen begins. If a straight throw (2, 4, 6) has been thrown, the strip representing the railway  is positioned on II, if odd (1, 3 , 5) is thrown, it is on I. This is to be done after each throw, and this will alternately block the blue stripe representing the country road. If the railway crossing is closed, the players have to stop till it opens again.&#10;&#10;E-F presents a bridge on which 2 cars cannot drive side by side. If a player comes to the bridge and this is occupied by an oncoming car, he has to wait at E or F until the bridge is free. Also, no player can overtake a car moving in the same direction, but must occupy the next space behind it.&#10;&#10;If two oncoming cars come to a stop on the same space on the road, this means a collision. The two players then have to roll the dice together. The lower throw is eliminated from the game, the other moves back 10 spaces.&#10;&#10;Whoever reaches the opposite end of the lane first gets half the contents of the till and his party a point, and for each additional car that arrives earlier than the first car of the other party, another point. The first winner of the opposing party receives a quarter of the contents of the till. The last quarter remains in the till. The game is repeated until one party has 30 points. This party distributes the remainder in the till evenly among its members.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each player initially receives 30 tokens, of which he pays 10 into the till. If the cash runs out during the game, each player pays in another 10 tokens. The Players take turns to roll and move. The ships depart from space A, but are immediately caught up in a storm that pushes the vessels in different directions until the player manages to get past space B or C. From then on, the ship follows the chosen direction until it finally reaches space &#10;A again to win the game.&#10;&#10;If a ship comes to a green space, the player receives as many tokens from the till as his roll counted eyes. If he comes to a red space, he has to pay the same amount into the till. If a player is unable to make their payments, it means &quot;shipwreck&quot;; he receives a lifeboat and swaps his previous colored ship for a black one. With this he may continue to move; he is waived from paying twice if he stands on red. If he gets into payment difficulties again, this boat sinks and the player is eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;Scylla and Charybdis: As before, the player advances his ship by the number of columns equal to the number of eyes he rolled, but must place himself on the square of the column in question that shows the same number of eyes as his roll.&#10;Friendship Island: In front of the island there are two squares to jump over. If unsuccessful, the attempt must be repeated the next time. If ships coming from different directions meet on the island, they share their wealth equally among themselves.&#10;Vortex: The player stays around the circle with his ship until he comes to one of the exit spaces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

It aims to allow the use of part of the Cycle of Water material in the Cycle of Earth and vice versa.&#10;&#10;This expansion provides material to use some of the Cycle of Water figures in the Cycle of Earth:&#10;&#10;- An Identity Card for Tikku, his Initiative Card and his 8 Action Cards&#10;- Identity card for Eiko Bashimon, her Initiative card and her 8 Action cards&#10;- Identity card for Anko Kaori, her Initiative card and her 8 Action cards&#10;- An Identity Card for Ninjas&#10;- Identity Card for Oni Yama&#10;- An Identity Card for Oni Kage&#10;&#10;It also provides materials to use some of the Cycle of Earth miniatures in the Cycleof Water:&#10;&#10;- An Identity card for the Bushi&#10;- An Identity Card for the Archers&#10;- Identity card for the Fire Faces&#10;- An Identity Card for the Taish&ouml;&#10;- An identity card for Mitsu Hatori&#10;&#10;Finally, this expansion offers a great campaign using the material of the 2 previous Okko Chronicles games:&#10;&#10;- 1 Campaign Book of 80 pages&#10;- 1 Pajan Map&#10;- 1 Time token, with a Day / Night side&#10;- 20 Food / Koku counters&#10;- 9 Reputation counters numbered from 01 to 09 (1 Execrable, 2 and 3 Doubtful, 4, 5 and 6 Uncertain, 7 and 8 Honorable and 9 Excellent) &#10;- 6 Bashimon Clan counters (or cards), with the same front side but 3 corrupted Clan sides and 3 uncorrupted Clan sides&#10;- 12 Object cards&#10;- 1 calendar card&#10;&#10;The campaign book is based on the campaign &quot;Adventure in Pajan&quot; available for free on BGG. It will be largely modified and completed in order to integrate the scenarios of the Earth Cycle and to allow an even greater immersion in the Pajan universe. This booklet allows to link a large number of unpublished scenarios or spread in the different boxes and extensions of the Water Cycle and Earth Cycle to create a huge campaign using more than 50 different scenarios and quests.&#10;&#10;In the course of their adventure, Heroes will travel across much of the empire, from the cold city of the Silver Silks to the azure seas of the south to the snowy mountains of the 7 Monasteries range. Depending on the circumstances, their choices, their successes (or failures), the sequence of scenarios will be completely different, allowing for a unique adventure.&#10;&#10;",

You need to figure out where you are headed, and fast, or else&hellip; well, the previous captain did not exactly retire.&#10;&#10;In A Little Dinghy, one or two players work together to re-build a map and plot a successful trade route.

    "Description": "A fairly simple abstract strategy game for two with a Nordic feel, which combines elements of hnefatafl and chess.  Stated to be a traditional folk game with rules handed down in the family, when marketed online, but it appears not to have been previously recorded.&#10;&#10;Played on a square wooden board, divided into 7&times;7 undifferentiated squares (the game can also be played on an 8&times;8 chess board).&#10;&#10;One player takes 6 light / natural coloured discs, termed ravens, and sets them up in one corner of the board, one in the very corner, another in each of the adjacent squares, and the remaining three in the squares adjacent to those.  The opponent takes six dark / stained discs, and similarly sets them up in the opposite corner.  Each player's specially marked disc, termed Odin's Raven, is placed at the head of this flock.  Players then take turns in moving one of their ravens, with the aim of winning the game by capturing all of the opposing ravens.&#10;Odin's raven moves like a knight in chess, and captures by landing on an opposing disc. Other ravens move like chess rooks, and capture by flanking an opposing disc, as in hnefatafl.  Odin's raven may also participate in these flanking captures.&#10;There are several slight variants with differing movement / capturing rules.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game, the players are assigned certain peoples according to their game colour. Some of these peoples are already on the board at the beginning of the game, others are added in the course of the game.&#10;&#10;A Roma aeterna game lasts about four to six hours and comprises a total of 16 game rounds.&#10;&#10;Within the individual game rounds, the players continuously collect victory points for the successful execution of certain actions and for the possession of certain territories by their peoples. The winner of the game is the player who has scored the most victory points with his or her peoples at the end of game round 16.&#10;&#10;Roma aeterna is a game in the so-called Britannia style. So if you like games in this style, you will love Roma aeterna...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Chinese climbing game for five players is said to have originated in Shandong province, and in the early 21st century it has become popular across a wide area of northern China and online. B&#196;&#131;o hu&aacute;ng (&#228;&#191;&#157;&#231;&#154;&#135;) means 'protect the emperor', and the game is also often known as d&igrave;w&aacute;ng (&#229;&#184;&#157;&#231;&#142;&#139;) meaning 'emperor'. In each deal two players, the emperor and his protector the eunuch (xiao baozi: &#229;&#176;&#143;&#229;&#173;&#162;&#229;&#173;&#144;), play against a team of three, the farmers or people (ping min: &#229;&#185;&#179;&#230;&#176;&#145;). The emperor and the eunuch are the holders of particular cards. While the emperor is known from the start, his protector remains hidden until the card is played.&#10;&#10;As in all climbing games the object is to get rid of one's cards (and help one's partners to do so) by playing them singly or in combinations, where each play must beat the previous play.&#10;&#10;There are five players and a pack of 168 cards is used. This can be constructed from four standard 52-card packs from which the 3's, 4's and 5's are removed plus four red jokers and four black jokers. Suits are irrelevant in this game, and the cards rank from high to low:&#10;&#10;Red joker, Black joker, 2, A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.&#10;&#10;One red joker and one black joker are marked on the front, and the holders of these two cards will be the emperor and the eunuch respectively. Although standard Anglo-American cards can be used, the game is sufficiently popular that special 168-card packs can be obtained for this game with the emperor and eunuch cards ready printed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blue Steel Brewery is a &quot;roll and write&quot; game that puts the player in the seat of a manager, at a beer-making company. The goal is to take the initial capital and increase the size of the business by buying ingredients from the fluctuating market and producing various types of beers and ales to sell. Logistically, ales are a type of beer, but for the sake of the function of the game, they are separate.  The market prices are determined by dice rolls, which is the only use of dice. You, the player, then choose which ingredients to buy knowing which beer/ale to produce and the sale price of that beer or ale. There is also the company building, which graphically represents the &quot;company building.&quot; The player then uses the in-game coins to buy extra beer/ale producers and storage. Additionally, the storage aspect of the game allows beers/ales to gain monetary benefits by letting them ferment. The bulk of the end-game points tends to focus on the company building, so be wary. The company building is the layout of the objects you buy; a visual representation.&#10;&#10;",

The player takes the part of American infantry and armor pushing inland to take objectives, using a dice-roll action system that gives you a guaranteed number of actions each round, but not always of the exact type you need. A card-driven action system manages the Japanese defenders, including veteran units, machine-gun nests, pill boxes and even tanks. Victory is based on objectives and American Morale score, and game complications include lack of supplies and surprise Japanese reinforcements, so even on the edge of victory, it pays to be cautious. But with a time limit on every scenario, not too cautious. With five scenarios of increasing difficulty and complexity, Scream, Aim, Fire Pacific! is a challenge you will have to rise to and a challenger that is always ready for you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The players gain help from the various professions of the middle ages. Some of these, like peasants and bakers, help the players grow their populations. Some, like the monks and nuns, use wisdom and faith to avoid the plague, while the warfare conducted by the knights and soldiers spreads the plague to new areas. However, the plague does not make any distinction. When the rats arrive, no one can feel safe. Finally, the plague withdraws and the game ends.

We must succeed or die.&rdquo; &ndash;General Israel Tal&rsquo;s admonition to his officers before crossing the boundary into the Sinai.&#10;&#10;Succeed or Die is a low complexity Operational level wargame simulation of the battles of Rafah and El Arish, fought in the Sinai between the Egyptian Palestinian forces and elements of General Israel Tal&rsquo;s and Avraham Yoffi&rsquo;s armored Ugdahs (divisions) during the Six Day War.  General Tal&rsquo;s Ugdah was tasked with attacking the dug in Palestinian 7th Infantry Division in and around Rafah to secure the crucial road intersection near the Sinai/Israel border. Once secured, General Yoffi&rsquo;s Ugdah would become the breakthrough force that would then drive deep into the Sinai to either take the Mitla Pass if General Sharon&rsquo;s Ugdah was unable to defeat the Egyptians at Abu Ageila, or El Arish. General Tal would support General Yoffi by preventing any enemy attacks out of Gaza as well as taking El Arish if General Yoffi&rsquo;s goal became the Mitla Pass. The Egyptian&rsquo;s had powerful forces in the area, including their 4th Armored Division and a combined arms formation that combined outnumbered the attacking Israeli formations. The Israeli&rsquo;s enjoyed total air supremacy, but numbers were against them, and it would take all of the skill, daring and luck they could muster if the Israeli&rsquo;s were to succeed.&#10;&#10;Players are cast in the roles of the local commanders on this battlefield.  Both will be challenged to do as well, or better than their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Each hex is about a quarter of a mile across.  A turn represents four hours of time.

In Britain in particular, 'plant hunters' brought back bulbs, seeds and sometimes even seedlings of native species from Asia, Africa and the Americas, which were then propagated, crossbred and adapted to the cold climate by gardeners back home. This seemingly impossible project was supported by a flood of funding from patrons, mainly royalty, aristocrats and wealthy families.&#10;&#10;In Age of Flora, flowers are everything. You are a flower buyer, so you need to collect as many flowers as possible before your competitors do. The sooner you reach seven flowers in your possession, the sooner you will receive a contract to deliver them to the noblemen's mansions - which will naturally have magnificent gardens. However, you cannot buy all the flowers. The market is limited in size and the varieties that should be delivered to the 'Royal Gardens' are not easily accessible!&#10;&#10;In Age of Flora, players aim to collect 7 different flower saplings the fastest! However, if you wait too long for flowers to accumulate, the market may fill up go bust! Or the Royal family may swoop in an buy the flowers from under your nose.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever has the Judas card must make Jesus discover him before the other disciples.&#10;&#10;If Jesus finds Judas, Jesus and Judas win (the prophecy is fulfilled). If the disciples found Judas, the disciples win (and the prophecy is not fulfilled).&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

This story of expansion and decline is the inspiration for these wargames' rules.&#10;&#10;Designed for ease of play, Three Ages of Rome offers a player experience based on the commander&rsquo;s problems. The rules are designed to create a feel for the uncertainty of ancient battles. Most games should take 2-3 hours to play.  No rebasing required, can be played with all current basing styles and conventions.&#10;&#10;Keeping your men going, even when things don't seem too good, is critical for success. Units are likely to become progressively disabled and cohesion begins to suffer. If commanders don&rsquo;t take care to maintain cohesion, then they could be heading for disaster!&#10;&#10;The six historical battle scenarios span the Three Ages and provide different challenges. They offer players an insight into the nature of command in ancient warfare. The Terrain Generator and Scenario Generator allow the players to develop their own games. For competitive games, a system of points gives players all the information needed to exactly balance their forces.&#10;&#10;In battle nothing is certain but generals that practice their skills are more likely to be victorious.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
