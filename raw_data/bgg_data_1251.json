Eldarim Champions that match either element can affect them normally. Dragon Staffs and Dragonkin Champions of either element also affect them normally. Dragonkin of either matching element cannot be rolled when attacked by an Hybrid dragon. Hybrid Dragons fight all dragons (except pure ivory dragons and ivory hybrids with a matching elemental) that do not match their elements exactly. Elemental and White dragons fight all Hybrid Dragons.&#10;&#10;Ivory Hybrid Dragons:&#10;These dragons are hybrids of the elemental dragons and an ivory dragon. Composed of one element and ivory, they have that element in their very makeup, plus all the attributes of the ivory dragons. They generate breath against 5 health of the defending army  and the elemental army breath effect (if any) against the army. A Dragon Summoning spell of any element (reflecting their ivory nature) will summon them to a terrain. Eldarim Champions of a single element that matches the dragon&rsquo;s elemental can affect them normally. White Eldarim Champions affect them normally. Dragon Staffs and Dragonkin Champions of the same element as the dragon also affect them normally. Just like pure ivory dragons, dragonkin cannot be rolled when attacked by an Ivory Hybrid dragon. Like the pure ivory dragons, once summoned to a terrain, no ivory Dragon Summoning spell can move them. However, a Dragon Summoning spell of their element can move them. Ivory hybrid dragons, like pure ivory dragons, always attack the army at the terrain. However, they are attacked by all hybrid dragons that do not have a matching element. Elemental dragons not matching the ivory hybrid dragon&rsquo;s element and white dragons attack all ivory hybrid dragons.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Terror Town RPG is a simple solo game wherein all rules of gameplay are included in a single character sheet. In the game, the player takes the role of a person trapped in the evil Terror Town, a ghost town whose legend claims a corrupt mayor sacrificed the souls of his entire town in order to gain power and eternal life in a dark dimension of pure evil. Now, the town exists in three different worlds at once: Our World, Grey World, and Dark World. In our world, you will find weapons and other useful items. In Dark World, you will find twisted monsters out to kill you. In Grey World, you will find both. Can you survive the survival horror challenge of Terror Town? Will you escape the doomed town, defeat it&rsquo;s diabolical mayor, or just end up falling victim to it&rsquo;s many monsters? The answer awaits you... in Terror Town.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Despite its name, Terror Town RPG is not a role-playing game.  The procedural, solitaire game is played in a series of turns, each turn presenting a challenge to overcome.  If successful, a random die roll determines what the next turn will bring.  The player starts with two pools of points - Escape and Life - which vary during play.  Escape points are used to avoid certain situations; Life points are depleted by failure.  If Life ever reaches zero, the game is lost - otherwise the game ends in success when the player escapes Terror Town.&#10;&#10;The print-and-play game rules are presented in tiny typeface on a single page of paper; three pages of cut-out tokens also are provided.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "LES TROIS PORTAILS is a game of medium complexity, a wargame in which you are the hero! It allows you to relive the epic of the Land of Alhandra, more exactly, the invasion of the chaos it undergoes by opening 3 magic portals.&#10;&#10;With a 16-page booklet of illustrated rules and scenario add-ons, a system inspired by that of ARS BELLUM, but introducing characters, magic, objects, flyers and monsters, it is fully immersed in the Heroic-Fantasy world.&#10;&#10;The Land of Alhandra is made up of ancient races (men, greenhorns, dwarves, elves) who are experiencing the rebirth of the forces of Darkness, embodied by the Lich King Alach Zhur, and the invasion of chaos.&#10;&#10;The player delivers the battles of the scenarios on A4 cards (A3 later) that make up &quot;The Great Campaign&quot; (the story of the invasion of chaos).&#10;&#10;The game is played in pairs, one game lasts about 1 to 2 hours. You can choose to embody one side or the other (Darkness or Empire), or alternate roles. Each scenario is independent and constitutes a small battle, but it is also a stage in the story that is told to you.&#10;&#10;The units (leaders or combat units) have a movement and combat capability (possibly including firepower) and represent 500 to 1000 or 2000 men, a dozen or twenty monsters, an illustrious character or hero.&#10;&#10;The system is based on the initiative conquered by players following a die roll and the impact of leaders and/or other modifiers in the scenario. Scenario speed and ease of understanding are favored. The player starts with basic units, he enriches his pool as the scenario progresses with other units, additional spells and characters.&#10;&#10;In THE THREE PORTALS, the system is based on the skills of the units that bring the player's character or armies, and on the development of his main character or armies.&#10;&#10;The basic module of the game gives the essential rules and the scenarios are the preamble of the story; the extensions are groupings of scenarios around one or more new features (new race, new characters, additions of objects or various attributes).&#10;A general map in the basic module will be completed as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;Usually, extensions include 4 additional battles, a counter board, additional maps, items, spells, the author works on additional locations.&#10;&#10;The rulebook&#10;16 pages of illustrated rules, simple concepts and fun play system effectively allowing the simulation of historical dimension of battles.&#10; &mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Participez &agrave; une &eacute;pop&eacute;e fantastique sur la terre d'Alhandra !

The teammates select the clue difficulty they want, 1 point being easy, 2 points being medium, and 3 points being hard.&#10;&#10;The opposing team then has the opportunity to play a troll card or a trap card to add an extra layer of difficulty. Troll cards are played face up. They can make players do things like &ldquo;sing the clue in their best opera voice,&rdquo; &ldquo;read the clue while smiling through clenched teeth,&rdquo; &ldquo;read the clue in their best Australian accent&rdquo; &ldquo;read the clue with a mouthful of water&rdquo; or &ldquo;text the clue using only emojis&rdquo; to name just a few. Trap cards are played face down and revealed after the clue is read. They can make teams skip turns or lose points.&#10;&#10;If a troll card or trap card is played, the answering team has the opportunity to play defense with a trench card. Trench cards can negate troll and trap cards, award extra points or give extra turns.&#10;&#10;Once all troll, trap, or trench cards have been played for the round. The clue is read, hilarity ensues, points are awarded (or not) and then the next team draws their clue. The first team to 11 points wins!

And who is the mysterious plump man that appears to be following the group?&#10;&#10;Carcosa Rising includes a new Investigator class (the Dreamer), three alternative versions of locations from the basic game, an entire new location (Carcosa), three event tables for traveling, possible attacks from the Pallid Mask (who takes control of the body of Investigators gone Insane), and a final Encounter with the King in Yellow.&#10;&#10;This is a non-standalone expansion. Players can choose to add any combination of elements from Carcosa Rising to the base game, mixing and matching materials to ensure that no two games will be the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Set #4: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; of the Thinkers series of board games will allow children of primary school age to learn to draw logical conclusions in various non-standard situations. The skills obtained as a result of the game will not only increase social adaptability but also lay the foundation for further personal development. Most of the items on the cards in this set are short stories that tell the background of a fact. The players are asked to determine exactly why this or that consequence took place, and what was its cause. Here are just a few examples of the 100 tasks that players will have to solve in this set:&#10;&#10;- In which country are only men citizens?&#10;- In the English city of Bradford, there is the only farm in the world where samples of woolen fabrics are delivered from all UK textile factories. Who is bred on this farm?&#10;&ldquo;What is the use of a tape recorder of a tiger's growl at Bombay Airport?&#10;- In the American state of Arizona, they began to protect the desert from thieves. They steal something without which the desert is threatened with desolation and devastation. what is taken out of the desert?&#10;- Walter Scott said: &quot;Both the crystal and the heart would not be so valuable if ...&quot;&#10;&#10;Any number of participants can play the Thinkers board game, but if there are a large number of players, it would be advisable to split into teams. The teams, in turn, take one card with the task, which indicates the topic, difficulty, i.e. the number of victory points, and the task itself. After that, all team members jointly begin the discussion. The complexity of the tasks varies from one to five points, so the developer recommends to allot from 3 to 15 minutes to find solutions, respectively. The team can check the correctness of its answer on the reverse side of the card, then move on to the next team. At the request of the participants, the game can last for a certain time or end immediately after one of the teams scores a predetermined number of points.&#10;&#10;",

Maybe you just need to liberate the participants of your corporate team building?&#10;&#10;With the board game Gradus, you will not only diversify your fun but also get an unforgettable sensation and experience with a touch of the piquancy of adult competition. But what can I say: the roof will blow away completely from jokes, gags, eroticism, and alcohol. Everyone will play the board game Gradus because you simply won't be able to get out!&#10;&#10;Hit the table with a Degree!&#10;Before the start, all players receive tablets, presented by the designer in the form of beer mugs, and tokens with the volume of alcohol consumed to record their achievements in conventional alcoholic drinks. Do you want to be limited to conventional alcohol and liters? Prepare thoroughly: a few bottles of pleasure and a good snack will not be superfluous. Companies of teetotalers can simply eat well and drink tea.&#10;&#10;The set includes 6 decks of cards with different themes:&#10;Basic - it is also basic and participates in all mixes;&#10;Alkotresh - the name speaks for itself, so the tasks are tied to the &quot;alcohol&quot; part;&#10;Move your body - tasks from this deck will crush your bodies sitting at the table;&#10;Tin - the special coolness of the tasks will blow anyone's mind;&#10;Spicy - a little eroticism will not hurt;&#10;Brain ON - don't want to move your body - move your brains. Components of the game Degree&#10;&#10;It is recommended to use no more than three task decks in one game party, shuffling two more decks from the base one if desired. A menu with a standard section and a part of wishes is also available for players.&#10;&#10;The goal of each player is to reach the liter or two-liter value on their tablet by drinking or drinking points. Points are awarded after completing a specific task.&#10;&#10;So, you are in an entertainment establishment, and just burn with the desire to drink! Wait for your turn and, in the clockwise direction, make a move: take a card from the general deck and announce your task to all participants. If you successfully complete the task, you will receive a point by noting the amount taken internally on the tablet. Please note that if you refuse to fulfill the conditions, then you drink a free &quot;penalty&quot; for which points are not awarded.&#10;&#10;During the game, you can use the menu once and drink your points to order any dish for another participant. The standard section is available at any time during the game, and the Wish Menu is available after completing the task. If the victim of your choice did not complete the task, then, like all losers, he drinks a &quot;penalty&quot;, while receiving the right to use the Menu for free.&#10;&#10;The board game Degree can be adapted to suit any company by using suitable decks, making some decks suitable for families as well.&#10;&#10;",

He stumbled upon a mysterious board game they used to train their children. Once the hacker reconstructed the abstract game, he revealed an ingenious system for learning various life concepts. The people who played &amp; learned through this framework became wiser, stronger, and more capable, helping the nation become the most powerful on Earth. Nowadays, this &quot;game&quot; is known simply as GEMJI.&nbsp;The hacker changed the future once, and now it's your turn.&nbsp;Game on!&#10;&#10;GEMJI is a modular game system made of 70 double-sided magnetic tiles that give you the freedom to play multiple games. Games include original titles developed by the GEMJI team, educational games, and popular classic game adaptations.&#10;&#10;Just like a standard deck of cards, the GEMJI System offers multiple games in one set. The big difference is that GEMJI could be used in many more situations and combinations, which means MORE games! The magnetic grid, the double-face tactile interface, the unique design language, and 3D build options make GEMJI unbeatable.&#10;&#10;Over 30 pre-made games exist currently, and more will continuously be added.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Once the words have been built, players drop the words on their sheet. The first word will still make sense, but then things get GRBLD!&#10;&#10;Players score by filling rows, marking off the alphabet, filling a &quot;combo bar&quot; by placing vowels in the correct spaces, and stacking the same consonants on each other. Via the combo bar, players unlock great powers to use, such as the &quot;letterbomb&quot; and the ability to use both letters on a card or even to make two words in a round.&#10;&#10;By using various powers, players get to experience satisfying explosive turns in which they rack up both words and points. However, peak too early and risk running out of space for your words; peak too late, and risk not being able to make optimal use of your powers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This expansion for The Thing - The Boardgame allows you to experience the events that happened at Thule Station, the Norwegian station where it all began! As for the 1982 version, the expansion lets you relive the tensest moments from the story, transporting you into the cinematic film!&#10;&#10;The core element of the game is based on the emulation properties of the Thing, which will hide its identity under a blanket of fake humanity, but with substantial differences in the way they interact with the game and with your feelings.&#10;&#10;Here are the key points of the expansion:&#10;&#10;     A new board, new characters, and new materials.&#10;     A new end game condition represented by the escape of the dog that will arrive at Outpost 31. IF this happens, you can play your next game of the 1982 version with a pack leader dog (a dog that behaves differently throughout the game).&#10;     A new element in the game: teeth! The Thule Station crew discovers that the Alien cannot assimilate and duplicate metal parts, so dental fillings become a way to find out if a person is definitely human, but not if they are alien. The test with the wire and the flamethrower disappears and flashlights are added with which it will be possible to carry out a test and look at the teeth of the other characters, checking for the presence or lack of fillings.&#10;     A new location is available for the Thing: The UFO! It represents the last hope of escape for the Thing, as in the movie. The final confrontation with any remaining humans will take place here. Of course, this is only an option, and just like the dog escape mentioned above, it doesn't necessarily happen! Everything will depend on your behavior, as you can win or lose in many ways!&#10;&#10;&#10;In the 2011 film, as soon as they found out what's going on, people's behavior becomes more selfish, trying by all means to save their own lives. We therefore decided to try to include the possibility of a solitary escape, an element that will bring the level of distrust to the maximum! This also brings new mechanics, such as the ability to voluntarily sabotage vehicles even if you are human.&#10; The expansion will contain: a new board, new characters, new cards and new tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the traditional, diagonal form of Checkers, pieces are restricted to playing on a single color of the checkerboard. Thus it is possible to play two games simultaneously on the same board. The first game is played on the Dark squares, and the second game on the Light squares.&#10;&#10;Also, the conventional way of playing two games simultaneously is that the player makes a move in the first game, then another move in the second game. However, in 'Persephone' the player picks between either of the two games in which he wants to move a piece. Captures still take precedence over any other move. So a player is forced to make a capture on a particular side of the board if possible.&#10;&#10;A player wins when he manages to capture all of his opponents pieces that are on the same color of the checkerboard - either all the Light pieces or all the Dark pieces. With two games at once, the chances of a draw are greatly reduced. If one of the games is undecided, the other game can still be resolved for the win.&#10;&#10;The two sides are Iron and Gold. Instead of pieces being referred to as Men and Kings, they are known as Maidens and Queens.&#10;&#10;Other than this, the game follows the rules of Spanish Checkers. This is played very much like Anglo-American Checkers, the main difference is that the Queen has a more substantial move along any number of vacant squares, including ones beyond a captured piece. Captures are mandatory. If a player has a choice of captures he must take the greater number of pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Can you and your fellow investigators survive being caught in the middle of this war, or will our world be torn asunder?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But a bug in the patch caused a frantic side effect: in the pursuit of being harder, better, faster, and stronger, robots are now smashing smaller ones and even creating new problems.&#10;&#10;With a length of approximately 30 minutes, the game is played in alternate turns. Players control 4 different robots to execute actions and collect resources, fixing problems, or robots that were smashed by the opponent. The first crew to clear their workshop, fixing all problems, and lining up all its robots in the Production Line of the factory wins the game.&#10;&#10;Turns are simple and divided into three phases: In the first, robots in the workshop charge up; in the second, a single robot is called up to activate its quadrant in the Production Line, generating resources to fix problems and other robots. In the last phase, the available robots can be lined up in quadrants of the Production Line for later activation.&#10;&#10;Although robots can block quadrants from the Production Line by their presence there, bigger robots can smash them out, sending their pieces to their workshops to be fixed.&#10;&#10;As problems are fixed and players get closer to winning, combos are forged, and in a blink of an eye, your opponent can take you from certain victory to an &ldquo;hasta la vista&rdquo; defeat.&#10;&#10;How to end the game? The first player to finish his turn with his office empty, solving all problems and allocating all robots on the production line, wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each game in the system is based on one of the major battles of the 30 Years War. Each battle has its own map, special rules and counters representing the military formations which participated in the original action. The rules model the overall effects of the weapons and tactics of the great era of pike and shot, and include combat, leadership and morale. Players command armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, each with their own special capabilities, as well as the great leaders who took the field in this era. Each hex on the map represents 150-200 meters. Each game turn (GT) represents 45 minutes to one hour. Most cavalry and infantry units represent one or two regiments or battalions. Each combat strength point represents 75 to 150 men, depending on the quality of the army and assignment of light guns to the unit. Each artillery unit represents four to six heavy or medium guns.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters.&#10;&#10;S&amp;T #332 Nov-Dec 2021&#10;&#10;",
