A &quot;turn&quot; took place over about a one-month period - players submitted by post written turns using a semi-standard format (freeform actions and explanatory notes were allowed); the results were published in the next monthly issue of Lokasenna.&#10;&#10;Player personas started from a base template and then were customized by spending points from a pool to gain benefits - increased characteristics, weapon or shield skills, combat skills, or armor.  Once a persona was created it was placed into the combat arena and beneficial changes thereafter were quite limited - harmful changes resulted from combat.&#10;&#10;Written player orders consisted of a movement action and a combat action - a variety of each were available.  The game referee received all written orders and then determined outcomes.  Some outcomes were determined by game rules; other outcomes were adjudicated by the referee.&#10;&#10;Cearnage rules were published in Lokasenna (Issue 9 - Nov 1983) and play turns appeared from that time forward.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The marshal had time to send a message indicating his desire to attempt an exit if a rescue army arrived. But since then, there has been no news. To break the encirclement, Mac Mahon, at the head of the army of Ch&acirc;lons, receives the formal order from the government to rush at Metz to liberate its brothers in arms. The army of Ch&acirc;lons, composed of disparate elements (troops from Africa stand alongside the mobile guards of the Seine), must remain grouped and must move quickly to avoid being taken at the flank by the German troops. The Germans, commanded by Moltke himself, still believe the French to be at Paris, covering the capital. But the city of light is not his objective for the moment. His goal: the destruction of the French regular armed forces in a decisive battle.&#10;&#10;Through &quot;Sedan 1870&quot;, the evolution of the &quot;Marshals of the 2nd Empire&quot; campaign series, will you be able, like Mac Mahon, to cross the Meuse in time and go to the rescue of Bazaine&rsquo;s army ?

    "Description": "Seven Weeks War 1866 (and the 3d Italian Risorgimento) is an independent Age of Valor (AOV) expansion chapter or mini-module for Age of Eagles II, also known as Napoleonic Fire &amp; Fury. As such AOE II is needed to properly play this game. In most cases all rule changes have been imbedded in the Data Charts as well as the charts and tables on the Quick Reference Sheet. All players need to do is use these new specifications or DRMs with the original rules, then play as normal. Any changes unique to the Seven Weeks War and the 3rd Italian War of Independence, the subjects of this expansion set, are included for both the conflict overall, and the included battles of Trautenau, Problus, Kissingen and Custoza scenarios.&#10;&#10;The AOV product line is sold direct thru digital distribution, though hardcopy versions are available from certain retailers. It is 36 pages long. Kindle formatted products are sold exclusively thru Amazon, while digital downloads exportable to PDF format may be purchased via Google Play.&#10;&#10;Online, public research portal for this game and its historical period (to include flags for miniatures, official histories, Public Domain military maps, images and publications - all copyright friendly and FREE to download) at https://tinyurl.com/AOV-1866-SWW-Reference-Portal.&#10;&#10;-description from the designer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Motorsport is a deck building game for 1-4 players that captures the frenzy of automotive competition.&#10;&#10;You will compete against your fellow drivers to build the most competitive car, as quickly as possible. The goal is to win Events, such as drag races, car shows, drift competitions, autocrosses, and circuit races. The first player to win enough Events to claim seven Trophy Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;You play with a personal deck which you will add to and expand as the game progresses. Your deck starts pretty weak, but each card you add to it will make it stronger! You will build your deck the same way you would build a car: by deciding what your goal is and purchasing Mods that support that goal.&#10;&#10;The gameplay in Motorsport revolves around four Upgrade Types: Speed, Style, Handling, and Traction. Vehicles have stats for each Type, Mods belong to and support specific Types, and the winner of Events is determined by Vehicle Upgrade Type stats. You can choose which of the four Types you want to focus on, depending on your play style!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The operational plan, which mobilizes 20,000 soldiers, is the responsibility of the XV Mountain Corps as well as the air forces. The first phase of the raid is led by airborne troops (paratroopers and gliders), the SS-fallschirmj&auml;ger battalion 500, a sort of disciplinary battalion. The second phase notably involved the 7th SS Prinz Eugen division, the Brandenburg regiment and its Chetnik subordinates, several reconnaissance Kampfgruppe as well as Croatian forces.&#10;&#10;&quot;Operation R&ouml;sselsprung 1944&quot; is a solitaire tactical wargame appearing in the French Vae Victis magazine #151 (special game edition). The game is edited under ziplock and contains an A3-size map depicting Drvar (in Bosnia-Herzegovinia) and surroundings, 108 counters (25 counters representing the SS-fallschirmj&auml;ger bataillion 500 &ndash;- and 54 counters for the communist partisans). The rules are included in a separate 16 pages A5-sized booklet.&#10;&#10;The systems uses the improved rules of the &quot;Bruneval 1942&quot; (VaeVictis #104) and &quot;Commando 4 in action: Dieppe 1942&quot; (VaeVictis #131) to simulate the airborne phase of the operation.&#10;&#10;This game system developed for the &quot;Raids&quot; series is only playable in solo ; very easy to learn and fun to play ! The &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; automatically manages Yugoslav actions while the player is in charge of German actions.&#10;&#10;The map is point-to-point, one to several hundred meters apart. A game turn is equivalent to 2 hours during the day and 5 hours at night, the scenario begins at 6:00 am on May 25, 1944 and ends at 12:00 am on May 26, that is 12 game turns. One counter represents a full strenght, 35 to 40 German paratroopers, a company of 20 to 100 Yugoslav partisans, an officer, two anti-aircraft machine guns, or two Italian tanks L3-35.&#10;&#10;Would you be smart enough to capture Tito, maximize the prizes and minimize your losses ? It&rsquo;s up to you Captain !&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game Objective &ndash; Players choose Kaiju and battle each other in an all-out melee till one player has defeated all of the other player&rsquo;s Kaiju and is declared The King of the Monsters!&#10;&#10;Starting the Game &ndash; Taking turns, one at a time each player chooses one Battle Kaiju for their team till all players have a total of 3 Battle Kaiju chosen.&#10;&bull;    One at a time each player chooses a section of the game board. Place them together to form a (4-part, section) game board.&#10;&bull;    Players start at opposite ends of the board with their characters spaced apart.&#10;&bull;    Play rock, paper, and scissors to decide which player goes first. Game play then continues with the player to the left.&#10;&bull;    Shuffle and place face down off to the side of the board within reach of all players the Kaiju Assist Cards. &#10;o    Each player may draw 1 card and keep it hidden from all other players. &#10;&bull;    Each player takes 3 Rampage Counter Cards and places them next to their kaiju. &#10;&bull;    Place 2 Military Vehicles on the game board in the designated areas. Refer to Military Vehicles below for placement/respawn info.&#10;&bull;    If you have a kaiju that can either fly or burrow, take a Burrowing &amp; Flying Counter Card for each kaiju.&#10;&#10;Game Round &ndash; After each player has had all of their kaiju go, a round has passed. &#10;&bull;    During a turn, each player&rsquo;s kaiju goes. Players may choose to do nothing with a kaiju on their turn if they wish to not move it or do a battle.&#10;&#10;What to do during your Turn&#10;At the start of a player&rsquo;s turn, they must announce which one of the following actions they are going to do to start their turn for that particular kaiju.&#10;&#10;Battle &ndash; Each player rolls 2 dice and the highest die roll wins. The defender wins ties.&#10;&bull;    Each Battle Kaiju Card and some select Kaiju Assist Cards have a Wound Counter on them to keep track of when a Kaiju receives a hit. &#10;&bull;    Once a player&rsquo;s Battle Kaiju receives a KO, that Kaiju is no longer in play. Remove that Kaiju from the board and flip over its Kaiju Battle Card. &#10;o    Kaiju Assist Cards: Some require being defeated. Once defeated, follow the same rules as above for Kaiju Battle Cards.&#10;&#10;Grab/Throw &ndash; Grab a Building/Vehicle; roll 4+. To throw a grabbed object; roll the die, the die amount rolled is the x number of spaces you may throw that object. &#10;&bull;    Destroying Buildings &amp; Bridges: They are destroyed when a player&rsquo;s Kaiju attacks them.  Attacked Buildings/Bridges are destroyed on a die roll of 4+.&#10;&bull;    Once a Building/Vehicle or Bridge has been attacked or used as a ranged attack they are no longer in that space and are considered destroyed. Place a game logo chip on that space.&#10;Hint: Use objects as ranged attack against other player&rsquo;s Kaiju. A player&rsquo;s Kaiju takes a hit from a building on a die roll of 3+ and a hit from a vehicle on a die roll of 5+.&#10;&#10;Melee Attack (Punch/Kick) &ndash; A standard attack against another player&rsquo;s Kaiju. Refer to Battle for info.&#10;&#10;Kaiju Battle Card Special Ability &ndash; An attack unique to that Kaiju that can be done against another player&rsquo;s Kaiju.&#10;&bull;    Range Attack Ability: Some characters can perform range attacks. These characters can aim at an opponent&rsquo;s Kaiju that are in line of sight.&#10;o    Line of Sight is an imaginary line drawn from the center of one Kaiju&rsquo;s head to the center of another Kaiju&rsquo;s head. If any part of the imaginary line touches or crosses a Kaiju or a building, the Line of Sight is blocked.&#10;&bull;    Kaiju must wait x number of rounds before they can regain their range ability back; depending on distance they used their attack.&#10;o    Each Kaiju who can perform a Range Attack has a Range Ability Counter on their card to help players keep track of when their Kaiju can perform the ability again.&#10;&#10;Movement &ndash; Roll the die and see how many spaces you can move a particular Kaiju. This action can be combined with any of the above on a player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&bull;    Players can either use regular movement or burrow/fly movement on the board and then either do battle, grab/throw or a range attack.&#10;&#10;Sharing Spaces &ndash; Only a player&rsquo;s Kaiju may share a space with one other Kaiju they are using at a time. Other players Kaiju may not move onto space with another player&rsquo;s Kaiju.&#10;&bull;    Tails &amp; Wings: Some Kaiju figures have tails/wings that extend into an adjacent square. The Kaiju is NOT considered to be in the square which its tail/wings occupy. If another Kaiju moves into the tail/wings occupied space, either move it off the side to make room or turn the Kaiju figure in the opposite facing direction.&#10;&#10;Military Vehicles &ndash; These vehicles are sent to defend the city against Kaiju. They seek out the nearest Kaiju and battle them.&#10;&bull;    During setup, place only 2 Military Vehicles on the game board two spaces away from the middle and facing opposite ends of the board.&#10;o    There will only ever be 4 Military Vehicles on the board at once.&#10;&bull;    During a player&rsquo;s offensive turn, the other player or players (defense) move the Military Vehicles. Any time a Kaiju moves visible to a Military Vehicle, that Military Vehicle will move two spaces towards that Kaiju. Buildings and other Kaiju block Military Line of Sight.&#10;o    If the Kaiju moves out of view of a Military Vehicle, that Vehicle will not continue to pursue the Kaiju.&#10;&bull;    Military Vehicle Firing (attack) distance: May fire (attack) any Kaiju from a distance of 3 spaces away; long as they are in line of sight.&#10;&bull;    Destroying Military Vehicles: They get hit by a Kaiju&rsquo;s Melee/Ranged Attack, including Thrown Objects or a Kaiju enters the same Space they are in.&#10;o    Military Vehicles will spawn at beginning of every round (unless the max number is already on the board) at one of the game setup locations. Player(s) who destroyed a vehicle the previous round or have the fewer number of kaiju on the board will be the one to place a vehicle on the board.&#10;Hint: Use Military Vehicles as projectiles against other player&rsquo;s Kaiju. A player&rsquo;s Kaiju takes a hit from a Military Vehicle on a die roll of 5+.&#10;&#10;Kaiju Assist Cards &ndash; Players can only have 1 Kaiju Assist Card at a time. It can be played at any time, depending on what is written on the card. &#10;&bull;    After a Kaiju Assist Card has been played or is no longer in play, place it in a discard pile. Once all of the cards have been used, shuffle the cards and place them face down like at the start of the game.&#10;&bull;    If a player draws a Kaiju Assist Card that they do not wish to use or hold on to, they can discard it at the end of their turn. At the start of the next round and it is their turn, they will draw a new card like normal.&#10;&#10;Rampage Mode &ndash; As a player&rsquo;s Kaiju wins offensive battles, its Rampage Counter will go up 1 level. After Winning 5 Battles that player&rsquo;s Kaiju will reach Max Rampage Level. &#10;&bull;    On your next turn (or any other offensive turn) go on a Total Rampage against the opponent's Kaiju! &#10;&bull;    You have 3 Battle Energy to use within your kaiju&rsquo;s Rampage. A standard Battle (Punch/Kick) is worth: 1 Battle Energy and ability off your Kaiju's Battle Card is worth: 2 Battle Energy.&#10;&bull;    Each player has a Rampage Counter Card next to their Kaiju Battle Card to help you keep track of your Kaiju&rsquo;s Rampage level.&#10;&#10;Burrowing &amp; Flying Kaiju Special Abilities &ndash; Some Kaiju have the unique special ability to be able to either burrow or fly. When a player uses this Kaiju&rsquo;s ability, they can ignore Buildings or Bridges that may be in there way.&#10;&bull;    At the start of the player&rsquo;s turn, they must announce which Kaiju they&rsquo;re going to use and if they&rsquo;re going to use the Burring &amp; Flying ability prior to rolling the die for movement.&#10;&bull;    Kaiju cannot end their turn under or top of bridges, buildings or water spaces. A player may end either turn on the same space an ally kaiju only.&#10;&bull;    In addition, a player&rsquo;s Kaiju can do pass through another player&rsquo;s kaiju that is in a space.&#10;o    This ability cannot be used during Capture the Flag scenario.&#10;&bull;    Player&rsquo;s will keep track of when they can use this special ability by using the Burrowing &amp; Flying Counter Card. A player&rsquo;s kaiju will need to wait up to 6 rounds (depending on the x-number of spaces traveled) before using this special ability again.&#10;&#10;Water Spaces &ndash; If a Kaiju is passing through water spaces -1 is subtracted from their die movement. Kaiju using the flying ability can ignore this rule.&#10;&#10;Military Vehicles, Kaiju Assist Cards and Rampage Mode are all extra optional game features to Godzilla Rampage: Kaiju Unleashed.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to prepare a foothold into an uncharted territory and sustain your war effort. Find and defeat the Prince of Despair, his majesty, the Worm Emperor, by breaking the three magic seals which protect his fortress and challenge him to a deadly duel.&#10;&#10;Lured by the promise of earthly riches and eternal knowledge in an uncharted region of the realm, the party of Heroes must battle chimeric creatures, flesh and dark thoughts mingled together by magic and molded into fierce monsters born from the depths of a dreadful mind, complete trials which will reveal the very fabric of their soul, fight, scavenge, loot and trade to survive the journey and ultimately face the abominable overlord, the Master of Lies and Prince of Despair, his majesty, the Worm Emperor. &#10;&#10;Replayability : The core of the game is entirely player driven. Heroes decide (individually or as a group) where the game is heading, from fighting an epic monster down to trading and building new dwellings in the castle they settled in. Many paths lead to victory.&#10;&#10; Automa System:  You move, his majesty, the Worm Emperor and his acolytes are moving as well. The enemy army is already on the march to conquer the regions and consolidate the domain of despair. Sooner or later, your armies will meet.&#10;&#10;Castles and Outposts: A game within a game. You may start the adventure from any sub-region on the outskirts of the adventure map. Once settled in, you can build new dwellings, trade in the market for items, recruit creatures, complete puzzles and more.&#10;&#10;Unique Adventure Map: Divided into three major regions and a fourth special inner region (controlled by the Worm Emperor) and counting more than 65 independent sub-regions the party of Heroes will have the freedom to explore a uniquely designed map with one-of-a-kind characteristics. Conquer cities, acquire resources, uncover mysteries and secret locations.&#10;&#10;Modular Battlefield: Constantly changing its configuration depending on the sub-region you are exploring. The setup is randomly created each time your party clashes with a monster or a group of monsters. Terrain obstacles, power-up spots or de-buffs areas will hinder you or help you win the day.&#10;&#10;---description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Originally it was Time, a tumult of uncontrollable energies, then Space, an infinite fabric in search of a foothold, then Matter arrived as a parasite ready to infest the rules of the Game. Finally she came, blossomed by a tear of light, which gave rise to all living beings, now she has been imprisoned by her power-hungry children and you will have to free her. ETEREA princess has been chained to the heart of the first world, her children, custodians of the six dimensions , they overturned the throne determined to master the fundamental principles to be able to reign over the entire universe. What was once a thriving planet is now a distant memory, that place where life was born has died out, the Vital Essences, now lost, they no longer generate beings and the thread that binds all the galaxies is corroded and close to splitting. The last hope is a handful of Architects, faithful heralds of the princess, designers of all perceptible dimensions and im palpable. Only they will have the ardor to undertake a mission to the limit of the impossible to try to subjugate the six tyrants, take their keys and free ETEREA from an unacceptable fate; if they fail, everything will be lost, the universe, as we know it, will cease to exist giving way to despair, chaos, ruin.&#10;&#10;In ETEREA you are one of the architects who will attempt the enterprise to recover the keys, guarded by the six Bosses who govern the six dimensions: Water, Fire, Wind, Earth, Cosmos and Oblivion, to free the princess and save the whole ETEREA is a game divided into two parts: in the first you will have to wander through the six dimensions trying to reconstruct the Requirements, now swept away by the tyrants, to repopulate them; doing this will allow you to acquire Requirement cards and Artifacts, which are essential to succeed in the mission; to create the Requirements you will need careful planning in the dice roll and a careful use of certain skills or Vocations. In the second part you will have to face the Bosses and recover the keys, in doing so you will have to build your dice set , thanks to what I learned in the first part, and launch yourself in a desperate attempt to defeat them in an unequal duel, but thanks to a careful strategy, nothing will be impossible. There is more, always keep an eye on the time that passes , you will only have eighteen hours, a single day on ETEREA, then everything will be lost. Only an Architect will be able to succeed in the heroic action, but everyone will be able to perish in battle leading everything known to ruin. Good luck, that the glow of ETEREA accompany you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One morning, at the very edge of the winter solstice's arrival, all of this changed.&#10;&#10;Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare, the sequel to Antsy Labs' Storm the Gate, is a frantic tabletop dexterity game in which you must rapidly move your army of heroes into your opponent's battle camp.&#10;&#10;Introducing more depth than its predecessor, Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare offers players the choice between two factions and six heroes - each hero belonging to a class with its own unique abilities and token dimensions.&#10;&#10;You win the game by clearing all tokens from your camp before your opponent can do the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The players can challenge each other, as well as the sheriff, to the Mexican standoff. After a duel, only one player is left standing, and this player takes several tricks at the same time. The player who fights a duel at the most appropriate time and collects the largest points &mdash; as well as the highest number of special bandit cards &mdash; will be the final one standing when the game ends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description of publisher&#10;&#10;",
