    "Description": "Each player is randomly dealt a set of &quot;Curios&quot; of categories: Vintage, Games, Etc, Electronics, Sports and Collectibles. Once you win an auction of the items that match each of your Curio cards you win the game. Item cards represent the items you can find for sale on the eBay website. During the game Item Cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder. There are 2 types of Bidding Cards: Money Cards and Action Cards.&#10;&#10;First the Curio Cards are dealt according to the number of players ... 3 or 4 players = 5 Curio Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 4 Curio Cards each. Second the Item Cards are dealt face up in a row ... 3 or 4 players = 4 Item Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 5 Item Cards each. Third, each player is dealt 5 Bidding Cards. One D6 die is then placed on each Item Card matching the number showing on the die to the Number of Rounds field on the item. Finally, each player rolls a die. The highest roll receives the &quot;Starter&quot; Card and goes first.&#10;&#10;One complete round of play consists of one turn per player and an Auction Update Phase. During each player's turn, they may perform any or all of the following actions in any order: 1) Draw hand back up to 5 Bidding Cards, 2) Discard one Item Card won on a previous turn to draw 3 Bidding Cards, 3) Either 3a) Play 1 Action Card and/or place 1 bid on an item, 3b) In lieu of placing a bid and/or playing an Action Card, you may discard as many Bidding Cards as you like. You redraw at the beginning of your next turn.&#10;&#10;When each player has taken a turn, The &quot;Starter&quot; Card passes to the left.  After this, starting with the first Item Card, the die on each Item Card is lowered by one. When a die reaches zero, the auction is finished and all bids are revealed. Players may, at this point, play Action Cards which are allowed during this phase.&#10;&#10;Action cards: Know Your Enemy, Bad Money Order, Tastes Change, Mass Amnesia, Offshore Financing, Lost Connection&#10;&#10;Cards played during Auction Update Phase: Expensive Shipping, Reserve Price, Bad Feedback&#10;&#10;You can change the length of the game by adding or subtracting the number of Curio Cards available.&#10;&#10;(Most of the above was taken directly out of the rules sheet that comes with the game. Personal note: Some of the Item Card titles and flavor text is pretty funny and some are just plain &quot;cute&quot;.)&#10;&#10;",

Strategy, maths, probability and bluffing combine to make this a game unlike any other.&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;Each wizard holds nine spell cards numbered from one to nine. As our wizards are more &quot;Greedy&quot; than &quot;Gandalf&quot;, their spell-casting abilities leave a little to be desired -  making their spells a little on the unusual side. The game's incantations include things like summoning an &ldquo;absolutely massive chicken&rdquo; or &ldquo;a woman who shouts hurricanes.&#10;&#10;Players take it in turns to secretly select and then lay three spell cards face down, either side of a duel token. This is repeated until each wizard has played all nine of the cards they hold. Duels are resolved by adding up the total value of cards - with the wizard with the highest winning that particular scrap. Win two duels out of three and a piece of cake becomes theirs.&#10;&#10;However, three pieces of cake are needed to win the game - and because our Wizards are Greedy, they value cake over spells. Winning a piece of cake means discarding a spell card. And as the cake cards are double-sided, the opposing wizard can see exactly when they are being played. When cake is in play, the game becomes one of strategy, bluffing and probability - do you have what it takes to get your cake and eat it?&#10;&#10;Beautifully illustrated, easy to learn yet full of decisions and intrigue, it&rsquo;s a game which can be enjoyed by any level of player. As long as they are greedy.&#10;&#10;",

After the last road tile is placed a rectangular U-turn tile sends the cars back in the opposite direction over the laid out course.

Each player owns a ship.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds in two phases. &#10;In the first phase the object is to trade and acquire wealth as quickly as possible. To that purpose, each player sails from harbour to harbour: in a harbour a commodity can be bought [wheat  - gold - wood - cloth - wool - fruit] &ndash; in some harbours no goods can be bought.&#10;Sailing can be short distance &ndash; form harbour to harbour which are connected by dotted lines or long distance using a &ldquo;Long Course&rdquo; card.&#10;Selling goods can take place in any harbour &ndash; player rolls the dice which determines which good can be sold &ndash; always at three times the cost.&#10;Using a &ldquo;Storm&rdquo; card a player can organise a storm in one of the six areas forcing the ships in that area to leave behind their goods in the harbour &ndash; available for the next ship that visits the harbour.&#10;The ships will return again using the dice as this determines to which area the ship will return &ndash; player can choose the harbour.&#10;When 2 ships are going to the same harbour the 2 captains need to fight each other using &ldquo;Squabble&rdquo; cards damaging the opponent more and more [pretty funny descriptions]. The loser of the fight looses his money.&#10;However, cards played do NOT return so there&rsquo;s limited supply. And you will definitely need some of these later in the game.&#10;&#10;The second phase starts as soon as a player is rich enough to acquire the corsair ship &ndash; the corsair ship is auctioned with a minimum cost. The player will then try to eliminate all of his or her adversaries. The dice decides in which area the Corsair ship starts. On the turn of the player &ldquo;owning&rdquo; the Corsair ship he can sail 3 steps &ndash; as opposed to the other players who can only sail to the next harbour. The &ldquo;Long Course&rdquo; cards are very valuable now.&#10;When the Corsair ship catches a player&rsquo;s ship that&rsquo;s the end of it: goods return to the bank and the owner of the Corsair gets the money. The Corsair ship has done its job and returns to the bank &ndash; available for another player to buy it.&#10;The Corsair ship is sensitive to the &ldquo;Storm&rdquo; cards and will sink.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one remaining player.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple, but the characters are limited in what he/she can do each turn. Also all eliminated players have to wait until there&rsquo;s a winner and are no longer participating in the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the year of our Lord 1603. The Uskok Warlord Radoslav died during the last Venetian raid. All the Uskok leaders, including you, were invited to Nehaj, the unconquerable Uskok fortress, in order to choose their next Warlord.&#10;&#10;Dark storm clouds loomed over the stone fortress, its walls battered by the bitter nothern gales, and yet the Uskok leaders could not come to an agreement. Mighty warriors though they were, none of them had proved to be enough to their comrades, so no Warlord had been chosen. As midnight struck, the debate was cut short by a shot from a flintlock. The hall went silent. The old sea dog Stipe spoke: &quot;According to ancient customs, if no agreement is reached by midnight, the title of Warlord shall go to the first lord who collects enough loot to fill twenty-five Uskok vessels.&quot; So it was written, and so it was done.&#10;&#10;Uskoci were a historical pirate band in the 16th century who lived and prospered by being a nuisance for much more powerful opponents, but never on such a scale to provoke full-scale retaliation. Uskoci: The card game of Croatian pirates takes that idea of heart as players need to demonstrate both their skill as a pirate and restraint comparable to the historical Uskoci to prove the best captain among your peers.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, players must combine treasures (valued 1-9) on their pile until they total exactly 25; what makes this difficult are the 14 event cards (Venetians, traitors, storms) that can mess with a player's plans or change the value of a treasure, but thankfully they can also protect you. The more complex game adds card drafting to the mix, with the player who has the least treasure on the table drafting the most cards.&#10;&#10;The rules in both games are for 3-6 players, with modifications that allow two players to go head-to-head.&#10;&#10;",

If the ball handler is playing with a defender, the opponent should contrast it with a forward card, likewise, if a midfielder is playing, the opponent should also play with a midfielder. &#10;The ball handler should always pass the ball to a player in a more forward, adjacent section. Only one back-pass is allowed during each action.&#10;If the player still has the ball after playing an attack card, he may attempt to score a goal. Roll as many dice as the value of the bonuses accumulated during the action, minus the value for the goalkeeper.&#10;Some special cards may be used to have an extra benefit in some cases.&#10;&#10;Rules are in Italian, English and German languages.&#10;sandrindavide@yahoo.it for info&#10;&#10;",

Feeling helpless as the dragon moves closer and curls his tail behind them, the survivors tremble.

At that moment, the bravest of the group yells, &quot;Run!&quot;&#10;&#10;In an instant, the terrified hirelings scramble away, seeking the quickest way out of the dragon's lair. Unfortunately, that's not the way the heroes brought them in, but a new escape route fraught with danger! Their only hope of survival is to use their quick feet and the items strapped to their backs. Unfortunately, they are not too bright (and not very fast) and they have no clue how anything they're carrying might help them. Will they make it out? Only you can determine their fate...&#10;&#10;Hirelings: The Ascent is a board game for 2 to 6 players who become the frantic escapees, trying to find and fight their way back above ground.

Passing another engine costs one coal, passing an engine going in the opposite direction (with more than four players, the starting positions are on both ends of the track) costs 2 coals, and getting rid of an obstacle piece and placing it anywhere else on the track costs 4 coals. &#10;For crossing the finish lines, the players may pay any number of coals and add that number to their final die roll; they can also do one turn within their turn - but only if they can actually cross the line. The first player to do so, wins. In case of a tie, the remaining coal is the tiebreaker.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. &#10;The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.&#10;&#10;Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.&#10;&#10;When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!&#10;&#10;Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Car Wars: The Card Game is the game of car-to-car combat. In the near future, combat between armed and armored cars will be an arena sport. You shoot at the other cars, trying to destroy their tires and armor. The last player with an operating car is the winner!&#10;&#10;In each battle, or duel, the players play cards to damage each others' cars. When one side of a player's car is breached (the armor on that side is destroyed), the car's driver may be attacked! If a car's driver is disabled and unable to operate his car, the player who disabled him scores a kill. (Note that the driver will be back for the next duel! Only the car is killed.) When only one car is left (or when time runs out), the duel is over. New duels continue until one player has scored 60 points to become an Ace!&#10;&#10;Car Wars: The Card Game is fully compatible with Battle Cattle: The Card Game! Combine the two... take your hot rod out to the pasture and go gunning for Bossy...but remember, Bossy shoots back!&#10;&#10;",

For example, if blue and square is rolled, you would want to grab the blue fish with squares on it.&#10;&#10;However, if a player already has the matching fish in his play area, the players yell &quot;Splash Attack!&quot; and grab the red piranha. If the player that already had the matching fish is the first to do this, he gets to permanently keep the fish as a point. If a different player is quickest, however, the player loses the fish back to the center of the table. Thus, you must be the quickest to react to a matching pattern twice in a row to score. The first player to score three fish wins!&#10;&#10;",

There are 4 different sets: The Baudelaire Orphans, Count Olaf in Disguise, Olaf's Henchmen and the Orphans Confidants. Players take turns drawing a card from either the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile in hopes of completing their sets.&#10;&#10;Aside from Character Cards, there are special cards that augment play:&#10;&#10;Olaf's Eye - lets you see another players hand.&#10;&#10;Burning House - Lets you destroy a set of another player&#10;&#10;Mr. Poe - Forces another player to make another set&#10;&#10;Lemony Snicket - Disables ALL other special cards&#10;&#10;Beatrice - acts as a wild card in completing your sets&#10;&#10;First player to complete their sets wins the hand and may retrieve a victory card from either the center or from an opponent. The game ends when there are no more victory cards left in the center.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;Rescue the Baudelaire orphans by building sets of characters that include Uncle Monty, the Hook-Handed Man and Count Olaf!&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&#10;Sadly the Object of this game is not to have a pleasant experience, for any game involving the Baudelaire Orphans will surely end in disappointment. However should one choose to play anyway, his or her objective is to be the first player to collect a majority of seven victory cards. One victory card is awarded to the winner of each round.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In December 1805, Emperor Napoleon I led about 67,000 men against about 75,000 Russian and Austrian troops near Brunn (modern Brno) in Bohemia, part of today&rsquo;s Czech Republic. The battlefield, divided by hills and streams, became known as Austerlitz and would be celebrated as Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory.&#10;&#10;After fierce fighting amid the morning mists, the sun broke through the clouds. The French stormed the key Pratzen Heights, and after a bloody bayonet fight with the Russian troops manning the lines forced the Allied army into a disorganized retreat.&#10;&#10;The 34&quot;x22&quot; map features not hexagons but irregular-sized areas which relate to the actual topography of the area being depicted.  198 counters in two sizes (2/3&quot; square and 1 and 1/3&quot;x2/3&quot; long pieces) depict the infantry, cavalry, artillery units and the leaders so necessary in this activation system; the better leaders activate their troops more readily and more often.&#10;&#10;This is a new rules set , bearing some resemblance to the earlier Napoleonic games by Avalanche Press, but also borrowing from their War of the States and Rome At War series.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes a partner figure and places it on the start space. The 6 partner cards are shuffled and each player takes one - this card shows which partner you want/need in order to get into the 7th heaven. (Partners are not the fellow players at the table - but the chosen partner card of the same color as the wooden piece).&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 12 sympathy cards. These cards are played on your turn and are used to move or exchange a partner figure. There are 3 different types of sympathy cards: the cards with the numbers are used to move the corresponding colord figure on the board; the cards with an arrow moves the corresponding piece forward to the space of another playing piece; finally the cards with the text are played and the actions carried out immediately.  Alternatively, each numbered or arrowed sympathy card can be used to exchange partner cards with another player.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a player playing a numbered Sympathy Card and moving the corresponding piece forward that number of spaces, then drawing a new card. The next player then takes his turn, etc. Play continues in this manner - moving or swapping pieces until a player is able to get to the finish (7th Heaven) while holding the correct colored partner card for his playing piece. If no-one makes it to 7th Heaven, the game ends when the last sympathy card is played. The winner in that case is the player with the correct partner card who is closest to 7th Heaven.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s up to you to commission a brave officer of the Royal Navy to pursue that black-hearted cur, catch him, and turn him into shark bait. But he&rsquo;s a rascal, that Pirate King, so you&rsquo;ll need to recruit one of the dregs of the Queen&rsquo;s dungeons because sometimes it takes a pirate to catch a pirate. Iffn&rsquo; you discover where that swab is hiding, you&rsquo;ll need to beat the Pirate King in a duel or acquire enough gold to buy back the ship. Act with haste because you&rsquo;re not alone in this hunt. Whoever saves the Sea Hammer first wins the Queen&rsquo;s undying gratitude - and the game!&#10;&#10;Here's a description of the game from Timothy Rose, who saw a presentation on the game at GenCon:&#10;&#10;The &quot;S&amp;S&quot; pirate game is a &quot;track&quot; based game (think &quot;Talisman&quot; more than &quot;Monopoly&quot; ). Each player controls two characters, a &quot;hero&quot; and a &quot;scoundrel&quot; type, and the goal is to retrieve the Queen's flagship from the Pirate King. Of course, each character has different ways to do that, either by derring-do and combat or by more underhanded methods (if you have enough gold, you could even BRIBE the Pirate King to get the ship back!). They showed the box design, pretty standard pirate/cutlass stuff, but nice art.&#10;&#10;",

Many civilizations were already on the brink of collapse, and had already left their deteriorating home worlds behind in search of resources, peace, and solidarity.&#10;&#10;As new civilizations arrived in the TAU CETI system, they settled among the planets, terraforming them into more hospitable worlds. With this mass migration a new alliance was quickly formed, known as the TAU CETI Authority, which encouraged diplomacy among the different cultures and emerged as the new economic power.&#10;&#10;Trade began, with each civilization utilizing their strengths and comparative advantages to maximize productivity. Heralded among the civilizations, a sense of friendship, economic prosperity and peace enriched the star system.&#10;&#10;But all is not well. Soon after forming the alliance, unprecedented crises afflicted the colonized planets, causing civil unrest and economic disharmony. The fragile new alliance&rsquo;s existence is now being threatened! The most skilled Command Ship captains and emissaries from each race are being called upon to assemble a team of specialists, explore the star system for answers, and restore stability before all is lost.&#10;&#10;Tau Ceti: Planetary Crisis is a 1-5 player semi-cooperative game centered around an economic engine, asymmetric powers, and strategic manipulation. Tau Ceti tells a story of a newly formed alliance between several alien factions in a time of galactic declension, who compete for influence as they lead their civilization through a crisis-ridden star system.&#10;&#10;With multiple paths to victory, you are free to Explore the mysterious outer reaches of the star system for knowledge, Recruit Specialists to help you resolve crises, exploit opportunities through Trade, Buy/Sell commodities as the market fluctuates across planets, Complete Missions for money, Build Orbitals and Defend them against enemies, Acquire Exotic Technologies, and Upgrade your starship's systems for greater advantages as you navigate the cosmic environment.&#10;&#10;Tau Ceti has all the elements of a 4X game, but allows you to advance at your own pace with &agrave; la carte advanced rules, and can be played in 1-2 hours.

    "Description": "Elementals are elemental beings developing from earth, fire, water or air and change perpetually. Players try to find elementals corresponding in two parts to an elemental in the middle. &#10;The cards are evenly distributed among the players. The first player turns up a card for the middle, this is the pattern. Then in turn players turn up their top card. If it does not correspond, it stays discarded with the player, if it corresponds, the player noting this claps his hand on the card in the middle. If the player is correct, he/she gets all open cards, if the player makes a mistake he/she loses the cards. Their are some special cards which have curious consequences.If a player has not enough cards for play of for paying for a mistake, the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;This game was released for Essen 2005.&#10;&#10;",

All players keep the cards in their hands and pass one card to the player on their right until one of the players has 5 identical cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;Each player takes one card from his hand and places it face down on the table in front of the player to his right. As soon as all players have put down a card, each player picks up the card passed to him from the player on his left (a command e.g. &quot;now&quot; may also be given for this). This procedure is repeated until one of the players has 5 identical cards in his hand. When this happens, the player in question puts his hand down on the table and calls &quot;Dingo&quot;. As soon as the other players hear the word &quot;Dingo&quot;, they must put their hands on top of the calling player&acute;s hand as quickly as possible. The last player to put his hand down must give one of his chips to the winner (the hand at the bottom).&#10;&#10;The game continues until the conditions agreed at the beginning of the game are fulfilled, or the player with the highest number of chips is the overall winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A completely different game from the &quot;Archimedes&quot; published in 1995 by egSpiele. The game is played on an 8x8 board, with each player controlling one King pawn. On your turn, you must move your King (as a normal chess king) and then place a pyramid on the board. Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.&#10;&#10;Oddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a &copy; symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover. Even the rules for the game are printed on the back of the box (in English &amp; German) as opposed to being included on a separate sheet inside.&#10;&#10;",

You will also receive a card that tells you whether you are a Sane hero or Possessed by the Mind Flayer.&#10;&#10;A game plays out over a series of turns and pits two teams against each other: Sane versus Possessed. As a Sane character, you must resist the Mind Flayer's attacks to win the game.

On your turn, draw a card and give it to another player to help them, remove them, or make them change teams.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, if at least one Sane character is still in play, all Sane characters win the game.
