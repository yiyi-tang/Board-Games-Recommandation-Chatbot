There is also pretty much infinite opportunity to make up one's own ideas.&#10;&#10;",

They don't actually know this, they're just having lots of fun!  Here's how you play...&#10;&#10;One trip around the board is one day in Hungry Hank&rsquo;s life.  As you make your way through Hungry Hank&rsquo;s day, he will have breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and maybe even dessert.  He'll also get plenty of exercise (and so will you)!&#10;&#10;Each time you land on a food space, pump Hungry Hank the number of times indicated by pressing the big green button by Hungry Hank's feet.  For example, landing on a bowl of cereal and a banana for breakfast is 1 pump.  Two donuts and chocolate milk for breakfast - that's 3 pumps!  All food spaces require at least 1 pump, but you will see some require a lot more!  Every time Hungry Hank eats, his arms flap, he burps or grunts and his belly grows.&#10;&#10;When you land on an exercise space, you must get up and do exactly what Hungry Hank is doing the number of times indicated (for example, Jumping Jacks 8 times)!  All exercises can be done right next to the game.  When kids play the game with their parents or other adults, it's great for them to see adults exercising!&#10;&#10;The player who lands on a food space and causes Hungry Hank to pop ends the game.  You don&rsquo;t want to be the one to make Hungry Hank pop!&#10;&#10;Ages 4+&#10;&#10;2 - 4 players&#10;&#10;",

Remove the lowest die. &#10;The total of the dice removed represents total strokes for that hole. Mark your score on the score card.  &#10; B. Points are also awarded. Birdies are worth one point.

The lowest score in the total column wins the game. The highest extra points in the total column wins the points.&#10;&#10;D. Penalties: &#10;-When a player shakes three &quot;1's&quot; in one shake, he removes two aces and so his count for that stroke is 2. (Sand Trap)&#10;-When a player shakes three '2's&quot; in one shake he is penalized 2 strokes and must remove two deuces so his count for that shake is 4 strokes (out of bounds).&#10;&#10;When the above rules are followed, the scores will be very representative to a regular outdoor game of golf.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to buying and auctioning businesses, players may also place them Receivership, or take out a Loan against one. Players can attempt to Swindle each other out of owed patronage [i.e. rent]. Businesses under Receivership are vulnerable to be stolen in a Corporate Raid by other players, and those with loans can be lost in a Hostile Takeover. In addition to the spaces running around the outside of the board, players can enter the High Roller route, where both business cost and patronage is determined by the dice. The game ends when only one player remains, or after an agreed upon time.&#10;&#10;This game was published under different names including Bend's  Powerbroker  and Burbank's Powerbroker. Each business is named for an actual local business, whose name and contact information are listed on the rules sheet. Additionally the box states that proceeds benefit the local business community. Bend's Powerbroker is based on the business offerings of Bend, Oregon.&#10;&#10;",

He starts the game on the center of the map.  If he receives any damage during a battle, he immediately explodes in the same phase, causing a point of damage to units in all 6 neighboring hexes (except headquarters).  He then will be drawn as the first tile by the next player in turn order after the one who caused the bomber to be hit, and that player can deploy him on the map again.  If more than one player hits him in the same initiative phase of the battle, then he is knocked out of the game.&#10;&#10;The Mad Bomber II works slightly differently: he starts the game off the board.  Either player can then, by discarding a tile in addition to their usual discard, place the Bomber anywhere on the board.  Once he is eliminated, he may then be placed again by either player, as previously detailed.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Neuroshima Hex&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Final results are determined by Spinner #3 (results include throwing the fish back, landing the fish, or drawing a card from Stack #2). The game includes a board (with the spinners, two decks of dedicated cards, and a pad of score sheets. Game production and distribution was generally limited to Dowagiac.&#10;&#10;",

The prime motivator of the game is a spinner embedded in the game board with both numbers (1-4) and weapons/accessories (Strength, Reflective Shield, Pegasus, Cloak of Invisibility, fire, sword, arrows, or Power of the Gods) represented on its rim.  Players take turns spinning to determine how far they can move.  Upon entering any creature's space (except the Sphinx or Minotaur) the player spins to determine combat.  Landing on an appropriate weapon defeats the creature, with the reflective shield defeating the gorgon and basilisk and so on.  If the player enters the Sphinx' space, he must answer a riddle to advance, while entering the minotaurs space requires the draw of  a card to decide combat.  The first player to escape the maze wins.  The game includes a book detailing 15 mythological beasts from around the world, 15 painted plastic miniatures, 4 minotaur cards and a game board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "RUSSIA: THE SOVIET-GERMAN WAR presents the war on the Eastern Front, from its beginning in 1941 until the end in 1945, in five modules. By the series&rsquo; completion, its ten maps, scaled at 10 miles per hex, will cover the area east to west from Moscow to Warsaw and north to south from southern Finland to Grozny.&#10;&#10;The first three modules&mdash;entitled MOSCOW, STALINGRAD, and LENINGRAD respectively, all contain a variety of scenarios beginning in late 1941, with the fourth module, BARBAROSSA, adding the final maps and beginning the war from the jump-off date of June 22, 1941. Module #5 completes the series with a set of campaign and optional rules.&#10;&#10;RUSSIA has several highly specific design goals, all of which will be kept firmly in mind as the modules in the series are under development.&#10;&#10;1. The emphasis on the entire series will be on playability&mdash;and we mean that. To this end, we will always be willing, during development, to chop out detail that impedes the speed of play&mdash;and we are focusing on the major defining elements of each campaign rather than the tiny details. In addition, the game will do everything possible not only to eliminate large stacks, but to provide hexes large enough to provide for comfortable counter placement.&#10;&#10;2. Play will alternate quickly between the two sides. Not only will interactivity occur while each player is conducting his moves, this is not a game in which one player moves all his units and then the other player does. Instead, play will switch constantly from one player to the other, and the game system is being designed from the ground up to eliminate downtime.&#10;&#10;3. The complexity rating of the modules will never rise above a rating of 5, and even with the campaign module will not rise above 6. This is a promise. These ratings assume that EFS and OCS have complexity ratings of 8 (as a point of comparison).&#10;&#10;4. The game will make it impossible, at the strategic level, for the Soviet player to simply run away from the German army. Drawing from the research in David Glantz&rsquo;s series of studies of the war, the RUSSIA series forces the Soviet player to think in terms of frequent&mdash;even continual&mdash;attacks, beginning very early after the initial attack. The Soviet player can ignore this requirement, but if he does his &ldquo;War Experience&rdquo; (as the system is known) will never increase, and he cannot win the game. The Soviet player must learn that victory in battle means something much different for him than it does for the German, and the that he must be aggressive in attack from the earliest days of the war.&#10;&#10;5. The system will provide a variety of ways for each player to win, but also a number of ways for players to lose. Juggling one against the other will provide a constant challenge.&#10;&#10;The first module of RUSSIA will ship in May of 2009, with each additional module appearing at roughly one-year intervals. We plan to unveil the campaign module at Monstercon in 2013.&#10;&#10;",
