Also, a garbage tile can be removed from the board. If the two tiles don't match, the player has to cover all red-dotted items s/he just flipped open with garbage tiles.&#10;&#10;When all items with green dots are covered with item tiles, the game ends.

    "Description": "Thruway is a two-player connection game with many twists and turns. Two not-so-civil engineers attempt to build a thruway across the landscape while his or her opponent contests the right of way.&#10;&#10;The game of Thruway requires the following components:&#10;&#10;&#10;        120 road section tiles; 60 gray concrete tiles and 60 black asphalt tiles.&#10;        One 11 x 11 square landscape game board with 121 parcels of land cells.&#10;&#10;&#10;The landscape game board is empty at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;The concrete player tries to connect the east and west borders. The asphalt player tries to connect the north and south borders.&#10;&#10;The concrete player plays first. Then on the asphalt player's first turn only, if he or she feels the concrete player has too much advantage from the placement of the first two concrete tiles, the asphalt player may opt to trade tiles and roles. The asphalt player becomes the concrete player and vice versa.  Whether or not roles are reversed, the asphalt player then takes a turn. Player turns then alternate for the rest of the game. Players may not pass a turn unless they have no legal move. Consecutive passes can never occur.&#10;&#10;During a turn, an engineer may do any one of the following three actions:&#10;1.    Pave a road without replacement,&#10;2.    Pave a road with replacement, or &#10;3.    Resolve a crossroads dispute by swapping tiles.&#10;&#10;To pave a road without replacement, a player places two of his or her road sections on two horizontally or vertically adjacent empty parcels of land.&#10;&#10;To pave a road with replacement, a player places two of his or her road sections on two horizontally or vertically adjacent parcels of land, where one parcel is empty and the other cell contains an opponent's road section.  The replaced road section is recycled to its owner's reserve.&#10;&#10;When a 2 x 2 square of land parcels is occupied by four road sections where asphalt and concrete roads occupy the two diagonals, this is called a crossroads dispute.&#10;&#10;Crossroads Disputes&#10;ox    &#10;xo or&#10;&#10;xo&#10;ox&#10;&#10;A player may resolve a crossroads dispute in either of two ways:&#10;1.    by swapping any asphalt and concrete road sections along an edge of the 2 x 2 square, or,&#10;2.    if possible, by paving with replacement.&#10;&#10;When swapping is used to resolve the dispute, only one swap per player turn is allowed. New crossroad disputes may arise due to the resolution of a dispute. In this case, the resolution of the newly formed dispute(s) may not immediately recreate the first dispute. This restriction, which prevents position repetition, applies only to your opponent's immediate response. On later player turns, the resolution can be reversed by either player.&#10;      &#10;A road section is indestructible, only if, all its adjacent north, south, east and west land parcels (that exist on the game board) have been paved by either player and it is not part of a crossroads dispute.&#10;&#10;Goal: The first civil engineer to pave a thruway (connected path of horizontally and/or vertically adjacent indestructible road sections) connecting their two sides of the landscape wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "prelude&#10;&#10;During the middle ages, a powerful wizard obtained a unique item after years of searching. He secretly hid it in a royal treasury hall, that no one dared to enter.That was one of the most important tasks of his life. Centuries later, an archaeologist excavated the same item the wizard had placed in the treasury hall. The archaeologist, also hid the item in a secret place called the Continuum Vault. His purpose was the same as the wizard&rsquo;s. To leave the item in the Vault, until the proper passing of the centuries, like a good wine in a cellar. In the far future, an agent that had access to the continuum vault, extracted the item she had asked from the wizard and the  archaeologist to keep safe through the centuries.&#10;&#10;THE GUILD. The Wizard was a founding member of a Wizard&rsquo;s Guild that managed the impossible. To travel without moving. Although, the moving wasn&rsquo;t through space. The Guild discovered that when you manage to travel without using the dimensions of space, you travel through time. Hence, the new name of the Guild was based on the event of that movement through time, the Total Inertia Moving Event Guild, or simply T I M E Guild. Centuries passed, the coming of the Nano Age totally reformed the Guild into a T I M E Agency and gave a new agenda to its members: The molecular processing. The Agency could combine almost anything in order to create new properties it could utilize. But, some items needed to be centuries old in order to evolve or to become suitable for the processing. Therefore, the Agency decided to cooperate with its members from times past in order to bring items to the future in their desirable state. So, there were many ways for one to do that. You could simply travel back in time instruct someone in the past, to hide an item for you in a place that you knew, and travel back in your time and take the item, which now would be centuries old. Or, you could take an item from your time and hide it somewhere in the past by yourself and take it back when you return in the future. But, the T I M E Agency has many members, so that it can function properly in all Eras. If you travel back in time, too far away from your Era, it could be hard to adjust in the ways people had in the past, so, the help of another person from that Era makes the procedure easier. Usually, a Mission that includes the keeping of an item through the centuries, is concluded by 3 members: A Wizard, an Archaeologist, and a T I M E Agent specialized in traveling through the ages.&#10;&#10;Components.&#10;1 board.&#10;4 player sheets.&#10;12 pawns (3 for each player).&#10;108 cards.&#10;1 rulebook.&#10;&#10;GAME-PLAY. &#10;All players begin the game with a mission that requires at least 4 items of different properties. Each player during his/er round uses his/er 3 pawns, which are the Wizard, the Archaeologist and the T I M E traveler. The board of the game is divided in three regions that represent three aspects of time: Past Present and Future. Each pawn starts from one of these regions and moves in order. First the Wizard can move in regions of the Past to collect information about powerful items and artifacts and then gather the items and/or artifacts for which he possesses the proper information. Then, the Archaeologist, moves in the Present regions in which he can also gather items that are somewhat different from the Past items and he can gather some more info about artifacts of the Past that might help the Wizard find them. Last, the Time Traveler moves and starts from the future areas, in which she can also gather info and items. The difference in the future region is that, items gathered here are built for time travel, which means that they evolve as the centuries pass. It is best for the Time traveler to travel back in time and leave these items in the Past or the Present to age and become stronger. Each item in Continuum Run has tiers, 3 sometimes 4. When an item is new, it begins from tier 3. Some areas on the board allow the players to store items and take them back from another time period. For example in the Present regions there is the Continuum Vault. If the Archaeologist stores an item of tier 3 in the Present it stays there until someone takes it. The Continuum Vault has its future version, in which the time traveler can go and take the item the Archaeologist has stored. But, centuries have passed, so the item must be replaced with a lower tier. Tier 2 in this case. Different tiers have different values. So, if a player requires for his/er mission an item with a value of Ruination 3, and s/he possesses a future item that has Ruination 2, s/he may store that item in one region and take it back from the next.&#10;GOAL.&#10;Any player that has at least 4 items that his/er mission requires may cause an endgame, during which, a last round is played and then players score Victory Points for each item and/or artifact they have managed to send to the Future Area called Molecular Processor.&#10;&#10;",

One of these tiles is randomly chosen as the starting field; all players place their playing pieces on it. &#10;The active player rolls and moves, trying to reach the field on a tile which shows his/her color. If successful, the player discards one of his/her handcards (the one with the number of the tile). When going over the edge of the board, another board tile with no player on it can be attached at that edge. When a player has gotten rid of all cards, s/he goes back to the starting tile. The first player to reach a certain field on that tile is the winner.&#10;&#10;(User summary by HilkMAN)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A different dice game. No lucky dice here, as they are used as tokens in this game. The special thing about the game is, that in order to move the dice forward, they are tilted over their edges. There are two game variants: In the first variant, a player&rsquo;s dice must reach the opposite end of the board first. If two dice of the opposing players are colliding, the dice showing the lower number has to be removed from the board. The second game variant resembles Halma but is more demanding. Players can hop their dice over any other dice in a straight line attempting to get as many of their own dice as possible to the opposite baseline of the board. The game ends if one player manages to completely occupy the other player&rsquo;s baseline. However, the player who first manages to do so, needn&rsquo;t be the winner of the game! The winner is determined by adding up each player&rsquo;s eye number of dice already on the opposite baseline. Though players will need to make some minor tactical considerations during play, CUBLINO is definitely a great fun to play game. It is a family game for adults and children of 5 years and older. CUBLINO&rsquo;s elaborate design features slots for the dice and optimized edges for a smooth gaming experience&#10;(From the website of Intellego)&#10;&#10;",

For decades now, returning goblins have reported having encountered members of a mysterious and frightening goblin clan &hellip; The Shadow Clan!&#10;&#10;These goblins are very similar to the Dark Goblins, mainly because of the two powers they have in common: Trapping and Zombie Mutation.&#10;&#10;These new goblins will also bring along two new types of gameplay.

Secondly, other goblins will introduce a new kind of action during his turn, like [*Trap Z&auml;xg* : Choose 1 FREE card then destroy it.]. In this example, your action will be to trap Z&auml;xg for free in order to destroy a card.

    "Description": "GAME information from www.nostalgiagames.net: The board of this game features circles and squares around a picture of the QUEEN MARY. Each square has a number of cards on them. These are the different cargoes that need to be on the ship before it departs, (oil, provisions, passengers, mail etc.) When you land on a square you take the top card from the deck located on each square in an effort to accumulated a full set of cargo. When you acquire a full set,  you then race to the dock in order to drop your goods off so that the ship can sail. First one to do so wins.&#10;&#10;Candy Lovegrove from Nostalgia Games provided me with the information about this game. She does have a game for sale at her site. (nostalgiagames.net)&#10;&#10;",

The sentry thought he saw movement, the slightest of disturbances in the pale light that illuminated his watch. He paused, waiting for the ghost to show itself again.

A hand covered his mouth and a translucent blade materialized across his neck.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Quiet now,&rdquo; Hoax said, with a hint of menace in her voice. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t want to raise the alarm, would we?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Fantasy Flight Games is pleased to announce the upcoming release of Hoax, the latest single figure expansion for Tannh&auml;user! Armed with a stealth suit forged from mysterious alien technology, Caitlin &ldquo;Hoax&rdquo; Lamsbury is a ghost on the battlefield, fading from sight only to ambush her foes from the shadows. Her stealth suit, Joshua T1, allows her confuse her foes and infiltrate even the most secured locations.&#10;&#10;Hoax comes complete with four miniatures - one is painted to reflect Hoax fading from sight while the other three are translucent, used to track her movement on the board while she is invisible. When using Hoax&rsquo;s camouflaging suit, players can perplex their opponents by sending her translucent figures in opposite directions. Which one is the real Hoax?&#10;&#10;In addition to the miniatures, Hoax also comes with a rulebook detailing the rules for invisibility, tokens for her equipment (as well as bonus tokens), and a custom scenario which throws players into a deadly game of hide-and-seek!&#10;&#10;Keep your eyes peeled for Hoax, coming soon from Fantasy Flight Games!&#10;&#10;Tannh&auml;user is a squad based tactical board game set in an alternate timeline in which WWI has never ended.

The game starts with two equal armies of eleven pieces facing each other across the river - the Sage piece begins high in her tower, waiting to descend upon the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Any piece may capture by sandwiching opposing pieces vertically or horizontally.&#10;&#10;The aim is to score six points. These are achieved by moving your pieces into the river and off the board. The biggest tactical question is how soon you wish to move your pieces off the board - if you send too many off the board with an inadequate defence, your other pieces will be surrounded, but if you leave it too late, your opponent will slip off the board unchallenged.&#10;&#10;The game is fantasy themed; with Immortal sages, swift apprentices and soaring skyships. It is set on Quiet Mountain, an experimental island of scientific sorcery that has pushed the bounds of its esoteric lore too far - tearing Reality apart in a catacalysmic disaster. The first Sage to leave Quiet Mountain will be able to reach the Empress and blame their counterpart for  the disaster!&#10;&#10;",

The other team then has 2 guesses to try and work out which is the correct answer whilst trying to avoid the definition created by the other team.

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Poltava&rsquo;s Dread Day covers a conflict that lasted nearly a quarter of a century (1700-1722), with two turns plus an administrative phase each year. The Summer turn is when everyone gets to work. The Winter turn is where great commanders take huge risks. All movement is a variable, impacted by leader initiative and a die roll. Sometimes, the troops will move far and fast. Sometimes they won't.&#10;&#10;The game provides a range of different foot and horse unit types which impact how well they fight, but is unusual in one area&mdash;each unit is a single unit (strength of &quot;1&quot;), with no numbers to clutter up the counter. With few exceptions, once lost, units are gone forever...making each battle and each risk of attrition something to consider.&#10;&#10;Poltava&rsquo;s Dread Day provides a keen look into a decisive historical situation that few people know very much about. This period saw not only the founding of St. Petersburg but the birth of &quot;modern&quot; Russia. It saw the rise of Prussia, and led to shifts in the balance of power that would have significant effects on the Seven Years War.&#10;&#10;Part of the TPS, &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series&#10;That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value. Poltava&rsquo;s Dread Day features randomized elements for everything from reinforcements to diplomacy. No two games will play the same.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Objective: Stalingrad (OS) is a regimental-scale game of the two-month struggle for control of the 30-kilometer long industrial town that sat on the West Bank of the Volga River. In the fall of 1942, the very experienced German army was pushing further into the Soviet Union despite the serious setback inflicted on it by the Soviet winter offensive in December 1941. The Germans were now fighting a rebuilding Soviet army composed of raw recruits and some veteran units that had survived, and learned from, the battlefield disasters suffered by the Russians in 1941.&#10;&#10;The German Sixth Army approached the outskirts of Stalingrad in September 1942 a little over two months into its summer offensive. Although his bombers had destroyed the city's industrial and transportation capacity in August, Hitler ordered the capture of Stalin's city. In Objective: Stalingrad, the German player starts with only sixteen regiments to accomplish this mission. The means to German victory is in the ground-attack Stukas and independent battalions of artillery, combat engineers, anti-aircraft (flak), and assault guns (StuGs) that can be attached to the regiments to devise the best tactical mix of forces to conquer Stalin's city.&#10;&#10;While the German regiments were steadily reduced in strength and exhausted to impotence, dozens of untested, conscript Soviet rifle regiments and brigades were obliterated in the house-to-house fighting. Cards will provide crucial influential factors such as snipers, leader initiative, mine dogs, armored trains, and river flotilla warships.&#10;&#10;In Objective: Stalingrad the German player commands up to twenty regiments of infantry, including panzer grenadier infantry, along with numerous independent units. There are four scenarios representing each of the major attacks launched by the Germans between 13 September and 11 November. There is also a multi-player campaign game. The smaller scenarios are designed to be played in three to four hours. (For a different approach, see Stalingrad: Verdun on the Volga. In VoV the German player can refight the four major historical attacks using up to nine primary maneuver units &ndash; divisions &ndash; at an operational level. The same scenario at that level can be finished in one to two hours.)&#10;&#10;Objective: Stalingrad is about tactical choices for both the German and Soviet players. If you never had time to play Dana Lombardy's tactical company-level &quot;monster&quot; game Streets of Stalingrad, OS enables you to refight one of the most important battles of World War II in far less time.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is encouraged to vocalize his opinion - to investigate how each group decision will affect him. It is recommended for groups of not less than seven nor more than fifteen players.&#10;&#10;There are no rules in COMMUNITY - only procedures by which to play. Dice Roll and Role Cards create a simulation of day-to-day living conditions and the responsibilities which we all must face. The Event Cards simulate events which affect the community and require a group decision. The Pollution Index forces the community to take group action and Community Improvements offer a way to improve the quality of life.&#10;&#10;User Summary: &#10;COMMUNITY is run by a Gamemaster who is in control of the game. Decisions about what a player can or cannot do are made by the Gamemaster based on his learning goals for the group. There are &quot;rules&quot; included with the game, but these can be adjusted per the Gamemaster's discretion. The game is over or is &quot;won&quot; when the Gamemaster's pre-determined goals have been achieved or the players have failed.&#10;&#10;",

Now, it's up to you to find a way to stop this infectious contagion from spreading before MBI returns to clean up their accident...with a nuclear purge.&#10;&#10;Endicott Epidempic: Infectious Contagion is a game for 1 to 8 players. Each player plays as a character with unique abilities allowing them to combat the Zombie hordes. The object of the game is to find the Hermit, his critical Intel and his escape route before all of the players have become infected by the never-ending wave of Undead. Additionally, all this must be accomplished before the 4 Countdown Cards have been drawn, which will lead to the Nuclear Purge and an instant lose for all players.&#10;&#10;Endicott Epidempic: Infectious Contagion is also great for solo play. You can play with some or all of the characters, or play as a single character and take a stand as the only uninfected human in the county. Once you become infected, all hope is lost.&#10;&#10;There are 70 Cards: &#10;4 Countdown Cards &#10;8 Character Cards &#10;30 Zombie Cards &#10;15 Item/Weapon Cards &#10;7 Event Cards &#10;3 Cure Cards&#10;3 Hit Chip Cards [requires manual cutting]&#10;&#10;While Infectious Contagion is a spin-off card game, Endicott Epidemic is also available as a full board game with more objectives, more items, more gameplay styles, and of course - more Zombies!&#10;&#10;Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion will also be expandable with new card packs including advanced Zombies and Zombie Bosses, Upgraded Weapons, New Items, and objective-based area cards that augment the gameplay to make the already intense battle against the Undead even MORE exciting.&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics/Design and Artwork by Douglas Harvey&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Crazy Mix is a card game about shapes with four different properties: shape, size, colour and fill. Each game is a race to determine the correct set of properties.&#10;&#10;The game is played with two sets of cards. There is a set of twenty target cards, that each show two shapes. These cards are aranged in a square. Then, four cards from the code deck are drawn. Each of these cards show a single shape. The players must now find the card that has the same shape as the first card, the same colour as the second card, the same fill as the third card and the same size as the fourth card. If a player thinks he has found the right card, he puts his finger down on the matching target card. If his guess is correct, he gains a number of the code cards as a reward. If his guess is wrong, he loses a card he has gained before.&#10;&#10;Halfway through the game, things will get a bit more complex. The target cards are flipped over, and now show shapes in secondary colours. From now on, in order to determine the colour for the target card, the players must mix the colour of the shape on the code card with the background colour of the code card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are too few code cards left to create a new assignment. The player that has gained the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Thai Checkers is a traditional game from the checkers family played in Thailand. &#10;Its rules are often given wrongly, including online gaming sites.&#10;&#10;Thai Checkers is played on an 8x8 board. The board is set up so that the lower left corner is black. Each player has 8 men (ordinary Checkers) which are placed on the black squares of the first two rows. Black starts moving. Only one piece may be moved at a turn. Pieces consist of men and kings.&#10;&#10;Men move and capture as in English Draughts or American Checkers. That means they move and capture diagonally forwards and forwards only. At the end of a move on which they reach the back row, they are promoted to kings.&#10;&#10;Kings move and capture at the long range. It means they can move diagonally forwards and backwards over any number of empty fields. Similarly, they can capture at any distance, if the field directly behind the opposing piece is empty. A king must move to that empty field directly behind the captured piece. Removal of the captured piece is immediate and occurs during the capture, as in Turkish Checkers.&#10;&#10;Capture is enforced. Multiple captures are possible. Maximum capture is not enforced. A player can choose any capturing line he wishes as long as he does not end it while the capturing piece can still do captures. Since removal of captured pieces is immediate and capture is enforced, it can happen that a king immediately reverses direction in a capture.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to block or capture all pieces of the opponent, leaving him without a legal move.&#10;&#10;",
