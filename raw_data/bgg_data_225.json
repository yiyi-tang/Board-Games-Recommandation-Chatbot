    "Description": "Aliens vs. Zombies (&quot;AvZ&quot;), by designer Chris Taylor, is a two-player game about the life and death (mostly death) battle between two natural enemies: Aliens and Zombies. The Aliens attacked the Earth and destroyed 99% of humanity using orbital death rays. However, the weapon interacted strangely with human DNA and caused an unforeseen mutation! Within 24 hours of death, the recently dead arose and slowly shambled aimlessly with purpose in the general direction of the Alien attackers to take their revenge.&#10;&#10;Aliens vs. Zombies is a small, low-complexity wargame for beginners, children and light-hearted fans of aliens and/or zombies. The aliens are invading a small town. A side effect of their weapons used to conquer humanity is the reanimation of the newly dead, who are out for revenge!&#10;&#10;The alien player has fewer units but has the advantage of superior weaponry and armor. Zombies are plentiful and are divided into different types: rotting, tough and fast. Both sides can move or attack during their turn. Each side has one unique action: aliens can blast away with exploding dice and zombies can chomp their opponents to create new allies.&#10;&#10;Each turn a tile is revealed with a number of zombie spawns and special events. After the 8th turn, the zombie dead (those deader than usual) are counted to determine the victor.&#10;&#10;Which side will you choose? Choose wisely and conquer, in Aliens vs. Zombies!&#10;&#10;Complexity: 2 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;",

Sorcerers specialize in types of magic represented by 7 different colors. Sorcerer adds a twist to the old &quot;combat differential&quot; system (attack strength minus defense strength) by adding a circular system of combat bonuses based upon what colors of magic are attacking each other; Blue/Green/Yellow/Grey/Orange/Red/Purple with each color having a strong advantage over it's neighbor to the right (with Purple circling around to have power over Blue) and a disadvantage against it's neighbor to the left, with lessening combat bonuses the further away the color is from itself. Combat bonuses are also given based on map position as the hexes alternate colors of magic instead of representing physical terrain. Attacking from one's own color is good.&#10;&#10;Several different scenarios are included in the rulebook that range from 1 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;",

The time of the sympathy strike and negotiations of the 21 Demands with the government delegation, completed by signing the August Agreements and the emergence of Solidarno&#197;&#155;&#196;&#135; (the Solidarity movement), is the period when Lech Wa&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;sa scaled the shipyard fence and became not only the leader of the opposition, but also a front-page public figure. Because of the strike, he became the head of Solidarity, received the Nobel Peace Prize, and was elected President of the Republic of Poland.&#10;&#10;You begin the game with only your quick wit and gift of the gab. Everybody in turn controls the actions of Lech Wa&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;sa, gaining support for the strike in the shipyard.

With them on his side, Wa&#197;&#130;&#196;&#153;sa draws the attention of foreign correspondents. Press interviews inform the entire country of the shipbuilders&rsquo; struggle, which causes other groups to join the strike, and the shipyard is visited by delegates of MKS (Mi&#196;&#153;dzyzak&#197;&#130;adowy Komitet Strajkowy: the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee) and the MKS Committee of Experts under Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Being certain of support from the delegates and experts, you can attempt to negotiate the strike demands.

Players could prepare their own circuits with use of supplied segments with curves and straights. In the 2007/2012 game editions arrangement of the track spaces has changed for better determining the order of the moves in the turn.&#10;&#10;In every turn the players set the speed of their cars and try to drive through curves without an accident to reach the finish line before opponents.&#10;&#10;When safe speed for the curve is exceeded, the player has to roll the dice specified number of times to check if the car would stay on the track after breaking or if the accident (and some damage to the tyres) would happen.&#10;&#10;The cars are equipped with some amount of tyres tokens, which are used during the game when players brake hard, or accelerate to indicate the tyres wear. In 2007/2012 game editions there are only tyre tokens - in the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; there were cards (&quot;Tyres&quot; and &quot;Brakes&quot;) to indicate damage points after hard breaking. Tyre wear is regulated by penalty charts.

No one knows which ships you're betting on to bring in the biggest haul, but at the same time, you're in the dark as to what the other fishermen are doing, too.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives seven cards from a deck of 28, with each color appearing four times. Players simultaneously pass one card to the left. The four colors of cards match the colors of ships that start in the harbor. Six cards are shuffled and laid in a row from the harbor, with each card having 0-3 fish. Each player starts with one resource cube, and 15 journey tiles are shuffled and laid face down.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you announce that you're revealing 1-3 journey tiles &mdash; gaining a resource cube if you say 1 and paying one if you say 3. You then reveal those tiles, then move one of the ships depicted on one tile one space forward. (Alternatively, if you reveal the pirate tile, all other players must discard a resource cube.) Instead of revealing tile, you can discard one of your cards in hand face down to move one ship forward or backward one space. You cannot move a ship to the final space this way. If fewer than four tiles are face down at the start of your turn, place them all face down, shuffle them, then continue.&#10;&#10;When a ship reaches the final space, the game ends. Each player then reveals their cards, and each card is worth as many fish as the space occupied by the ship of the same color. Whoever has caught the most total fish wins!&#10;&#10;",

When you play a card that your opponent cannot block, you win the round and score points according to the winning card. The game is played over multiple rounds until one player scores at least fifteen points, winning the game.&#10;&#10;This is a game about forcing your opponent to react, so as to maneuver them into a position where they cannot do so. As such, good play is about enforcing deadlock until you are able to break it in your favor. If the mandatory reactions in the same designer's Table Battles get on your nerves, then this one probably isn't for you, because that is in effect the entirety of the game.&#10;&#10;This is the third of Hollandspiele's annual holiday mini-games, packed in as a free promotional item on any order of at least two games during their 2018 December sale.

As a travel agent, players will try to bring their own groups of passengers (1, 2, 3 and 4 travellers) from to their respective departure cities to their destinations.&#10;&#10;The game board shows the world map with all departure/arrival cities, the different connections between them with their fuel cost, the chartered airplane with ten available seats, a fuel indicator and a customs area. Each player is randomly dealt a departure and destination card for each of their four traveller groups and also receives a number of customs cards. The plane is placed on a randomly chosen starting location. If this happens to be the departure location for any of the players' passengers, these may immediately board the plane and all is clear for take-off.&#10;&#10;A players' turn consists of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     First, two six-sided dice are rolled and the result is added to the fuel indicator. After that, the player may move the plane using one or more connections, as far as the fuel reserve will allow. &#10;     If the plane lands at the destination airport for any of the passengers that are on the plane, these are moved to the customs area. When enough seats are available in the plane, new passengers may board the plane at the current location.&#10;     Players may now play matching customs cards for the current location, thereby sending passengers from the customs area and/or the plane back home.

Points are earned by growing your city's population and by employing them with jobs - commercial banker, farmer, forester, miner, or driller. As the population and job opportunities expand, players have the opportunity to upgrade their zones and earn money, both of which earn players even more points. Soon after the game starts, new skyscrapers begin to sprout up across the region, players' zones begin to compete for resources and space, and strategic playing becomes an engaging and critical element to each city's success!&#10;&#10;As each player's city grows, resources and purchase power becomes limited. No city can grow unchecked forever! When the resources from one sector are used up, they are gone forever. Strategic players will develop a diverse and thriving city and amass wealth, and maybe even collaborate with a neighboring city.... Game ends when all resources have been used up. Points are awarded based on number of jobs, number of skyscrapers and amount of saved money.&#10;&#10;Players will enjoy the uniqueness of every new game of CITY that they play! Change in board layout and zoning options means each game of CITY is completely different and guaranteed to be awesome!&#10;&#10;",

Behind them lay Romania and the wreckage of the German 6th and 8th Armies. Ahead of them lay Budapest and Vienna and the battered lines of German and Hungarian defenders. The men of the Red Army were confident of a quick and easy victory. Appearances were deceiving, however.&#10;&#10;Near the city of Debrecen the Russian Advanced Guard encountered, not the remnants of an already defeated force, but four full-strength panzer divisions, eager for revenge. They would clash in one the great battles of the Second World War. The result would be the last real victory for the Germans in the East, the last time that the Wehrmacht could slug it out toe to toe with a full strength German force. The victory, however, was close and might well have gone the other way.&#10;&#10;It is this situation that The Last Panzer Victory seeks to simulate with a fast paced, mobile, hard hitting game of operational warfare on the Eastern Front.

When the player finishes building that object, she snaps a picture with the phone, which then presents a score based on how difficult the object was, how quickly the player built it, and whether it was built correctly. After five rounds, the player with the highest score wins. In LEGO: Build Your Brain, players play &quot;game show&quot; style, solving in different categories a variety of pattern building and logic puzzles for points.&#10;&#10;In the single-player mode, you're presented with a series of images, and you complete them as quickly as possible in order to record a high score. The &quot;My Life&quot; section of the app allows you to upload pictures of LEGO models that you created for posterity or for future challenges against other players. The separate Build Your Brain app can also be played individually, solving pattern-building logic puzzles (and taking a picture of one's solution when complete) like those that are presented in the multi-player game.&#10;&#10;",

Mr. Lincoln's War is organized into two games, The Army of the Tennessee, which deals with the Western theater, and The Army of the Potomac, which deals with the war in Virginia.  Each game has four short campaign scenarios that recreate the maneuvers and battles of Shiloh, Gettysburg, Atlanta and other monumental Civil War contests.  A grand campaign scenario enabling the players to fight the war in the West or East is provided with each game.  Both games may be combined for a grand campaign game that simulates the entire Civil War on both fronts.&#10;&#10;Each game contains the following components:&#10;1) One 22' x 28' mapboard covering the eastern or western portion of the United States.&#10;2) 400 die-cut playing pieces.&#10;3) A rules booklet.&#10;4) A scenario booklet.&#10;5) One player-aid and leader display card.&#10;&#10;Each hex represents about 12 miles.&#10;Each strength point represents approximately 2,500 men.&#10;&#10;Additional information:&#10;&#10;Game features alternating player turns including interception movement by the non-phasing player, leaders required to move infantry, special rules for naval and amphibious operations, supply, railroad construction and repairs, a combat system featuring morale and leadership and a campaign game combining both the Potomac and  the Tennessee games. The campaign game also adds politics and production to the mix.&#10;Turns are monthly, except for the winter turns (November to February), which are bi-monthly.&#10;&#10;",

If you land on a row/column with no uneaten insects &mdash; yet insects remain elsewhere in the layout &mdash; then you've lost the challenge; if you eat all the insects, you win.&#10;&#10;Kameleo can also be played as a two-player game.

Victory points (VPs) can be won by collecting creatures, completing missions, building your research lab, and smacking down your enemies! Creature College is played in three university terms: Spring, Autumn and Winter. Each term consists of three bidding rounds and one battle round. At the end of twelve rounds the game ends and the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;To start the game, every player takes a player mat, a set of bidding tokens, and playing pieces in their color. Three ability cards are then dealt to each player from which they can choose one. The ability cards allow them to personalize their player a little. The ability card sits face up in the space provided on the player mat. They then take three missions and again choose one. The missions come in 15, 20 and 25 VP types and show a set of cards the player must collect to complete the mission. The mission card sits face down in the space provided on the player mat.&#10;&#10;In the bidding round, a number of creature cards are laid face up in the play area (determined by number of players). The players bid in player order (determined by who bid highest in the previous bidding round) if someone is outbid they have to move to a different creature card. Once all bidding has been completed, the players roll two dice and either take research lab cards to fill their research lab slots or battle cards to help them in battle. If Kevin the Giga-Pig has turned up during the bidding phase, all players must now try and battle Kevin. After three bidding rounds, there is a battle round. In player order, players now fight the players either side of them by choosing one or more cards in a single suit, tapping the card (by turning it 90&ordm;) and choosing to fight right or left players first. Battle cards may be added in each battle separately, and if the attacking player wins, they get green gems; if they lose, red gems.&#10;&#10;",

The match in the hand is put out at the same time by the shout of &quot;One, Two! Fire!&quot;&#10;&#10;If the total number of colors in either match, red or blue, becomes &quot;1&quot;, the ignition succeeds. Next, we aim to grow flames with &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, and &quot;5&quot;. Even if it succeeds or fails, the match that you put out will be put on the pedestal, It might be a hint, saying that &quot;That person's color will come out next time&quot;.

    "Description": "They fought tooth and claw for 160 million years... let the battles begin again.&#10;&#10;Jurassic Wars is a dinosaur combat game with computer-generated images and an unusual game mechanism.&#10;&#10;During the game players must carefully play Dinocards from their hand and must judge when to play a Combat card, which can alter the outcome of the combat. Timeline cards can also affect combat. There are two types of dice - green and red - and they vary in their effectiveness in scoring a hit. Green dice are used by herbivores and red by carnivores.&#10;&#10;Play consists of combats between pairs of players. During combat players take the appropriate number of combat dice, which vary according to a few simple conditions, and start rolling. The aim is to score hits against the opposing dinosaur. Jurassic Wars features an interesting game mechanism where the combat dice also serve as the number of hit points that each dinosaur can sustain in combat. After a series of rolls, one player will be left with no dice to throw and his or her dinosaur is defeated. With every combat, another dinosaur is removed from play. As the game progresses some players will lose all their dinocards and be eliminated until only one player is left standing and is the winner.&#10;&#10;The simple, probability-based game mechanism is flexible allowing for basic game parameters to be changed and also lending itself to many different variations, such as Jurassic Wars Whist, a points scoring game that involves greater skill and judgement, and Jurassic Wars Casino, a Craps-style gambling game. Details are available from the publisher&rsquo;s website. Expansion sets are in development.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ruckus: The Goblin Army Game is a tactical war game that introduces an innovative army formation mechanic to create fast, intense combat for 2-4 players. Players choose from one of four unique Goblin Guilds, each with a special set of skills and tactical advantages, and build their army to destroy anyone that stands in their way. As battles are won and lost, players gain Victory cards, Victory Points, or the ability to upgrade their army. Who will be victorious, the mighty Fighters, the cunning Thieves, the powerful Clerics, or the magical Necromancers?&#10;&#10;To begin the game, players set up the Camp, the area of the game board housing Victory Point Tokens, action markers, the Kicker card deck, the Victory card deck, and the Upgrade deck. Next, players choose a Goblin Guild consisting of 25 units. In addition to the starting units of each Guild, players have 12 draft points to use in order to draft additional units to create their own unique army. All remaining units that are not drafted are combined to create the Upgrade deck.&#10;&#10;Players will compete in battle to gain 5 valuable Victory cards. Players will secretly set up their army's battle formation behind a Battle Screen. After shuffling their unit cards,  players will draw 5 cards into their hand. These 5 cards are then set up into a battle formation consisting of 1-3 units in the first row, 1-2 units in the second, and an optional 1 unit in the third combat row. Once all players' formations are complete, players remove their Battle Screens and combat begins. Players may first recruit any available units to their army, and may then choose to activate 1 combat skill per round. Next, damage between opposing Guilds is declared and resolved. As units take damage and are defeated, they are removed from combat and are placed in a player&rsquo;s discard pile. Combat continues until one Guild is left standing, with the winner gaining the first Victory card and its benefits. Players who lose the combat round may chose to upgrade a unit in their army. Once the 5th Victory card has been won, the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Who will be victorious? Will it be the Mighty Fighters, the Cunning Thieves, the Powerful Clerics, or the Magical Necromancers? Choose your guild! Draft your army! Destroy your enemies!&#10;&#10;",

TLG2 is a follow-on to the original TLG, which was published in S&amp;T #184 (Mar/Apr 1997) and covered the battles of Bladensburg, North Point and New Orleans.&#10;&#10;Each of the three battle games included in TLG2 is a two-player contest. One player commands the American forces, while the other commands the Anglo-Canadian opposition. The American player is generally on the offensive in all three games, but the Anglo-Canadian player will also have ample opportunity for counterattack.&#10;&#10;",

If the player wants to add a tile to an old planet, he has to roll on the die more than the number of finished space stations on the planet.&#10;&#10;Then, the available tiles are replenished, and the next player takes his turn.

    "Description": "A game played with a deck of 42 cards of 21 different kinds, all in the same suit. 12 of the cards are numbered, the rest are named cards with special abilities. Each player is dealt one card. Going round the table a player can choose to swap his card with the player to his left, but some cards have special abilities and will 'kill off' e.g. the player wishing to swap. The object of the game is to be the last remaining player, and thereby winning the pot.&#10;&#10;According to the history section of an Offason edition, this game was very popular in Sweden starting from the 1750's and about a hundred years thereafter. While a part of the Swedish cultural tradition, it is in fact based on a popular 17th century Italian version (&quot;Cucc&uacute;&quot;) of a medieval French 'hazard' game (&quot;Coucou&quot;); both of these names refer to the cuckoo, which is the highest card in the deck.&#10;&#10;Kille can be played in the original form as 'single-card kille' or as the 'five-card kille' variant developed in the mid-19th century.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;Technically speaking, the Korean War has remained active since the cease-fire agreement of 1953: the belligerents have never actually ratified a final peace accord. Since 1953, the Korean peninsula has remained devoid of open war, though only South Korea has prospered during that time. In contrast, North Korea has become isolated, bankrupt and confrontational. Indeed, as the North Korean economy continues to implode, and more starvation ensues, it's conceivable a desperate North Korea could resort to war to try to avoid its own final collapse.&#10;&#10;DMZ utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From artillery to helicopter gunships, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single armor brigade, for example &mdash; perhaps with close air support &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry corps defending an airbase. As that attack gets underway, that armor brigade may find itself under fire from rocket batteries; more support fire will be necessary to take the airbase, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In DMZ, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses likely to be sustained by both sides during another Korean War. Winning a battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    DMZ: The Battle for South Korea, late 1970s&#10;&#10;&#10;",

So it's minus points.&#10;&#10;When two line is out, the game is end.&#10;The winner is the player with most points.&#10;&#10;Description in Japanese:&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#181;&#183;&#229;&#186;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#230;&#176;&#180;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#226;&#152;&#133;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#163;&#232;&#166;&#150;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#179;&#168;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#178;&#185;&#230;&#150;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#181;&#183;&#229;&#186;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#139;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Anno Domini 947 a. C. marks the royal marriage between Lothar II, King of Italy, and Adelaide of Burgundy. Unfortunately, soon after this union is sadden due to the death of the King. The belief is that the King was killed by Berengario II, Marquis of Ivrea, hungry to reign the Kingdom. Adelaide, indignant, opposes this new regency, as Berengario II tries to force her to marry his own son, Adalbert of Ivrea. She runs away to seek refuge in the Canossa Castle, strategic in its position, owned and governed by Azzo Adalbert. Here comes the siege of the castle, and this is what we are going to recall: on one side Berengario II and his son, Adalbert, are besieging, and on the other Adelaide of Burgundy and Azzo Adalbert are under siege; in defense of them comes Otho I, Emperor of Germany, with his knights. Each courageous player will guide 2 of the Emperor&rsquo;s knights, to try to free Adelaide, allowing Otho I to marry her in 952, and thus becoming the new King of Italy.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game is to achieve a higher score than your opponents. Points are achieved by either taking enemy tiles or creating a way out of the Canossa Castle (3 points).&#10;Enemy tiles, like all other tiles, are captured when you place one of your knight-pawn on one of them. Captured tiles must always be perfectly visible to all other players.&#10;The game ends when a player creates a way out of the Canossa Castle (that means to seize the Canossa Castle tile).&#10;In order to seize the Canossa Castle tile or any other enemy tile players must create a way out that enables that tile, on which there&rsquo;s the knight-pawn, to be moved off of the board.&#10;&#10;",

Each hero comes with a skill deck representing their unique set of skills. During play, heroes must manage their actions and coordinate with the team, moving to the locations under the most threat and doing battle with enemies, ideally finding time to recover and purchase items between engagements as they prepare to defeat the monsters and enemies.&#10;&#10;The game has multiple chapters, and each of them has a similar structure of main plot and side quests. If any hero dies during the round, they suffer a penalty, but can be revived in the next round. As long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win. The chapters are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.&#10;&#10;The board game significantly broadens the original game's universe and emphasizes the depth of the plot, yet its main focus is on interaction driven by game stories and decision making.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Their names are virtually synonymous with the long conflicts with the native indigenes of the American West.  Cochise, Victoria, Chato, Geronimo.  These great war band leaders all come from the various tribes of the Apache, and the Apache Wars dominated the attention of the US government in its westward development for the critical 25 years from the American Civil War to the final capitulation of the natives of the area.&#10;&#10;What the Game Looks Like:&#10;&#10;Once We Moved Like the Wind covers these central conflicts of the American South West.  The game is played as a series of turns, each of which follows a sequence of play that begins with determining how bad a provocation results in conflict for the turn.  The provocation level determines the forces each player will have for the turn and their general placement on the map.  Next the Apache player moves the Apache forces and then the Army Player moves the US and Mexican forces.  Combat may then occur between opposing player forces that share a location.  After any combat is resolved, victory points are counted up and the player with the most for the turn earns one increase in victory level on the Victory Track.  Play then repeats for the next turn to the end of the game when the player with the higher level on the Victory track is the winner.&#10;&#10;Central to the game is that the playing pieces are all wooden blocks with the information about each particular piece only on one side and hence hidden during play from the opposing player until action occurs which must reveal particular blocks.  And not all of these blocks are actually opposing forces.  For the Apache player in particular, many playing pieces each turn will represent rumors of Apache actions and forces which the Army player must chase down to determine if they are real or false.  Similarly, for the Apache player, not knowing which Army pieces represent which forces means not knowing if an opposing group is small enough to attack and win, or is in reality a force big enough to hand out a devastating defeat.&#10;&#10;Once We Moved Like the Wind is played on a 22&rdquo;x 22&rdquo; mounted game board with a scale of about 14 kilometers per centimeter or 22 miles per inch.  The terrain represented is divided by a number of features.  Overall the area is divided into 4 large Territories: the Arizona Territory &amp; the New Mexico Territory in the US and the Sonora Territory &amp; the Chihuahua Territory in Mexico.  Dividing up all of the Territories, and often crossing their borders, are the Areas.  These represent sections of land of differing types between which the players move their forces.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;    &bull; Complexity: 3 out of 10&#10;    &bull; Solitaire Suitability: 5 out of 10&#10;    &bull; Time Scale: 3-4 years per turn&#10;    &bull; Map Scale: Areas covering parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Sonora and Chihuahua&#10;    &bull; Unit Scale: A wooden block represents an Army Troop or Apache War Band&#10;    &bull; Average Time to Play: &lt;2 Hours&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In SET, players want to create sets of three cards, with each card in the set having the same feature as each other card in the set or a different feature. For example, all three cards have green symbols on them, but they have 1, 2 and 3 symbols and the symbols are all different shapes (oval, squiggle and diamond).&#10;&#10;One side of the double-sided game board in SET Junior features three 3x3 squares, with each line in a square forming a set. Players take turns drawing a tile from the stack &mdash; with each tile featuring 1-3 symbols in one of three colors and in one of three shapes &mdash; and placing that tile on the game board. Each time a player completes a set by placing a tile, she claims a point chip and whoever collects the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;On the other side of the game board, a dealer lays out up to ten tiles one by one and whenever any player sees a set among the face-up tiles, she shouts &quot;Set!&quot; and claims the tiles that form the set. The dealer then replaces these tiles and the game continues until no more sets can be claimed. Whoever claims the most sets wins.&#10;&#10;",

Together they face off against the fearsome dungeon deck.

The game is playable with one to eight players and allows for both cooperative and competitive gaming.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to the standard numbers and suits the cards also contain a letter of the alphabet.&#10;&#10;The players are attempting to create &quot;runs&quot;, &quot;groups&quot; and &quot;words&quot;. A Run is four or more cards in the same suit in sequence. A Group is three or more of a kind. A Word is formed using the letters on the cards and can be any non-proper word found in a standard dictionary. A game consists of seven rounds, and in each round a player must form a specific number of Runs, Groups and Words.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a number of cards, the exact number of which varies depending on the round in play. Each turn the player draws the top card from the deck or from the discard pile then plays as many cards as possible (either by forming new Runs, Groups or Words or by adding them onto cards which have already been played, either by themselves or by other players). Finally, they discard one of their remaining cards. The round ends when one player manages to empty their hand.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by forming the number of Groups, Runs and Words specified for the round and for the cards in the melds they created. They lose points for cards left in their hand when the round ends. The player with the highest total after all seven rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;An interesting variation of Rummy, Tryce adds an element of strategy to that game.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series.

    "Description": "This game was originally published by the designer as Bin'Fa under the company name Taoist Arts, Inc. It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.&#10;&#10;Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.&#10;&#10;The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.&#10;&#10;Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.&#10;&#10;The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin&acute;Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, &quot;The Art of War,&quot; written 2,300 years ago. They provide the structural framework for the game.&#10;&#10;",
