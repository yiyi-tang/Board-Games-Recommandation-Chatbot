    "Description": "An expedition, composed of subjects of various backgrounds (there are distinguished Egyptologists, valiant officers of Her Majesty, archaeologists in search of notoriety with their daughters, treasures hunters of every ream etc., and their respective carriers), runs through the corridors and rooms of an ancient Egyptian Temple miraculously remained intact in the sands of the desert,  in search of treasures and precious finds. But there are those who make good guard. And, above all, the Eternal Sleep of the Queen's Spirit is very heavy, but not entirely bombproof.&#10;&#10;Do Not Wake Up Netiqrys! is a three-dimensional tabletop game, which is played with miniatures and on a map containing three-dimensional elements. It is a quite traditional dungeon crawler, so your characters (miniatures) move on rooms and corridors in order to reach the Hall of the Sarcophagus of the Mummy and to collect treasures. What makes the game a bit particular is the random generation of the path and of the enemies every time the characters turn a corner or open a door.&#10;&#10;The rules are very simple but immersive, in order to satisfy both old friends of colonial or exotic miniature games and casual players or children. A game can involve a number of players ranging from one to six.&#10;&#10;To play DNWN! it is necessary to have about twenty miniatures, normally in 28 or 20mm, including the Mummy, some of her Followers, some &quot;Undead&quot;, as well as members of the archaeological expedition and their local carriers. You also need a 12-sided dice, a pair of 6-sided dice, some furniture to be disseminated on the path and a play area of about 90 cm - 36&quot; per side, which will represent the perimeter of the Temple, within which the path will have to wind.&#10;&#10;Everything else you will need is present in this issue that, in addition to the rules of the game and two sides of very complete &ldquo;fast reference&rdquo; tables (to play you will only need those), provides you with the &quot;Character Cards&quot;, containing the characteristics of each of the protagonists, and also with the tiles for the construction of the path (including corridors, rooms, doors and so on) as you see it in the photos,  to print, paste and crop. In fact, DNWN! involves the random construction of the path during the game, an element that makes each match deeply different from any other and that allows the game to be particularly enjoyable even in &ldquo;solo mode&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "AGON (Ancient Games Of Nations) 24 traditional board games in a playable book. The collection features 24 old abstract strategy games from all over the world, such as ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Africa, the Far East, North- and Central America, and Europe.&#10;&#10;Pierrot, the author, wanted to make his book playable, therefore it was designed to provide large, hard cardboard surfaces, and the pawns and dice were supplied as punch board attachments. However, for an even better visual experience, players are encouraged to creatively collect or make more suitable pawns from various sources, such as glass pearls, pebbles, shells, buttons, pieces of wood, or pottery.&#10;&#10;The 24 games included in this book are not exact replicas, as in many cases there are no original models considered authentic. Often, the circles and grids were just drawn on the sand, and then erased when the game was over. Nonetheless, enough information is available to create most of the prototypes.&#10;&#10;The rules described in the book are based on the most widely accepted version for each game &ndash; and were thoroughly tested.&#10;This Hungarian book includes the following titles, along with the author's own artwork:&#10;&#10;The Royal Game of Ur, Bizingo, Fanorona, Puluc, Rimau-rimau, Yot&eacute;, Patolli, Jarmo, Mig mang, Ringo, Owari, Alquerque, Fox &amp; Geese, Agon, Tablut, Tonkin, Siga, Pah tum, Senet, Sz&rsquo;kwa, Surakarta, Hasami shogi, O-pat ko-no and Yut.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pierrot t&aacute;blaj&aacute;t&eacute;kok ir&aacute;nti szenved&eacute;ly&eacute;nek &eacute;s hossz&uacute; kutat&oacute;munk&aacute;j&aacute;nak k&ouml;sz&ouml;nhet&#197;&#145; ez a k&uuml;l&ouml;nleges album, amely huszonn&eacute;gy tradicion&aacute;lis absztrakt strat&eacute;giai j&aacute;t&eacute;kot tartalmaz.

Players also receive three cards representing a shopping list, with three food items on each. On your turn, you roll a single die (d6) and move that amount around the board. If a space has a face-down token it is revealed, and if it is an item you need you can pick it up and put it on your list (it stays on the space if not). There are also a few &quot;wild&quot; tokens that can used for any item. Other spaces let you draw from a deck of cards with a variety of actions, including stealing tokens from an opponent's list. Complete a list and you get another, and the first player to complete three lists wins. Any token from a completed list is put in the center and can be collected if a player lands on an empty space; as such, the game picks up pace as it goes on as more items are readily available.&#10;&#10;",

In turn order, players can either pick up an influence / corruption card OR bid influence, corruption or a combination of both for a crony. Players can only gain one card per round, so any player who outbids another forfeits their turn. Players that are outbid, get their turn and their influence / corruption bid card back.&#10;&#10;The end of the game occurs when there are no cards left in the deck or fewer cards than needed to draw for a new round. A final round is played for players to buy and used tactics before the election takes place and the player with the most votes wins!&#10;&#10;",

In this 2-4 player game, you will assume the role of a Greek God vying for control of the world and the future of your civilization. Wield divine power using asymmetric abilities and your customizable action deck. There are 13 Gods to choose from, providing a different challenge and experience each time you play.&#10;&#10;As a God you exercise your will, represented by various cards and abilities, to build the world as you play. On your turn you will play cards and pay for their scalable effects by exhausting your civilization&rsquo;s cities and temples.  New cities and temples can be built when your population grows, making your action cards more powerful and your turns more efficient.  You&rsquo;ll be able to shape the shared world map as players choose which unique hex-shaped land tiles to add, giving the mortals new areas to grow into.  Each land has its own mix of geographic type, attack and defense bonus, population growth rate, potential build sites, movement cost, and location abilities.  No two worlds will look the same.   You will also guide your Hero and High Priestess to go on quests, use location abilities on land tiles, lead your people to new areas, or convert the non-believers. There are also 12 powerful mythological creatures that can be summoned, each with their own abilities to enhance your strategy.&#10;&#10;As powerful as you are, the mortals are not entirely within your control as they have their own free will.  They will pray for various signs, protections, or resources, and answering these prayers will grant you a range of benefits in return.  In addition, at the end of each player's turn the population will move and grow in response to the Mortal die's result.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 3 Ages of raising mountains, answering prayers, causing catastrophes, unlocking technologies, warring, and building cities, temples, and monuments. Victory points are awarded for area control of the world, your completed quests and world-building secret objectives, technological discoveries, military victories, Follower's morale, and other achievements. Each God also has their own way to earn VP.  The god with the most VP takes their rightful seat on Mount Olympus.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

And in this board game.&#10;&#10;Honest, committed and capable rulers oppose lying, cheating and scheming fellow citizens. In the struggle for power in the role of Chancellor / Chancelloress, some people will use any means. &#10;As a member of politics, you must assert yourself in this - often unfriendly - environment and also be able to deal with unfair means of competition in order to decide the question of the next Chancellor for yourself.&#10; Based on real political events, you will experience this tension and all these contradictions in Kanzleramt.&#10;Your path to the chancellor's office is long and rocky, and it always leads through the Bundestag. It is important that you get as many members of your own party as possible into the Bundestag. Because in this parlor game they elect the chancellor at the end.&#10;&#10;As in real life, the path to this position is practically never straightforward and is marked by both positive surprises and setbacks. Luck, skill, fighting spirit and a wide variety of political events influence the path of your party's politicians to the Bundestag.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to raise your opponents&rsquo; device risk and hack their devices before they hack you.&#10;&#10;Each player lays out three Device Tokens in their playing area. Next, deal 4 cards face down to each player. Place the remaining deck face down to create the Draw Pile. Then, flip over the top card to start the Discard Pile.&#10;&#10;On your turn, draw one card from the Draw Pile or Discard Pile. Play one card from your hand. You can ATTACK an opponent by raising the risk on one device, DEFEND one of your own devices by lowering or resetting the risk, or DISCARD one card if you cannot or do not want to play a card.&#10;&#10;When a device&rsquo;s risk reaches level 4, it may be hacked. Once a player has three hacked devices, that player cannot win the game. However, they remain in the game and continue to attack the remaining payers until there is a winner.&#10;&#10;The last player remaining with at least one unhacked device wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

The game is based on the idea that workers (warriors) and resources (livestock) are two sides of the same coin. If you send a large number of people to raid an area, you will earn more money, but you will have fewer actions to perform. In addition, the dominance of the colours over the area makes the management of your warband very difficult. Use the sale market to sell your livestock at a high price and invest in various cards to get rich!&#10;&#10;Worker pieces are double sided. On your turn, you choose a number of workers to send to a given space. One worker occupies the space, triggering it's  while the remaining workers flip over to become the depicted resources. These resources can then be sold on a variable market, allowing you to buy skills, more workers, and Estates, which are the main source of victory points.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points after 3 rounds (short &amp; solo games) or 4 rounds (long game) is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

All cards in the set were from the Arabian Nights, Antiquities, Legends, and The Dark expansions (14 from Arabian Nights, 21 from Antiquities, 71 from Legends, and 19 from The Dark). Each card was white-bordered, while the cards in their original sets were black-bordered. Also, each card carried the expansion symbol from the set it was originally printed in.&#10;&#10;The set was printed in English and Japanese only. The Japanese version was black-bordered, because as it was the first time those cards were printed in the language. A similar black-bordered set called Renaissance was released into German, French, and Italian markets. These contained a different array of cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Legend tells of a sinister beast that stalks the caves and canyons of Black Rock, a thriving mining town north from the ruins of Brimstone. Known as The Devil of Black Rock, they say it towers over normal Slashers and has grown mutated beyond recognition. With four razor-sharp scything arms, it eviscerates its prey, feeding on their souls as it shreds their flesh. Layered in a thick shell of light-refracting Void Chiton, The Devil of Black Rock phases through time and space with shimmering speed, warping in and out of reality as it strikes!&#10;&#10;Challenge Pack #2 &ndash; Beast Unleashed is themed for facing off against the infamous Devil of Black Rock and his hordes of beastly minions that all use cards from the new Beast Unleashed Enemy Trait cards set. A Legendary foe, hunting the Devil of Black Rock is not for the faint of heart. It shrugs off attacks with its thick shell while phasing through the Void to activate multiple times per turn, shredding the Heroes with each slash!&#10;&#10;A Challenge Pack is a new themed set of cards with a terrifying new Enemy and a nightmarish new Mission designed to give the Heroes an extra challenge. These cards are all used together for the included Mission; but can also be added to your card decks to increase the challenge across your normal games of Shadows of Brimstone as well. Many of these new cards are marked with a Challenge Icon, to be easily identified as extra dangerous.&#10;&#10;Challenge Packs reward players for having a robust collection of Enemies and Expansions; and contain several Threat cards that include a mix of various Enemies from across the game. Some of these Threat cards even add new bonus ability to the Enemies on the card for thematic ways that they can work together to crush the Heroes.&#10;&#10;The following Expansions are highly recommended to get the most out of this Challenge Pack (though these sets are not required to use this Supplement, most of the Threat cards included in this Challenge Pack do use various Enemies from these other Expansions):&#10;&#10;&#10;     Swamps of Death core set&#10;     City of the Ancients core set&#10;     Blasted Wastes OtherWorld deluxe expansion&#10;     Flesh Mites enemy pack&#10;     Void Swarms and Void Hive enemy pack&#10;     Dark Stone Scorpions XL enemy pack&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They are instruments of pure mayhem on the battlefield, scuttling forwards and reaping a bloody toll with their scythe like appendages, leaving only bloody ruin behind them. Survivors speak of a keening whine, just on the verge of hearing that pervades their memories, a sound that registers deeper than the cries of their fallen comrades. This is the only sound an Abomination can make, the only sound it is allowed to make: a keening howl to convey the depth of their misery and torment.&#10;&#10;Abominations were not originally intended to serve as organic war engines. They were an advanced and cruel form of punishment, devised on a whim by the Sovereign. Ensconced deep within an Abomination lies the body of an Exile who has betrayed his trust or breached the most sacrosanct of Spire laws. Despite significant effort, even the Sovereign's most ardent opponents have not been able to come up with a more cruel punishment and have adopted this cruel torture for their worst enemies.&#10;&#10;Invasive cerebral procedures impairs the cognitive function of the condemned, as chemical and hormonal treatments are applied to make them lose control of their Life-Binding gifts and forcibly bond them to a lower organism. Multiple organisms were proposed and tried but the humble ant was ultimately preferred. While more gruesome examples could be made, it was found that those Abominations bonded to other species were too intractable or self-destructive. The ant's instinctive hierarchical physiology somehow makes it more susceptible to Pheromonic command, forcing the body to respond to orders while allowing compromised psyche trapped within the hellish amalgam only enough control to wail its anguish even while enacting the will of its tormentors.&#10;&#10;",
