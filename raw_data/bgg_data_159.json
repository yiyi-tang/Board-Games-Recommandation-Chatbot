    "Description": "Pet Evil is a social and strategic card game where players fight for world domination. Taking the role of cute mastermind pets players are locked in a nuclear war to the death. The goal is to craft missiles using set collection and devastate opponents with various combinations to be the last player standing.&#10;&#10;The party-style game features classic 'gotcha' style game mechanics and encourages players to form social alliances, be deceitful and to back-stab one another. Cards in the game feature various hand illustrated rocket parts which combine to create missiles of varying damage levels.&#10;&#10;Players target one another with rockets constructed from the parts that they have drawn, stolen from other players or salvaged from the discard pile. Once the rockets are launched, players bargain for their lives and try to convince others why they should be spared. with several special cards which allow players to disrupt trades, change life totals and to redirect damage, Pet Evil is a party game with a constant chaotic struggle for victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;Blitzkrieg in the South is the first in the East Front Battles series, a series which will cover the whole of the Russo-German front in World War II.&#10;&#10;Ground Scale is 5 miles to the hex, turns represent 2 days of real time, units represent division, brigades, regiments, or battalions.  The game covers the Axis assault on the south-west Soviet Union, which began with the attack by Army Group South with 41 divisions (plus allied divisions) against a Soviet force of 60 divisions.  The game concludes in mid-August 1941, at which time, historically, 20 Soviet divions surrendered in the &quot;Uman Encirclement.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game contains a wealth of different unit types - including bridging units, motorcycle infantry, an armored train, a Soviet river flotilla, combat engineers, rocket artillery, anti-aricraft units, et., etc. - as well as the more standard armored, mechanized, and infantry units.  Supply, weather, and terrain all play their part, as do fortifications, strongpoints (these can be built each turn), air power, artillery, reinforcements and replacements, headquarters units, and reserves.  The game sequence includes &quot;reaction movement&quot; by units in reserve status, as well as separate motorized movement phases.  A particularly eleqant piece of design has the Axis motorized movement following standard movement and combat - thus facilitating armored breakthrough; for the Soviets the order is reversed, leading to poorer coordination between tanks and infantry...&#10;&#10;There are 4 scenarios - The Siege of Kiev is an introductory scenario lasting 7 turns, and using only Map B.  Rundstedt Attacks depicts the German assault on perhaps the strongest portion of the Soviet frontier; it last 5 turns and uses only Map A.  Secenario 3, &quot;Optional Deployment,&quot; is a variant of #2.  The Campaign Game lasts 27 turns and uses all 3 maps.  Victory is judged both in terms of combat losses, and the Axis capture of key geographical objectives.&#10;&#10;Historically accurate, fast paced, and playable - Blitzkrieg in the South is a worthy first entry in what will surely become the definitive East Front Series.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; maps&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 20-page rules booklet&#10;One 1-page Turn Record Track&#10;Four 1-page scenario set-up cards (two Soviet &amp; 2 Axis)&#10;&#10;",

The &quot;Chief&quot; player (a &quot;job&quot; that rotates each round) determines whether the lighter or the heavier side of the scale will be declared the winning side at the end of this round.&#10;&#10;During a round, each player places one of their stones onto one of four spaces at the ends of the see-saw. The order of the players is determined by the Chief. Before placing a stone, each player may raise the prize to be won (the currency in this game are wooden discs - &quot;wheels&quot;) in the middle of the game or take one disc. Taking a disc automatically excludes you from winning any discs at the end of the round. Special abilities of the different kinds of stones and the fact that all players play each type of stone over several matches makes this a rather heavy tactical wagering game.&#10;&#10;English rules for 2-4 players will soon be available on the Chili Spiele website as well as here on BGG.&#10;&#10;",

They then read the question aloud to the other players.&#10;&#10;3- The other players chat and have to all agree how they think the Judge has ranked the characters. Reveal the answer. If the players guessed the correct ranking everyone wins the round; if not everyone loses.&#10;&#10;EXAMPLE:  &#10;Q: Who would you choose as the drummer in your rock band? &#10;&mdash;Hermione Grainger &#10;&mdash;George Washington &#10;&mdash;Shrek&#10;&#10;Start a new round, reveal three new characters and the next player becomes the Judge. Play until all players have been the Judge. You all win if you have succeeded more often than failing. It leads to hilarious arguments but it's not easy!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seven Years War is a simulation of the war between Prussia and a Coalition of European states, 1756-1764, published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #163 (Sep 1993). While militarily a stalemate, the war consolidated Prussia's dominance of central Europe until its defeat at Jena and Auerstadt in 1806.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for two players or two teams. The Prussian Allied side, opposes the Coalition side. The objective is to gain control of as many central european fortress cities as possible without losing control of your own. The rules consist of a Standard Game that gives a relatively simple but historically valid game, and an Advanced Game providing a more complete historical simulation. Play centers around the operational activity of moving armies, fighting battles and besieging fortresses. However, this operational activity is heavily influenced by, and is intertwined with, the ever changing strategic choices and actions the players take as the game proceeds. This game is falling through the cracks in recent years. There is a reasonably good Cyberboard gamebox but it would be nice if someone would create a Vassal module as well.&#10;&#10;Operational aspects include leaders, a variable movement table, discipline classes for units, logistics with supply wagons and foraging, and limited intelligence. Forces are comprised of infantry, cavalry, light troops, pioneers and artillery. Combat is modified by battleplan chits, selected before the die is rolled, that allow a player to emphasize line infantry, or more elite units, or cavalry achieving strength bonuses or die roll modifiers. The combat table produces percentage loss and moral checks for one or both sides. One learns that strength is not always the deciding factor. Leadership, high discipline, moral and making use of unit specialization play a big roll. Fortresses can also be captured by siege combat.&#10;&#10;Strategically, the game makes use of random events, diplomacy, (the various European states get pushed in and out of neutrality and switch sides). Winning battles can give a player diplomatic options. As the game proceeds the progress of both sides is recorded on the Balance of Power track which can also modify victory. It is possible for both sides to achieve a victory. The two are then compared to give a final victory. Also, both sides can lose if the Balance of Power track moves too far toward one of the players. Restraint is part of a player's strategic considerations.&#10;&#10;The game is complete by magazine game standards. The errata is light. It is not a simple game and it requires players to be willing to roleplay the point of view of the leaders from that period. There is a four turn short scenario covering the first year of the conflict. A full campaign game can last as long as 28 turns if things are drawn out. It is a highly replayable game.&#10;&#10;Errata and Q&amp;A for 7YW were published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #s 165, 166, 167, and 169.&#10;Additional counters for 7YW were included in Strategy &amp; Tactics #s 170 and 171. &#10;7YW also received extensive coverage in Moves #79.&#10;&#10;",

A single Corn is worth 2 points.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Blindes Huhn has mouse and hawk symbols on the cards for a variety of additional options and rules, making this new edition more than a simple reprint.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "300: The Board Game is a fast and exciting way for 2-4 players to recreate the Battle of Thermopylae as depicted in Frank Miller's epic film. In the 2 player version, one player controls the Spartans and the other player controls the Persians. In the 3 player game, 2 players compete for the most Glory as the Spartans, and in a 4 player game, 2 players also compete as the Persians for the most Spartan kills.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the battle forces (represented by round cardboard Units) are already lined up and ready to fight at the border of the Hot Gates. Each time a Persian Unit dies, the Spartans score Glory Points on the Glory Track that surrounds the board. Spartan Units die permanently, while most defeated Persian Units can enter the game again as reinforcements.&#10;&#10;The Object of the Game for the Spartans is to score 100 Glory (or 50 Glory if there are 2 Spartan players). The Object of the Game for the Persians is to wipe out the Spartans before they can achieve their Glory, or to delay the Spartans long enough for Ephialtes to reach the end of the Goat Path (6 rounds of play). If there are 2 Persian Players, then the player with the most Spartan kills wins this game.&#10;&#10;The game uses cards and dice to simulate the action from the film. Spartan Heroes include Leonidas, Stelios, the Captain, Dilios, and Astinos. Persian Leaders include Xerxes, the Uber Immortal, and the Persian Generals. Each card simulates the action associated with a quote from the film, such as &quot;I Would Gladly Kill My Own Men For Victory&quot; (Persian) and &quot;Tonight We Dine In Hell!&quot; (Spartan).&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly (20 - 30 minutes), and is meant to be a fast diversion with a good share of both tactics and luck.&#10;&#10;Official 2-Player Variants&#10;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/671632/2-player-variants&#10;&#10;",

Optimus Princeps covers the Dacian Campaigns of Trajanus.&#10;&#10;From a translation of the rules:&#10;At the start of Trajan&rsquo;s reign, in Europe there remained only three major barbarian peoples against the might of Rome.  While the Germans lurked in their woodland labyrinths, and the Sarmatian horsemen fled along the infinite plains of the East, the Dacians, hunkered down in the Carpathian mountains, represented the only sedentary barbarian people in Europe who still resisted the Roman invader.&#10;    This enemy offered an ideal target because they could not flee unlike the other semi-nomadic peoples.&#10;&#10;Player's description:&#10;The game has a unit scale of 1 Strength Point = 1000 to 2000 men, or 500 to 1000 horsemen. Game Turns are seasonal, the game covering the campaigns between 101-118 AD. The map represents the area in point-to-point style, while the counters must be mounted &amp; cut from card (mostly double sided). The original game is entirely in French, but a full English translation, with player aids, is available. The original French rules cover 10 magazine pages.&#10;&#10;Units are activated by an Action Point system, alternating between players to move &amp; attack with stacks of counters representing armies.

Different weapons apply a multiplier to the strength. The strength itself has a random component added to a base strength, the latter being derived from the unit's quality. Thus the exact competence of your units is unknown until you try them in battle.&#10;&#10;Army lists in the rules cover all major, and many minor, conflicts in Europe from 1820 to 1920, whilst a separate army list book covers conflicts from the rest of the world, ranging from well-know ones such as the Zulu War and American Civil War through to the Yucatan Revolt and Dutch expansion in the East Indies.&#10;&#10;",

In this version of the game, each player chooses to be a member of the pantheon of Old Gods from H.P.

When in a Team Match, you play with 4 or 6 players teamed up in pairs of two. You will have one Main God and a Support God. A team wins together if they can eliminate the opposing team's Main God.&#10;&#10;Rise of the Old Ones introduces a new game mechanism to this world known as Artifacts.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Railroads was designed to be a game about table talk.  It's about making deals with other players, riding the rise and fall of various authentic nineteenth century railroad companies.  In most railroad board games, one player is one company, and is engaged in pure competition with the other players.  That doesn't make for a very social experience.  Since players are investors in Railroads, they have the opportunity to benefit from semi-cooperative ventures, while hedging out their allies with other investments.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Railroads is not a game about budgets and check books.  Money functions as points and are never spent.  Stock tokens are played and moved in a simplified fashion that means strategy is emphasized and budgeting is eliminated.  Stocks are merely methods of earning money (scoring points) so players can focus on their larger plans.&#10;&#10;Players who play alone in Railroads will not do very well.  Railroads only gain as much track per turn as there are players in the company.  If there is only one player in the company, they only lay one track per turn and will not make a lot of money.  However, if you can get one or two people to join your venture, you can double or triple the speed that your railroads grow, turning your fledgling railroad into a geopolitical force to be reckoned with. Just make sure that when the money dries up, you are the first one out.&#10;&#10;A small number of handmade wooden versions were sold and are available on the second hand market.&#10;&#10;",

Hidden perils confront the Imperial player, who will face traps and ambushes, as they search for the Warmaster.  As the game progresses, the Emperor's dwindling forces will face greater numbers of Traitors as they, the traitors, receive reinforcements.  The Emperor is in a race against time to defeat Horus or die trying.&#10;&#10;The Traitor player wins by killing the Emperor and the Imperial player wins by killing Horus, if both are killed at the same time, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the building of the transcontinental railroad, the owners of the Union Pacific Railroad Company set themselves up as the owners of a construction company &ndash; the Credit Mobilier. They proceeded to award themselves fat contracts, paid for by the U.S. Congress, to construct their own railway.&#10;&#10;In Credit Mobilier, four fictional railways race to construct track and move goods westward while the players invest in the railways and the Credit Mobilier.&#10;&#10;User review: There are five railroads; each of a different color. Four of the railroads have fifteen shares of stock, a treasury card, ten railroad tracks, and several blocks. The fifth railroad, Credit Mobilier, only has the stock and treasury card. The game board represents the United States. One block is put on each of the cities randomly. Each player begins the game with three dollars and a share of Credit Mobilier stock. A start player is randomly chosen and the game begins.&#10;&#10;In turn, each player will roll the five dice. The player will then choose to lay track (which adds to the Credit Mobilier treasury), move freight (which may add to the treasury of the railroad that owns the freight and traversed upon track), buy stock of one railroad (if available) for one dollar each, or pay dividends to the owners of the shares of one company.&#10;&#10;A player&rsquo;s options are limited to which colors are rolled on the dice. Rolling orange is the only color that lets one pay dividends. Purple represents Credit Mobilier and it is also &lsquo;wild&rsquo; but it can only be used as a duplicate of any color rolled except orange.  &#10;Players take turns in clockwise order until there are blocks of two colors which have yet to be transported to the Pacific Coast wherein the game ends immediately. The player with the most cash on hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

One or two players are the runner(s) who have escaped from prison and are attempting to get back to their hideout, and the other player(s) are chasers representing the detectives in pursuit.&#10;&#10;Winning conditions:&#10;&#10;    The runner wins if they reach their hideout.&#10;    The chaser wins if they catch a runner before they reach their hideout.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The Franco-Spanish fleet arrives on time to seize control of the English Channel, and a hell-for-leather landing is made aimed straight at London &ndash; the Kent Campaign ensues! With special post-landing maneuvering and naval conflict abstractions, Albion 20 adds many fascinating new features to simulate this campaign.&#10;&#10;Will the Emperor finally triumph over his arch-rival, &ldquo;Perfidious Albion?&rdquo; Or will there always be an England?&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex is about 1000 meters, and each turn is roughly 3.5 day hours (or 10 night hours).&#10;&#10;",

The game is then played in five rounds over which the two Attorneys debate and argue the case chosen by the Judge by playing pieces of Evidence from their hand and calling Witnesses to the testify. Each piece of Evidence and each Surprise Witness is determined by a card, but it is up to the individual players to decide how they fit into the narrative by continuing to tell a story around the card being played.&#10;&#10;Jury members will align themselves with one of the attorneys, and, at the end of the 5th round, the Judge will call for a vote.

    "Description": "The Trojan War has begun, and both sides of the conflict pursue every advantage they can possibly gain. Two opposing heroes &mdash; Hector of the Trojans and Achilles of the Greeks &mdash; seek the favor of the gods to lend them support and tip the scales of fate. Only one side will emerge victorious, its hero becoming the legend of the Iliad.&#10;&#10;Iliad is a tile-placement strategy game for two-players by Reiner Knizia. On your turn, select one of two tiles from your hand and place it onto the board adjacent to an opponent's tile. Both players have symmetrical pools of tiles, with their strength ranging from 1-5, along with the Dolos tile that mimics your opponent's adjacent tiles. The key to victory lies behind the relentless tension of where and when to commit your tiles. When placing a tile, you may also activate the tile's ability, which can serve to turn the tide of war.&#10;&#10;When a row or column is filled, the player with the highest total strength in that line earns the right to select one of the two success tokens at the ends of that row or column; the other token goes to their opponent. Success tokens can earn you the favor of the Gods, and they can earn (or cost you) points. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has earned the favor of all five Gods. If both players &mdash; or neither of them &mdash; meet this qualification, then the player who has earned the most points wins. Thus, players will face tough tactical trade-offs as they must decide whether to compete for exclusive favor of the Gods or for the most points &mdash; then influence the outcome of the game toward their intended advantage.&#10;&#10;Iliad is the first game in the Mythos Collection, a line of two-player titles by Bitewing Games featuring strategy and mythology.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). &#10;The winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks.

The game comes with multilingual rules (english, spanish, italian, german and french) and instructions to build 10 different F1 circuits.&#10;Each player must set the gear and roll an appropriate number of special dice, that determine the speed of the car and the fuel consuption. The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.&#10;The game is not a &quot;simulation&quot;, but to win you need a good amount of skill. Even if the speed of your car is determined by dice, you have to choose carefully the &quot;braking point&quot; in order to enter the curves at the best speed. If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose &quot;tyres points&quot;. Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your &quot;driving skill&quot; to be competitive. Rookies can win, but they will find very hard to beat a skilled player.&#10;Game components: 65 tiles to build the circuits (an avarege of 25 tiles are needed for each circuit), 6 plastic sport cars, 12 special dice, 6 &quot;dashboards&quot;, 40 speed limit tokens, 24 plastic pawns, one rules booklet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; is an easy fantasy-themed strategy game. You are supposed to assume the role of the militant feudal and to put a halt to the hostile lords&rsquo; encroachments on the throne of the fairy kingdom. Mercenaries will help you: they are ready to spill their blood on the battlefield for a pretty penny and promises of glory.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; vaguely resembles &ldquo;Battles of magicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Memoir&rsquo;44&rdquo;. Lords&rsquo; castles are located on both sides of the game-board. Players can recruit troops and build fortifications there. The battlefield itself is two-sided and it contains special structures, giving bonuses to players who occupy these locations.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game, each player chooses one of the four mercenary factions, which will be his army. Characters of each faction are represented by the cards. They have their own  particularities, strengths and weaknesses. A lot of soldiers have not only ordinary characteristics such as velocity, attack and defence, but also some special abilities (which are very often unique for the army) that can be used during the game.&#10;&#10;The confrontation between barons is very swift. Having recruited troops from hand, a player can move forward and attack. As soldiers can move only forward, so five &ldquo;corridors&rdquo; appear on the battlefield where the major battles occur. But each player can activate only five units during his or her turn, and some characters can change the lines they move along. All these points transform simple mechanics into an interesting tactical puzzle. The more the player is experienced, the more difficult is to solve this puzzle. Moreover, spells, able to change course of action, are available for each player. Soldiers also can be sent to the Catacombs in the hope of finding treasures hidden there.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win: to help your mercenaries to end up beyond the edge of your adversary&rsquo;s field or to get 20 points for having struck adversary&rsquo;s troops and having destroyed his structures.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; is a duel strategy game with low learning curve. Its rules are easy to explain and the game will not take long. Besides, rules also propose different options for three and four players.&#10;&#10;",

To win, eliminate your opponents, or have the most shards when Zodraz appears.&#10;&#10;Each player is a Citadel (city-state) of Fantos. They must hire mercenaries (called Legacies) using Shards from their Citadel Bank. Once hired, Legacies can be tasked to harvest more shards, go to war with a neighboring Citadel or be nominated as the savior of Fantos for Tribute. Legacy may also play Labor cards from the Citadel's hand using their own shard currency.&#10;&#10;Every time a player chooses to harvest shards from the Trove, they must reveal a new card from the Trials Deck. Life on Fantos becomes increasingly difficult as Zodraz unleashes plagues, summons cosmic creatures and forces dissent among the Citadels. Resolve them together, as a planet, or watch as rival Citadels struggle to survive. Plan wisely and make every turn matter because Zodraz is lurking in the Trials deck. When the Cosmic Warden is drawn, judgement is passed (scores are tallied) and the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

Each player commands the forces of several different factions, each faction representing a major entity in this particular conflict whose goal was to gain control of as much of Angola as possible while inflicting decisive losses on the enemy.

The map features all of Angola and the adjoining border regions of Southwest Africa and Zaire. The map scale is approximately 31 miles (50 kilometers) across each hexagon; each brigade or regiment represents from about 1,000 to 3,000 men, depending on the army. A battalion is 300-900 men, whereas a cadre represents small teams of soldiers.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Human Interface: Nakamura Tower (HINT) is a board game that is a unique combination of many elements known from tactical and skirmish games, RPGs and board games. The game is based on a struggle between two powerful megacorporations that takes place in the title tower.&#10;&#10;HINT is designed for 2+ people but through different scenarios can be played alone, in cooperation or against other players. The story happens in the near future when the world is dominated by new technologies.&#10;&#10;In HINT you will lead a team of selected professionals of a given faction. Each of them has unique skills and abilities, each one can be given weapons and other equipment, be enhanced genetically or cybernetically. All characteristics and modifiers are presented on special character and equipment cards (you don&rsquo;t need to constantly flick through the rulebook). Each character card has a limited amount of slots that can be filled with equipment and modifications. The player can purchase additional equipment to replace the current item depending on the &ldquo;group&rsquo;s assets&rdquo;. You may like your heroes or hate them but they will no longer be just anonymous pawns.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board showing the interior of the Nakamura corporate tower that is under attack by its rivals. The characters are moved using spaces on the board. This eliminates the need to measure distance when moving and fighting thus quickening the pace of the game and allowing to avoid misunderstandings. Each space presents a specific tactical situation that influences the characters placed on it.&#10;&#10;Game mechanics are fairly easy as we wanted to achieve a perfect balance between a fun game and rules that enable a lot of tactical possibilities. The basic rules are easy to learn but the possibilities of their use grow significantly in combination with the characters&rsquo; skills and capabilities of equipment. The characters are defined by their basic physical and mental abilities and modifiers, which make it easier or more difficult to perform some tasks, that make them unique. These modifiers result from their skills, special training or cyberations and other equipment. The rules do not use any dice and the testing mechanics are based on cards that we call CanDo. The description on the card, its value and colour influence the final result of the test. The numerical value also states the location of a hit and additional effects connected to it.&#10;&#10;",

Oh, and they'll need to search quickly, too, or else the giants will wake from the sleeping spell cast on them and run the searchers out of the forest. Who can combine speed, control and a good memory to find the imps where they hide?&#10;&#10;To set up, players place the 16 imp tokens in the holes on the game board, cover these imps with the 85 cardboard leaves included in the game, then place one large wooden giant on each corner of the board. On a turn, the active player reveals a search card showing one of the imps. An opponent flips the sand timer, then the player uses her magic wand to push the leaves aside and (fingers crossed!) find the imp on the search card. She can use her wand to move the giants as well, but if they fall off the game board &ndash; or even so much as a single leaf falls &ndash; the giants awaken and chase the player away empty-handed. If the player reveals the target imp, though, she keeps the search card to record her find. After each search, players cover the board again and return the giants to their places. In the end, whoever has collected the most search cards wins!&#10;&#10;Die verzauberten Rumpelriesen includes rules for cooperative play, with the players using their wands together to search for the imps one by one as they're revealed by the search cards. If the players find more than eight imps without the giants awakening, they win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Modern War #15, Jan-Feb 2015&#10;&#10;Red Tide West: The Cold War &amp; World War III in Europe is a wargame that simulates a hypothetical Warsaw Pact invasion of West Germany in the late-1980&rsquo;s. Red Tide West also presumes a wider conflict beyond the scope of the game, but postulates West Germany to be the so-called &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; for the entire war. In other words, regardless of what is happening in, say, Scandinavia, or the Balkans, or the Middle East, etc., the presumption here is that the war will be won or lost in central Europe. To wit, if the Red Army cripples NATO and overruns West Germany, it is assumed that diplomatic negotiations will then suddenly become advantageous to both sides. For the Soviets, they would be satisfied to end the war with their substantial gains, not to mention the distinction of being regarded by the world as having won the war, especially if a nuclear exchange had not yet occurred. NATO, on the other hand (and especially the French) would want to end the war before the Red Army rolled into France proper, and certainly before a full-blown nuclear war erupted (or escalated further, if a limited nuclear exchange had already occurred).&#10;&#10;On the other side of the coin, if the Red Army&rsquo;s drive into West Germany is halted or thrown back, the war will have run its course then and there, regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the world. Negotiations would be underway, regardless, but the Soviets would have very little to gain (and actually much to lose) by perpetuating a war that is then being perceived as the ultimate reproach of the Soviet state and Communist ideology. Indeed, before Soviet battlefield defeats became prolific and pronounced, and especially before NATO units began to push across the borders of East Bloc countries, the Soviets would be confronted with a choice of trying to negotiate an end to the war before the Warsaw Pact alliance collapsed (or worse, defected&hellip;as if a widespread repeat of the Hungarian Uprising of &lsquo;56), or resort to nuclear strikes to avoid a total defeat (a decidedly undesirable solution when considering NATO&rsquo;s predictable response).&#10;&#10;In any case, Red Tide West presumes a short war whereby the final dispositions will be known within a matter of weeks. The Soviet timetables expected the Red Army to reach the French border within 15 days, and therefore the game excludes Soviet &ldquo;Category C&rdquo; and &ldquo;Category D&rdquo; reserves, which could not have been mobilized within the timeframe of the game&hellip; whether or not the Soviet timetables were realistic in the first place.&#10;&#10;The game includes two maps (22&quot;x34&rdquo;) and 560 counters.&#10;&#10;Design &amp; Development: Eric R.
