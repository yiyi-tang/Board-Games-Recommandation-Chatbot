    "Description": "This Edo-era (early 1800s) game is perhaps the earliest to focus on the famous story of the 47 Ronin or Ch&#197;&#171;shingura (The Treasury of Loyal Retainers).&#10;&#10;It is a Mawari-Sugoroku style of game, with die rolls determing movement around the board. Each panel illustrates an episode in the story of the group of samurai who were declared ronin after their master Asano Takumi-no-kami Naganori, the daimy&#197;&#141; of Ak&#197;&#141;, was forced to commit seppuku by the Shogun in 1702.&#10;&#10;They eventually got revenge by killing their former master's treacherous opponent Kira K&#197;&#141;zuke-no-suke Yoshinaka, and then turned themselves in to the authorities knowing that they in turn would be forced into seppuku, which they did as a group.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game contains two variants: 1. Liberation Game, 2. Happy Families (a quartet game). The first variant involves the following:&#10;It is an exciting game for 2 players. The cards are dealt as follows: one player uses the carts with the red backs and the other player the cards with the blue backs. Each player thus receives 26 cards. Each player arranges the cards in 4 rows of 6 cards and below this a fifth row consisting of 2 special cards (the &quot;Magic Potion&quot; and the &quot;Normans&quot;). All cards are placed face down. The aim of the game is to keep Britannia out of Roman Hands and find the magic potion as fast as possible!&#10;&#10;Throw the die and turn over a card from your opponent's first row. If this card matches the symbol on the die, you can remove this card to clear a path to the magic potion. If the symbol and card do not match, turn the card face down again. Play now passes to your opponent. You can place &quot;steps&quot; horizontally, vertically and diagonally. You and your opponent take turns to roll the die and, if you get lucky, remove a card. But watch out for the &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; Cards!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Five Goblin Pirates, marooned on a deserted island by treacherous crewmates, cobble together a raft and set off towards home through the Goblund Gauntlet, a dangerous pass full of sharp rocks, shipwrecks and merciless fellow pirates. Surviving the trip would be great. Collecting a big pile of loot would be better.&#10;&#10;Goblins, Guns and Grog is a solitaire roll-and-write adventure game in which players attempt to navigate a treacherous sea route to make it to the mainland. Each turn, the player rolls dice to &quot;Scavenge&quot; (add items to the inventory), &quot;Attack&quot; (if in possession of cannons), &quot;Loot&quot; (in case of a successful attack), &quot;Move&quot; (along the map track, always straight forward towards the destination), &quot;Adventure&quot; (if the turn has ended on one of the X's scattered along the track). Every turn ends with eating, depleting the meager store of food that, if exhausted, causes the player to lose the game.&#10;&#10;Arriving at the end of the track is somewhat easy and is nominally considered a &quot;win.&quot; But points are only scored for looting the many ships along the way. To engage with these potential prizes, however, the player needs both cannons (to attack) and chests (to store loot). The catch? At the start of the game, the player's &quot;ship&quot; is large enough only to hold a pair of cannons. The ship can be expanded through adding Tetris-like pieces to the hull, slowly expanding the size until the raft has become a formidable warship. But focusing on acquiring lumber, cannons, and chests means passing up opportunities to acquire food. Players must therefore decide when to push their luck and when to play it safe.&#10;&#10;Will you be satisfied to return to the mainland, safely and with a fully belly? Or will you risk it all to answer the siren call of gold?&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the March 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

The player rolls a die to navigate the grid, selecting letters and copying them on a separate, blank grid. Points are scored for each completed word, chosen out of a word bank. The words in the bank are classified as either &quot;aspects,&quot; &quot;elements,&quot; or &quot;methods,&quot; and combining them -- having one word use letters from another -- is the way to score big points.&#10;&#10;After there's no space left on the grid to inscribe more letters, the game ends, and points are tallied. A grading rubric tells the player whether they've passed the test... or failed, and need to take it again.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the April 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

The development of the base game (its own 3rd edition was in 2016) includes:&#10;&#10;     English rules and card list included.&#10;     12 unit cards added.&#10;     1 enemy card added.&#10;     2 boss cards added.&#10;&#10;&#10;The rules set has been slightly modified and the balance between the cards has been adjusted. A set of rules for a short game have been introduced, and a hard mode included. The artwork is slightly altered and some components are changed.&#10;&#10;The publisher says &quot;Spirit Circuit Drive EXE, the publisher edition, is quite different from the doujin editions. Especially, the number of unit cards, the core of the game, greatly increased from 20 to 32, substantially influencing the game play. In addition, English rules and card list are included for overseas players. Spirit Circuit Drive EXE is produced as another game and not another edition. Nonetheless, there are no major differences in the rules, number of players, victory conditions, etc. Also, all doujin editions (including the expansions) are currently out of print. If new expansions are to be released in the future, they are likely to be for the EXE edition.&quot;&#10;&#10;NOTE : whilst the game includes English rules, there is still substantive JP text on the cards themselves.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;The players choose unit cards of various spirits to form parties. Each unit card has unique effects and can be played in various combinations.&#10;&#10;Holding circuit cards with numbers 0 to 4 and 4 colors as your hands, play the cards with numbers and colors matching those of the cards in the play area. If you have a unit card matching the played card in your party, that unit will attack the enemy.&#10;&#10;Thus, play cards to attack and destroy the enemies that appear one after another. You can also gain magical power by card plays and use that power to activate your unit's special ability as well as raise the unit's level to lead the battle advantageously. The enemies' final boss is very powerful. The players need to cooperate and support each other for victory.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#231;&#178;&#190;&#233;&#156;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#149;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#186;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;0&#239;&#189;&#158;4&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#143;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#232;&#183;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#231;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;

    "Description": "Six Sided Summoner is a cooperative tactics game for 1-4 players.&#10;Players control a group of Guardians that must defend a light crystal from waves of AI controlled Shadows.&#10;&#10;Shadows are summoned in waves at one end of the board and move down lanes toward your crystal in the style of moba video games. When a new wave spawns, modifiers are added to the shadows that make them more powerful as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;Players defend their crystal (represented by a set of tiles at one end of the board) using guardians, each of which have unique movement types and abilities. All Guardians can attack by rolling a six sided die, but their special abilities make them suited to different roles. Some guardians can lay traps for shadows to fall into, others can heal allies, others focus on damage and maneuverability. While these are powerful, they are also limited, so you must use them strategically. Try to manipulate the board to slow down enemies and maximize your damage.&#10;&#10;Abilities and shadow modifiers are determined randomly at the start of the game,so every game is going to play a little differently.&#10;&#10;Additionally, while the game is focus on cooperative play, it also includes a 2 player competitive mode in which both players defend their own crystals from each other.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Charm Warders are powerful Chi users who have dedicated their lives to warding off evil spirits. By harnessing and focusing their Chi, they are able to create mystical barriers that prevent spirits from passing. The most powerful of their number can even create powerful Chi Blades, which can cut through many of the defences of otherworldly creatures.&#10;&#10;Since last year's Battle of London, some Charm Warders have felt the barriers between the worlds weakening. These men and women have travelled to Malifaux in search of some way to repair the damage being done to the world.&#10;&#10;As with most spellcasters, the magical talents of the charm warders have increased significantly since they passed through the Breach. Most end up selling their services to the Ten Thunders in exchange for the ability to study the Oni, ghosts, and other strange creatures at their beck and call.&#10;&#10;As a group, the charm Warders are starting to realise that Malifaux itself might be the problem. They have started to research a way to strengthen the barrier between worlds in the hopes of saving Earth... even if it means the loss of Malifaux.&#10;&#10;Ten Thunder Box Set, containing two 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high-quality plastic.&#10;&#10;Set Contains:&#10;&#10;Models&#10;&#10;2 Charm Warders&#10;&#10;Stat Cards&#10;&#10;2 Charm Warders&#10;&#10;Please Note: Miniatures are supplied unpainted and assembly will be required.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "By This Axe: Medieval Fantasy Battle Rules presents a simple, fairly standard wargame ruleset to handle small- to medium-size miniatures battles (optional rules allow play without miniatures).  The rules assume two or more armies will be involved, each with two or more units.  Infantry units contain 3 to 25 figures; cavalry units contain 2 to 15 figures; figures may be arranged as desired but only up to the first three ranks are involved in combat.&#10;&#10;The game assumes 1:5 to 1:20 scale ratios though any type of (consistent) basing is allowed.  Action resolution uses a modified six-sided-dice resolution method; 1 is successful, 6 is failure.  Unit movement takes place in inches; various terrain effects are noted.  The mass combat is fairly abstracted.&#10;&#10;An optional &quot;Command and Control&quot; method relies upon card drafting from a standard pack.  The standard command method assigns a Leadership level which limits actions.&#10;&#10;The game does support individual figures that may represent generals, leaders, and &quot;characters&quot; (generally - mages, priests, etc.); these figures may duel each other.  The game does support (but does not require) fantastic elements and magic, and a variety of non-human &quot;monster&quot; units are described in &quot;Appendix A: Fantasy Supplement&quot;.  Numerous unit types have special abilities that allow units to take special actions or make special movements.  Generally, these all work within the basic framework of the game.  Opposing forces are constructed using a &quot;point cost&quot; method that allows disparate but balanced armies to be fielded.&#10;&#10;Play involves turns, with both players executing some portions of the turn simultaneously, other portions in alternating order.  Each player turn is executed in five enumerated phases that take place in order.  The phase orders are:&#10;&#10;&#10;        Phase 1 (optional) - draw cards&#10;        Phase 2 duels between individual units are resolved&#10;        Phase 3 Ranged fire and magical attack is resolved&#10;        Phase 4 Movement (each side, in turn)&#10;        Phase 5 M&ecirc;l&eacute;e is resolved&#10;&#10;&#10;Units must test morale after sustaining damage; units may route; leaders may attempt to rally.&#10;&#10;The game does not elucidate a winner or formulaic victory situation; presumably this becomes evident through play.  After the battle is concluded, a simple process is used to determine Battle Results.  This process may determine a &quot;victor&quot; for post-game results.  Opposing armies are impacted by the Battle Results, both in survivorship and field location (presumably this allows multiple engagements in a campaign).&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Battle lines are being drawn on Amontep II, a planet rich in the mysterious substance that once held the tides of the warp at bay, and a hundred worlds besides. The Adeptus Mechanicus have become aware of a strange mineral bounty that lies within their domain, and are going to extreme lengths to secure it &ndash; but the Necrons who have long slumbered under Amontep II are rising. The stage is set for a war that could define the future of the Great Rift, and perhaps even the Imperium itself&hellip;&#10;&#10;Forgebane is a great-value boxed set containing 2 armies split across the forces of the Adeptus Mechanicus &ndash; cybernetically augmented post-human soldiers of the Machine God &ndash; and the Necrons &ndash; an ancient, slumbering civilisation of soulless automata whose rousing is changing the face of the galaxy.

The last one standing wins, riding off into the sunset with the rest of their (most likely unconscious) crew.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of Ammo Cards (Like Blanks or Bullets). They load one of these cards in front of them each turn and try to figure out what opponents loaded. Flip your opponents' cards when you think they're playing it safe (blank) and load dangerous cards (bullets) when your friends trust you too much and think you're playing it safe.&#10;&#10;Rushin' Roulette is a bluffing game. You can load safe cards to keep your own characters safe, but if your strategy is obvious, your friends will flip your card to save themselves. So if you think they'll take your card, load a bullet instead. Each character has a Safe and Shot ability that activates depending on the cards you flip. Generally, shot characters go to the grave while safe characters stay in your lineup. The last player with characters in their lineup wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, someone leads a card, and players must follow suit if possible. For each Beutelschneider (cutpurse) you collect, you must subtract 20 points from your score for the round, which could put you in the red; the Beutelschneider is the highest ranked card in each of the non-trump suits, though, so ideally it will allow you to collect the 10-point gold sacks that rank far above the cards worth 1-4 coins.&#10;&#10;Many of the trump cards in Beutelschneider have special powers, and the deck even includes a bunch of violet special cards that can be added to gameplay if desired. To do this, shuffle the deck of special cards separately, then give each player one before dealing out the other cards like normal.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Anarchess takes place in the land of Chess long before the enemy White and Black kingdoms were formed. Back when the land was not ruled by kings and queens, neither structured armies with bishops, knights and rooks existed. The world was unexplored and amorphous and it had not been squeezed yet into the rigid cast of the contemporary chessboard. There were just 2 proud tribes constantly struggling to expand their territories to ensure survival in a barren and harsh land. And those who today we (somewhat degradingly) call &quot;pawns,&quot; were free entities with dreams, fears and hopes who defined their own destiny.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 32 light- (&lsquo;white&rsquo;) and 32 dark-colored (&lsquo;black&rsquo;) square tiles and 8 light- (&lsquo;white&rsquo;) and 8 dark-colored (&lsquo;black&rsquo;) pawns.&#10;&#10;Update: Anarchess has now been playtested and confirmed to also be highly playable and fun with 3 and 4 players. In a 3-player game each player gets 6 pawns, while in a 4-player game each player gets 5 pawns.&#10;&#10;It takes just 5-10 minutes to learn how to play. A game lasts about 30-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can perform 2 actions:&#10;A. Tile Placement&#10;B. (Optional) Pawn Action (placing a new pawn, moving or attacking)&#10;&#10;The game ends after a player places the last available tile. Players earn points by controlling areas (i.e., having the most pawns in them) comprising two or more tiles. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

At the end of the game, be the bravest and help Nabang in pushing Smong back to the ocean and gain the most victory points to win the game.&#10;&#10;Smong is inspired by a folklore from Simeuleu island that warns the natives about the danger of tsunami. By learning about the story since their childhood, the local people of Simeuleu learned about tsunami and the necessary steps to take during an earthquake and incoming tsunami.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It was created by five doctoral students and produced by the Nancy student association Big Brother. This game was created by Quentin Dumont, Micka&euml;l Lebdar, G&eacute;raud Le Falher, Tania Louis and Camille Paoletti, advised and supervised by St&eacute;phane Goria (researcher at the Mediation Research Centre of the University of Lorraine) and Marie-Laure Lenertz (Communication Officer at the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology of the University of Strasbourg) as part of a training for doctoral students during the &quot;Science &amp; You&quot; days at the University of Lorraine in Metz in 2015. Using black humour, this game highlights the problem of infertility in some parts of Africa (contrary to stereotypes and other preconceived ideas, research shows the health and social urgency associated with this problem). The scientific elements conveyed by the game are based on the research work undertaken by Emmanuelle Simon (researcher at the Centre de recherche sur les m&eacute;diations of University of Lorraine).&#10;It is a humorous game in which each player plays a character or a pair of characters whose particular winning conditions and other characteristics are represented on a tablet on which the cards drawn during the game are placed. The game also requires 2 dices.&#10;&#10;",
