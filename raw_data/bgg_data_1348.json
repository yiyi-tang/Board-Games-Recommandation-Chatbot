Each round, every player plays five cards from their hand, and each played card allows the player to perform one of the many actions of the game. An action can have a variety of effects, which depend on the symbols on the board. At the end of the round, a player can take back all the cards except for one. One card has to remain on the board, which means that you give up one possibility of doing that action, but also that that very action will be carried out with greater strength. Fortunately, you can acquire new cards with additional powers to perform more actions.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players co-operate to empty a vault of gold before the time is up. The laser locks have to strategically be opened and closed according to dice rolls, so the carts can move between the vaults. The elevator also has to be moved up and down several times to get all the gold out. The same dice control both the locks and the elevator, so the most efficient use of the dice has to be quickly chosen upon.&#10;&#10;When in turn, a player always rolls the two colour dice. A die can be used to open or close a matching laser lock on the track, or to move the elevator to the next level, if the colour matches. Further, the player can move their own cart along the tracks on their turn. They try to open a way to an opened vault with gold, and move there to load their cart. With a loaded cart they try to move to the elevator console in the middle of the board, and unload the gold off their cart there. When a cart is being moved, it can move freely along any tracks, until its way is blocked.&#10;&#10;A free app needs to be downloaded for full play. The app functions as a timer, but also tells the players when their (non-player) partners on street level have managed to open a new vault. Gold can only be fetched from the opened vaults.&#10;&#10;The elevator can only take 3 gold pallets at a time, and 12 pallets need to be brought to street level, before the time is up. If the players manage to bring up the 10th-12th pallets before the time is up, they win! If the 15 minutes are up before that, the players lose...&#10;&#10;",

The game is driven by the Player Turn cards, which, in combination with the player's unique Accord card, dictate what the player can and must do during their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the player must add one card from their hand to a player's Coterie (theirs or another player's - there are benefits and drawbacks to either).  After adding a card to a Coterie, if the player has 3 or more cards in their Coterie, they return all cards in their Coterie and receive a number actions based the cards that were returned. For each Action, a player can play a card to their Structures.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out for the second time, the game ends and players score points for their Accord Icons, Wealth, and Structures.  The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Zombies, Vampires, and Meteorites is an apocalyptic survival board game, with an engaging balance between luck and strategy. All players start off as Human and explore the board to be the first to survive 12 months of the Apocalypse. However, the Zombie City and Vampire Graveyard is out there and players who discover these locations become those fearsome horrors. And if that&rsquo;s not enough to make you fret, then have fun dodging the pesky meteorites that continually change the course of the game!&#10;&#10;At the start of a player&rsquo;s turn, they roll the 6-sided Movement Dice and move that many spaces. If they land on an unexplored space, they pull at random a location and build the map. Locations can consist of Elements, Villages, Mountains, Zombie City, or Vampire Graveyard. Then, for a Human player, they decide how to use any collected Elements to work toward Survival Points or decide to attack another player before ending their turn. On a Zombie&rsquo;s turn, they roll the movement dice, moving 1 less than the number rolled, but can control up to 6 Zombies in a single turn. Their turn ends when all movements and attacks are used.  For the Vampire, they roll the movement dice, moving 1 more than the number rolled, and decide whether to Suck Blood for Energy or Attack a player using Energy to obtain a Coffin. Their turn ends when all movements or attacks are used.&#10;&#10;In the scenario a player rolls a SURVIVE! on the Movement Dice, they immediately roll the two Coordinate dice to determine where a Meteorite or Supply Crate lands on the board before concluding that player&rsquo;s turn automatically.&#10;&#10;The Game ends when a Player achieves the requirements to survive the apocalypse. For the Human, it&rsquo;s collecting 12 months of Supplies (a combination of Elements, Supply Crates, and Defenses). For the Zombie, it&rsquo;s Replicating in each Human Village and returning all 6 Zombies to the City. And the Vampire must obtain Blood Drops and all 5 Human Coffins before concluding their turn in the Graveyard.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#176; (VOGU) is a tile placement game from Japan about sneaker dealers (the game box is styled to look like a shoebox).&#10;&#10;The game has a deck of cards showing sneakers in two colours (red/yellow, green, blue for example). Players are dealt a hand of cards, and on their turn either play a card to the table, or place a card in front of themselves and gain a matching colour token to multiply their end score.&#10;&#10;Cards that are placed must match their neighbouring cards. As each card is placed, the popularity of the colours alters on a chart.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players have 4 cards left in total, in hand and in front of them. They multiply out the colours they hold plus tokens, against the colours' scores on the chart.&#10;&#10;By placing a card in front, a player gains a multiplier, but shows the other players which colours they favour. Players must balance trying to improve colours place on the chance, against holding good scoring cards at the end.&#10;&#10;The publisher includes a webtool to help calculate the end scores.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;In the ever-changing fashion world, you are a sneaker dealer.&#10;Place cards with colorful sneakers every turn and control the color trends by combining adjacent cards.&#10;Read the ever-changing value of colors and the speculations of other players, and get around to get the highest value for your sneakers.&#10;&#10;&#231;&#181;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#176;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#175;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#143;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#154;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#147;&#141;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#136;&#187;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#190;&#161;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#230;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#170;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#190;&#161;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Torch &amp; Blade is a pen and paper, solitaire, dungeon delving game set in a sword and sorcery world. You control intrepid adventurers braving dark and perilous dungeons in an attempt to bring back precious loot and complete arduous quests. The game can be played as a chronicle, an endless chronicle, or a short play campaign. No matter what game mode you choose, you will play several individual sessions, called acts.&#10;&#10;During each act you will guide an adventurer through a randomly generated dungeon. The playing time for a single act, once you are familiar with the rules, should be between 60 and 120 minutes.&#10;&#10;During a chronicle you will control several characters, alternating among them. At any point you will only have 2 to 4 active characters to pick from, and they will all either succumb or successfully retire and get replaced by new adventurers. A full chronicle can last anywhere between 24 and 192 acts, mostly falling around the middle of those extremes.&#10;&#10;A short play campaign lets you complete a full campaign in a shorter time frame. You will control a single character until they either succumb or successfully retire. In this game mode there are no overarching legacy elements, apart from the progress made by your character. A short campaign lasts between 1 and 8 acts.&#10;&#10;An endless chronicle lets you keep the legacy element of the standard chronicle, but it doesn't have a fixed end. You can keep creating new characters without end and keep playing until you get bored!&#10;&#10;Designed for the 2021 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.&#10;&#10;",

The investigator must keep on defeating them until there are not enough (fewer then 4) cultists left to complete the ritual. The investigator must deduce the elder signs connected to each cultist in order to defeat them.&#10;&#10;A game consists of several rounds in which the cult leader and the investigator take alternating turns playing their cards.&#10;&#10;If there are 4 cultists in play simultaneously, a Great Old One is placed at the end of the row. If the investigator cannot deduce all the remaining face-down ritual cards in his next turn right away (without revealing a card) the dark ritual is complete and the cult leader wins the game.&#10;&#10;If the investigator manages to defeat 5 cultists by deducing all the ritual cards allocated to them, the cultists will not have enough power to summon their master and the investigator wins.&#10;&#10;Face-2-Face was specifically designed with Essen Spiel &lsquo;19 in mind.&#10;&#10;",

Four clans make up the island: Rock, Water, Forest, and Earth.&#10;&#10;In the darkness, quiet battles rage, with Lords, Warriors, Farmers, and even Children playing their part. Loyal as dogs, the towering Kyojuu fight alongside human masters. These mythical creatures protect their clans with unmatched strength. Remembering former times of peace, the Kyojuu are powerless in the presence of Children.&#10;&#10;To start the game, each player places their 9 pieces face down within their designated 3x3 home area. Once placed onto the board, these pieces cannot be flipped over again except when attacking, being attacked, or by the special use of an action card. Each turn, players decide whether to roll and advance their pieces, battle another player, &ldquo;pinch&rdquo;, or instead play an action card. When attacking, players reveal the face of one of their pieces that is next to an opposing player's piece. The opponent then reveals their face, and the lower-ranked piece gets removed from the board. The only way to oust a Kyojuu from the board is to &ldquo;pinch&rdquo;, which is when two Children from any clan surround a Kyojuu. This move can be made at any point in the game. Through battles and card play, each player&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to reach the center square of an opponent&rsquo;s 3x3 square home territory. The first player that lands on the center square of an opponent&rsquo;s territory is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Webster that are among the most popular air battle board games of all time. This expansion kit allows folks who want to get deeper and into more complexity with their games to do so while still using the intro rules found in the base Buffalo Wings game itself.&#10;&#10;To that end, we've included more &quot;Aircraft Data Cards&quot; (the handy charts which capture everything that makes one plane different from another), plus the bombers in the expansion game now perform as individual planes (they are rather generic in the base game).&#10;&#10;Best of all, the new map and ADC cards are still fully compatible with the entire Fighting Wings series of games!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "More Cards Box 1 is the first expansion to Poetry for Neanderthals.&#10;&#10;Poetry for Neanderthals is a competitive word-guessing game where you can only give clues by speaking in single syllables. So, instead of saying &quot;broccoli,&quot; you'd say something like &quot;green thing you eat for live long and have good health.&quot; If you mess up and use a big word, such as &quot;vegetable,&quot; you get bopped on the head with a NO !Stick and you lose points.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to score the most points by correctly interpreting words and phrases. The chosen Poet starts off the game with a Poetry Card and tries to get their teammates to say the listed word, using only words with one syllable within a 90-second time limit.&#10;&#10;The box contains 500 new double sided cards. That&rsquo;s 2000 new words and phrases to use with Poetry for Neanderthals.&#10;&#10;",

The winner of a trick take a face up display card into their Showcase row, while the loser takes the top card of talon into their hand unseen. Then another display card is dealt. After thirteen tricks, in the second phase, the last thirteen tricks are played out exposed using the previously won cards in each's Showcase row.&#10;&#10;There are several unique constraints that guide the flavor and strategy of the game: Phase 1 is played &quot;All trump&quot;: a player has to follow suit but if they can't and play another suit that card automatically wins.  Only these ruffed tricks count as points in the first phase. In the second phase, the player with the least points in the first phase gets to choose trump (among any of the four suits, no-trump, or a repeat of the all-trump of the first phase).  All tricks count 1 point in the second phase. The other interesting constraint is that if a player leads a suit that the other player has in their showcase row, the other player must follow suit. Otherwise they may play any card.&#10;&#10;",

The Vikings of East Anglia, under Alfred&rsquo;s longtime nemesis Guthrum, now saw an opportunity with their Viking Allies to strike back at their Saxon antagonists.&#10;&#10;Lundene had been held as a defensive base by the Vikings since 871AD; by reinforcing the existing walls in the old Roman town they commanded a strategic asset which controlled the Thames River from both trading and military perspectives.

When they are leading the warriors in combat your moral and thereby fighting ability is increased, without them it is weakened.

The game has been written to provide a playable experience with a low commitment entry point.&#10;&#10;This free rulebook provides all the basic rules needed to play and includes stats for all of the Factions, otherwise known as Circles in Elf King Red.&#10;&#10;So once again strap on your Faeblade of Starmetal, don your Glamourbound Armour and prepare your magick, for Red War and The Fall of All.&#10;&#10;",

By providing entertainment for the delegates from seven different worlds, a player tries to curry favour. But if they give too much to one of the aliens, they will be penalised for favouritism. They will lose points, and their rivals may gain.&#10;&#10;The game follows normal trick-taking rules, players following the colour lead. The cards shows an alien and the amount of hospitality the player is offering. Winning the trick gets the player the host spot and the cards go to their tableau.&#10;&#10;Rounds end when a player exhausts their hand. The game end when somebody reaches enough points or enough rounds are played. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;However, the different alien races trigger effects, either when the card is played or scored. For example, a player might be forced out of a round, or lose points for having too many cards of one alien. This means players have to make more choices than simply playing high cards.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Such a soul is already a light in front of the wind, but if you give it power, it will bloom beautiful flowers. On the contrary, if you take power, it will soon die.&#10;&#10;You cannot survive in the castle without strong power. Let's create a new technique from Reason and Instinct. There is some danger in learning the art of Instinct. The ending changes depending on whether you follow Reason or Instinct.&#10;&#10;If you have been exploring the castle for a long time, you will be oppressed by karma.

    "Description": "Spirit Fire is a non-linear, open-world board game system in which you explore compelling fantasy realms on an introspective journey of discovery, wonder, and mystery. Your choices matter, because instead of following a story, you ARE the story.&#10;&#10;This is a substantive, emotionally-driven experience with aspirations beyond the expected iterations on tactical combat and standard gameplay. To emphasize this vision, there is no combat. Instead, this experience finds conflict, pressure, and suspense in the countless other types of difficult challenges life asks us to overcome, including the tensions we face deep within ourselves. In the world of Spirit Fire, wisdom is your only weapon.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s system has two principal pieces: your character box, and realm boxes. With the first, you create your character, with whom you explore the open-world realm boxes. Across the realms, you tell your story in a campaign of your own creation, exploring where you want, pursuing the quests and ideals of your choosing, in an experience some have compared to an MMORPG (like World of Warcraft), but most agree defies easy classification.&#10;&#10;Spirit Fire seeks to provide the greatest single player experience available, inspired by a love of TCGs, MMOs, rogue-lite-like loops, metroidvania map development and discovery, fantasy fiction, and&mdash;more than anything&mdash;a desire for something truly new and fresh.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll explore a series of open-world maps, uncovering new locations and quests in worlds that evolve based on your discoveries and actions. As your character grows, you will craft your deck and bring it to bear against countless unique challenges in the game&rsquo;s spiral bound book. Each quest or encounter card introduces variables that create a unique variation of one of the book&rsquo;s dozens (and dozens) of challenge spreads, which vary wildly in style and function depending on the type of activity you are engaged in. Each challenge or activity you&rsquo;re attempting (evading a threat, deciphering a lost language, negotiating with telepathic wolves, and so forth) recontextualizes your card play, giving you a constant stream of fresh opportunities for creative response without requiring you to learn a bunch of new mechanics all the time.&#10;&#10;With drop-in / drop-out multiplayer (meaning seamless transitions between solo and cooperative play, if you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;never solo alone&rdquo;-er), multiple open-world realms coming at launch (with many more in development), and a plan for a continuous stream of quest packs that can by played in any realm, Spirit Fire is a deeply customizable, on-going experience from the award-winning creators of Vindication and Unsettled.&#10;&#10;What will you do, in this dark world, with the flame you carry?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They can draw their unique markings, shapes and doodles that will help them remember what is on the other side. The tiles are then placed face-down. In the second part of the game they spin the spinner and find the character that the arrow points to among the face-down tiles. The player with the most tiles at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game mode, extra tiles are added, with only some tiles marked, and additional rules apply that make the game even more challenging.&#10;&#10;The rules include additional variants for a single player and cooperative gameplay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
