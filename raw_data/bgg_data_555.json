    "Description": "A mancala game from Beni Amir &amp; Mensa (the place in Eritrea, not the club). From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Beni_Amir_%26_Mensa):&#10;&#10;&quot;Qelat is a common name for mancala variants played in western Eritrea. In Bil&eacute;n it is the plural of qeltay, the name of the seeds used in the game. This particular variant is played among the Beni Amir and Mensa people, mainly by elders and young boys in their leisure time, as well as by males generally, especially during the period after marriage ceremonies. The elders often played it for large stakes, such as a hundred cows or a piece of land.&#10;&#10;It was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 as Qelat II (Game 11) who stated that &quot;the counting of balls in the course of play is fully permissible.&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Qelat is played by two players.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of two rows of six holes. Initially, there are 4 seeds in each hole.&#10;&#10;Qelat is a two-directional game played on a twelve-hole board without pre-designated storehouse holes. As the game proceeds, each player creates up to six storehouse holes, called waldas.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players sow only from one of the six holes on their own side of the board, but not from waldas. Seeds from the three holes on a player's right are sown counter-clockwise, whereas seeds from the three holes on a player's left are sown clockwise. Qelat is a single lap mancala game.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture holes, which is done, as in many games, by dropping the last ball in any hand into a hole containing three balls which are thus increased to four. Such captured holes, corresponding to the weg of other areas, are known as walda, but can be captured only in certain parts of the board.&#10;&#10;The leftmost and rightmost holes on either player's own side of the board, as well as the outer two holes on the opponent's side of the board are eligible to become waldas for that player.&#10;&#10;Thereafter seeds accumulate in walda(s) from the sowing of both players. Waldas are not skipped as incorrectly stated by Mohr.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who accumulates the largest number of balls in his walda(s).&#10;&#10;Unlike many other mancala games, a player who is unable to move passes turns until a legal move is available. When neither player can move, the game is over. At the end of the game, the player who has captured the most seeds wins.&#10;&#10;Pankhurst didn't say how to avoid repetition of board positions. It is suggested to use the following rule from another mancala game (Mazagebh I (Game 12)) of the same region: When a player moves a ball across the end of the board to his opponent's opposite hole the latter player is forbidden to shift the ball back in the following move.&quot;&#10;&#10;Pankhurst, R. 1971. 'Gabata and Related Board Games of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa', in Ethiopia Observer; 14 (3): 204.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game from Keren. From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Keren)&#10;&#10;&quot;Mancala variants are often played in the Keren-Agordat area of western Eritrea. Most players are herdsman taking their cattle to water, newly married couples and their friends, and housewives in their homes.&#10;&#10;Qelat is usually played in holes in the ground, but wooden boards are also known. The following game was observed by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 who called it Qelat II (Game 5). It might be related to Um el Banat (&quot;game of women&quot;), a mancala game to be found in northern Sudan.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Qelat is played on a two-row board with six playing holes per row called b&eacute;t in Bil&eacute;n (literally &quot;house&quot;) and two larger holes at the end of the board to store captured balls. Initially there are four balls in each b&eacute;t. The balls are called til in Bil&eacute;n, if they are dry goat droppings or shesher, if they are small stones.&#10;&#10;The balls are always sown one by one in an anti-clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;If the last ball falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last dropped ball are picked up and continued to be distributed into the following holes.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last seed falls into an empty hole.&#10;&#10;The players try to capture enemy holes by increasing their contents to four with the last sown ball in any hand. Captured holes are known as ekwarna, literally &quot;a child is born to me&quot;.&#10;&#10;A move may not start from an ekwarna with the result that balls would tend to accumulate in such holes. A player dropping the last ball in any hand into one of his own ekwarna might say lagadi yekura, literally &quot;grow up my children!&quot;.&#10;&#10;When the last ball falls into an ekwarna captured by his opponent he would &quot;eat&quot; (qunna in Bil&eacute;n) one of the counters in that hole, and put it, together with the ball effecting this capture, aside as his takings.&#10;&#10;A player's ownership of an ekwarna continues even if it becomes empty. Thus balls subsequently entering such a hole, belong to the player who had captured it, while his opponent on dropping the last counter of any lap there would put this counter aside as his takings.&#10;&#10;It is not permitted to pass as long as a player has a legal move.&#10;&#10;The round comes to an end when all the balls are captured either by being put aside or accumulated in ekwarna. The players then count out their total earnings by placing them back in their holes, four counters per hole. Pankhurst reported:&#10;&#10;&#10;        A player who had captured more than his original number of counters would gain one hole from his enemy for every four balls he captured. Should a player have won three extra counters his opponent, who had an extra counter, was obliged to cede to the player with tree who thus acquired an additional hole. If, on the other hand, the two players were each left at the end oft the round with two extra balls they would draw lots to decide to whom they should belong and who in consequence should gain the hole at issue. &#10;&#10;&#10;Eventually, the player who gains a monopoly of all the balls and hence of all twelve holes is declared winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game. From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Rio_Kadalis:&#10;&#10;Rio Kadalis (&quot;helping a female goat to give birth&quot;) is a mancala game, which is played by the Habr Awal tribe and other clans in Hargheisa and in the Jigjiga area in Somalia. The game was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971. Similar games exist in western Eritrea and in some parts of Ethiopia (Tigre, Shoa), e.g. Lahemay Waladat, Lam Waladach, and Lamosh.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Rio Kadalis is played on a board of two rows of six holes (the Habr Awal also use sometimes just five). There are four stones in each hole at the outset of the game.&#10; On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes anti-clockwise (some Somalis also play clockwise), one at a time, into the following holes.&#10;&#10;If the last stone is sown into an occupied hole, its contents are distributed in another lap.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last stone falls into an empty hole or makes a group of four stones, a situation referred to in Somali as binikh (&quot;wasting&quot;).&#10;&#10;Any groups of four made during a turn belong to the owner of the row, except a group of four effected by binikh, which is won by the player whose hand it was.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player can't move at his turn. The stones that remain are won by the player on whose side of the board they are.&#10;&#10;The player who wins more fours wins the round.&#10;&#10;For the next round each player fills his holes with four stones from his winnings. Any holes that could not be filled are closed down with sand, but can be re-opened in a later round.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to close down all the opponent's holes, that is, to reduce his provision to less than four stones.&quot;&#10;&#10;Pankhurst, R. 1971.

The Ijaw are with over 8 million people the fourth largest ethnic group of the country. Their armed militants, which form the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, are fighting against the destruction of the natural environment of the Niger delta by the petroleum industry.&#10;&#10;The game was first observed in the January of 1946 by K. C. Murray, the son of the famous English game historian Harold James Ruthven Murray (1868-1955). In Germany, Obridjie was mentioned in a game book in 1980. It was misspelled Obridjic in the description, while it was written correctly in the index of contents. Since then, the wrong spelling has been copied many times.&#10;&#10;Obridjie is very similar to other Nigerian mancala games, such as Whyo (Oron clan, Ibibio), Jerin (Yoruba) and Lok (Jaba). It is a simple game which is preferred by women. A similar game is known by the Anuak at the Ethiopian-Sudanese border as Anywoli.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;&quot;The game board consists of 2x6 smaller holes and a store hole at each end. Initially there are four seeds in each of the smaller holes. A player owns the row closest to him and the store to his right.&#10;&#10;At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his smaller holes and distributes it, one by one, counterclockwise into the following holes, but not in the stores. If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last distributed seed is continued to be distributed.&#10;&#10;If at any time during a turn a hole contains four seeds, its contents are captured by the player who owns this hole. The captured stones are immediately put into the player's store.&#10;&#10;Exception: If the last seed of a lap makes a four, these seeds are captured by the player who was moving, no matter where the hole is.&#10;&#10;A move ends when the last seed is dropped into an empty hole or makes a four.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the players can't move.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player who captured most seeds. The seeds which are still in the smaller holes are not counted.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

It was described as Sad&eacute;qa V (Game 84) by Richard Pankhurst, who stated that it used to be a popular pastime at the court of Abba Jifar. While the king had wooden boards called bolo sad&eacute;qa, boys simply dug holes in the ground, and women were not allowed to play the game at all.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board of 2x10=20 holes. Initially each hole contains four seeds.&#10;&#10;Seeds (lon) are distributed counter-clockwise, one by one, in a multi-lap fashion into the following holes until the last seed is dropped into an empty hole, a warana (&quot;speared&quot;) or an opponent's hole containing exactly three seeds thus making four (a warana). A move may begun from any hole of your own side, except a warana.&#10;&#10;A warana can only be made on the opponent's side and is said to be owned by his creator.&#10;&#10;When the last seed falls into a warana that is owned by his opponent, he captures it and another seed of that warana. If the warana was empty, the player captures only one seed. In any case the player makes a bonus move by starting from any hole of his side which is not a warana.&#10;&#10;The move ends if the last seed is dropped into an empty hole, creates a warana or falls into a warana which is owned by the player.&#10;&#10;Passing is not permitted as long as there is a legal move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all remaining seeds are in warana, i.e. neither player has a legal move left.&#10;&#10;Each player has as many points as he has captured seeds and has seeds in his warana at the end of the game. The player with most points wins.&#10;&#10;Strategy:&#10;&#10;A warana is an important mean of winning the game - or losing it! Often it is hard to judge whether they help you or your opponent more. Usually, it is good for you to create a warana only if it is located in your opponent's first three holes.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game. From: http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Pasu_Pondi&#10;&#10;&quot;Pasu Pondi (&quot;sweep four&quot;) is an old Indian indoor game mostly played by Tamil women in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, South India. Sometimes it is also played in the open as well. However, the game is usually not played at night. Play often continues for several hours and the players may be surrounded by many spectators who &quot;observe, assist and enthuse&quot; them.&#10;&#10;The game was first described by Dr L. S. Saraswathi in 1995.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a two rows board. Each row has seven holes.&#10;&#10;According to Saraswathi every hole usually contains five seeds at the beginning, although six may be used, too.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the seeds from one of his holes in a clockwise direction into the following holes. When all seeds have been sown, the contents of the next hole are picked up and distributed in another lap.&#10;&#10;The turn ends when the last seed falls into a hole which is succeeded by an empty one.&#10;&#10;During sowing the contents of any hole that contains exactly four (pasu) seeds are immediately captured by the player who owns the hole.&#10;&#10;If, after the turn was finished, the hole following the empty one is occupied, the contents of this hole are captured. This is called pondi (&quot;sweep&quot;).&#10;&#10;The game ends when all seeds are on one side of the board.&#10;&#10;The remaining seeds are captured by the player who owns their holes.&#10;&#10;The winner of a game is the one who captures more seeds.&#10;&#10;Pasu Pondi is played in rounds. In the next game, the players fill their holes with the seeds they captured in the previous game. Again, there must be five seeds per hole. These holes which cannot be filled are closed. The play goes on until one of the players cannot fill even one pit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A manqala game. From http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Sat-gol:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sat-gol was described by Professor Hem Chandra Das Gupta. He was the first Indian full-time Professor of Geology at Presidency College, Founder of Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Society and Geological Institute. &#10;The information about sat-gol comes from the village of Gosalpur, in the Jubbulpur district, Central Provinces. &#10;Nowadays Gosalpur is in the Jabalpur district of Madhya Praddesh, in North Central India. &#10;No cultural background is given.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board is made of seven circles (note that he doesn't say &quot;holes&quot; but &quot;circles&quot;) arranged in a circle. &#10;At the beginning, there are four stones in each circle. &#10;On your turn you take all the pieces from any circle and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each circle. When you have sown all the pieces on your hand, you take the ones in the next circle and keep on sowing with them. &#10;The turn ends when the last stone is dropped in a circle which is followed by an empty one. &#10;If the empty circle is followed by an occupied one, its contents are captured. &#10;According to the original description it is not permitted to choose the hole from which the move begins. You must take the first non-empty hole after the hole where the opponent finished her last move. This would lead to a single game that would be played exactly the same all the time. V&iacute;ktor Bautista i Roca therefore suggested: &#10;     You can choose from which hole the sowing is started. &#10;     The game ends when both players agree that it is impossible to capture more pieces and the remaining stones are not counted. &#10;According to Murray's misinterpretation of Das Gupta's description &quot;the player captures the contents of the hole beyond, or if there is a sequence of empty holes, the contents of the first loaded hole&quot;. Das Gupta says, clearly, &quot;he will be in possession of the pieces lying within the circle immediately next to the latter&quot;. &#10;The player who captures more pieces wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game. From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Selus:&#10;&#10;&quot;Selus is a generic name given to mancala games which are played on three-row boards. Apparently, the word derived from Geez selus which means &quot;three&quot;. [NB: This makes sense since Ge'ez is an Afro-Asiatic language and this is then cognate with Hebrew shelosh.]&#10; In 1972, Richard Pankhurst wrote an excellent 53-page article on Ethiopian mancala games, including games from Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia. He gave the rules of 103 games, of which 12 were three-row games or &quot;Selus&quot;.&#10;&#10;In the 1970s, Selus was still played in the highlands of Eritrea and in certain regions of modern Ethiopia, notably northern Tigre, Dorz&eacute; and Kulu Konta.&#10;&#10;This particular variant was reported from the city of Massawa, Eritrea. It was described as Game 13 by Pankhurst.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board has 3x6 holes. Initially there are three seeds in each hole. Each player owns the row closest to him and the three holes of the central row at his right hand.&#10;&#10;Each move starts with a player emptying the contents of one of his holes that is not a wegue (&quot;wound&quot;). Then, the seeds are dropped one by one into the following holes.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into an occupied hole other than a wegue, the player takes up its contents and distributes these seeds in a new lap. Let's suppose you start the move in your left corner: the seeds are first distributed in your own back row from left to right, then in your central holes from right to left, afterwards in your opponent's back row from right to left and finally in your opponent's central row from right to left (see the diagram).&#10;&#10;It is not permitted to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.&#10;&#10;The move ends if the last seed is dropped into an empty hole. This is called kwah, an onomatopoetic word that imitates the sound of the stone alighting on the board.&#10;&#10;Wegues are created when the last seed distributed falls into a hole of three, thus making four seeds. The creator is called the owner of the wound who marks it in a distinctive way. Creating a wegue ends the move. A wegue can be created on either side of the board.&#10;&#10;If the last seed of a move is dropped into a wegue, the player captures this seed and, unless the wound was empty, one of the seeds it contained. Capturing is permitted from any wegue, irrespective of the owner. The player must move again (beginning with any hole of his side which is not a wegue) if he captured from a wegue he owns, but must stop moving, if he captured from a wegue owned by his opponent.&#10;&#10;Exception:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The two left-hand holes in a player's back row are called ayemi (&quot;eye&quot;). A player is not permitted to capture from an eye on his side, only from the opponent's side. In that case, he must move again, even if he has captured from an opponent's wegue. If the last seed fell into a wegue in your own ayemi, the move ends. &#10;&#10;&#10;The creation of a wound is only permitted after the original set-up has been destroyed, i.e. after the first move of a game. If, in the first move, the last seed makes four seeds, they are distributed in another lap.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players have no move left. Each player scores a point for each captured seed and a point for each seed in a wegue owned by him. The player with most points wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A manqala game. From http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Tchadji:&#10;&#10;Tchadji is a game played, at least, in Island of Mozambique (Ilha de Mo&ccedil;ambique in Portuguese, the official language; Muhipitti in Makua, the local language). It has been studied by Abdulcarimo Ismael, a mathematician from Universidade Pedag&oacute;gica, Maputo. It is played mostly by men. &#10;Except for the initial position, and for the fixed length of the board, tchadji is identical to mefuvha and moruba.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Tchadji is played in a wooden board with four rows of eight holes each. At the beginning there are 2 seeds (Caesalpinia bonduc) per hole. Each player only uses his side of the board, which consists of two rows. &#10;At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two seeds, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side. &#10;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction, and so on. &#10;The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole. &#10;If the last seed is put into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of the opponent contains seeds, these enemy seeds are &quot;eaten&quot; (odj&aacute;). &#10;Additionally, the seeds of the outer hole directly behind it, if any, are also eaten and the contents of another (any) enemy hole. The eaten seeds of the opponent are removed from the board. &#10;When a player has only singletons (ompwech&aacute;, &quot;divided into pieces&quot;), he is permitted to move them, but only into empty holes. &#10;The winner is the one who captures all the opponent's seeds. &#10;Other data&#10;Talking about habitual players, the first move is made without counting, as they know beforehand what are the best moves. Usually the first move is made from the last but one hole in the outter row (the second from the right). On next moves players do count. &#10;According to the study made by Ismael, a game lasts a mean of 146 seconds, and 38 moves per player. The shortest (in time) recorded game lasted 62 seconds. The shortest in moves, 16. The longest, 4 minutes 39 seconds and 73 moves respectively.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The first western tournament was in August 2006 at the Mindsports Olympiad (MSO) in London, England. It was won by Aidos Seitzhanov from Kazakhstan.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;To&#196;&#159;&#196;&#177;zqumalaq is played board made of two rows of nine holes, plus two kazans (&quot;boilers&quot;), either in the middle of the board or one at each end of it. The players own the kazan at their right, if at the ends, or the one on the other half of their board, if in the middle. &#10;As captures are made by pairs, the holes are usually made in a way so it is evident whether the contents are odd or even. &#10;To begin the game, there must be nine balls per hole, except the kazans, which are empty. That is, 162 balls are needed.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player takes all the balls of a hole on his side of the board, and distribute them anticlockwise, one per hole, on the following holes, starting from the very same hole he has taken them. If the movement is done from a hole containing just a single ball, it is moved to the next hole, leaving the starting hole empty.&#10;&#10;If the last ball falls into a hole on the opponent's side&hellip;&#10;&#10;     &hellip;and this hole afterward contains an even number of balls, these are captured and stored on the player's kazan.&#10;     &hellip;and this hole afterward contains precisely three balls, the hole becomes your &#209;&#130;&#210;&#177;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#139;&#210;&#155;, tuzdyq (or &#209;&#130;&#210;&#175;&#208;&#183; &#210;&#175;&#208;&#185; according to Maksat Shotayev, t&uuml;z &uuml;y, i.e. &quot;sacred place&quot; in Kazakh; or tuz in Kyrgyz which means &quot;salt&quot;), and it is marked as such. ** Each player can only make one tuzdyq in a game. &#10;         A tuzdyq cannot be made on the opponent's last hole (ninth, the one on his right). &#10;         A tuzdyq cannot be made if it is symmetrical to the opponent's one (if the opponent has his tuzdyq in our first hole, we can not make ours on his first hole). &#10;         In the cases a tuzdyq cannot be done, we can finish a movement there, but the hole simply does not become a tuzdyq. &#10;         A movement cannot begin from a tuzdyq. &#10;         The balls that fall into a tuzdyq are captured by its owner. If it is overcharged, we can take the balls and store them in the kazan. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player cannot move on his turn, because all the holes on his side (except a possible tuzdyq) are empty. &#10;When the game is over, the player who still has balls on his side (except in a possible tuzdyq) gets them and adds them to his kazan. &#10;Both players add the contents of their tuzdyq (the one on their opponent's side) to their kazan.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with more balls in his kazan at the end of the game. If both players have captured 81 balls, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Unee_Tugaluulach:&#10;&#10;&quot;Unee Tugaluulach (Mongolian: &#210;&#174;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#141;&#209;&#141; &#209;&#130;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#131;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#133;, &quot;let the cows calve&quot;), also spelled Unee Tugaluulax, is a mancala game played by Kazakhs in western Mongolia near the Chinese border. It was described by Namzhildorzh in 1963 for the first time. Although a very small board is used, the game is challenging for humans (not so much for computers) because it usually takes more than 150 moves.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board (kh&ouml;l&ouml;g) of 2 x 3 = 6 holes. Initially each hole contains six dungballs (khorgol), excrements of camels, goats and sheep are recommended.&#10;&#10;At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, one by one, in a clockwise direction (viewed as the male direction in Mongolia). The first ball must be dropped into the succeeding hole.&#10;&#10;If the last ball is dropped into one of your own holes which then contains four balls, you capture the contents (four balls).&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player cannot move or the board position repeats.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot move, the remaining balls are captured by the player who was able to move last. The player with most balls wins.&#10;&#10;The traditional rule for what happens when the board position repeats is unknown. In other mancala games, counters that continue to circulate around the board are either divided between the players (Oware) or they are not counted (Cross-Wari). It is also possible that the game is considered to end without result (Aw-li On-nam Ot-tjin).&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game. From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Vai_Lung_Thlan:&#10;&#10;&quot;Vai Lung Thlan (lung &quot;stone&quot;; thlan &quot;grave&quot;; vai may mean &quot;foreign&quot; or be short for vai phei, the name of an old Kuki clan) was first described in 1912 by Lt.-Colonel J. Shakespear. This mancala game is played by both sexes of the Mizo (the modern name for the Lushai people) who live in the Indian State of Mizoram located between Myanmar and Bangladesh.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board consists of two rows of six holes.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player lifts up all the stones of one of his holes and distributes them clockwise, one by one, into the consecutive holes, first along his row and then back along that of his opponent.&#10;&#10;If the last stone is dropped into an empty hole on either side of the board, the player captures it as well as all stones which precede this hole (that is, against the direction of movement or anti-clockwise) by an unbroken chain of single stones. Captured stones are removed and placed aside by the player.&#10;&#10;No matter whether it was captured or not, the move is over after one lap.&#10;&#10;The players move alternately and passing is prohibited, unless a player has no legal move.&#10;&#10;The game is finished when no stones are left on the board. The player who has captured more stones wins. If each player has captured 30 stones, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;Suggestions for good play:&#10;&#10;The game starts slow, but accelerates as stones are captured or accumulated in a few holes and the board is cleared. The middle game should be a clever exchange of stones.&#10;&#10;A hole containing 12 stones can always capture at least one stone because the last stone is dropped into the emptied hole. On the other hand, it is impossible for holes which contain more than 12 stones to capture. These holes can be used for defence because by distributing their contents all empty holes of the board are filled. At the end of the game players try to deprive their opponent of legal moves while keeping as many stones as possible on their own side in such a way that only single stones are created when they are distributed. Therefore, overloaded holes become &quot;bad shape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Quote:&#10;&#10;Counting the stones in the hole before removing them is not allowed, and considerable skill is required to judge accurately the number of stones, so as to select a hole containing the number of stones which when distributed will leave the maximum number of holes with single stones in them. &#10;J. Shakespear&quot;&#10;&#10;Mancala World also gives an interesting endgame problem.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    igGameCenter (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The ability to play corps sized battles and larger actions with battalions as opposed to brigades was made possible due to an innovative morale and combat system that simplifies the mechanics of play while accounting for tactical nuances. It is not an exaggeration to say that Shako II can be played often without reference to the rule book or even the Quick Reference Sheet.&#10;&#10;In addition to clarifying the few points of ambiguity in the original rules, the central design concept focused on battle planning and command and control is being refined to speed play and to more accurately reflect the limits of control Napoleonic generals had over their men and the course of battle. In Shako II, careful planning, scrupulous deployment of units and attention to timing will be as important as how one moves individual units within the restrictive chaos of fighting. Bad planning and poor deployments will be punished by those players who have the Napoleonic flare for battle. En avant!&#10;&#10;",

They must make port in every harbour along the route. They have the option to travel under engines, but must spend fuel cards when doing so. They must also manage their money, as harbour fees must be paid (by penalty of losing the game instantly). To move, players roll two dice and may decide which to use first for one straight lap of movement.&#10;Specially marked spaces are incident fields (players must draw an incident card, which may turn out to be a question that must be answered- correct answers are rewarded by an extra move) and log fields where special events take place (like extra cost, restricted movement etc.). Fields with numbers are &quot;storm&quot; areas; on those spaces, the number printed on the board must be subtracted from the die roll or must be paid by extra fuel cards.&#10;The rulebook briefly mentions a couple of possible variants, like choosing different routes, doing away with the engines or using only one die.&#10;&#10;",

It comes with a huge (58x78cm) board, 6 boats, 3 buoys, 2 dice, a set of sailing cards and a set of advantage cards. Players sail one of the triangle courses as printed on the map; each course is used for a number of boat classes. Start and finish lines are also printed on the board. Wind direction is constant (South), as is the wind force, but some currents are printed on the board that influence the direction sailed. Players roll dice to move, and they need certain die rolls to start the race, change direction or gain sailing or advantage cards. Sailing cards represent difficulties the player must cope with (so they are, in effect, &quot;disadvantage&quot; cards). Special rules apply in the immediate areas around the turn marker buoys. Otherwise, some basic yachting rules, in particular right-of-way rules, must be observed.&#10;The game is completely bi-lingual (English &amp; French, as befits the location) and comes with an &quot;Olympic Information&quot; booklet that explains the sailing events (courses and boat classes) of the XXI Olympic Games as they took place in 1976 in Kingston Bay, Ontario, Canada. This booklet also has a glossary of sailing terms and illustrations of sailing maneuvers.&#10;&#10;",

It contains 10 scenario cards.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:&#10;&#10;31 August 1944... The Royal 22nd Regiment moved into action before dawn in a bid to secure the right shoulder of the breach in the Gothic Line. Engineers worked through the night to clear three narrow paths in the minefield where the West Novas had earlier come to grief, Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Allard hurried two companies forward.&#10;&#10;1 September 1944... In the centre, the Fifth Division had not been idle. Monte Peloso and Tomba di Pesaro were its primary objectives, but it took most of the day to complete their capture. The original plan called for the Perths and Strathconas to attack Peloso, but this had to be revised when it became apparent that fresh infantry would be needed.&#10;&#10;&#10;15 September 1944... Eighth Army designated the Canadian Corps as its pursuit corps and placed the British 4th and 2nd New Zealand divisions, the British 25th Army Tank Brigade, and the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade. The Canadian Corps was to launch its assault as soon as the rains stopped.&#10;&#10;&#10;18 September 1944... The situation on the First Canadian Division&rsquo;s front was not so happy. Unlike the British V Corps, the Canadian First Division commander Chris Vokes was unable to offer assurances about getting over the Ausa on the 18th and nothing could be done until San Martino had been recaptured and the first had moved up to the Rimini railway line. Finesse had not worked thus far, thus the Vokes decided to try brute force.&#10;&#10;&#10;23 September 1944... Intent on debouching into the broad valley of the Po, the First Canadian Corps poured troops and tanks through the Marecchia bridgehead. General Burns had designated three successive rivers as the main objectives of the coming operations, the Fiumicino, the Savio, and the Ronco, twenty-five miles beyond the Marecchia.  &#10;5 December 1944... The First Division was having problems. Despite committing it&rsquo;s reserve unit, the Carleton and York Regiment, the Third Brigade was unable to get beyond the Lamone. By the morning of 4 December, 48-hours after launching its first attacks, the brigade had finally closed up to the river, to find that the Germans had retired behind the blown railway and road bridges.&#10;&#10;&#10;13 December 1944... The battle for the Naviglio began after dark on Tuesday, 12 December. Four battalions spearheaded the operation. On the right, the Fifth Division sent into action the only two infantry units that had not yet been involved in the fighting, the Princess Louise Dragoons Guards (Plugs) and the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish, while the First Division committed the Carleton and York and, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment. It was overcast evening, with a thick mist giving way to drizzle as the troops slogged forward&#10;&#10;&#10;15 December 1944... While the Fifth Division pushed across the Naviglio and closed up to the Fosso Munio, the First Division staged a series of local attacks to widen its bridgehead for break-out. During the night of 14-15 December, Princess Patricia&rsquo;s Canadian Light Infantry moved over the canal, with the task of driving the Germans out of ancient, walled Bagnacavallo, where many of the enemy counter-attacks had originated.&#10;&#10;&#10;20 December 1944... There was no let-up. A determined Charles Foulkes met with his Division commanders within hours after the First Brigades failure on the Fosso Vecchio. New plans were drawn up for yet another joint assault between the First and Fifth Divisions that very night. The object was to force the Germans to abandon the S-shaped Fosso Munio and retire behind the Senio and the task was given to two infantry brigades, the Second and Eleventh, both using two-assault battalions.&#10;&#10;&#10;2 January 1945... The quiet along the Senio was about to be shattered. At either end of the Canadian sector were pockets of German troops and I Corps headquarters had decided to get rid of them before settling down for the winter. On the right, north of Ravenna, the Germans were huddled behind a web of canals and rivers, below the Lago Comacchio along the line extending from the coast to Alfonsine, where it linked up with the Senio defences.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a scenario pack for the Advanced Squad Leader system.  Here is the description from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:&#10;&#10;This six-scenario pack revolves around a single, day-long action, in the heart of bocage country between the American 30th Infantry Division, and the German SS-Panzer Division 2 &quot;Das Reich&quot;. Many of the scenarios are ideal for tournament play. &#10; Scenario #1- The US 2d Battalion 120th Infantry Regiment had rejoined its regiment, ready to head the day&rsquo;s attacks. Despite the threat of German counter-attack, the 2d Battalion slowly advanced towards the village of Quesnel. As the Americans entered the village, they came under machine-gun fire from several unseen locations. Unable to call for artillery or armour support and under increasing fire from the village, the American company commander was about to withdraw... &#10; Scenario #2- A small probing force from SS-Panzer Division 2 &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; struck the US 30th Division&rsquo;s right flank near the village of l&eacute; Desert. The 743d Tank Battalion, which was on the right of the 30th Division, was enticed by a pair of Panzer IVs to advanced down a minor farm road towards a fork. When the 743d's lead tanks were within 200 yards of the fork, the German armour struck...&#10; Scenario #3- The US 30th Division HQ began to receive reports from the 117th Regiment that German infantry, supported by self-propelled assault guns, was attacking the right flank of its 3d Battalion. At the same moment, the 120th reported that Company B, 743d Tank Battalion had just had a brush with German tanks. The engineers of SS-Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 3, &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; supported by the panzers of SS-Panzer Regiment 2, &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; had managed to infiltrated through the bocage undetected... &#10;Scenario #4- The Americans continued their southern advance towards the high ground of Hill 32. The 117th Infantry Regiment reported only light resistance from stragglers, but nothing they could not handle. Then late in the afternoon, the Germans launched a counterattack with elements of SS-Engineer Battalion &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; supported by assault guns...&#10;&#10;Scenario #5- The US 120th Infantry Regiment's  first objective was Hill 32,  and the initial advance progressed relatively calmly, with the leading platoons meeting little, or no resistance. Then as the 120th approached the forward slope of Hill 32, the German resistance stiffened considerably... &#10; Scenario #6- This scenario joins scenarios 1,3, 4, and 5 together as combined game. By 1000-hrs, the US 2d Battalion, 120th Infantry Regiment began its advance with Company B of the 743d Tank Battalion moving ahead of the infantry. Hill 32 was their first objective in the 120th&rsquo;s zone, and the German resistance began to stiffened considerably with heavy artillery strikes, slowing  the 2d Battalion's advance as it approached the high ground...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mancala game. From Mancala.Wikia.com:&#10;&#10;Adji-boto (&quot;pebble boat&quot;) is a mancala game which is played by the Saramaccans who live on the upper Saramacca river in Suriname. The Saramaccans are a tribe of Bush-Negroes which was formed by escaped slaves. The first field study on the game was conducted by the American ethnologue Melville J. Herskovits (1895-1963) in 1928 in the village of Beidotti. The game resembles mancala games known in Benin, West Africa.&#10;&#10;The game is used to entertain the dead during the ten-day period preceding burial in the kre wosu, or house of mourning. The play is only carried out during the daylight hours because in the night the yorkas, or ghosts of the dead, would come and play with us and eventually carry away our spirits.&#10;&#10;The boards are only carved by old widowed men because this is a serious issue. They are made in two shapes, those having straight tops, and those in which the tops are curved. A village should have both types, so that if a person was fond of one kind of board dies, the people can play for a time on the other and there will be a lessened danger of his ghost coming to play with them. Although the Bush-Negroes are fine wood-carvers the Saramacca boards are of the roughest. This is because of the sacred character of the game which is not one which can be hurried in playing. It must entail some effort and even pain  to bring it to perfection.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;Adji-boto is played on a board called adji-bangi (&quot;pebble stool&quot;) that consists of 2x5=10 holes. In addition, each player has a store called boto (&quot;boat&quot;) at his right hand.&#10;&#10;Each hole contains 10 stones called adji (&quot;pebbles&quot;) at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, except one stone that remains in the hole, one by one, in consecutive holes in an anti-clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;In the first ten moves of the game all of the ten playing holes must be played.&#10;&#10;It is only permitted to play a hole which contains at least two stones.&#10;&#10;It is not allowed to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.&#10;&#10;If the last stone ends (kaba) in a hole which precedes another hole or a continuous chain of holes that contains one, three or five stones (including any sequential combinations), these stones are captured and put into the player's boto. It is possible to capture on either side of the board. The only exception is the opening move in which  nothing is captured. If a Bush-Negro captures he says: &quot;I eat your children!&quot; (Mi nyam yu p'kin kaba!)&#10;&#10;The game is finished when both players can't move.&#10;&#10;The remaining stones are captured by the player on whose side they are.&#10;&#10;The player who has won most stones is declared winner. It is said that  &quot;the loser is killed!&quot; (a kiri mi kaba!).&#10;&#10;If both players captured the same number of stones the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

The publisher provided a round board consisting of 37 circles arranged in four concentric rings and split among two colours, and two sets of checkers (12 in each colour). As in traditional Checkers, the players' goal is to capture the opponents' checkers or to force the opponent into a position in which any legal move will allow the moving piece to be captured.&#10;&#10;The rules approximate traditional checkers, with only six circles in the outermost ring serving as &quot;Kinging Circles.&quot; (These are the three rings for each colour that are farthest removed on the board from the opponent's home territory.)&#10;&#10;The construction of the playing area into a series of rings comprised of circles creates the necessity of several unique rules, specifically redefining &quot;forward movement&quot; (the motion of a checker toward its opponent's central kinging circle, the &quot;Rules of the Nearest Circle&quot; in movement and jumping that define which circles a checker may move to from its current position, and a &quot;Single Combination Jump&quot; which allows one checker jumping another within its ring to change directions and end in a separate ring.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Vienna or Death&quot; is the third volume in our &ldquo;Age of Muskets&rdquo; series and it can be played together with Volume II &quot;Eagles Rising&quot;. It depicts the campaigns that took place during 1796-1797 and again in 1799-1800 in southern Germany, the Rhine and Danube river areas and northern Switzerland. As in Volume II, it's a two-in-one game since the first group of scenarios show the brilliant campaign of 1796 of Archduke Charles of Austria, who defeated and expelled from Germany the French Armies that had launched an invasion across the Rhine; and it also includes other scenarios centered on the Swiss-German side of the Austro-Russian offensive of 1799. They depict the Allied advance into Switzerland and the Alps and their defeat that culminated in the outstanding victory of the French troops led by Moreau at Hohenlinden.&#10;&#10;As in Volume I the game includes all the elements that characterized pre-industrial warfare. However, the player will also find some elements distinctive of this campaign, as Alpine terrain, a different map and time scale to reflect the duration of the campaign as well as special rules to play the longest campaign scenarios together with those of Volume II &quot;Eagles Rising&quot;. Given the size of the armies involved most of the scenarios of this Volume are quite adequate for two to four players since there are few headquarters and their size is quite manageable.&#10;&#10;Each game contains:&#10;- 2 80x60 cm maps (together form a 60x160 cm map of Switzerland and Southern Germany) &#10;- 8 Terrain overlays used in field battles &#10;- 2 Sets of Player Aid Sheets (3 sheets each)&#10;- 2 General Headquarters display sheets&#10;- 2 Dice (d10)&#10;- 1 Set of Army Sheets (to be photocopied) &#10;- 832 counters (4 sheets)&#10;- 1 Age of Muskets series booklet&#10;- 1 Vienna or Death Exclusive Rules booklet, scenarios, historical and designer notes&#10;&quot;Vienna or Death&quot; is more than just a game. It comes with 6 introductory battle scenarios &ndash;Wurzburg, Neresheim, Schliengen, Ostrach, Stockach, Hohenlinden- to learn the battle rules and 11 campaign scenarios of increasing complexity. From the first (&quot;Mountain warfare&quot; lasting four turns) to the whole campaigns of 1796-97 and 1799-1800. Furthermore, there are scenarios to be played using volumes II and III together to play both campaigns on the three fronts, Germany, Switzerland and Italy!!!&#10;&#10;El juego est&aacute; en ingl&eacute;s pero encontrar&aacute;s en esta p&aacute;gina (Apoyo al Jugador) los archivos en espa&ntilde;ol necesarios para jugar &ndash;Hojas de Ayuda, Reglas y Escenarios.&#10;&#10;",

Roll the dice and move that horse forward one space, if you roll a penalty horse you pay the penalty in chips. The race is over when one horse crosses the finish line. Every player with that horse's number takes an equal share. If you hold more then one, you get multiple shares.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "DEEP INTO THE BEKAA&#10;Final Confrontation, 1000 hrs, June 11, 1982&#10;&#10;DEEP INTO THE BEKAA is a simulation depicting the first T-72 and Merkava tank battles in the final stages and hours of the Peace for Galilee Israeli offensive in 1982. These tank battles were the largest of the war and occurred as both sides sought to position themselves before the ceasefire at noon. They began at 10 a.m. as the Israeli Merkava tanks moved deep into the Bekaa Valley from their 77th battalion and the 409th Anti-tank (TOWs on Jeeps) swept far to the north until both collided with the fresh Syrian T-72 tanks of the 82nd Brigade, 3rd Armor Division.&#10;As soon as elements of the Merkava tank battalion arrived, Syrian T-72 tanks began to fire from a distance of 2500-3000 yds. The Israelis inched ever closer to the Syrian border and in desperation, Syrian Milan AT units and Gazelle TOW gunships began to appear. To the Israeli, the going was a cautious advance yet one that had to achieve the most territory before the agreed ceasefire at Noon. The battle is unique for it was the first time the new Russian T-72 tank faced off with the new Israeli Merkava, for both their debut in battle.&#10;&#10;Units represent single AFVs, helicopters or infantry AT teams. Each hex measures 324 yards from side to side. Each turn represents 5 min. time.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules.&#10;&#10;",

The leather creaks and steel clangs as you gird yourself for war. Overhead, storm clouds gather and the lightning slams into the earth in great forking bolts all around you. A howling north wind scourers the lands clean in preparation for the final conflict that will decide the fate of the world.&#10;&#10;You know in your heart that of all the battles that have come before, this will be the last, and greatest. This is Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods of men and the dark forces of the night.&#10;&#10;With a wave of your massive hand you summon forth the heroes and Valkyrie that will fight at your side. The ground trembles under the footsteps of your mighty foes. There they are! On the horizon, grim giants, fell beasts, and the undead of countless battlefields approach in unending waves. Above the clatter of their weapons and armor a clear deep note pierces the sky. It is Heimdall&rsquo;s horn! He is calling forth the gods and heroes to stand fast at the rainbow Bifrost Bridge and do battle.&#10;&#10;Without hesitation, you stride forward to stand at his side with your brothers and sisters. You are an Aesir, a god and defender of humanity, and this is the time of legends!&#10;&#10;Game Play&hellip;&#10;&#10;A few years ago, we realized that the core action-reaction card mechanic of Down In Flames would also be perfect for other interactive combat situations, but we could never think of the right setting. Finally, a couple months ago, we came up with the idea of designing a game based on the Norse gods, their foes the Jotun, and the mythical battle to end all battles, Ragnarok. In this game, we&rsquo;ve given the action-reaction system a twist in that the turn sequence is interactive, so as each attack is played, the next card played is actually a counter-attack that can inflict damage. This makes for a very intense battle system where every card can both attack and defend.&#10;&#10;In this fact-paced card game, you take on the role of one of Norse mythologies greater gods such as Thor, Odin, Heimdall, or one of their Jotun enemies like Thrym, Fenrir, or Loki.&#10;&#10;Once you are girded for battle, you will hack, slash, thrust, and grapple your way to victory!&#10;&#10;Ragnarok is designed and packaged to be an economical social game. Instead of our normal 9&rdquo; x 12&rdquo; box, this game comes in a 4&rdquo; x 6&rdquo; box. This is an ideal game for people who would like to socialize while playing a game. Each game takes only 30 to 60 minutes, so the game play is fast and furious.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s components are designed to be language independent. The card titles are in English, but all the other game information is represented with iconic symbols and numbers.&#10;&#10;Scheduled Components: &#10;110 Full color cards (63mm x 88mm)&#10;1 Full color counter sheet&#10;Rulebook (Full Color)&#10;&#10;Players: 2 to 6 &#10;Play Time: 30 minutes&#10;Complexity: Low&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fans of Chess and Arimaa will want to pay close attention to The Travelers, a game which has not been commercially produced, but probably should be.&#10;&#10;The game, played on a 9&times;9 board, is explained as &quot;an unorthodox game, very different from Western Chess. It is a strange game, but it is very nice, and regardless the apparent simplicity of some pieces and rules, it is a very complex and deep game. The object of the game is to move TWO pieces, called TRAVELERS, to the last rank,&quot; according to information found on www.chessvariants.org.&#10;&#10;The pieces include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Travelers (T): Can move in the eight directions, up-to three positions. A Traveler can't capture pieces, neither being captured. A Traveler can't  move into Check, but if in Check, it is not obligatory that you move your Traveler. When a Traveler reaches the last rank, it can't move, neither being displaced. You win the game if your two Travelers reach the last rank.&#10;     Displacer (D): Can move as Queens. If a Displacer lands on a square orthogonally adjacent to an enemy piece, you can DISPLACE the enemy piece (except a Block) and send it to ANY EMPTY square in the vertical line or the horizontal line defined by the Displacer's landing square. A Displacer can't displace a Traveler that has reached the last rank.&#10;     Block (B): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Block can't capture, neither being captured. Block can't be displaced. A Block can't never move to the first or to the last rank.&#10;     Ace (1): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. An Ace can capture a piece at distance 1 in the eight directions, except a Traveler or a Block.&#10;     Deuce (2): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Deuce can capture a piece at distance exactly 2 in the eight directions, regardless there is or not an intermediate piece in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks.&#10;     Trey (3): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Trey can capture a piece at distance exactly 3 in the eight directions, regardless there are or not intermediate pieces in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks. &#10;&#10;&#10;You start the games with two Travelers, one Displacer, one Block, four Aces, two Deuces and two treys.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This 8-scenario pack from Lone Canuck covers actions from early in WW II for the elite German Grossdeutschland unit.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;10 May 1940... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland reinforced by artillery and engineers crossed the Belgian frontier about midday encountering little resistance. The report of a force which had taken up positions in Etalle comprised of elements of a French Cavalry and motorized reconnaissance units. The Infanterie Regiment Grossdeutschland was dispatched to handle the situation. Upon arriving in village of Etalle, Grossdeutschland found the fighting was serious. Houses had been shot up, telephone wires hung down everywhere, on the corner sat a bullet-ridden civilian automobile. The bridge at the entrance to the village was barricaded and held by the French under heavy rifle, and machine-gun fire coming from the houses behind it. Major F&ouml;st assessing the situation personally took command of the 5th Company and moved to launch an attack.&#10;&#10;&#10;10 May 1940... While the bulk of the Grossdeutschland Regiment drove towards the Luxembourg frontier. Elements of the 3rd Battalion under Oberstleutnant Barski took off from airfields near the German-Belgium border in 100 three-seat Fieseler Storch. This force was earmarked for the air landing operation codenamed &quot;NIWI&quot;. The 400-men of the Garski Battalion were to be flown 15 km behind the enemy&rsquo;s front lines, with mission to cut communications, hinder reserves reinforcing the front lines and attack the enemy&rsquo;s fortifications from the vulnerable rear. Oberstleutnant Garski&rsquo;s landed at 0600 hours and was only able to link up with nine men of his force. Radio contact was established with XIX Panzer Korps and Garski learned from reports that to the east of Wity, Belgian Ardennes Mountain troops were putting up stiff resistance. Using the earlier commandeered automobiles, Garski quickly moved his force to the western outskirts of Fauvilliers.&#10;&#10;11 May 1940... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland spent the night on the hills northwest of Villiers-sur-Semois screened by a thin line of pickets. The 1st Battalion carrying their machine-guns, ammunition canisters and mortar bases which weighed heavy on men, passed west of Mellier and pushed on towards the village of Suxy. The attack on Suxy developed into a perfect training school attack supported by the Regiments&rsquo; heavy weapons, including artillery and assault guns. The infantry supported by the assault guns stormed into the village and the enemy forces, a French Cavalry reconnaissance company, suffered heavy losses while putting up a stubborn defence.&#10;&#10;&#10;19 June 1940... The headlong advance south towards France&rsquo;s second largest city Lyon by Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland continued with an assault gun from Lt. Von Werlhoff&rsquo;s platoon leading the way. The first serious French resistance was met near Neuville-sur-Seine. There was a barricade in front of the village, which had a heavy machine gun, two light machine guns and a 47mm anti-tank gun. The assault spearheaded by the 6th Company, Infantry Regiment GD approached the barricade, machine gun and rifle fire suddenly erupted from every house and near-by park. The assault gun immediately went into position and blasted the barricade.&#10;&#10;5 July 1941... By midday of 4 July, Grossdeutschland reached Stolpce and Swerzen, about 3 km to the south was the regiments objective, Tschweren. Urgent orders were received to move a strong kampfgruppe into the area northeast of Stolpce where the 15th Infantry Regiment was involved in heavy fighting with an attacking Russian force. By evening, the 1st Battalion GD reached an area near Odceda northwest of Stolpce and set up a hasty defensive position. As the morning fog lifted, a firefight broke out as masses of Russians stormed out of the woods towards the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s positions occupied during the previous night. These first waves were beaten back, however heavy fire continued from the impenetrable wooded area and companies of the 1st Battalion were order to clear out these pockets. The Grenadiers of the 3rd Company rose and moved widely spaced towards the woods.&#10;&#10;&#10;5 July 1941... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland received orders to ferret out Russians that were forming up just inside the woods for a break out. 12 km southwest the 6th Company, together with a platoon from the 18th (Pioneer) Company, heavy guns of the 15th Company and elements of the 1st Platoon, 20th(Flak) Company, were ordered to move immediately to Kamienka and launch an attack on the village. The attack against Kamienka and the near by wooded areas began at 0545 and was supported by the heavy infantry guns of the 15th Company. Rapid defensive fire met the attacking German companies, which nevertheless pushed forward with great &eacute;lan, effectively supported by the heavy weapons.&#10;&#10;&#10;14 December 1941... The German spearheads had got to within a few miles of the outskirts of the Soviet capital. The Soviet realized that their hour had arrived. The projecting wedge of Guderian&rsquo;s Second Panzer Army presented the Soviet&rsquo;s southern group with an opportunity for envelopment from three sides. As dawn broke, Soviet artillery began firing into the village, as the rumbling of tank engines and near by shells burst heralded the Soviet&rsquo;s arrival. A few metres farther stood the anti-tank guns of the 14th (Panzerj&auml;ger) Company, which was fighting with the 1st Battalion. The Panzerj&auml;gers watched as the tanks rolled through the snow, firing as they came. As machine gun fire rattled against the protective armoured shield of their 5cm Pak 38, the Panzerj&auml;gers began their firefight. As the smoke cleared, three enemy tanks were set a fire and Soviet infantry littered the snowy fields around the village. Together with the surviving 35 grenadiers of the 1st Company they had stopped the Soviet breakthrough.&#10;&#10;20 February 1942... The heavy Soviet attacks against the weakened German lines continued, but they were unable to make any significant territorial gains. Once more, the Grossdeutschland was tasked to attack. The Regimental commander was forced to merge the two rifle battalions into a single Rifle Battalion Grossdeutschland; as it arrived at its assembly area in preparation for a counterattack. The attack on Kosowka and Tschuchlowo had all the preparations made to ensure the success of this difficult attack. Upon reaching the gully, the Grenadiers began suffering heavy losses as they were opened up upon by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the smoking buildings in the village. The men of Grossdeutschland waited for darkness to withdraw. The pitiful group that returned numbered 3 officers and 30 men. It was all that remained of the once proud Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This was the first ASL scenario pack published by Lone Canuck.  It includes 10 scenarios for Advanced Squad Leader.  Unlike other Lone Canuck scenario packs, Winpak #1 did not have a common theme and even included one scenario from the Pacific Theater, a real rarity for Lone Canuck.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;Pachino Airfield, Sicily 10 July 1943: Operation &quot;Husky&quot;, the Allied Invasion of Sicily, had the Canadian invasion forces landing on the Sicilian shores in a wide, curving bay known as Costa dell'Ambra, Code-named &quot;Bark West&quot;. Bark West was divided into two sandy beaches, &quot;Roger&quot; on the right and &quot;Sugar&quot; on the left. The Hasting and Prince Edward Regiment and the Royal Canadian Regiment of the First Brigade were assigned to Roger Beach, while Sugar was given to the Second Brigade's Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and Seaforth Highlanders. Three miles inland lay the main Canadian objective, the Pachino airfield, near the town of the same name.&#10;&#10;&#10;Daliki, Russia, 26 June 1943: Partisan attacks on moving trains and extensive demolition of tracks, bridges, and tunnels at times almost halted traffic on the railway routes Warsaw-Gomel-Bryansk and Minsk-Borisov-Smolensk. German anti-partisan operations had developed a definite pattern. As soon as the location of a partisan force became known it would be attacked simultaneously from several sides. Dawn was the preferred time for such raids. However these tactics were successful only if the partisans did not learn beforehand of the Germans' intentions.&#10;&#10;&#10;South of Casa Barardi, Italy 13 December 1943: In an attempt to gain a port to speed the Commonwealth Forces assault on Rome, the First Canadian Division was assigned to capture the ancient Adriatic port city of Ortona. To gain the approaches to the city the Royal 22nd Regiment was assigned to capture the hamlet of Casa Barardi and the crossroads on the Ortona-Orsogna road beyond. To carry out this task the Royal 22nd&rsquo;s C-Company under the command of Captain Paul Triquet and C Squadron of the Ontario Regiment with seven Shermans under command of Major H.A. &quot;Snuffy&quot; Smith.&#10;&#10;&#10;Schweigen, Germany, 9 September 1939: On 7 September French units advanced out of the Sarre Gap between the Region Fortifee of Metz and La Lauter of the Maginot Line, moving towards the German industrial centre at Saarbr&uuml;cken. The French units lumbered forward into one of the most heavily defended sectors of the still incomplete Siegfried Line.&#10;&#10;&#10;Near Eisholz Germany: 1 May 1945: On the 21April the spearheads of the 1st Ukraine Front and the 1st White Russian Fronts met near K&uuml;nigswusterhausen, encircling the three Army Corps of General de Infanterie Busses&rsquo;s German Ninth Army in the Frankfurt-F&uuml;rstenwalde-K&ouml;nigswunsterhausen area. The Ninth Army was now being attacked on three sides. On the morning of 23 April, Hitler had given authorization to pull back the Oder Front. The surrounded Ninth Army formed up for the breakout.&#10;&#10;&#10;Casa Berardi, Italy 13 December 1943: The Canadian 3rd Brigade committed their reserves, the Royal 22nd Regiment to a hard blow across the &quot;Gully&quot; immediately south of Casa Berardi. In an attempt to pinch out the position in front of the crossroads by driving up from the south. At 0730 hrs, the Vandoos started out for Casa Berardi under heavy shellfire crossing the &quot;Gully&quot;, at a point deemed to be its least formidable point. &quot;C&quot; Company under Captain Paul Triquet which fought its way over the &quot;Gully&quot; doing terrible damage to enemy tanks with the company&rsquo;s PIATs, was to perform a left flanking movement which was would enable the remainder of the Battalion to attack Casa Berardi from in front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Southern Edge of Scheidiswald, Russia 17 January 1943: Without pause, the second and third phase of this second battle of Lake Ladoga began. The two old corner-posts of the German defence continued to play their former part. The strongpoint of Gorodok with its hospital and power station on the Neva, at the other end, the fortified positions known as the &quot;Wrengler Barrier&quot;. Time and again throughout the Soviet tank attacks, the guns of the 1st Battalion, 240th Artillery Regiment relieved the grenadiers and engineers by timely defensive fire or concentrated bombardment of the focal points of the attack. Late in the afternoon of the 17th the First Troop guns went silent.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pontaubault, France 1 August 1944: Patton drove his VII Corps down and through the narrow corridor between the German flanking position and the Atlantic Coast. The 4th U.S. Armoured Division reached Avranches in the evening of 30 July. On the following day it took Pontaubault and established a bridgehead over the Selune River. Patton had burst open the door for the breakout into unconfined expanses of France. That is if he could keep the door open. Patton's VII Corps depended on one road over one bridge, for only one single road with one single bridge led from Avranches over the Selune into Brittany.&#10;  &#10;Near Toungoo, Burma 18 March 1942: Late in the afternoon, three British officers were riding along a jungle track towards Toungoo, 250 km from Rangoon, with 100 soldiers of the Burmese Frontier Forces (F.F.2). They had been on the move for weeks, making their way from the distant Chinese frontier. The riders and their small but sturdy Burmese horses were at the limit of their endurance. The 2nd Frontier Forces column was attached to the Chinese formation under General Stilwell, and given reconnaissance duties.&#10;&#10;&#10;Ozereyka Bay, Russia, 4 February 1943: A Russian Seaborne Invasion landed and moving inland. Soviet tanks reached Glebovka overrunning a Romanian Mortar battalion, held up in an old vineyard in the process. The recapture of these mortars was given to Captain Dabiji Nicolai and his Romanian 5th Company who immediately launched an assault on the manor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The 2nd of Lone Canuck's trilogy of ASL scenario packs based on Canadian troop actions in Italy during WW II.  You must own several modules of Advanced Squad Leader to utilize these 12 scenarios.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of these scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;4 September 1943... The Canadians splashed ashore at 0430 hours 3rd September, the fourth anniversary of Britain's declaration of war. The Canadians had landed in continental Europe- Hitler's celebrated Festung Europa, without being shot at or suffering a single causality. It was ideal countryside for delaying tactics, executed with excellence by German demolition teams. Steady, if slow progress was made by the Canadian division. The first clash was in Gambarie, a ski resort in a pine forest, was defended not by Germans, but Italians- Fascist militia known as &quot;Black Shirts&quot;...&#10; 7 September 1943... The Second Brigade now moved into the lead, striving to reach Cittanova, a large town on Route 111, one of the lateral highways which crosses the Aspromonte from coast to coast. When the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry were slowed by demolitions along Route 112, Brigadier Chris Vokes sent the Loyal Edmonton Regiment cross-country along a doubtful track which might lead to Cittanova. The Eddies also ran into Italians troops, a hundred German-trained paratroopers of the elite 184th (Nembo) Division, who surprised the Canadians by putting up a spirited fight...&#10;&#10;&#10;1 October 1943... Campobasso a picturesque city nestled in the eastern foothills of the Apennines was the Canadian objective. Twelve miles from Lucera, Route 17 climbed rapidly. The Princess Louise's Dragoon Guards armoured cars came under heavy machine-gun and shellfire shortly after 0800 hours and the Canadians deployed for a tank-infantry assault. The tank broke into Motta but the infantry were soon pinned down by German artillery and machine-guns...&#10;&#10;&#10;6 December 1943... The First Canadian Division commander, Chris Vokes after studying patrol reports decided to establish a bridgehead and chose to cross the Moro at three points. The bridgeheads; on Route 16 near the mouth of the Moro, at San Leonardo and at Villa Rogattia village two miles upstream from San Leonardo. The Hasty Ps were to cross the Moro on the right, while the Seaforth of Canada took San Leonardo in the centre and the PPCLI on the left were to capture the village of Villa Rogatti, two miles upstream from San Leonardo. The only clear-cut success was gained by the PPCLI who had slipped across the Moro at an unguarded ford and by dawn had captured the village in a short but savaged battle. When morning came, the Germans launched their first counter attacks along the Moro producing mixed results, and still unable to dislodge Major W.D. &quot;Bucko&quot; Watson and his company as they stood firm on the north bank...&#10;&#10;&#10;8 December 1943... By nightfall on 6 December, the Canadian division was across the Moro in two places. The only practicable site was the demolished bridge on the road to San Leonardo. The afternoon of 8 December the First Brigade launched a two-prong assault on San Leonardo with the RCR right hooking out of the Hasty Ps bridgehead while the 48th Highlanders of Canada would cross the Moro and attack La Torre midway between Villa Rogatti and San Leonardo. Attacking southwestwards along a long winding lane soon to be dubbed &quot;Royal Canadian Avenue&quot; the RCR would attack across the front of the 361st Panzer Grenadier Regiment. The Germans retreated and San Leonardo was at last secured, but counter-attack were the order of the day and on Thursday 9 December the German counter-attacked. Again and again the Germans swarmed around Sterlin Castle...&#10;&#10;&#10;23 December 1943... While the Second Brigade slogged its way yard by heartbreaking yard through Ortona's streets and alleys, General Vokes had launched an outflanking attack two miles west of the battered town. The First Brigade was to commit its three-infantry battalions supported by the tanks of the Ontario Regiment in succession. The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, the Hasty P's would lead the attack, but the two-lead assault companies soon became bogged down in the face of heavy fire. Seeing the difficulties newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel Bert Kennedy, charged forward running a gauntlet of bullets and shellfire without so much as hunching his shoulders. Kennedy quickly organized a new assault, moving up one of his reserve companies and putting out a call for the Ontario Shermans, churning in the mud somewhere to the rear....&#10;&#10;&#10;4 January 1944... The Canadian Army's first action of 1944 on the Adriatic front was fought by the Carleton and York Regiment exacting sweet revenge for its New Year's setback at the hands of those tough paratroopers. At Point 59, overlooking Torre Mucchia on the coast, the Germans had established two strongpoints, defended by a half-dozen machine-guns and linked by trenches, protected by barbed wire and minefields. After a daylong bombardment, a single company of Carletons attacked from two directions...&#10;&#10;&#10;17 January 1944... The Eleventh Canadian Infantry Brigade of the Fifth Armoured Division moved up on 12 January to relieve the weary Third Brigade and with that the First Canadian Corps had become fully operational in the Italian theatre. The brigade patrol program was barely under way when a dramatic change of plan took place. This operation to be supported by all artillery available. The Perths Regiment went in first, at 0545 hours. C-Company remained pinned down, except for a party under Lieutenant Robert Chamberlain. After fording the Ricco, Chamberlain's platoon had wiped out a three-man machine-gun post and moved up the ridge....&#10;&#10;23 May 1944... The western Canadians of the Second Infantry Brigade walked into disaster. For Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry on the right, supported by the Loyal Edmonton Regiment with the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada on their left. Major Watson's company reported that it was past the barbed wire entanglements that marked the leading edge of the Hitler Line. Unable to move forward, the tanks present wonderful targets to the Panzerturms mounting 75mm guns. As tank after tank brewed, the survivors were forced to fall back to the dubious protection of the woods. At every step men fell; some were victims of Nebelwerfer fire, many were dropped by machine-gun bullets and others trod on mines scattered about the barbed wire entanglements...&#10;&#10;&#10;24 May 1944... By the evening of 23 May the Anzio beachhead suddenly coming to life and posing a threat to the German Tenth Army's line of communications. As the German defences crumbled, there was only one possibility of stabilizing the situation in the Liri valley. Six miles northwest of the ruptured Hitler Line, a little river meandered across the floor of the valley. Its name was the Melfa, and if the Germans could hold it, the German Tenth Army might yet be saved. Vokes Force, commanding by Lt-Colonel Vokes and consisting of his British Columbia Dragoons and the Irish Regiment of Canada would go about halfway to the Melfa and then allow Griffin Force to pass through. Vokes Force plunged into action 0757 hours on 24 May. The B-Squadron, BC Dragoons became the first Allied force to engage Mark V Panther tank. Lieutenant Taylor never forgot his shock at seeing the Panther, but fortunately he spotted the Panther before the German saw him...&#10;&#10;30 May 1944... The Perths entered undefended Arnara, two miles northwest of Pofi. Beyond lay three hills code-named &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, and &quot;Harry&quot;. The first two were taken with little difficulty by the Cape Breton Highlanders of Canada and the Irish Regiment of Canada respectively, and the 8th Hussars reached Ceccano. German forces were reported retreating along Route 6 and the Strathconas were ordered to cut them off. They were greeted at the crossroads near the village of Torrice by tanks, self-propelled guns and mounted infantry of the 26th Panzer Division, desperately trying to keep open this vital link....&#10;&#10;&#10;23 May 1944... Canadian soldiers were among the first to enter Rome. The Black Devils of the Canadian-American First Special S ervice Force (FSSF), who arrived in the embattled Anzio beachhead on 1 February, were the first liberators to enter the city. At 0630, half an hour after the start of the Canadian assault on the Hitler Line , the US VI Corps burst out its trap and launched a drive towards Valmontone. That morning the First Special Service Force with its right flank resting on the Canale Mussolini, punched towards Route 7, the fabled Via Appia, one of the two highways to Rome from the south. The Force reached the road, but a counter attack by a half dozen tanks checked any further advance that day. The tanks included a new and unbelievable monstrosity, Tiger...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lone Canuck's first of three ASL scenario packs based on Canadian troop actions in Italy during WW II.  You must own Advanced Squad Leader and several modules to make use of these scenarios.&#10;&#10;Here is a description of the scenarios from from Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;15 July 1943... The British Eighth Army's drive stalled in the face of the stubborn and skilful German defence, Montgomery had to turn to the US 7th Army for help, only to discover that most of the Americans had gone off in the opposite direction. This forced the Eighth Army into a gruelling campaign in adverse conditions against a determined and resourceful enemy in easily defended terrain. His only chance to salvage success lay with the one formation of his army that had not fought in the desert, the First Canadian Division. Moreover, he was pinning the Eighth Army's hopes on the efforts of a single untried division of Canadians. Outside Vizzini, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (Hasty P's) passed through the Royal Canadian Regiment as the First Brigade led the way to the paved Route 124, the infantry riding in lorries or on tanks of the Three River Regiment. The next major town was Grammichele, ten miles from Vizzini. The Hasty P's and the Three River tanks ran right into the German ambush.....&#10;&#10;&#10;16 July 1943... The British Eighth Army advanced had stalled on the edge of the Catania plain and General Montgomery had instructed General Leese of XXX Corps to &quot;Drive the Canadians on Hard!&quot;. The First Canadian Division began their eastward advance on Caltagirone with the 48th Highlanders proceeding cross-country. Lt-Colonel Jefferson's Loyal Edmonton Regiment and a Squadron of tanks from the Three Rivers Regiment formed the vanguard, headed for the next large town, Piazza Armerina. Just beyond San Michele di Ganzeria, Route 124 joined the Gela-Enna highway; Route 117, the highway had been hijacked from the Americans. The Loyal Eddies had smooth sailing until noon when three miles south of Piazza Armerina they ran into elements of the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division.....&#10;&#10;&#10;18 July 1943... While RCR clung tenaciously to the roadside a mere half-mile south of the town, Brigadier Graham had committed his remaining battalion. He sent the 48th Highlanders to take Valguarnera by making a long right hook. The Toronto regiment was to launch its final approach on Valguarnera from a ridge two-miles south of the town, but when the Highlanders arrived they found the ridge to be strongly held by the Germans. Enemy snipers and machine-gunners pinned down the Toronto infantrymen for long minutes, until an English-born corporal took matters into his own hands.....&#10;&#10;&#10;22 July 1943... Unlike Assoro, there was no unguarded backdoor, Leonforte had to be attacked frontally. And the town was held in strength by tanks and troops from the 104th Panzer Grenadier Regiment. A savage street battle ensued and all four Edmonton rifle companies were soon involved. With neither artillery support nor anti-tank guns, the Eddies were faced with the choice of remaining in Leonforte and being wiped out, or withdrawing to safety. The battalion commander Jim Jefferson made up his mind quickly ordering his embattled companies to pull out of Leonforte under small arms covering fire provided by the Seaforth Highlanders. At Second Brigade HQ, a despondent Brigadier-General Chris Vokes received a ten-year-old Italian boy named Antonio Guiseppe, who dodging bullets, shells and German patrols made his way to the Canadian lines to pass a message from Jefferson. Vokes acted decisively, organizing a flying column of troops from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, four Shermans from the Three Rivers Regiment and four 6-pounders from the 90th AT-Battery and led by a PPCLI Company commander, Captain Rowan Coleman.....&#10;&#10;&#10;24 July 1943... The Second Brigade, which was to support the First Brigade had difficulty moving into position around Assoro and when patrols from the divisional reconnaissance unit, the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards encountered heavy fire on Route 117 near Nissoria. At noon, he signalled a 24-hour postponement in favour of a set-piece attack, supported by every available artillery piece. Under Simmonds' plan, The Royal Canadian Regiment would attack at 1500 hours advancing behind a barrage which would advance at a rate of a hundred yards every two minutes. Half-mile ahead, a smoke screen 2,000 yards long would precede the attackers and guided Kittyhawk fighter-bombers assigned to bomb and strafe targets along the road, while six squadrons of medium bombers plastered Agria and environs. A total of 5 field regiments and 2 medium regiments, over 150 guns would support one battalion.....&#10;&#10;&#10;2 August 1943... It fell to the Canadian troops to launch the beginning of the end of the Sicilian campaign. Temporarily attached to the British 78th Division, the Canadian Third Infantry Brigade was to mount a preliminary operation near the village of Catenanuova. The West Nova Scotia Regiment played a key role in the capture of Catenanuova. After the Royal 22nd Regiment captured Monte Scalpello, a razorback ridge towering 3,000 feet over the valley of the dry Dittaino. The 3rd Brigade had done its job, giving the 78th Division a springboard for its attack towards Centuripe. And while casualties had been light tougher times were in store for the brigade and particularly for the West Novas. While the 78th struck out for Centuripe northwest of Catenanuova, the 3rd Brigade moved cross-country to fill the narrowing gap between the 78th and the First Canadian Division further north. German prisoners warned that the paratroopers of the 3rd Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment held the hill.....&#10;&#10;&#10;4 August 1943... With the fall of Regalbuto, the Canadians had unknowingly entered the final phase of operations in Sicilian campaign. Three notable features had to seized along the way to Adrano, Hill 736, Monte Revisotto and Monte Seggio. The Loyal Eddies loaded up their ammunition, food and water as well as the 3-inch mortars and medium machine-guns of the supporting Saskatoon Light Infantry on to pack mules and headed into dry river valley. The battalion spent the nex t four days moving into position for the assault on Hill 736, clashing several times with German outposts cleverly concealed in the wilderness terrain. Major Archie Donald led the Loyal Edmontons, supported by 25-pounders from the 3rd Canadian Field Regiment, up the hill under heavy machine-gun and mortar fire.....&#10;&#10;&#10;5 August 1943... The loss of Agria, Regalbuto and Centruipe to XXX Corps had convinced the Germans to abandon their endangered defences in front of Catania and to withdraw into the main defensive position around the foot of Etna. Montgomery urged XXX Corps to step up its efforts to capture Adrano, the loss of which would disrupt the German defence. 4 August, the 78th Division continued its push northwards across the Salso and Simeto rivers via Route 121, while the Canadians were to capture Monte Revisotto and Monte Seggio, then force their way through the valley of the Salso. Major-General Guy Simmonds saw one of the rare opportunities to properly utilize tanks.....&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lone Canuck Publishing has been releasing scenario packs for ASL for years, but Purple Heart Draw takes Lone Canuck to the realm of historical campaign games.  Here is the description from the Lone Canuck web site:&#10;&#10;&#10;Battle of the Hedgerows - Purple Heart Draw offers players the unique challenge of fighting a small-unit action in hedgerow terrain like nothing depicted before and is a must-have for any wargame collection.&#10;&#10;Battle of the Hedgerows - Purple Heart Draw contains:&#10;&#10;One colour 23&rdquo;x 30&rdquo; historical Map of the eastern slope area of Hill 192,&#10;&#10;Four Scenarios played on various parts of the map,&#10;&#10;Five-Scenario Date, Campaign Game; and&#10;&#10;Chapter PHD that includes rules to play the Campaign Game&#10;&#10;Scenario Descriptions:&#10;&#10;St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: The morning was chilly and a mist had settled over the slopes of Hill 192, for the men of Company A, 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment this weather would mean that the planned air support for the attack would be canceled. Stepping off just after 6:00 a.m., Company A crossed its line of departure, the road that ran west out of St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle. Some 200 to 400 yards from its line of departure was a long, steep gully that ran 750 yards east to west along the battalion's front, called &ldquo;Purple Heart Draw&rdquo;. Company A did not meet stiff opposition until it reached Purple Heart Draw, then a murderous fire came from automatic weapons emplaced in houses along the road south from St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle and from the south bank of the draw... &#10; &#10;St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: Company A was being pinned down by heavy mortar and artillery fire in Purple Heart Draw; Company C, to its right had moved forward against lesser difficulties thanks in part to the assistance of the engineers of the US 2d Combat Engineer Battalion, who blasted gaping holes in the thick sides of the hedgerows for the support tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion to pass through. The men of Company C quickly followed up and by mid-morning had closed on the small chateau, which seemed heavily fortified and bristling with German machine-guns... &#10;&#10;&#10;St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: By late morning, the 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment was finally able to cross Purple Heart Draw, but had suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile on the east side of St-Georges-d'Elle, the Germans still held the lower end of Purple Heart Draw. It was decided that in an effort to draw off any Germans from reinforcing their position in front of the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s main effort, the 3d Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment would launch a series of diversionary attacks. Company L, US 23d Infantry Regiment started forward, tasked with the clearance of the eastern half of St-Georges-d'Elle, but no sooner had it cleared the last hedgerow just north of the town, when it too came under heavy fire... &#10;&#10;&#10;St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: Through out the day, the drive of the 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment, while it had been slowed by stubborn resistance, had packed too much power for the Germans, who fought to hold Hill 192 and their lines near St-Georges-d'Elle. The Germans, in a last desperate attempt to halt the US advance, were forced to commit Fallschirm Sturmgesch&uuml;tz-Brigade 12, Fallschirm Aufkl&auml;rungs-Kompanie 3, and their last reserves, Fallschirm Pionerie-Abteilung 3, in a last ditch counterattack north along the heavily-treed road towards St-Georges-d'Elle in the hopes of catching the Americans off-guard...  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Be fast or be last in the whackiest, zappiest American Diner on the block!&#10;&#10;Sunny die up, over easy, hold the fries! Take the order, serve the food and collect a tip - but its your opponent that's in control of the time with the unique, shake, rattle and roll salt pot timer. They shake - you quake, as you race to be the first player to collect three tips and win the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;One of the last game to be produced by Waddingtons before they were taken over by Hasbro. The game is for 2-4 players, Ages 6 and up.&#10;&#10;Each player has a coloured playing piece representing a waiter or waitress. On their turn, each player is timed using a salt pot shaker (which is effectively a timer), which is frantically shaken to make the 'salt' within it drain faster. When all of the 'salt' within it reaches the bottom, the players turn is over.&#10;&#10;During a players turn, the player may do as many of the following before their time runs out:&#10;&#10;- roll a standard six sided die and move from the kitchen to the nearest table of their colour&#10;- on arriving at a table, the player picks up a food order disc and tries to return to the kitchen&#10;- upon reaching the kitchen (which contains a spinner), the player spins the spinner until it matches the food order they have picked up. The spinner can reveal either a blank or food. If food is displayed, the food order is ready&#10;- return back from the kitchen to the table where the order was placed, and collect a money tip&#10;&#10;The first player to collect three money tips wins.&#10;&#10;The game board requires some assembly, and consists of the kitchen, the tables to be served, and narrow lanes which the players move along.&#10;&#10;As with many of the later Waddingtons games, it was firmly aimed at the younger end of the market, and as a consequence has limited replay value. Still, it is fast and frantic - players are constantly rolling dice and moving pieces, whilst another player is shaking the timer to end that players turn, egged on by any other players. The narrow lanes in the board do introduce a limited amount of strategy - you can block opposing players off - and the salt pot timer is a work of genius.&#10;&#10;",
