Each player controls a team of bellhops in the hotel and attempts to earn the most tips by helping the guests off of the elevator and with their luggage as they arrive in the lobby.&#10;&#10;You can backstab your friends' bellhops and reduce his/her tips by stopping their elevator. Be careful, though, as you might not be able to get your guests to the lobby without help! The player who has received the most tips at the end of the game wins. Maximize your points by collecting guests of all types. Try to get a bonus by helping the most guests of any one type.&#10;&#10;Bellhop plays with 2-5 players and lasts between 45 and 60 minutes. The photos are of an unpublished prototype and the designer is actively looking for a publisher.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Grand Tactical Rules for the mid-19th century Europe wars of transition&#10;&#10;1870 covers the Franco-Prussian War. The rules were designed specifically to accommodate the many large-scale engagements of this important war - from a few divisions to several corps per side.  The intention was to enable gamers to recreate very large battles without getting bogged down in extraneous details more appropriate for regimental-size skirmishes -- indeed, the normal command per player in most games is a corps or two: two to six infantry divisions.  Extensive morale and fire modifiers, multiple movement and fire opportunities, and national or troop type nuances have therefore been kept to a minimum in the interest of finishing a reasonably faithful approximation of a large historical battle in an afternoon.  A half-scale variant of the basic rules enabled smaller engagements to be fought simply by doubling the number of stands per unit in 1870.&#10;&#10;Besides the rules, 80 percent of the booklet is devoted to detailed historical notes, background information, orders of battle, and an extensive annotated bibliography which provide ample reference material for custom designing additional campaigns or battles &#10;Fourteen exhaustively-researched historical battle scenarios are included in the book; these cover both the Imperial and Republican phases of the war. Enabling gamers to accurately recreate the wars' most interesting battles. Each scenario also includes &quot;what if&quot; variants positing historically plausible alternative missions or forces.&#10;&#10;The book is extensively illustrated in color throughout, and contain ample diagrams and examples of play, formation diagrams, and game board photographs to help the gamer understanding the nuances of formations, maneuvers, and tactics, as well as visually differentiating the three different playing scales available.&#10;&#10;Later expanded by 1859. This book consists of two parts: &quot;1859&quot; and &quot;1864&quot;.&#10;&quot;1859&quot; depicts the Second Italian War of Independence between Austria and France/Sardinia. Same scale as &quot;1870&quot;, though the 'Double Scale' in 1870 is renamed 'Half Scale' here. 7 scenarios.&#10;&quot;1864&quot; depicts the Second Schleswig War between Denmark and Austria/Prussia. New Quarter Scale is introduced and used in 2 of the 7 scenarios (the remaining scenarios are at Half Scale).&#10;&#10;Summary &quot;cheat sheets&quot; are included with both books.&#10;&#10;",

Each card, at the tips has a number that must match the card that it is laid down next to, as you strive to empty your hand of cards.  For the 'younger set' there are animals, ranging from sharks to ladybugs, and it, of course, includes dinosaurs.  This way, for kids too young to know their numbers, they can play using the animals as 'the key' to matching their cards.&#10;&#10;Each player takes turn matching one card, if no match is possible they must draw cards from the 'tile card pool,' until there is a match, then play continues to the next player.&#10;&#10;The game ends when when one of the players runs out of cards.  That person is considered the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game board consists of piecepack tiles that are placed suit-side up; each representing an ice floe.  One player is selected to be the torch bearer and is given the candle.  Game play is broken up into phases.  During the movement phase, starting with the torch bearer, players take turns either moving a game board tile, or moving one of their own pyramids.  After movement, a voting phase takes place, accompanied by a comment period that allows some limited negotiation.  Players vote on which floe is to be blown up by the torch bearer, with the torch bearer being the tie-breaker.  Any pieces on the selected floe are removed from the game.  Often, multiple players will have pieces on a single ice floe, so short term alliances may form during voting.&#10;&#10;Complete rules are free to download from http://piecepack.org&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:  Ice Flow&#10;&#10;",

The pike was used throughout the period supported by or supporting an increasing number of shot troops, only falling into disuse when the introduction of the bayonet merged the fire and shock capability of the infantry into one man. This period saw  the development of the gunpowder weapons from simple handguns and bombards of the middle ages to the mobile cannon and muskets that ruled the battlefield until the 19th century.&#10;&#10;Like all the Principles of War rules, these rules have a simple mechanism with the emphasis on leaders' command and control. This is to represent the problems of commanding troops in battle which confronted kings, princes and mercenary leaders., rather than how many casualties each unit was taking at each stage of the battle. Major European conflicts ( including the English Civil war and Thirty Years war) covered in the 64 army lists. Now includes armies for Asia including Japan and Korea.&#10;&#10;",

As such the rules are designed to focus on the Infantry Company and its supporting arms, and not on Special Forces, Riverine or Armored Cavalry actions.  As a game system it can be played with anywhere from 3 players to as many as 20, with one person serving as umpire and being responsible for setting up and running the game.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of a Company Commander, Lieutenant, or Sergeant in the US armed forces; the GM controls the VC and NVA. The players start off green and continue their &ldquo;Tour of Duty&rdquo; through scenarios and gain experience. Eventually, if they are lucky and skillful, they will become seasoned veterans. The game expects the players to complete 12 of these missions before their tour of duty has ended.&#10;&#10;The book provides an overview of the Vietnam War and how the various militaries were comprised. Players may play Marines or the US Army and each is historically equipped. South Vietnamese units may be used as auxiliary forces as well as Ruff Puff&rsquo;s, the CIDG, the Australians, the Koreans, and American engineers/special forces/LRRP teams. Terrain includes open, brush, elephant grass, forest, dense forest, jungle, rubber plantations, rivers and streams, swamp, villages, urban combat, bunkers and entrenchments, tunnels, rice paddies, hills, gullies, canals, roads, trails, and paths. Rules for booby traps like pungi stakes, claymores, etc. are also given. Helicopter assaults and air support rules (fire for effect, napalm, strafing, are in addition to all the typical infantry maneuvers usually found in miniatures wargames like direct fire, charging, grenades, sniping, forward observers, indirect fire, artillery, etc. Also includes rules for night vision, sappers, flamethrowers, engineers, riverine operations, beehive rounds, and prisoners. There is also a glossary of military jargon and a bibliography of suggested books to give Game Masters ideas for more scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

Jarrird had always been a bit of a show off Julia thought as she watched the many-headed beast slither about on the ground before its new master.&#10;&#10;No matter she smiled, her enemy could be as showy as he wanted to be, it would not stop her from crushing him under her boot heel. Knowing the Hydra would still be a bit dazed from its master's summoning spell, and thus vulnerable, Julia quickly sent her Goblins in to kill it. The small green warriors each drew their short sword and rushed the larger creature, each yelling a shrill battle cry as they charged. Julia knew the little green Goblins would have no chance against the many heads of the Hydra, but she hoped to at least hurt it a little bit so her Minotaur could finish the job. Once his last defender had been taken care of, well Jarrird would be next.&#10;&#10;This is Conjurer, a new Mini-game from Bad Baby Productions. Play a skilled wizard as they battle other spell casters in a duel of summoning.

The explosion rocked the ship he and the others were encased in, shacking it like some small child playing with a toy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Damn&quot;, he thought as he pulled himself along the passage tube, &quot;Another hit like that and we might not survive this engagement.&quot; With the gravity turned off for battle stations, Jones found it hard to reach his station. Still he managed to make his way down the tube towards the beam weapon's controls. The captain wanted to make a quick pass on the federation carrier before it could launch all of its fighters. Jones thought it was a suicidal run at best, but the captain had been lucky so far and she might just pull it off, might Jones thought as the next missile hit home?&#10;&#10;This is Space Armada, the newest Mini-game from Bad Baby Productions. Across our solar system, in the distant future, battle two mighty space fleets. The imperialistic Federation means to bring the whole of system under their sway. Meanwhile the Colonial Fleets, each a small, independent fleet in its own right have banded together to stop this move by the Federation. The fate of the human race now lies in your hands as you command one of those fleets. Will the Federation bring order and law to the solar system, or will the independent colonies and mining outposts remain free.&#10;&#10;Space Armada is a fast past game of space fleet battles, wages across the solar system. Players will need to be decisive in their game play, all the while trying to protect their fleet's ships, waiting for the right moment to strike.&#10;&#10;",

There are 3 different classes of ships to choose from.  Players can see what their opponents ships are, and narrow down the potential mission of their opponent.  As the game progresses, players attempt to block their opponents from reaching their goals.  The goal may be to abduct different types of earthlings, or destroying cities (to name a few).  On each city, there is a marker that the player flips to determine how many cards to pull, or perhaps damage to the ship.  An additional angle is not all of the cards drawn are not necessarily good, so, it may not always be advantageous to be on a city that is giving a lot of cards.&#10;&#10;",
