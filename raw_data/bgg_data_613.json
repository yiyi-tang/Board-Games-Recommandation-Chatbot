    "Description": "In Dragon Ball Z Final Tournament - Strategy Game each player (up to 4) chooses a 3-characters team to battle in the tournament arena. When one character is defeated, the next of the team enters the arena.&#10;&#10;Each available character has 2 values: &quot;Endurance&quot; (hits needed to defeat him) and &quot;Aura&quot; (ability to evade attacks/dissipate energy blasts). Each character has his values, although some have the same values (like in the manga/anime series).&#10;&#10;Each turn a player follows the sequence: 1st movement, attack, 2nd movement (&quot;hit&amp;run&quot;).&#10;&#10;You roll 1 die to know how many squares you can move; then if you are next to your opponent or max. 5 squares away from him, you can attack.&#10;&#10;To attack, you roll 1 die and substract the opponent distance from the result; if the result is a positive number, that's the power for that attack (so close combat has no power lessening). &#10;The opponent rolls 1 die for defense: if the result is lower or equal than his character Aura value, then he evades/dissipates the attack and gets no damage. If not, the attack power is deducted from his Endurance. &#10;Then, the attacker can break away (rolling a die and moving).&#10;&#10;When one of the caracters' Endurance reaches zero, his player places the next character of his team on the starting position, and the battle continues.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player whose character is the &quot;last man standing&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the DVG website:&#10;&#10;Our first venture into the Euro/Mass Market!&#10;&#10;A &ldquo;Family&rdquo; card game. It's a card game for 2 to 6 players. Each player plays a mob boss trying to take over the top spot in New York City. The game is designed to be a low complexity family game and takes about 45-60 minutes to play. The tone is very light and very socially interactive.&#10;&#10;The goal is to take control of different places and people in the &quot;Neighborhood&quot;. As you do so, you gain reputation. The first player to reach the reputation goal wins.&#10;&#10;Here's the cool part of the game...&#10;&#10;The cornerstone to the game is the &quot;Vendetta&quot; mechanic. If I take control of the local Delicatessen, I get some Reputation points. If you then come and Whack (destroy) the Deli, you take the Reputation points I gained from controlling Deli.&#10;&#10;But wait!&#10;&#10;There's more!&#10;&#10;When you Whack my Deli, you must give me some of your Vendetta counters. The specific number is noted on the Deli card. If I attack you in the future, I can spend your Vendetta counters to pump up my attack against your places and people.&#10;&#10;So, the more you Whack a player, the more bonuses they have in the future to Whack you back.&#10;&#10;This does 2 cool things.&#10;&#10;First, you get the whole &quot;Grudge&quot; or &quot;Now it's personal&quot; aspect of mob warfare.&#10;&#10;Second, even if a player gets Whacked hard, he still has the resources to make a comeback. Which means until a player wins, everyone has a shot at winning.&#10;&#10;The design came together very fast, and the artist, Jerry, is doing a great job of capturing the light feel we're going for.&#10;&#10;",

Interesting, Instructional and Amusing&quot;.&#10;&#10;In detail, according to the games directions:&#10;&#10;&quot;This game is virtually a business trading account between players, their stock being various breeds of fowls, the eggs from which at varying prices count in the competition. The player who makes the most money during 12 months being the winner.&#10;&#10;&quot;As there are seven breeds of fowls, there should be seven players, but a lessor number can play if a corresponding number of breeds are taken out of the pack first, leaving in only one breed for each player.  Fowl Feed cards also must be one short of the number of players.  All the accessory cards are left in.&#10;&#10;&quot;The accessory cards are introduced as they affect the game and add greater interest to it.&#10;&#10;&quot;With seven players the whole pack is wanted, consisting of 35 fowl cards, 14 accessory cards and 12 sitting cards&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game seems to be of Australian origin. A web-article by Victoria Museum noted that old Australian newspapers are peppered with advertisements for the game.&#10;&#10;",

A petrified Gorgon is unable to move and blocks the space it occupies for the remainder of the game. Jumps may be in any of the five non retreating directions: vertically, diagonally forward, and sideways. Multiple jumps are possible. The first and last row of the board are considered to be connected. A Gorgon leaving one edge will be re-entered at the appropriate space on the other edge.&#10;&#10;The first player that cannot move, loses.&#10;&#10;Note: The game can be played without forced jumps (standard) or with forced jumps (variation).&#10;&#10;Gorgon was implemented on Super Duper Games (only without forced jumps).&#10;&#10;",

On a player&rsquo;s turn she can use the power of any one of her pieces on the board (which generally involve movement, pushing and killing enemy units, or adding new units to the board).  She could also use the powers of multiple pieces if those pieces occupied the same space on the board and formed a stack.&#10;&#10;Knowing when to stack and unstack pieces and clever tactical use of the powers of the pieces are key to winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The authors of the game are proposing an alternative approach to detective stories. Passive watching / reading of a detective story turns into a dynamic boardgame, in which the players engage in searching out the evidence and investigating the complexity of the murderer's motives.  &#10;Each session is a contest of skill between the detectives and the Master of the Game in the role of the Prime Suspect. Exactly what happened and how? Who is the murderer and what was the motive of the crime? The choice is far from easy. Among the twenty suspects are respected citizens of Vileburg. Step by step the detectives follow the murderer's trail, carefully checking each trace, searching out anyone in any way connected with the case. The witnesses (once identified) are ready to testify. Their statements may help or further complicate the process of investigation. In this game everything depends on the deductive skills of the players: no one else will put together all the pieces of the puzzle into one coherent and logical picture.  And even when (and if) the criminal is finally caught (after the exciting chase phase of the game), it&rsquo;s not over yet: the detectives try to deduct the motive of the crime, reconstruct the entire story from the scraps of data they have managed to collect.&#10;&#10;",

A player board--where you keep track of money, wins, equipment, unhired staff etc., A building board, where you place blocks to build luxury suites, sponsored consessions, and stuff like that--this is also where you get victory points.  And also on that building board is where players go to the playoffs, championship, and the big bowl game.  The games goes until one player has placed all 10 blocks (two are already vice presidents and their staff, and you can assign more blocks to represent staff if you can pay them enough)--usually 60-90 minutes.  Wooden tokens with one black side which change depending on block placement determine whether there will be a game (where you need to pay staff and players) and whether there will be a loss (equipment breaks, players get injured).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;In the spring and summer of 1916, American troops crossed into Mexico in pursuit of Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa, whose troops had sacked Columbus, New Mexico following a dispute with an arms dealer based there.  After several small clashes, the biggest battle of the campaign came not against Villa's Division del Norte, but another force also on Villa's trail: the Mexican Federal Army.&#10;&#10;Just what happened at Carrizal in June 1916 is not clear: Mexican and American accounts vary wildly.  What is clear is that two dozen American cavalrymen were taken prisoner and up to 50 soldiers on both sides were killed including the &quot;Hero of Carrizal,&quot; the 29-year-old Mexican commander Gen. Felix Uresti Gomez. Only the looming war in Europe prevented open war between the two North American nations.&#10;&#10;The Chihuahua Incident is a stand-alone game in the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series: You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the four scenarios. The game is designed as a preview of the Infantry Attacks system for our hard-core fans, the Gold Club members. It includes a handful of small scenarios taking place on one game board &mdash; one based on the actual battle of Carrizal (or at least our reading of the different versions) with the others based on hypothetical variations that show the game system's take on infantry and cavalry battles.&#10;&#10;The game includes the pre-release edition of the new series rules and charts, which may be altered before the release of the first boxed game, Infantry Attacks: August 1914.  The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor are the maps and rules printed. Instead it comes as a collection of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components. The game isn't for sale; it's free to all members of the Gold Club.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Open Rails Origins - 18AL is a hybrid of several game systems, most notable 18XX, Age of Steam and Chicago Express as well as some other unique twists to create a compact yet challenging train game experience.&#10;&#10;Play begins with players participating in an auction to buy shares in one of five railroads represented in 19th century historic Alabama.  Cubes are used to lay track, represent engines you have acquired and to track your income and stock price.   The price you set on your initial stock purchase determines how many cubes you have to work with.  Railroads may build stations to block a rival's advances, upgrade cities.  Each turn your railroad may decide to save money to buy further locomotive upgrades to force your competitors to buy more expensive trains that they can't afford - or they can pay out to their investors to ultimately drive up stock price.  Play moves fast and fortunes can change in the blink of an eye.&#10;&#10;The object is to make more money than your fellow robber barons by holding the most valuable stocks and acquiring the most cash through deliveries through the game.&#10;&#10;The game is playable for one to three players.  The one player version takes about 20 minutes to play after the initial pass through the rules.  Experienced players should be able to get through the two and three player versions of the game in 60-90 minutes.&#10;&#10;This game is a print and play release of the Open Rails train game system.  Poker chips, 1 cm cubes or smaller, a pair of scissors and the means to print out four sheets of 8 x 10 paper are all that are needed to play.&#10;&#10;Latest files - including Sampo's redraw available offsite here:&#10;&#10;https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7AWw2_0pF5DM3pNSHRrNlVNOHM&amp;usp=sharing&#10;&#10;",

It has been described somewhat wrongly (as Obtuse Y) in Cameron Browne's book Connection Games.&#10;&#10;The correct rules are: The six sides of the hexboard are labeled as three adjacent pairs. A pair of sides is said to be completed by a player, if both sides within the pair and a third side not in that pair are connected by an unbroken chain of stones belonging to that player. The player who completes two pairs wins. Only one player can win, and there are no draws possible.&#10;&#10;The usual rules for connection games apply. Players take turns placing one stone of their color on any empty space, and the first move can be swapped according to the pie rule. Corners belong to both edges.&#10;&#10;",

The Dark Elves are a cruel race who excel at taking prisoners, sacrificing them, and inflicting vast amounts of pain on enemy units through hit point reduction. This treacherous faction seeks to enslave the other races of the Warhammer world. The High Elves are a proud, powerful race who rely on card denial, cancellation, healing, and ranged attacks. They work to heal damage to the world and unlock the ancient mysteries of the arcane. Both will raise mighty kingdoms and venture out on perilous quests as they seek the power to stand victorious. Can either faction rise to dominance over the other, or will they both succumb to another foe altogether?&#10;&#10;Assault on Ulthuan contains two core starter decks of forty cards, as well as two capital boards for the Dark Elves and High Elves. Players of the existing factions will find plenty to aid them as well; new cards for the other four factions, plus a handful of neutrals, bring a host of new strategies, tactics, and deck-building options for each of the six races in the game.&#10;&#10;The war for supremacy over the Old World has already seen bloodshed and suffering beyond imagination... but this was only the beginning. This spring, two new forces join the invasion!&#10;&#10;110 cards&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to get to the center of the board by earning points for unique answers to topics listed on game cards.&#10;&#10;One player selects a card, chooses one of the three topics listed on the card, and reads the topic aloud to the other players.  The one-minute sand timer starts and players write down as many answers as they can that relate to the chosen topic.  Each unique answer earns one point.  Each point represents a space on the game board.&#10;&#10;On the way to the center of the board, there are some positive and some negative places to land.  A player may land on +3 and move three spaces ahead.  Conversely, a player may land on -3 and move three spaces back.  There is also a sad-faced character for players that land on this space, go back to start.&#10;&#10;The dynamics of the game always change depending on who plays.  Topics are unique and sometimes have double, triple, or more meanings, so creativity really helps.  Infunitum is a fun party game, is excellent as an ice-breaker, and helps people get to know more about other players.&#10;&#10;",
