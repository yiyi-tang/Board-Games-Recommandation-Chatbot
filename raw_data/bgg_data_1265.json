Players will need to seize control of every situation, in order to win the day with dash and swagger. The name comes from the affectionate nickname given to Wellington by his troops.&#10;&#10;The rules use a no-dice mechanism, aiming to bring the fun and suspense back into wargaming. They are designed to allow large games with lots of commands and are suitable for multi-player games for an evening, or longer.&#10;&#10;Good Old Hook Nose aims to give a feel for the period and the way command and control worked in the century, where uniform, discipline and control were as much a part of battle as good training and armaments.

The game is played with two phases each round: an Investigation phase of exploring and tackling monsters, and a Base phase of using the resources gathered from exploring to improve the camp and make new tools.&#10;&#10;The game has skill cards and item cards, and two boards. The smaller board is the Base camp and a pathway leads on and through the larger board. Here, the path branches, letting the lemmings find different routes through to the final goal. Each location contains a hidden creature and the end goals also vary. Players only win if they complete the adventure and satisfy the final goal's demands.&#10;&#10;Players defeat the monsters by combining tools and skills to beat a strength target on the monster's card.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Walking in the crisp snow, you recognize the entrance with its polar bears, the lake and the big rock, but the animals are nowhere to be seen. Instead, you meet a variety of different creatures. One of them turns to you to ask for your help. You must carry out a mission for which you are given a map showing a part of the zoo in detail. Based on this, and going via certain points in the zoo, you need to reach the final stage of your mission. The task seems easy, but the strange creatures that pop up and the blizzard howling around you make it difficult to navigate. Fortunately, if you listen carefully and manage to memorise all the stops on your journey, you can succeed in your mission. Meanwhile, the others are also wandering around the zoo.

    "Description": "Originally laid down as an Amagi-class battlecruiser, the stipulations of the Washington Treaty resulted in her conversion to an aircraft carrier. As a result, Akagi (&#232;&#181;&#164;&#229;&#159;&#142;, &quot;Red Castle&quot;) was one of Japan&rsquo;s first large aircraft carriers. Akagi and her near-sister Kaga straddled the line between carrier and dreadnought. To keep both options open, the ships were designed to be quickly converted to capital ships. They carried turret barbettes, magazines and other equipment to support big gun turrets, and the wooden flight deck and hangar deck were designed to be quickly stripped off, making room for turrets to be mounted. However, by the mid-1930s, the admirals believed the aircraft carrier to be the equal of the capital ship and Akagi was extensively rebuilt to improve aircraft handling capacity, ending any possibility of later converting it to a capital ship.&#10;&#10;Her aircraft served in the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. With the formation of the First Air Fleet in 1941, she became its flagship, and remained so until her sinking. Notable actions include the attack on Pearl Harbor, the invasion of Rabaul, bombing Darwin, Australia and the Indian Ocean Raid.&#10;&#10;In June 1942, she participated in the Battle of Midway, her aircraft bombarding the American-held atoll. However, US aircraft originating from Midway, and the US carriers Enterprise, Hornet and Yorktown attacked Akagi and three other Japanese fleet carriers. Dive bombers from USS Enterprise severely damaged Akagi, forcing friendly escorting destroyers to scuttle her to avoid her falling into US hands. The loss of four Japanese carriers at this engagement, including Akagi, was a key defeat for Japan, decisively shifting the balance of power in the Pacific theatre.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Encore can be played 1v.1, 4v.4, 2v.7 or even solo. Will you be the cool and determined team blaze or energetic and speedy team lightning? Draw from the center action card pile and your own time card pile to begin the game. As you do your workout hand, the other team rests, but watch out! If you are caught resting after the other team has finished their round, you get to go overtime.&#10;&#10;Every game you play is a different workout, sit-ups for 60 seconds and then burpees for 90 anyone? Probably not, but in that case you can always take your chances by drawing a wild card. By adding or taking out different amounts of time cards and workout cards, you can customize your difficulty level. You can also decide to start adding victory cards before or after the 8 minute mark to change the level of challenge. Various game modes from True Victor to Team Relay are also included in the instruction manual.&#10;&#10;Once a team&rsquo;s total time cards add up to 8 minutes, a victory card is shuffled into the time card pile. Now they have the chance to win!  For every consecutive minute, another victory card is added to the time card pile until one team draws a victory card. This team is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Yorktown-class of aircraft carrier were built in a series of three. Of those, only the USS Enterprise survived the war, with the USS Yorktown sunk during the Battle of Midway, and the USS Hornet during the Battle of Santa Cruz.&#10;&#10;USS Yorktown was commissioned in 1937, and named for the battle of 1781. After Pearl Harbor, USS Yorktown transferred to the Pacific and took part in some of the first American offences of the war around the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. She also fought at the Battle of the Coral Sea where her aircraft (along with the carrier Lexington's) sank enemy light carrier Sh&#197;&#141;h&#197;&#141; prior to engaging the main Japanese carrier force the following day (May 8th 1942). During this latter stage of the engagement, the US carriers' aircraft inflicted damage to the IJN carrier Sh&#197;&#141;kaku, but in turn USS Yorktown suffered heavy damage. Lexington suffered worse, and was later scuttled as a result.&#10;&#10;Returning to Hawaii, repairs were estimated to take two weeks, but she was put back to sea a mere 48 hours after entering drydock, in time to play a crucial part in the decisive Battle of Midway. Her aircraft were instrumental in the sinking of two Japanese fleet carriers. Her presence also drew the attention of Japanese aerial attacks away from USS Entreprise and Hornet. Though crippled by Japanese aircraft, there was optimism that she could be salvaged in part. These hopes were dashed on June 6th when torpedoes from the Japanese submarine I-168 struck her twice. Further hopes of repair were abandoned, and she sank the following day.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fato Fake is a knowledge contest. Do you think you know enough? So prepare your memory and let's get started.&#10;&#10;Start of the game: Each player chooses a color among the available pins and the oldest player shuffles the cards and places them stacked in the indicated place on the board, with the back side facing up.&#10;&#10;With all the pins in the &ldquo;start&rdquo; box. &#10;The first must advance one space on the board, remove the first card from the pile and, without looking, hand it over to the player on your right. Then, you must turn the roulette wheel. If the pointer stops at of the colored boxes, the player with the card reads the question with the corresponding color on the card and, at the end of the statement read, asks: &ldquo;Fact or fake? &rdquo;.&#10;&#10;If the player gets it right, he gets the card. If he misses, the card goes to a lot of discard.&#10;&#10;Attention: If the pointer stops over the &ldquo;CHALLENGE&rdquo; box, the player must point any player, according to his strategy, to respond.&#10;If the chosen player gets it right, he keeps the card; if he misses, the player who challenged him stays with her.&#10;But wait! Do you think it's easy? If the roulette stops on the &ldquo;AZAR&rdquo; box, the player must answer 2 questions to keep the card. For example: If he hits the first and misses the second, he will be forced to hit the third to keep the card. If you miss 2 questions, the letter goes to lot of disposal.&#10;&#10;The next one on the left removes a card from the pile on the board, advances one square and repeats the process.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player reaches the final square. At that point, all players count their cards. Win that one that got it right and, consequently, has more cards.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls an avatar moving around an ever-shrinking grid of tiles representing a nodes on company&rsquo;s network, such as email servers or security cameras. When you move onto a tile, you hack the node to extract a token of information secretly worth 1, 2 or 3 points.

When you move onto an occupied node, you are forced to share information with those players, surrendering your hard-won tokens. Your spoils are only secure after you logout of the system, either by running out of possible moves or waiting until the network gets small enough to slip out. Once everyone has logged out, the winner is the player with the most valuable set of tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Of course, if either fails too often, they both lose overall, so .... :-) )&#10;&#10;The player chooses either the H (High Himalayas) route with its hazards or the M (Japanese fighter-interceptor aerodrome at Myitkina) route.  He takes the maximum number of transport aircraft pieces possible and then adds to that upside-down piece mix a number of hazard pieces equal to half the number of transports rounded up.&#10;&#10;(In 1942-43, trying to fly the lower route over Myitkina is very much pushing your luck, depending on Japanese fighter strength and who wins the air battle.)&#10;&#10;From that inverted total he pulls a number of pieces equal to the number of original transports and finds out if sufficient loads - DC3s/C-47s carry 1, C-46s and (B-24 Liberator transport) C-87s carry 2 (although the C-87s can only carry 1 over the High route), and the late war DC-4s/C-54s carry *4*! - make it over the Hump.&#10;&#10;Of course, the number of loads required each season increases with the Allied supreme commanders' demands.&#10;&#10;The USAAF Air Transport Command actually delivered far more supplies in the air than could be delivered by gas-guzzling trucks on the Burma and then Ledo/Stilwell Roads.&#10;&#10;Hazards include Engine Failure, Unexpected Mountain, Mule Stampede! (wrecking the center of gravity ... 3,000 mules were delivered, 4 to a plane), Spontaneous Explosion (C-46s only), Bad Compass-Thick Clouds-Out of Gas, Oxygen Loss-Disorientation, and Rock Throwing Yetis! (Some planes just disappeared along the costly &quot;Aluminum Highway.&quot; Wrecks and remains are still being found.)&#10;&#10;The no-dice Basic Game plays in about 40 minutes max. and really gives you the overall sense of the air transport campaign.  (Ernest K. Gann was an ATC pilot and later wrote the book Fate is the Hunter.  The movie is free to watch on YouTube.)&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game, differentiating Fuel and Equipment loads,  including sea and rail transport cargo capacities to the East India airfields, and having abstracted ground combat rules takes longer.&#10;&#10;All aircraft icons are by me, pixel by pixel (hence, the small datafile size of the counter sheet).&#10;&#10;The Dedication includes mention of one Bob Coatney, who was a master sergeant based at ATC headquarters in Dacca, East India.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Polar Rails is a Christmas-themed game that uses the gameplay from Empire Builder with players creating rail networks that are centered on the North Pole.&#10;&#10;Use your initial investment to build track, then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand. Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains and expand your railroad empire. Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;In more detail, players use washable crayons to draw their train routes over a map of the North Pole, including North America, Greenland, Asia, and Europe. Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns. For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train. The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff. Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase. During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards. When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one. Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards. When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed. During the building phase, a player may pay to build more track or upgrade their train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect their track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;",

Captures the essence of what it&rsquo;s like to play Gridiron, without statistics, players, etc. You are the team and make the calls every play as you battle it out with the opposing team. Choose to be the home team or the visitor and it&rsquo;s game on! Includes 56 cards depicting offensive and defensive actions (Run, Pass, Kick, Fake, Dive, Hail Mary, Hand-Off, Kickoff, Tackle, Fumble, etc.), 1 Offense card, 2 Score cards, 1 Reference card, and 3 Indicator cubes.&#10;&#10;After the kickoff, the player assuming the role of offense will place a &quot;Snap&quot; card. The opponent can then place a card that counters or follows the snap card, such as &quot;Tackle.&quot; Offense can counter with a &quot;Pass.&quot; Cards can be played as combinations to increase your side's points. The goal is to get more points than your opponent every play to advance your marker on the score card. After 4 plays, offense will either score points (simulating a field goal all the way to a touchdown with a 2-point conversion) or defense will score 2 points for a safety. Play continues with the opponent assuming the role of offense.&#10;&#10;All of this can be interrupted or changed if an opponent intercepts the ball, recovers a fumble, etc. And every action played has counters. Winning players have a little luck but play their cards strategically to maximize when to play combos, which cards to play vs. keep, and how to predict their opponent's plays. To add further depth, each card has an Offense and a Defense side to it, providing for many more play possibilities.&#10;&#10;The deck represents either a full game, a half, or a quarter of a game. Once a full game is complete, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Today, you are playing pirates and want to build camps and a fort faster than anyone else.&#10;&#10;In Catan: First Adventure, you start with a pirate camp that sits across two of the islands in the larger ring of islands. Each island depicts a resource, and you start with one of each of the resources showing on the islands under your camp.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first roll the six-sided die. On a result of 1-5, all players take a resource from the reserve if they have a camp on an island with a matching number; on a result of 6, you move the Ghost Captain to an island of your choice, taking two of the resource depicted there. No one else can claim resources from this island as long as the Ghost Captain remains there.&#10;&#10;You then move the single ship on its course clockwise around the island. If you have one of each resource &mdash; molasses, wood, goat, cutlass &mdash; you can build a camp on an empty space adjacent to the ship. If you don't have what you need, you can trade any two resources for one of your choice, or you can spend a wood and a goat for random help from Coco the parrot. You don't know what Coco might give you, but ideally it's better than the wood and goat you just sacrificed to him!&#10;&#10;After you build all your camps, you can build a fort on an empty space by spending two of each resource, and whoever does so first wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1920 is a two-player, intermediate complexity, strategic-level wargame simulation of the  &quot;Polish-Soviet War&quot; the Soviet attempt to conquer Poland. Soviet and Polish forces engulf each other in swift campaigns, fighting on a large area stretching from Kiev and Smolensk in the East to Warsaw and Thorn in the West. Will the Red Army prevail and bring happiness and peace to the German and French working classes or will the Poles pull off a magnificent victory one can only describe as a 'miracle'? It only needs two players to find out an answer to this question in this exciting 2 hour wargame.&#10;&#10;Players can learn the game via four short scenarios, being gradually introduced to the game mechanics and quickly able to grasp the accurate concept of lines of control, surprising rail transfers, and morale advantages and understand the strategic ramifications of the theater of war. Further rules cover army morale advantages, revolutionary mobilization organized by the hated Soviet political police the Cheka, the torn loyalties of the Ukrainians, fighting on both sides of the front and the formation of the Polish Volunteer Army.&#10;&#10;A plethora of formations and units appear in the game: the Latvian Rifles, the dreaded Budyenny's Horse Army, counter-revolutionary Russian, Belorussian and Cossack troops, various Polish formations including the Siberian Brigade, support units such as tanks, flotillas, armored cars and above all armored trains, which were extensively used in the campaign.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Risky Chicken, each player is a chicken who wants to get rich. The winning player is the first to obtain a certain number of Gold Coins.&#10;&#10;Players take turns being the Leader of climbs up the Golden Mountain, each turn choosing a Sidekick to join them on this journey. As players ascend the Golden Mountain, they land on levels with increasing amounts of Gold Coins, but they also grow likelier to &ldquo;fall off&rdquo; the mountain.&#10;&#10;At every level, the Leader and Sidekick must each decide whether to Climb (continue to press their luck) or Chicken Out (cash out and end the turn.) Both players often agree that Chickening Out is a wise decision, and they may agree to play their Chicken Out cards. However, each player can benefit by breaking their promise and playing Climb, at the expense of the other. This dynamic is inspired by the &ldquo;Repeated Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma&rdquo; model of game theory. Players must weigh their greed in the short term against the value of their alliances.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives one Chicken Trick card which gives them a special rule-bending ability (variable player power). There are 12 Chicken Trick cards, each representing a unique, silly chicken character.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In Pirates of the Dread Sea you create a crew of pirates from various fantasy races (or just use the pre-designed crews) such as Orcs, Dwarves, the Undead or Humans and fight for treasure and survival. Although PODS can be enjoyed as a single game, and can easily be taught to new players for an evenings entertainment, it can also support long campaigns, during which players can personalise and upgrade their crews.&#10;&#10;Games of PODS are based on a Scenario. Scenario&rsquo;s usually involve finding treasure, though sometimes they may involve capturing or rescuing hostages, or simply fighting. Each player controls a small Crew of miniatures (around half a dozen) and players take it in turns to act with one miniature at a time. During a miniatures &ldquo;phase&rdquo; they can perform two Actions (Captain&rsquo;s can perform three) such as moving, shooting and fighting hand to hand.&#10;&#10;In addition to a huge variety of weapons, skills and traits which can be applied to characters dependent on their race and experience, Event Cards add another level of tactics to the game. An Event Card can throw your opponent entirely off track, or boost your own forces, whether that be by ensuing the enemy miss a shot, or by boosting your crews morale by singing a shanty to them!&#10;&#10;Pirates of the Dread Sea is a PIRATE war game, not just a war game with a pirate theme tacked on. Everything about the game has been designed to fit the setting, and create fun, narrative, exciting adventures on your tabletop.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You are taking the role of one of the major Silesian aristocratic houses ( Ballestrem, Giesche, Henckel von Donnesmarck, Hochberg, Schaffgotsch). In-game you have to make 2 actions out of five: Influence, extraction, research, building,exchange. Influence is needed to build more advanced buildings. Research gives cards from the technology deck. These cards are advancement cards or event cards. In the game, you are collecting resources by drawing cards from the extraction deck. You are also expanding your house by raising buildings in different fields. These buildings are giving bonuses to area resources. They are also giving victory points needed to win the game. Exchange lets you trade resources with bank in proportions 1:3 (or 1:2 with the special building). The game ends when any player earns 27 victory points. There are optional variants: with constructing every building, or a faster variant with 21 victory points needed to end the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1244: The Fall of Montsegur is a strategic board game inspired by the historical event. One player takes on the role of commanding the crusading army. The other player takes on the role of commanding the defense of Montsegur. In a series of turns the players fight to gain control of the area around Montsegur and the souls of the Cathars trapped inside the castle. At the end of the siege, victory points are scored to determine if the Cathar faith survives the fall.&#10;&#10;The goal in 1244: The Fall of Montsegur is to claim the majority of the souls of the Cathar perfects trapped inside the castle. The inquisitors of the Crusaders try to get the misguided to repent, while the Cathars perfects try to escape or to have faith to make the final sacrifice: Burn for their belief.&#10;&#10;The religious struggle takes place on the background of a military campaign, where each side strives to gain control of the battlefield and to endure the hardships of the long siege.&#10;&#10;In a number of turns each representing roughly one month of the siege, each player in turn plays cards to advance his goals and to sabotage his opponent. Each card can either be played for the point value on the card to take one of the standard actions or be played for the event on the card. Some events benefit solely the Cathars, others the Crusaders, and some can benefit both depending on who plays it and what the position on the board is. In every turn one card from each player's hand is not played but is kept for the final scoring.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You and your cohorts of crime have just pulled off the most successful bank heist of the century, including the theft of one of the world's most valuable diamonds. You must lay low for a week and guard your take; there's no honor amongst thieves here, and everyone wants the most they can get. Plus, rumors are there's a snake in your midst that might be out to get the prize jewel for themselves, and a rat could be trying to foil the whole operation.&#10;&#10;Each player will be dealt a random crew card to tell you what your part in this band of thieves is. These are not hidden from other players, since teamwork is dreamwork, after all. Each person brings their own unique talent, or specialty, to the crew, usable throughout the game. You will also be given a random role card, possibly giving you a secret double agent part to play. These should not be shared and will affect how you can win the game. There are four regular crew member cards, one snake card, and one rat card. As with any squad, the more people you bring in, the likelier it is to have defectors.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of seven rounds, or days. Every day will begin with players taking turns to choose their actions for the day by placing a token on the box next to the action of their choice. For morning actions, you will use the numbers on your crew cards to determine turn order. After that, turn order is based on the last round's actions going from top to bottom on the action card in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Your goal, as the thief you are, is to hoodwink your way through the week, exchanging loot with players and the score to end up with the best take for yourself. Don't get too greedy, though! If you end up with more than the score, your zealousness will be shown, and the crew will take you out. The prized diamond is also supposed to be shared, so any crew  member holding it at the end will mark you for an early demise, as well. Additionally, the bank loaded a tracker into the loot that will get you caught and disqualified if you're holding it at the end.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
