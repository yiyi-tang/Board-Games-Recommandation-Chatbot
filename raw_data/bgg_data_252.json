Cards are numbered one through 10, with there being more 1's than 10's. The object of the game is to pick up baggage in ascending numerical order, being the first player to collect numbers 1 to 10.&#10;&#10;This game from Alex Randolph from 1987 uses a similar mechanism as earlier used by Haltet den Dieb (Georg Schittenhelm) in 1975.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "INTRODUCTION&#10;Aliens are among us! Coming from a distant planet they do not have peaceful intentions: they are ready to assimilate humanity to make us blue, small and flabby just like them. And since the day was not already awful enough, they want to start right from your city. They are plenty, smart and wicked, just like fag ash, but do not panic: as current lodger of planet Earth, we still have some aces in the hole to play.&#10;&#10;On our side, we have unshakable field agents, tough to the bones and loyal to the cause, although limited when it is time to take action. We can also count on a brilliant group of scientists: if these eggheads could just work together, they might indeed find a way to prevent the imminent invasion... too bad that at the first warning they fled and scatter to the ends of the city! They might be braniacs but definitely miss the guts.&#10;&#10;As part of the resistance, your mission is to coordinate the agents on the field and gather all the scientists before the aliens complete their plan of conquering the city. You shall send orders from your secret headquarter, but be aware: the enemy is looking for you, and if it manages to localize you, it would assimilate and bring you by its side with no hesitation! If that happens you will end up in the perfect situation to undermine all the effort of your former comrades.. the Earthlings!&#10;&#10;COURSE OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The game is divided in three stages that repeat until the end of the game:&#10;1. Event execution (carried out by the architect)&#10;2. Players&lsquo; turns (carried out by all players clockwise)&#10;3. Consolidation (carried out by the architect)&#10;&#10;1. Event execution &#10;The invasion is underway! At any moment an alien attack or a stroke of luck can completely change the situation...&#10;&#10;The architect turns over the top card of&#10;the events deck and execute its effects.&#10;Then, he discards the card.&#10;&#10;2. Players&lsquo; turns&#10;&#10;Each player will be able to command agents in the city or to plan the best strategy to pursue his/her goal. Beware, though: with each action there is the risk of being detected and assimilated by aliens! The alien players may choose to stay hidden until the end of the game or to reveal themselves (without showing their cards)to be in favor with other alien players at the price of exposing themselves to the opposing faction.&#10;&#10;During his/her turn a player may have to perform risky actions that require to draw a given number of assimilation cards. Once drawn, the cards must be kept secret and cannot be revealed to other players. By drawing at least&#10;one Assimilated! card a player becomes an alien. From this very moment on, his/her goal is to let the alien faction win the game! If the assimilation deck is empty the player can still perform his/her actions without drawing any card. An alien player drawing a Human card is still alien. Moreover, drawing two or more Assimilated! Cards does not change the situation.&#10;Once alien, alien forever!&#10;&#10;3. Consolidation&#10;&#10;After all players have completed their turn, the field is prepared for the next stages.&#10;&#10;THE GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to save all the scientists on the map before the invasion is completed. To archive this objective you must keep out the aliens from the rescue. Keep your eyes on your neighbours, they may no longer be the friends you used to trust, not anymore.&#10;&#10;",

Players have a set of cards in their hands and place their political influence and power in front of them or in front of the other players, when they think their participation is enought they can chose to 'pass'. The politician that cointains the higher value of political power in front of him by the time everyone has passed is considered the autor of that scandal published and recieve all the information displayed in the card.&#10;The winner is the player who at the end of the game accumulates more votes.&#10;&#10;In the path to the victory, the administration of your image and money are essentials! With money you can buy political help, hiring a lawyer, marketeer or even a advertiser.&#10;Your image, despite being the first tie-braker, will help you gain more or less cards during the game.

If a player says Play in Round 1, they are the &quot;dummy.&quot; They lay all their cards down and declare which color will be trump (or no-trump). Each player then declares their hand's pip strength (small dots on some cards) and color count (largest quantity of one color in their hand). Starting on the dummy's left, cards are played. You must follow suit if you can; highest card  of the 4 wins. [Note: if no one calls play in Round 1, players will bid on how many tricks their team can win.] After 13 tricks, one team scores points as indicated on a chart. If the declaring team fails to make their bid, the opposing team scores. Play ends after four rounds.   &#10;&#10;&#10;",

They, as the Crew, therefore have to decode the Sources signal which he performs as a kind of flight simulation using his hand with 'taps' as stopover landings on planets on the way.&#10;In this cooperative game players loose if fuel runs out (6 incorrect guesses at the target planet), or win together if they managed to follow the signal with their rocket to 12 (different) planets.&#10;The game includes a variant for professionals, and helper cards to adjust difficulty in addition to the starting difficulty &#10;level.&#10;&#10;The person giving hints can only 1) show the length of the flight by 2) how long he keeps his hand above the table&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "from the general Comment:&#10;This is essentially a card game. Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.&#10;&#10;If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.&#10;&#10;",

Each player also gets some question cards.  Each player then takes turns asking their question to the other players.  If you get a Yes, you may draw another question card and ask another question.  If you get a No, you may ask no more questions, but may try to guess the identity of all the players.  A nice mechanism for showing if the player is right is part of the game.  When a player makes his guesses a box is handed around and each player puts a chip in the Yes side if his identity was correctly guessed or a chip in the No side if it was not.  The guessing player looks at the results and the game ends if all the chips are in the Yes side.  Else the game continues.&#10;There are also some oddball characters that will either: always lie, always answer no, or answer yes or no to any question.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&quot;Aloha, Holiday Island. Island tourism grew explosively around 1960 and travel agents searched desperately for new paradise beaches. Your travel office asks you to explore new holiday destinations. Your task is to find the best beaches and the most attractive locations.&quot;&#10;&#10;Aloha is a nice mix of tile play and push-your-luck. Players are travel reps trying to secure the best beaches by placing sun loungers on beaches as they explore the island. The tiles show a good mix of land and water, with 1-3 golden beaches on most tiles. On your turn, you jump your rep to a new place, then draw a tile. This must be placed adjacent so you can walk straight onto it, otherwise your turn is over. If you walk on, and it has a beach, you have the option of dropping a lounger in your color onto it on its side.&#10;&#10;Then you can decide to push your luck and draw another tile. Each time you walk on, you may drop another lounger, but these go onto their sides. When you decide you've done enough or cannot move on anyway, you stop drawing and turn your loungers upright. But if you draw a tile you can't place so that you walk on, you lose all the loungers on their sides back to your pot. The tile still gets placed, and the game has a clever rule. Whenever a tile is placed, it must go where it touches the most tiles. So if the tile is going next to where you stand, sometimes you have no choice, the game forces its placement. But usually you have a few choices and these are crucial to pushing your luck.&#10;&#10;Finally, when all the tiles are down, the island is scored. The longest beach gets a 10pt marker, the next a 9pt marker and so on (with rules for tie-breaks). Then, the player with the most loungers on that beach collects to points markers (more tie-breaks). Also, any loungers still in your pot are also worth 1 pt each.&#10;&#10;At first, you think you must fight over owning beaches, and try to wrest back control of a beach. But in fact you will only win by occupying several beaches, and often you only need 3 or 4 markers to secure control. Being able to start a beach, get control, then extend it to get most points will win. Players can be unlucky and draw un-walkable tiles a few times, but this means you are not picking the correct places when jumping.&#10;&#10;As the game ends, your options reduce, but you should have done your work already. The result is a nice looking island, with lush jungle and bluewater inlets, dotted with lots of loungers.&#10;&#10;You have nothing to do till your turn, but if you make the right choices, you should have a winning chance. Knowing when to go one more tile matters, and knowing when to stop. Players with lots of loungers left in front of them can still win, but may have wasted their opportunities.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to arrive close to the Chosen One, to catch her and to bring in the own base. Obviously, each player have to balance the ability of the own three Characters, decide which artifact to buy and when attack the other miniatures, to steal the Chosen One from the other faction or to kill an enemy model.&#10;The Secret Society's goal, instead, is to allow the Chosen One to complete her full path: so they can help one faction or the other, but only for a future personal gain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You might be fighting to control a zone, placing units in a certain location, or eliminating your opponent's units. There are three levels of play: Boot Camp, Intermediate, and Advanced. The Advanced mode includes rules for air support, destructible cover, special commander powers, and class-specific powers.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players will draw cards based on how many and which type of control points they own, move aircraft, fight other aircraft, move one squad, and fire with one squad. The game's cards allow players to recruit new units, call in airstrikes, or manipulate combat odds by upgrading the specialized attack and defense dice to more powerful ones with better results. The winning player or team is the one that accomplishes the stated victory condition on a scenario, usually by holding a specific set of territories or eliminating an entire opposing force.&#10;&#10;",

Sangoku (meaning &quot;three realms&quot;) is an elegant and thematic card game by renowned designer Mike Elliott.&#10;&#10;In the game, players recruit warriors &ndash; Dogs, Samurais, Oni and Dragons &ndash; to their armies by playing poker hands to each of the Three Realms. The best hand in each realm wins, and a Warrior is summoned from the winning cards &ndash; but the weakest cards also summon the most powerful Warriors, with the 2 card in each suit (Fire, Metal, Earth, Water, Wood) summoning a mighty Dragon. With these recruited Warrior tokens, players advance on their opponents to gain ascendancy in the Realms. They can also wager and collect Legend cards, which when combined into sets can be used to powerful effect, including bringing forth uniquely damaging Warriors.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this chess variant for up to 4 players, the game is played on a 10x10 board with four suits of sixteen cards corresponding to traditional chess pieces.&#10;&#10;Four games can be played with this set.&#10;&#10;Cardchess: Players shuffle the 16 cards of their suit and place them randomly face down in eight pairs of two on the letters A, R, D, C, H, E, S and S. Each player has two moves each turn. They first turn over a card. Second, they pick any face up card and move it according to chess rules. To win the game, a player must capture all of his opponents' Kings by checkmate. Once a King is captured, all the pieces from his team are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Positional Cardchess: The only difference between Cardchess and Positional Cardchess is the initial setup. In Positional Cardchess, the eight cards of highest value are placed face down on letters A, R, D, C, H, E, S and S in the same order as traditional chess.&#10;&#10;Memory Cardchess: All player cards are shuffled together and placed face down on the board in a configuration which depends on the number of players. On each turn, players have two moves. They first turn over a card. The card remains face up if it is in their suit. If it isn't, the card must be clearly shown to other players so they can memorize it. Second, players move the card they just turned over or any other previously exposed card according to chess rules. To win the game, a player must capture all of his opponents' Kings by checkmate.&#10;&#10;Traditional chess: The game board and cards allow to play a traditional game of chess.&#10;&#10;",
