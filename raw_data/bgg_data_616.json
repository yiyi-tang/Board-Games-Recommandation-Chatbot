    "Description": "Couch of Power is a multi-player game where the object is to get the players of your team to occupy all the positions of the Couch of Power.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&#10;Gather players and define the seating arrangements.  You need 1 more seat than there are players.  Therefore, if you have 10 players, you will need  11 seats.  In this way, there will always be one empty seat during the game.  Define the target goal - usually a couch (aka the Couch of Power) with room for four people.  Starting with the Couch of Power, fill up all positions in the seating area except, of course, the empty seat.&#10;&#10;Hand out slips of paper to the players.  Each player writes their name on the slip.&#10;&#10;Gather the slips up, and randomly distribute them back to the players.  Make sure each player does not receive back their own name.&#10;&#10;Divide the players into two teams.  The easiest method is to take the current seating arrangement and alternately assign them to a team.  One effective method is simply having every other player roll up a pants leg or sleeve to indicate which team they are on.&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;&#10;The game is played a number of rounds until the Couch of Power consists entirely of players from one team.&#10;&#10;Every round, the person sitting to the left of the empty seat is the caller.  They get to call out a name.  The person holding the slip of paper with that name on it moves from their current spot to the empty seat.  The player now to the left of the newly vacated empty seat is the new caller.  Play continues in this manner until the Couch of Power consists entirely of players from one team.&#10;&#10;The callers may not repeat the same name twice in a row.  This helps prevent a player from ping-ponging between two spots.&#10;&#10;It's important for players to remember who is holding which name.  The game is a combination of strategy, memory, and luck.  Strategy - is it better to pull an opposing team member off the couch or place one of your members on the team?  Memory - you need to remember who is holding what name.  Luck - in the beginning of the game, who is holding what name is unknown.&#10;&#10;",

It is distinct from Checkers and Canadian Checkers. A common alternative name used locally for this game is Dum.&#10;&#10;It is played on a board of 144 squares with 30 pieces on a side. Un-promoted pieces can only move and capture forward. A promoted piece (king) moves like a chess bishop, and can capture a piece anywhere along its line of movement.&#10;&#10;A turn must capture the maximum possible number of pieces. Failing to do so results in forfeiture of that piece. If there is a choice between pieces to use for capturing, the king takes precedence.&#10;&#10;",

George Parker had decided to concentrate on only the company's top sellers (and also to conserve materials). However South American Travel was released anyway because Mr. Parker believed Americans still had a hunger to travel and visit exotic places.&#10;The originally planned metal game pieces were however replaced with cardboard and wood, due to the war effort..&#10;&#10;",

As long as a player has one or more pieces remaining in the Starting Area, each piece is limited to either a horizontal or vertical move in one direction.

Two pieces may be captured, if a move is split between two pieces. Once down to one piece, you may capture two opponents pieces, by exact count of each of the two dice, either in a straight line, or by changing directions with the second die.&#10;&#10;This game includes two special 6 sided dice. Sides have printed numbers 1-5 and a side with a &quot;P.&quot; If one &quot;P&quot; is rolled, you may move one of your own (or an opponents) piece the number rolled. You can even move the opponent back to his Starting Area. If you roll two &quot;P's&quot;, you can move one of your pieces directly to the Plot Area, even if coming from the Starting Area.&#10;&#10;The Plot Area is a safety zone in the center of the grid. Each player has a square of his color. Besides rolling two &quot;P's&quot;, you may enter this area through your assigned color, and can only come to rest on your own assigned color.

To begin, any player turns over the top card from the stack of &quot;point cards.&quot; Each player then competes for that card by selecting one of the cards in his hand, placing it face down in front of him. After each player has done this, they turn over all the cards played. The player with the highest number is awarded as many points as is indicated on the face of that point card. Point card is then placed in a discard pile and the next point card is revealed.&#10;&#10;Play continues with each game ending after all 11 cards held by players have been played. Two of the 13 point cards will not be revealed in each game.&#10;&#10;",

Each square is marked at one of the  corners to help identify related squares during a complex move.&#10;&#10;The game begins in a unique way: &#10;The players agree on how many pawns each side will have.  An empty board is placed between the players and the pawns are placed in front of the players, but not on the board.  Black begins by entering one of his pawns on any square except one of the  &ldquo;border squares&rdquo; (the squares along the edges of the board).  Then White enters a pawn, no more than one square away from Black's, and not on a border square.  The players continue to take turns, either entering a pawn or moving one that is already on the board.&#10;&#10;How the pawns move:&#10;An isolated pawn cannot move &ndash; it's frozen (hence the name of the game).  A pawn that is not frozen has the potential to make a jumping or non-jumping move in any direction.  The jump can be over allied as well as opposing pawns.&#10;&#10;When an opponent's pawn is jumped over, it's removed from the board.  If the player is not at &ldquo;stage 2,&rdquo; that pawn is returned to the opponent to be reentered.  If the player has reached stage 2, that pawn is permanently captured.&#10;&#10;The last player able to move wins.&#10;&#10;The game set has a high quality vinyl roll-up board,  12 black pawns and 12 natural wood colored pawns (molded from material that is 40% recycled wood), and the instruction booklet which includes an explanation of Freeze notation and 12 short sample games, illustrating the rules and touching on the strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;www.frezcogames.com&#10;&#10;",

You'll track character's positions on the spaceship layouts and the ships' positions on the hex map. The action in Battlestations is literally character driven. If you want the ship to turn or speed up, a character has to take an action to make is so. If you want the ship's guns to fire at an enemy ship, a character has to take an action to fire the guns.&#10;&#10;This is the rulebook only. You will need the full boxed game to play.&#10;&#10;",

Do you have the nerve to test your luck against the forces of Man and Nature?!&#10;&#10;You don't have to be nuts to play this game, but it helps to have some!&#10;&#10;It has been estimated that before the arrival of the White Man, there were billions of squirrels and a squirrel could travel by tree from the Atlantic to the Mississippi without ever touching the ground!&#10;&#10;Well, time have changed!  The trees are gone and roads crisscross the countryside.  Life is tough on these hapless rodents as they attempt to navigate Man&rsquo;s Asphalt Obstacles!&#10;&#10;As you may have guessed, the object of this game is to gather as many nuts as possible and get them home without becoming a Furry Flapjack!  You will need a bag of Nuts.  Of course, you could use pennies or other objects, but for the true Wilderness Experience, nuts are essential!&#10;&#10;The first player to get home with nuts wins, and won&rsquo;t starve to death next winter!&#10;&#10;",

If neither player plays a card, nothing happens and both players return to Step 1.&#10;&#10;STEP 6: When both players have played a card, the battle begins!&#10;&#10;A.Each player must refer to Symbol on their card which indicates the Battle Element that each player&rsquo;s opponent will be using for this battle.

The winning player now gets to inflict &ldquo;Damage&rdquo; to their opponent.&#10;&#10;C.When receiving Damage, the losing player must draw a number of cards from the top of their deck equal to the amount indicated on the winning player&rsquo;s card (See Symbol ).

The Catcher tries to say anybody's word three times in rapid succession before that player can respond by saying his own word once.  If the Catcher is successful, the &quot;caught&quot; player discards a chip and the round continues.  Once one player has lost all three chips the round ends, and players score a point for each chip remaining.  The player who lost all his chips becomes the new Catcher.
