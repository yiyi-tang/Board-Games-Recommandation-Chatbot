    "Description": "&quot;NUTS! The Battle of the Bulge&quot; is a card wargame for 2-4 players recreating the famous World War II battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)&#10;&#10;The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.  (comments by Walt Mulder)&#10;&#10;",

Players look at these cards, then turn them face down. On a turn, a player rolls the two dice: one showing a number, the other a characteristic of a burglar card. If the player can identify the correct item on the correct burglar card, they claim that card as a reward, then put a new card in its place. Whoever collects the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

Cars can roll freely on the board and possibly roll off the board or crash.  When movement ends, you must release your 4x4 and see if it &quot;free wheels.&quot;  Rolling off the board or crashing means the loss of a turn while you get your 4x4 back on the road.  Seven boulders on the road (placed at the start of the game) stop movement, but are removed from the game when first encountered.  Light hearted and fun, especially with younger players.&#10;&#10;",

On each round, one player is the &ldquo;active merchant&rdquo;, and he tries to sell flowers to the rest of the players.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;84 Flower Cards&#10;22 Special Cards&#10;15 Special Orders Cards (these are used in a variant)&#10;5 Scoring Assistant Cards&#10;5 Merchant Cards&#10;70 coins in 3 different values&#10;10 Loan tiles&#10;1 Rulebook&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Before the game starts, each player selects (or is given randomly) a merchant card, a scoring assistant card and some coins.&#10;The flower and special cards are shuffled together, and are placed as a face-down deck on the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each round consists of the following:&#10;- Receive Income: this applies to all players. Each one gets coins from the bank, depending on who his/her merchant is, and what cards he/she possesses (some cards offer income).&#10;- Reveal cards: The active player draws and reveals a number of cards from the deck, arranges them into two or three &ldquo;bouquets&rdquo; and offers them, one by one, for auction. The other players announce their bids (each player can bid more than once), and this continues until someone offers an amount no-one else wishes to surpass. The active merchant then has two options: to give the bouquet to the highest bidder and get the money, or to keep the bouquet to himself/herself, and give the high bidder an amount of money equal to half his/her high bid.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;At the end of the second day the game ends, and each player counts the points he/she gathered from his/her flower collection and his/her coins. The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;MiG Alley: Air War Over Korea 1951&quot; is a two-player wargame covering the air battles over North Korea in 1951. One player controls the UN forces and must carry out a series of bombing raids to knock out key targets in North Korea. The other player controls the communist forces, including masses of the new MiG-15 jet fighters, and attempts to inflict prohibitive losses on the UN.&#10;&#10;The game uses the Air Wars series rules. Aircraft are rated according to historical type. Fuel consumption is factored into the plane types, so a player must manage the available forces to ensure enough combat power is ready when needed. Each player has a unique set of campaign cards generating movement, combat bonuses, historical events, and reinforcements. Playing the right card at the right time is crucial to winning.&#10;&#10;Skills:&#10;&bull; Level: Air Group&#10;&bull; Hex: 23.5 miles per inch&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Seize your friends' pawns in this delightful game of capture with two unique ways to play! &quot;Brainy&quot; Got'Em! offers the strategic challenge of outsmarting and cornering your opponents with deliberately placed walls, while the tricky yet fun-for-all-ages &quot;Bright&quot; Got'Em! has the same goal of trapping your opponents, plus colorful surprises that will keep you on your toes!&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;Corner Your Friends!&#10;&#10;Trap their pawns in one of two delightful games of escape and capture. In Bright Got 'Em you outsmart and corner your opponents through savvy card play, sly movement, and clever placement of blocking walls. In the still-casual, but even-trickier Brainy Got 'Em! you toss aside card actions in favor of a purely strategic challenge.&#10;&#10;Both games share the same goal, the same exciting intrigue, and the same social fun. &#10;Place walls to trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours!&#10;&#10;Surround yourself with friends and family. Get ready to enjoy mroe fun than any four walls could ever contain! It's time you Got 'Em!&#10;Play Summary:&#10;The goal: trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours. Last pawn free wins!&#10;&#10;Bright Got 'Em! (use colored side of the board)&#10;In Bright Got 'Em!, each player starts with 3 cards and pawn. Place your pawn on the same-colored start square (one of the four squares at the corners of the board's center square). The player who's birthday is closest, goes first.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will play a card, following each rule in the order they appear. Most cards have 2 instructions. The first tells you where you can place a wall and the second how many square you can move your pawn.&#10;&#10;Wall Placement Rules:&#10;Walls can only be placed along one edge of a square, between two squares.&#10;When a player's pawn is trapped by walls in a single square, that player is eliminated from the game. The edge of the board counts as a wall.&#10;There are a few cards that allow you to remove a wall or pass through a wall. However, you have to play these cards before your pawn is trapped! &#10;Once your pawn is trapped in a single square, you're out and your pawn is removed from the board.&#10;When you trap another player's pawn, thus eliminating him from the game, you may remove any 1 wall from the board.&#10;&#10;Moving Your Pawn&#10;Most cards allow you to move your pawn up to a specific number of squares.&#10;You can't move through walls, unless you play a card that allows it.&#10;You can't move through a square occupied by another pawn.&#10;You may only move orthogonally, never diagonally.&#10;You can stay where you are.&#10;You don't have to move the exact number of squares listed on the card. You can move fewer squares if you want.&#10;You can move zig zag, first in one direction, then in another, just not diagonally up to the number of squares specified on the card you played.&#10;&#10;After placing a wall and moving (or not), discard the card you played and draw another. (You should always have 3 cards in your hand.) Play passes to the player on your left.&#10;&#10;The last player to have a pawn on the board wins!&#10;&#10;Brainy Got 'Em! (use white side of board)&#10;You don't need any cards for this version. The goal is the same: trap your opponents' pawns while illuding capture yourself.&#10;&#10;On your turn, place a wall anywhere on the board, then move your pawn.&#10;The number of squares you can move your pawn is equal to 1 plus the number of walls on your square. You may place a wall on the square your pawn occupies to increase your pawn's movement on the same turn.&#10;&#10;All other rules are the same as Bright Got 'Em!&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 double-sided game board (Bright Got 'Em! on one side, Brainy Got 'Em! on the other), 84 wall pieces, 55 Got 'Em! cards, 4 pawns, game rules.&#10;&#10;",

With the favor of the gods, we shall lead our people to become the chosen tribe that will bring unity and strength to the empire once again.&#10;&#10;Gods of Rome is a competitive area-control game that uses worker placement and card activation and lasts around 60 minutes. Players each choose a tribe at the start of the game and must lead that tribe to gain the gods' favor. On your turn, choose one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Visit a God: Gain a god's blessing token, which allows you to take an enhanced action later in the game, and place one meeple in that god's color &mdash; which might also be a player's color &mdash; on the game board in a matching-colored location.&#10;     Activate a card: Place a token on an action space on your player board to add more figures to the board, move figures, and attack opponents. If you have a blessing token of the same color as the location where the action takes place, you can take an enhanced action.&#10;     Score: Advance on the victory track depending on which territories you control in regions that match the gods you have visited, then clear all action spaces and remove your tokens from the god spaces. Special objectives change the scoring of territories from game to game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The favor track features three checkpoints, and as players gain favor, they advance on this track; if a player hits a checkpoint, all players score points based on their relative position on the favor track, then they advance to the checkpoint. After a player reaches the third checkpoint, players again score points, then whoever has the highest overall score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You'll play two rounds of the game, and after each one, every player will accumulate points based on how guilty they look and add it to their running total. At the end of the second round, a winner and a loser will be decided. The game centers on the three factual categories of the game:&#10;&#10;When: The time of the theft&#10;Where: The location of the crime&#10;Who: A partial description of the thief&#10;&#10;Because no one has bothered to ask Ed about the details of the crime, police have nothing but wild rumor and rampant speculation to go on. You'll be able to change the alleged facts of the case and alter the focus of the investigation in each of these three crime categories.&#10;&#10;At the same time you'll plant evidence on other players. If a round ends while the case facts match up with the evidence planted on you, the police will grow suspicious. Too much incriminating evidence after each round will land you in the big house for the theft of Ed's pants.&#10;&#10;In a 4-player game, players sitting across from each other are on the same team and you will win or lose together as accomplices.

It is recorded only from the early 18th century, though greater antiquity is suggested by its trumplessness. The name of the game, literally &quot;three Seven&quot; may refer to seven sets of three or four point possibilities when a minimum of three each (three, two, ace or all of those together in a matching suit are dealt), or to the fact that it is played up to twenty-one. There are many variants depending on the region of Italy the game is played in.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from ATO website):&#10;&#10;Two years after the last US troops left Vietnam, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) General Van Tien Dung launched Operation 275, a &quot;limited&quot; offensive designed to set up an attack on the provincial capital of Pleiko. Rapid collapse of South Vietnamese (ARVN) forces caused a change in plan, with PAVN forces quickly taking one city after another, pausing only before an attack on Saigon itself. Based on previous performance, when three full PAVN divisions, supported by tanks and ample artillery, attacked one depleted ARVN division at Xu&acirc;n L&#225;&#187;&#153;c, Dung expected a cake walk. What he got was a Meatgrinder instead.&#10;&#10;For two bloody weeks, a division regarded as &quot;unreliable&quot; held back everything the PAVN could throw against them, inflicting heavy losses. No one, on either side, expected such heavy fighting. And hardly anyone thought that this would actually be &quot;the last battle&quot; of a 30 year conflict. It was.&#10;&#10;Now, Against the Odds lets you refight this key moment in history, with Meatgrinder: Battle for  Xu&acirc;n L&#225;&#187;&#153;c, 1975. The design uses a variable initiative system that keeps both sides uncertain, and features all the weapon systems that made this battle, and this period, so distinctive. The ARVN player employs cluster bombs, daisy cutters, M-48 tanks, and helicopters against seemingly overwhelming numbers of PAVN troops, artillery, and T-54 tanks. Leadership, close assaults, and airborne operations are also included...all the tools for attack and defense that made this a classic confrontation.&#10;&#10;Meatgrinder and issue #33 of ATO:&#10;Map - One full color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet&#10;Counters - 280 full color 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces&#10;Rules length - 10 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire suitability - Average&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a trick-taking playing card game played using 22 cards.&#10;The game is similar in mechanism to Oh Hell, but simpler to grasp because there is no suit.&#10;It is usually played using a tarot deck, keeping only the 21 trumps and the fool.&#10;If a tarot deck is not available, then it can be played using two suits (one suit for values 1 to 10, the other one for values 11 to 21) and the fool.&#10;&#10;Summary of the rules:&#10;&#10;If played in partnerships, partners sit across the table from each other.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with 14 points. The game ends when one player reaches 0. The player scoring the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The dealer deals the cards so that the lowest number of cards remains undealt: for example with four players, five cards are dealt to each player and two cards are put aside.&#10;&#10;The player to his left announces how many tricks he thinks he will win, then the player on his left, etc... This is the contract. The dealer is the last to announce, but the sum of announced tricks must not equal the number of cards dealt to each player.&#10;&#10;Let us follow the same example, where 5 cards were dealt to each player: player A announces 2 tricks, players B and C each announce 1 trick. Then the dealer cannot announce 1 trick because the total would be 5 tricks and each player could fulfill his contract. The player to the left of the dealer starts. The winner of a trick is the one who will start the next trick. The owner of the fool must assign its value (0 or 22) when he plays it.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player counts the number of tricks he has won and compare it to the number of tricks he has announced. No point is awarded for fulfilling the contract, but 1 point is deducted for each missed trick, either over or under the number of tricks the player initially announced.&#10;&#10;The next round takes place in the same way, but with one less card per player.&#10;&#10;After several rounds where one less card is dealt in each round, there is a round where each player only receives one card. Each player then places the card on its forehead without looking at it, so that all players except him can see the card. Each player then announces if he will win the trick or not. As was the case in previous rounds, the sum of announced tricks cannot equal the number of cards dealt to each player (i.e. one).&#10;&#10;After this round, in each round the number of cards dealt to each player is increased by one, until the number of cards is the same as in the first round.&#10;If we follow the same example as above (with 4 players), here are the numbers of cards dealt to each player in each round: 5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-4-3...&#10;&#10;",

Players are dealt cards to help them both in moving their rocket or plane and in scrolling the game board. In the travel version each time a player's plane sits on an airport space at the end of any player's turn, they get an Airport card. Similarly, if a player's plane ends any turn on a hazard, they draw a Hazard card.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the most points in hand when the board reaches the &quot;GAME OVER&quot; position. Airport cards add to your point total; Hazards subtract from it.&#10;&#10;While the rolling board, card drafting mechanism and even game play are the same, the British (Waddingtons) and American (Parker) games look very different.

By doing so, their team may receive certain benefits, but may also find itself limited at a crucial time. With the variety offered by the characters, factions and scenarios, no two games of Black Ops should ever be the same!&#10;&#10;Although the standard Black Ops setting is an ultra-modern world just a hair removed from our own, the rules are versatile and adaptable enough to suit OSS operations behind Nazi lines, Cold War-era infiltration missions in Moscow or Berlin, or sabotage runs against a rival corporation&rsquo;s interests in a cyberpunk dystopia, and the rulebook will include a guide to running games in such settings.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Not to be confused with a later, totally different game of the same name, Quandary, as published by Spears, is a two-player abstract traversal race game. Following an initially random placement of their four pawns (using cards), each player moves one pawn in turn one space forward (either orthogonally or diagonally) if and only if the space to which the pawn is moving is of the same color as the space in front of at least one of the opposing pawns. The first player to get one pawn to the far end of the board wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Medieval knights clashed to prove their bravery, courage and to impress rich and (sometimes) beautiful women. The Middle Ages are a relict of the past, but men are still men afterall and they still want to prove their superiority. So, what is the most reliable and effective way to distinguish a nobleman from a peasant? Oh yes! Duel! Instead of wearing full plate armor they wear equally charming elegant suits. Instead of fighting on the tournament arena, they meet in the underground of secret club called The Suits. Join this elite society and fight for your prestige and ...........*&#10;&#10;*) Enter your deepest and darkest desire that you want to fight for (or die for,  but it wasn't in the agreement)&#10;&#10;And remember that the first and last rule of The Suits Club is - you do not talk about The Suits Club.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one of five available characters. Each character has his own unique deck of cards. By using your wits, tactics, strategies and of course, a little bit of luck you can show your enemies who is the real gentleman. The Suits is a fast-paced, two-person card game steaming with atmosphere and tactical depth.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to contribute as much as possible to building a city. Along the way, you'll discover new species, build domes and solar panels and face sabotage, tornadoes and repeated power outages.&#10;&#10;In Exoplanet, players try to score victory points by exploring the planet with their team and delivering metal tokens to the city tile. This requires energy, which you can get from energy bricks or generate with solar panels. Humans can reproduce by building domes that they can live in. Drawing action cards can provide additional benefits and allow you to stay ahead of the competition. You can also use them to discover new species, which give you extra victory points. Each building gives you more victory points. Once all available spaces on the city tile are occupied, the game ends immediately. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In your turn, you have access to 5 action points, which you can use in different ways. For example, you can move your scouts, who may discover new terrain or pick up building materials. You can also choose to research the value of metal tokens or draw action cards. After spending your action points, you may build if you meet its conditions. Finally, you collect energy with scouts at solar panels. That energy is needed to deliver metal tokens to the central tile, with which you can eventually earn the most points and win the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the Kingdom of Faltisia, a land blessed with a stable economy and with natural, rich countries that are crowded with many people. You are a girl born in such a kingdom. Your only dream is to become a full-fledged maid.&#10;&#10;However, due to the importance of the maid occupation (it being essential to national security), only the most elite are allowed to graduate to professional status. Fortunately, you passed the entrance exams for the prestigious school &quot;Royal Faltisia Academy&quot;. You have three years to polish yourself, so how will you spend your school life?&#10;&#10;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#231;&#148;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#232;&#170;&#158;: The Story of Faltisia is an ambitious multimedia project by LAUGH SKETCH Inc, consisting of part web-novel, and part board game. (&quot;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#231;&#148;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#232;&#170;&#158;&quot; translates to &quot;Country Maid Story&quot;.) The board game is played out over three years during which players study at the esteemed Royal Academy of Faltisia. Here they improve their strength, wisdom, beauty, and purity, and hopefully graduate as a Professional Maid. At the conclusion of the game, the player with the highest VP wins.&#10;&#10;Players must choose what they will do each year by drafting action cards, then must choose between attending class to improve their abilities, or skipping class to instead choose from a number of extra-curricular activities.&#10;&#10;One of the core elements of the game is to apply for a Provisional Maid License, which is issued to the Academy from the Royal Maid Association. Without such a licence, you cannot typically work as a professional maid. In addition, each character has a unique ability that can be activated after receiving this provisional license; it is recommended you play the first game with the intention of acquiring this license.&#10;&#10;It's also important to take advantage of the items available in the school store. Let's become an excellent maid in three years!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Corporate wars, shadow ops, cranial jacks, cyber-augmentations&hellip; you&rsquo;ve been here before. You know how this goes.&#10;&#10;But familiarity breeds sloppiness and sloppiness will get you dead with a capital &lsquo;P&rsquo; for Permanent. So you&rsquo;ve got no excuses. You have a team, you have a boss, and that boss just gave you a job.&#10;&#10;Take whatever you need: weapons, micro-drones, dark-ware, pharma-derms, stealth gear... Just get it done. Because the particulars may change but the bottom line is the same: bring the package back or don&rsquo;t come back at all. Welcome to New Kowloon, 2069. Now get to work.&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Exploit Zero - Cyberpunk Espionage and Mayhem.&#10;&#10;A table top war game set during the Corporate Wars of 2069 in the mega-city of New Kowloon.  Miniatures agnostic.&#10;&#10;1 - 6 Players, Co-op or Solo Mode. Made for 15mm - 28mm miniatures.&#10;&#10;Grab your friends, create a team of elite Agents, and select a mission. It's time to run-n-gun.&#10;&#10;Exploit Zero uses four types of polyhedral dice: D4, D6, D8, and D10. The D4 Die is used exclusively for H-SEC spawning at the game&rsquo;s Arrival Locations. The D6, D8 and D10 are used in game to determine the success of a model&rsquo;s actions. For Agents, these three dice constitute their Dice Pool. These dice are used over the course of the Agent&rsquo;s activation to attempt Actions and the Dice Pool is renewed every turn. The die types can be used in any order the player desires, however each type can only be used once.&#10;&#10;THE DICE POOL, ACTIONS, AND DIMINISHING POSSIBILITIES&#10;Except for special circumstances, Agents are allowed Three (3) Actions per Phase. The Target Number to perform an Action successfully is a 4+. To act, simply declare the intended Action (Move, Shoot, Activate CAP, etc) select one of the die types in the Dice Pool and try for a 4+, accounting for modifiers and penalties. Every 4+ is a Success. Less is a Failure.&#10;&#10;To represent the stress and diminishing possibilities in a tense, frenetic combat situation, each Die Type can only be used once. One chance with a D10, one with a D8, and one with a D6. That&rsquo;s it. Although Specialization Protocols permit an Agent to roll two of a given die type in certain circumstances, the Die Type can only be used once per AGENT PHASE. In either case, once the Agent&rsquo;s Dice Pool is depleted, they can no longer act that Game Turn. This means Agents must prioritize their intended actions and allocate whichever Die Type they feel gives them the best chance at success. Die types do not have to be used in any particular order.&#10;&#10;TWO DICE BONUS&#10;Most action rolls are attempted with a single die type, however certain Agents stand a better chance at succeeding at certain Actions, ones linked to their Specialization Protocol. Depending on their SP, Agents can roll TWO dice of a particular type and choose the best result when attempting certain actions. This &lsquo;Two Dice&rsquo; bonus also applies to activating those specific Combat Augmentation Programs related to their area of expertise.&#10;&#10;All this really means is that while all Agents can attempt any Action or try to activate a CAP, a Razor is far more deadly in a Close Combat situation, and when it comes to hijacking the Cerberus security drone that just stomped into the room, you&rsquo;ll be thanking the Dark Net loa you&rsquo;ve got a decent Splicer at your side.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Thousands of Years Ago&#10;Conflict and strife between the six races resulted in years of war and suffering. One day, a strange cursed fog began to roll in from the north. The races fled south, and settled in what is today known as the Five Realms. Their ancient traditions and cities were lost to the miasma, and slowly forgotten by history.&#10;&#10;Modern Day&#10;A dwarven merchant ship sailing to Merchants Cove noticed that the poisonous miasma surrounding the land had been lifted. Word quickly made its way to Queen Tabitha who organized excursions to this new land. What they found shocked them; this was their ancestral homeland, and the six races used to live in peace. Peace and harmony had returned to the Five Realms, and thus the ancient curse had been lifted.&#10;&#10;In The Sixth Realm, players assume the role of explorers who&rsquo;ve sailed to this new (old) continent. With the backing of the crown and help from the guilds, players will compete to make a name for themselves in this strange new land.&#10;&#10;A game of The Sixth Realm takes place over three rounds.  Each round, the Stone Council will meet seven times, determining in which order each of the six guilds are going to activate. Players will then have the ability to take actions based on the selected guild. By exhausting their supplies of precious resources they will be able to take stronger actions, or even petition to take a different guild's actions.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, You will have opportunities to win the favor of the Stone Council and gain more permanent support from the guilds, allowing you to take powerful actions.&#10;&#10;As word of your deeds spread, your popularity will rise and you will attract new Envoys to aid you in your endeavors&mdash;enabling taking free actions that can lead to lots of exciting multi-stage combos.&#10;&#10;The Merchants Guild is all about resources. Gain new resources and refresh exhausted ones to keep your engine running smooth.&#10;&#10;The Builders Guild are trying to construct a permanent settlement, and need your help laying foundations and building homes.&#10;&#10;The Adventurers Guild are busy exploring ancient ruins, diving deeper into the dungeon for greater rewards, and precious artifacts from their ancestors.&#10;&#10;The Navigators Guild want to explore the entire continent, establishing outposts in forgotten cities, rebuilding bridges, and unearthing forgotten relics.&#10;&#10;The Scribes Guild are in charge of recording and scrubbing information on scrolls, which can be done with ink resources to take powerful free actions.&#10;&#10;The Historians Guild are in charge of translating scrolls and texts from an unearthed library containing a treasure trove of ancient traditions.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will earn the Queen&rsquo;s Favor, and use it to influence her royal challenges. These challenges will ask players to accomplish certain feats in this new land, and bestow royal favor upon those who rise to the challenge.&#10;&#10;The Sixth Realm is a heavy euro game stuffed to the brim with combos, bonuses, engine building, and interaction. The player-driven scoring and action-selection mechanisms mean that no two games play out the same. You must carefully balance long-term strategic planning, short-term  tactical adjustments, and the desires of your opponents to make a name for yourself as you return to the homeland of your ancient ancestors.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; is a multi-player combat game in which each of 2-4 players controls a segment of Tokyo under attack by the dreaded Godran, Self-Appointed Emperor of Monsters.  Players must protect their areas from the rampaging monster by deploying units of the national guard while at the same time evacuating tasty populace units.  As key production units in each sector are destroyed by Godran, the players&rsquo; resources dwindle.  Perhaps only a hastily-developed super weapon can save the day!&#10;&#10;Players have many options in &ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo.&rdquo;  Each turn, their remaining production centers generate a number of &ldquo;Mega-Yen&rdquo; to be spent in a variety of ways.  First, players bid &ldquo;Mega-Yen&rdquo; to control Godran.  Each turn, Godran could be controlled by a different player.  Victory point incentives will keep Godran rampaging - but if you win the bidding, Godran will rampage someplace other than your back yard!&#10;&#10;Mega-Yen can also be used to activate defense units, to evacuate panicked yet recalcitrant citizenry, and to develop super weapons to combat the mighty Godran.  Jury-rig a Death Ray and hope for a quick knockout punch, or undertake the longer and more expensive, but more sure-fire, process of researching Godran&rsquo;s origins to find his weakness. The Mega-Yen is an imaginary currency whose value, for the purposes of this game, is ridiculously high.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; plays essentially the same with two, three or four players.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; (Also known as ON,TGT!) contains a fold-out map that represents a hypothetical section of downtown Tokyo.  It could be any city, but Tokyo seems to be the most attractive to monsters.  Players are encouraged to substitute cities they particularly dislike if the urge strikes.  The game includes a set of counters representing Godran, destroyed buildings, the national guard in four colors and populace units in four colors.  Also included are a small selection of cards -  representing potential origin points for Godran and hair brained schemes to control the beast.  Relevant charts are included in the back of the rules for ease of access.  Play requires the use of multiple six sided dice to resolve combat and scrap paper for record keeping.&#10;&#10;",

The value of each set of tiles is based on the standard, idiosyncratic ranking of Chinese dominoes, an order that often does not correlate with the numerical value of the tile. Players unable to beat the high set during a trick must discard an equivalent amount of tiles face down. Points are awarded during the round, for special plays, and at the end, based on the number of tiles won by each player. Score multipliers may also apply, depending on the endgame conditions. Like Poker, it is typically played as a gambling game using chips.&#10;&#10;",

You must figure it out by yourself.&#10;&#10;2-player games of size beyond 8 are only recommended for experienced players and scores are often gigantic.&#10;&#10;OMEGA was initially designed for 2 players.

Prove your worth to the Queen by capturing all the Demons before they escape!&#10;&#10;The game is played in Turns which consist of two phases: Day time and Night time. Each Turn starts in the Day, where players may simultaneously perform a number of actions from the four available options. After all players have acted, Night begins. Every Night, Stone Demons come out of the Portal and move from tile to tile following the arrows. Players use Towers to snare Demons and the sunlight turns them back into stone. Stones are resources the players can spend during the next Day to upgrade Towers. After all Demons move, Day begins. Continue cycling through Day and Night until: players have captured all the Stone Demons from the Cave, any Demon walks off the map, or steps on the same Tile twice during the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player creates or adds to melds using Expedition cards in order to reach ten or more points. If ten or greater points is achieved that expedition would be considered to have found enough proof for science to take notice, thereby doubling that set's score. Also during each turn a single Anomaly card (action card) may be played which can do things like strengthen the value of an expedition in play, retrieve cards from the Tabloids, discredit other players expeditions or manipulate other facets of the game. At the end of a round, cards in the Tabloids that match expeditions in play discredit that expedition. The game also has a shut-out rule involving Extraterrestrials that, if achieved, prevents all other players from scoring that round.&#10;&#10;",

Your heart rate slows and your breathing steadies as you realize you are in a hospital. You glance around, finding your room empty. You read your identifying armband to see a name you don't recognize. As your bare feet smack to the cold tile floor and you steady your wobbling body, you feel the foreign presence of absence. You are alone&hellip;&#10;&#10;In Coma Ward, players are patients who have awoken in an abandoned, yet still functioning hospital with no memory and no idea of what is happening. Patients must search the hospital for clues and necessities. In their search, patients may find unspeakably terrifying things.&#10;&#10;Each time you play, you explore an ever-changing hospital as you search for the clues to your identity and the cause of the environment's unsettling emptiness. Balance your ever worsening terror and neurosis while monitoring your health and physical attributes. Remember to stay close to those who awoke with you because the shadows of the empty hospital can destroy your already fragile psyche. Once all the clues have been discovered, the true horror begins. Players discover what is actually happening and find out who they can trust &mdash; if anyone &mdash; and how to win.&#10;&#10;Each playing is a unique phenomenon that introduces diverse and dynamic rules. Coma Ward is a mature game with themes of violence, absolution, distrust, gore, and traumatic incidence. Player discretion is advised.&#10;&#10;Coma Ward plays in two parts: &#10;  The Prologue:&#10;&#10;Patients will move through the Hospital discovering new Tiles that represent rooms.

Other Tiles will impact the game in other unpredictable ways.&#10;&#10;While they explore and search, Patients will discover items that will help them in their frantic search for answers. Items like Clothing and makeshift Weapons will defend you from unseen forces or even other hostile Patients. While Medicine and Food can restore your Health and Focus. Ultimately, Patients are searching for the horrific Clues to what has happened in this hospital. Once all of the Clues have been revealed, the true game objective unfolds&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Phenomenon:&#10;&#10;Upon uncovering the final Clue, the Phenomenon is triggered.

    "Description": "In this cooperative game:&#10;1. Stack cards on a board while telling a short, crazy, funny, wacky story... all within 2 minutes!&#10;2. Together, take on the challenge of remembering the story in the correct sequence! &#10;And that&rsquo;s when the magic happens: Surprises and Laughter! Because, with the help of all players, having a good memory has never been easier!&#10;&#10;Each card correctly recalled in sequence earns the players 2 points. If a player seek assistance, the group still earns 1 point for each card, encouraging teamwork and collaboration. However, be cautious - an incorrect guess results in the group losing 1 point. Aim to continually improve your collective score from game to game, or to climb higher on the success ladder.&#10;&#10;The basic rules remain the same across different versions of Story Box.&#10;&#10;But each version offers a Themed Expert Variant:&#10;In Story Box Adventures, the Frenetic Adventure variant requires you to lay down 30 cards during the story phase to score the game. Can you play as fast as that? And can you remember the sequence of cards?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This card shows two colored racing cars. Each player tries to drive the two racing cars shown on their assignment card over the target line first. But watch out! The players are allowed to choose of the six cars so no one really knows which racing cars their opponents want to get to the target first. The aim of the game is to be the first to drive the two racing cars on one&rsquo;s assignment card up to the target.&#10;&#10;Like in Snail's Pace Race, you move cars according to the colour on the die. But in Gib Gummi, you roll three dice and choose one, than re-roll the other two, choose one again and finally re-roll one die.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;The game ends as soon as both of a player&rsquo;s racing cars havereached the target. This player yells &ldquo;Hit the throttle&rdquo; and winsthe race. He then shows his assignment card to prove it.If various players fulfi l their assignment at the same time,they win together&#10;&#10;",

A GOBBLE occurs when a tile is played in a space surrounded by at least 3 tiles (and color paths match on all sides). Gobbles allow players to remove 1 tile from their penalty stack.&#10;&#10;It is a family game which is more about speed than strategy. It suits fast rather than deep thinkers and is a fun introduction for younger players who find the tactics and restrictions of Tantrix Strategy a bit overwhelming. The optimum number of players will depend on how much chaos you can take - more than 4 players and elbows definitely become a factor!&#10;&#10;For 1 to 6 players, 56 tiles, Ages 5+, Average duration: 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players race against each other to add all their tiles to &quot;the Tantrix&quot;.&#10;     Players may only add tiles which touch at least two tiles already played.&#10;     Players are rewarded for filling gobbles! To fill a gobble, add a tile to the Tantrix which touches at least three other tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;Comes with a variety of rulesets for various styles of play.

    "Description": "This was supposed to be a tranquil cruise across the Atlantic on board the ship MS Batory. The promise of an unforgettable trip from Gdynia to New York attracted onto the ship's deck the most prominent personas, who wished to take part in the adventure of their lives.  No one suspected that the scenes taken straight from the bestselling crime novels will soon unfold aboard the legendary transatlantic ship. Audacious theft of the countess Pawlicka's priceless jewels has shaken both the passengers and  crew members alike. However the most shocking fact is undeniable truth that the thief is hidden among them...&#10;&#10;MS Batory is a deduction game, which in innovatory way makes use of three-dimensional game board. The players take a role of detectives, and their task will be to identify the thief as quickly as possible. Each character from among thirteen suspects has a set of unique features - gender, age and a role. The players will ask each other questions, based on which they'll be able to determine the innocence of the suspects. At the beginning of the game, one of the cards which represents characters will be randomly selected and put aside - this character is a thief.  The rest of the remaining cards will be distributed among the detectives.&#10;&#10;The player's round consists of the two phases:&#10;&#10;1. Movement Phase&#10;&#10;The players move characters around the deck of MS Batory. They have at their disposal a three-dimensional ship, which consists of  several dozen rooms, located on the three separate decks. During this phase, the Players will move characters and perform different tasks - like for example: &quot;Meet up with the member of the crew&quot; or &quot;Go to the observation deck&quot;. By performing those actions they will gain question cards, which are used later during investigation phase. Characters need to be moved around the ship so that current task is completed as many times as possible. All the while it has to be remembered, that arrangement created by character's placement can hinder or help when it is time for asking questions in investigation phase.&#10;&#10;2. Investigation Phase&#10;&#10;During movement phase, the players had gained question cards. Each of these cards contains one trait - age, gender, role, number, room or deck. Using these cards, the player will formulate a single question, which he will ask to another detective.  This question can be of any kind, but it has to be based upon the question cards at a player's disposal.&#10;&#10;For example, when in possession of  cards: &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;deck&quot; the player can ask another detective &quot;Are there any women among your characters which are currently on the observation deck?&quot; On the other hand, having a more varied set of cards like &quot;age&quot;, &quot;role&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;room&quot; allows for asking more detailed questions such as: &quot;How many of your middle aged crew members are currently in the cabin?&quot; Skillfully asked question allows the detective to eliminate further characters from his list of suspects, without giving away too many clues to the rest of the players.&#10;&#10;The winner is the detective who first identifies the thief!&#10;&#10;",

Or will the Workers triumph over the power of money to make society more equal and just?&#10;&#10;In Class War, players draw cards from their decks and deploy them in society using the money they earn in the economy. The cards you&rsquo;ve played will be used to mobilize dice (representing your social power) against your opponent &mdash; in the economy, to win a greater slice of the economic pie, or in the state, to elect figures who support your political agenda. Ultimately, both classes aim to make their demands into law, permanently changing the rules of the game in their favor.&#10;&#10;",
