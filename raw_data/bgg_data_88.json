    "Description": "THE CHARGE OF THE 3 KINGS 1212: BATTLE OF LAS NAVAS DE TOLOSA&#10;&#10;An epic clash between Christian and Muslim armies with a dynamic impulse-based game system that will delight even the most demanding strategists.&#10;&#10;In 1212, Alfonso VIII decided that it was time to take revenge for his defeat at Alarcos a few years earlier at the hands of the Almohads. They had come to the Peninsula from the Maghreb imposing their rule and strict religious norms on the Andalusians with plans to expand Islam into the Christian-held territories. At that time, the Peninsula was divided into fie Christian kingdoms: Castile, Leon, Aragon, Portugal, and Navarre. However, being bound by the same religion did not stop them from fighting amongst themselves, and by no means where they unified nor did they have the same interests. Alfonso VIII of Castile requested the bull of the crusade for his fight against the Almohads, which meant that if he could not get the other Christian kingdoms to participate, he could at least make sure he would not be attacked from behind as he advanced south. The Pope grants this endeavor the status of a crusade, which results in knights and kings from other kingdoms and places in Europe joining Alfonso&rsquo;s campaign, in addition to his neighbors on the Peninsula.&#10;&#10;Each player has 5 formations and a deck of tactical cards and a deck of strategic cards. During his turn, the player will receive tactical and strategic cards and will activate 3 of his formations, each in a different impulse and alternating with his opponent. In each impulse you can play a tactical card, even in the opponent's impulse if the card is a reaction card. Additionally, during any moment of the turn, the player can play a strategic card.&#10;&#10;&bull;    Recreate this epic battle in less than 3 hours.&#10;&bull;    The game cards allow players to alter the game rules in order to surprise their opponent and foil their plans.&#10;&bull;    Each side has at their disposal a wide variety of units with special abilities that affect the course of the battle, along with a unique deck of cards that will en-sure no two games are alike.&#10;&bull;    Thanks to the game&rsquo;s impulse-based system and the possibility to interrupt your opponent&rsquo;s turn, both players will have a great time as the battle unfolds. &#10;&bull;    The game&rsquo;s design and illustration has been meticulously crafted with the idea of immersing players in a medieval-themed experience. &#10;&bull;    Historical accuracy. Includes a scenario book that pro-vides a detailed summary of the battle, how it unfold-ed, the aftermath, as well as an example of play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from MMP website:)&#10;&#10;Karelia &rsquo;44 is an operational level game that focuses on the last major campaign of the Russo-Finnish Continuation War (25 June 42&mdash;4 Sept 44). STAVKA planned an offensive during the summer of 1944 to coincide with the Normandy landings. The objective was to force Finland out of the war. Towards this end, the Soviets amassed two ground armies, one air army, and an impressive amount of artillery. Confident after a series of victories against the Germans, the Red Army attacked in Karelia on 9 June 44. The attack began with an overwhelming artillery barrage (second only to the Oder crossings in intensity). Finnish lines were pushed back and then breached&mdash;the race for Viipuri/Vyborg was on. The capture of this city would open the road to Helsinki.&#10;&#10;The game features a unique &ldquo;Boss Point&rdquo; System which precludes either player from knowing how long the game will last. For the Russian player, this represents the gun to his head of an unhappy dictator who will gladly send you to a Gulag forever if you fail in your goals. For the Finns, you know that you are understrength and that the Russians will destroy you if given enough time, but you need to hang on for dear life in order to be in the best possible position when the Boss&rsquo; patience runs out.&#10;&#10;Players will find two very different armies to command. The Russians are the proverbial 500 lb gorilla, but one that takes time to prepare big operations and isn&rsquo;t fleet of foot enough to do small scale attacks.&#10;&#10;The Finns have splendid artillery and are designed for a mobile defense which, if done right, will leave the Russians flailing in the air. You have three defensive lines to use and an innovative &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; unit feature that allows your thin ranks to try to hang on to them.&#10;&#10;Please note, this is not the Winter War of 1939! This is a well developed late war Russian army, not the hapless troops of the opening years of the war. The Finns need to be on their toes to stand a chance.&#10;&#10;Karelia '44 is the 14th game in the award winning Standard Combat Series. Emphasizing easy to play rules, SCS lets the player get right into the game!&#10;&#10;Karelia &rsquo;44 Components: &#10;&#10;     SCS Series Rulebook&#10;     Karelia '44 Specific Rulebook&#10;     Two Full Color Play Aids&#10;     Full Color Game Map&#10;     280 Counters&#10;     3 Scenarios&#10;     Box and Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Will your pack live in legend as the ones who saved the world, or those who betrayed it?&#10;&#10;Is today a good day to die?&#10;&#10;Take control of a pack of Garou, savage werewolves, as they battle the forces of the Wyrm in defense of Mother Earth, Gaia.&#10;&#10;Call upon ancient spirit pacts, mystical abilities, and the tools of the modern world to destroy the forces of corruption that threaton to plunge the world into eternal darkness and decay.&#10;&#10;But not every Garou agrees how best to save Gaia. Is it best done through force? Through renewing the traditions and spirit pacts of old? Through mystical means? Or should the Garou just adapt to the new age and help Gaia change to fit into the new world?&#10;&#10;Or sell out and play a pack of Wyrm creatures hell bent on seeing that the Wyrm is the final victor in the coming Apocalypse.&#10;&#10;But not even the forces of the Wyrm can agree on their methods. Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish?&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player has two decks. One deck is his &quot;Sept&quot; hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.&#10;&#10;Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.&#10;&#10;Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:&#10;Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards&#10;Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt&#10;Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.&#10;Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions&#10;Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.&#10;Combat - resolve any fights.&#10;&#10;Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:&#10;1) Attack another Alpha&#10;2) Attack a victim&#10;3) Attack an enemy&#10;4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character&#10;5) Attack a territory&#10;6) Do nothing.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.&#10;&#10;Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Magic Number Eleven is an innovative sports game depicting the tactical confrontation of football games with simple rules. &#10;It's a 2 player game, and each player becomes a coach of a football team, confronting each other. The game consists of two Rounds; 1st half and 2nd half. Each round consists of several turns.&#10;&#10;In your turn, you basically place a Player Card on the Field Board. The meaning of Player Card placement is an expression of where the team is currently focused on and which player is the center of the tactics. &#10;Each Player Card has semicircular tactical icons which can be combined with the icons on other Player Cards. Therefore, each team will have more tactical icons according to the combination of the Player Cards, as the turns go on.&#10;&#10;There are 4 different type of tactical icons- Attack, Defence, Pass, and Press- and the action and the effect you may take in your turn vary according to the type and amount of the icons you have been made.&#10;Based on the tactical icons you have, you may 1) attempt a shot, 2) draw Synergy Cards, and 3) push the Control Maker on the Control Track.&#10;&#10;When you attempt a shot, compare your attack power and the opponent's defence power. Both of attack/defence power can be strengthened with the Synergy Cards that each player has. The Synergy Cards represent the teamwork and the passing play of the team. And if your Control is high enough, you may add more Synergy Cards to the attack power. If the total of the attack power is higher than the defence power, as a result, it's a goal!&#10;&#10;In case you made the total attack power exactly 11, it called a Magic Number, or Wonder Goal, so the opponent can't defend the shot even with the higher defence power. On the other hand, if it exceeds 11, it's always no goal bacause the shot was too strong to be on target. Since there is always at least ONE unknown Synergy Card which has to be played from deck, so you can't guarantee the outcome of the shot!&#10;&#10;A round ends when all the Synergy Cards run out. When the 2nd round ends, a team with higher score wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Grasshopper &amp; the Ant is the fourth title in Purple Brain Games' &quot;Tales &amp; Games&quot; series, each of which comes packaged in a book-shaped box. In this game, players take turns playing the part of the industrious ants and the grasshopper content to sponge off the labor of the ants.&#10;&#10;The Grasshopper &amp; the Ant includes two ways to play, but the heart of both is the same. At the start of the game, lay out 16 (of the 48) path cards in a 4x4 grid; each path card shows one of four types of landscapes. The ant player places six ants on these cards, one ant per card, with the ants forming a chain (as in real life), then secretly chooses one type of terrain on which at least one ant stands. The grasshopper player then stands with one of the ants, and if the grasshopper chose the same landscape as the ant player, the grasshopper takes all the path cards of this type on which an ant stands; if the grasshopper chose incorrectly, then the ant player takes these path cards. Either way, you then refill the 4x4 grid. The ant player keeps playing until she finally wins path cards, then the next player in clockwise order controls the ants. (In winter mode, the third and fourth players control red ants and receive a random path card if they match the choice of the ant player.)&#10;&#10;In autumn mode, players score path cards immediately, with each type being tracked independently; path cards that feature insects are saved for a endgame bonus. As soon as a player maxes out two scoring tracks, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In winter mode, players keep the path cards they collect in order to buy provision cards (worth one victory point), which cost particular combinations of path types. In this mode, when you win a path card that features an insect, you can claim another card in the grid that features the same insect. Collect both provision cards of the same type, and you score a bonus VP. The first player to collect 4 VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

You've walked its stalwart streets, tasted of its determined harvests, and have in turn sworn your life to its defense. Death does not frighten you near so much as the thought of Farrenroc falling to Darkness.&#10;&#10;And now, here you stand&mdash;at the gates of the last city, facing the uncertain lands beyond. As the distant drumming heralds the encroaching Darkness, you steel your weapons and ready your courage for a final defense of your ancestral home. The dark frontier awaits...&#10;&#10;Fight back the oppressive forces of Darkness in Myth: Dark Frontier, a fully cooperative board game for 2-4 players. Take on the role of an iconic Myth hero in a desperate fight to protect the city of Farrenroc from the legions of Darkness that seek to despoil its holy walls.&#10;&#10;Heroes will have to travel, fight, and quest in defense of their city, while also establishing strongholds throughout the surrounding lands to provide crucial resources to Farrenroc. Each hero is equipped with a unique deck of action cards, providing unique ways to perform the standard actions...as long as Fate is on their side.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the forces of Darkness spread across the land, methodically crippling Farrenroc's influence in hopes of eventually laying siege to this last standing beacon of Light. Each game of Dark Frontier pits the heroes against a sinle army, contributing its own unique minions, captains, boss, and treacheries. Heroes must contend with these threats while also mustering the support of the land to unite against a mutual foe.&#10;&#10;Dark Frontier combines high adventure with resource management, programmed action selection, and epic conquest to create a unique gaming experience to further enrich the world of Myth.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of iconic heroes from the world of Myth, aiding the besieged city of Farrenroc in its never-ending quest to push back the Darkness. Each hero has a small deck of five actions: Travel, Battle, Encounter, Fortify, and Quest. Three of the five are selected and placed in one of three time slots (morning, day, and night). These selections are made for all heroes and the enemy at the same time, then shuffled. Each time phase is played out by drawing and executing the action, be it a hero or an enemy. Oftentimes the timing of these actions is important to accomplish a quest or encounter, or to push back invading forces. Players will need to discuss their planned actions with each other and play them in the appropriate time slots. All the while, the enemy is moving to destroy Farrenroc by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;",

The game is said to have taught the emperor and his court to temper their influence and power with caution.&#10;&#10;The goal is to be the first player to push seven points worth of your opponent&rsquo;s game pieces off the board. Each player begins the game with eight game pieces shaped to look like one-, two- and three-story Japanese buildings. The number of stories a piece has equals the number of spaces it can move, the maximum number of other pieces it can push and the number of points it is worth if pushed off the board. Pieces move side to side and forward and backward.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;Game board.&#10;Eight oxblood (red) pieces.&#10;Eight ivory (white) pieces.&#10;Complete rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Micro Architects is a 1-4 player, city building game which takes 30-60 minutes to play. As a city architect your role is to plan the layout of your city, build landmarks, provide services, manage residents and deal with random events that affect your city.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 3 rounds with players scoring after each round. On your turn pick a building from the ones set up at the beginning of a round and place it on your city board and try to create patterns based on goal cards. When picking a landmark, take a landmark tile to go with it and try to fulfill its requirements. After filling up a whole district with buildings, gain a boat. 2 boats let you acquire a service for your city which makes it more attractive to the residents. After a round is completed score points in 3 ways:&#10;&#10;GOALS - each pattern is worth a number of points&#10;LANDMARKS - each landmark has a unique requirement for where it needs to be placed and what other buildings should it be surrounded by&#10;SERVICES - each service provides points for a specific set of buildings in your city&#10;&#10;At any point of your turn you are able to use construction tokens to demolish buildings and build them again in a different spot, use buildings from an additional building pool or have more choice when choosing the right service for your city.&#10;&#10;RESIDENTS module&#10;&#10;More advanced players will definitely want to play with an extra module that comes in the box - RESIDENTS.&#10;This module adds an additional board to each player's city board where you place residents that come to your city. Residents allow you to score additional points, reuse your construction tokens and gain extra boats which in turn let you acquire more services for your city.&#10;&#10;EVENT module&#10;&#10;Spice things up with the event deck! Pick a card and see whether you&rsquo;ll have to deal with an impending disaster or strike of good fortune. Disasters can ruin your plans if you don&rsquo;t prepare for them in time and positive events might give you that extra boost on your path to victory.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the scoring phase for round 3. The player with the most points is the winner and becomes the chief architect!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Missions are resolved by rolling combinations of custom dice. A diverse team of Shadow Runners gives you access to more combinations of dice, and your upgrades add even more dice to your pool. Take on smaller missions to earn creds. Then, put those right back into more experienced runners, and better gear. Once you think you've got what it takes, send your runners out to attempt to collect one final score. If you fail, don't worry, your doc-wagon contracts will keep your runners in the game. The first player to successfully complete the final mission, and collect that last big score wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Choose your star dice carefully, foresee your opponents' moves. and take risks at the right moment in order to claim victory.&#10;&#10;Over the seven rounds of the game, you form your constellation one die at a time, building off either or both of the &quot;starting stars&quot; on the player board. To set up, roll the six colors of d8 dice, then place them on the central game board. Place the d4, d6, d10, and d12 dice in each of the six colors to the side. On a turn, choose either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    One of the d8 dice without changing the value on it&#10;    Any three dice not previously claimed (with d8 dice being an option), then roll those three dice and choose one of them, returning the other dice to the central game board or the side as appropriate.&#10;&#10;&#10;Place your chosen die in your constellation, either as a star branching off one of your starting stars or as a star branching off a previously placed star. Each starting star and each placed star may have at most two branches off of it, and each placed star must have a lower value than the star from which it's branching off.&#10;&#10;If a newly placed star has more sides than the star it's branching off of, you immediately score 2 points. Otherwise, you score points only at game's end, with your dice scoing points based on their color. For example, with yellow you score 1, 3 or 6 points for having one, two, or at least three yellow dice. Blue dice are worth only 1 point each, unless two blue dice branch off one star, in which case the pair is worth 4 points. Black dice score based on their sum off each starting star, and red dice based on how many even or odd non-red dice are on the same line. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play Twinkle with mission cards that reward the player with the lowest total sum, the fewest types of dice, the fewest colors, and so on, with 1-3 of these mission cards in play as desired.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1918: Brother Against Brother is a two-player wargame of the Civil war in Finland during early 1918. One player takes the role of the Whites (i.e. the government troops) and other the Reds (socialist revolutionaries).  In that bloody struggle future of the nation that has just declared its` independence is decided, and whether General C.G.E. Mannerheim of White forces or Comrade Kullervo Manner emerges triumphant is up to the players.&#10;&#10;Map is point-to-point representation of the Finland from 1918 featuring both railways and roads of the time, both of which also effect the gameplay. Game is card-driven and more than 50 action cards (each with unique picture of the era) are at the heart of the game. Cards can be used either as action points or events. Events include German intervention, Swedish occupation of &Aring;land islands, grain trains from Soviet Russia as well as drunk Red commander&hellip;&#10;&#10;Units represent mainly company/battalion level and include both Civil Guards and Red Guards, as well as special units; armoured trains for Reds and Jaeger units and German intervention forces for Whites. Reds can either try to occupy the White capital of Vaasa (preferably before Germans appear) or to defend their area until the end of the game. Balancing with actions and events is crucial for both parties.&#10;&#10;Game is fully bi-lingual (English and Finnish) including two decks of action cards. So if you wish to familiarize yourself to wargaming lingo in Finnish this is a perfect opportunity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You manage one of these sectors of the company, trying to create an efficient assembly line; manage your team of operators, engineers, and scientists; and help expand the company to several locations all over Europe. As the company becomes more and more successful, you try to achieve certain milestones before other departments may do so because as much as you like to see the whole company perform well, you would like to get that extra bit of credit compared to your peers.&#10;&#10;Algae, Inc. is a medium-heavy strategy game that combines resource management, tableau building, and multi-processing. Each player has a unique player board and must adapt their strategy to the department they've chosen to manage. As the game progresses, you have to hire more staff, optimize your processing line, and keep a close eye on what your colleagues are doing. You also have to make crucial decisions as you decide to free up space on your science board by either unlocking engineer tiles (that will improve your factory) or science tiles (that will allow you to improve your actions). It's a meticulous game that reveals its true depth the more you play it as every decision you make will affect the next one.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tiny Epic Cthulhu is a 45-minute, 1-4 player cooperative game that will immerse players in a world of spinning madness! Players take the roles of unique characters residing in a cold, forgotten island town off the coast of 1920s New Arkhamoore. However, all is not well in this seemingly peaceful town. Cosmic horrors are emerging from the dense sea fog, plunging the once sleepy town into a state of chaos.&#10;&#10;As players navigate through the game, they must work together to translate the Necronomicon, unveil the Great Old One, and seal the portals to banish the impending horror back into the cosmic realm. To achieve this, players must tap into the madness that surrounds the town, using it to translate pages, battle against shamblers, and prevent locations from succumbing to pure horror. The cusp of madness gives players benefits like more movement, stronger attacks, and cosmic intellect. However, they must be cautious not to push their own minds too far, as the line between sanity and madness is a delicate one.In this game, madness is a valuable resource that can be used to translate pages and enhance player abilities, but excessive madness can lead to defeat. The pressure to save the town is felt from the very first spin!&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Cthulhu offers a tense and engaging gameplay experience, featuring innovative bag-building and push your luck mechanics. It includes a surprising component - a spinner! - which perfectly captures the essence of Lovecraftian madness and chaos, while still maintaining the strategic elements that players have come to expect from the Tiny Epic series. Each player will need to utilize their special powers, make use of the unique actions available in the town, and carefully manage their own madness. With its compact box and easy-to-understand rules, Tiny Epic Cthulhu offers meaningful decisions and layered strategies that will captivate players. It is a thrilling addition to the Tiny Epic series, providing an exciting and immersive gaming experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Field of Glory is a set of historical miniatures rules for ancient and medieval tabletop battles.&#10;&#10;From the designers:&#10;&#10;In Field of Glory you will take command of an army which consists of approximately 10-15 battle groups led by the C-in-C and his senior commanders. The game has been designed to ensure that, just as in reality, the commanders (you) are fully occupied with decision making from the outset. Your key objective is to outmanoeuvre the enemy army and concentrate your forces at critical points in the battle. This will then destroy the enemy's will to fight, deal a devastating blow to the morale of their commanders (your opponent) and allow you to win.&#10;&#10;Our companion army list books will contain historical overviews and the organisation of hundreds of accurately researched armies, ensuring that your battles will be able to have a realistic and historical feel.&#10;&#10;Also, in reality, some armies would be relatively small, consisting of as few as 5,000 men, whilst others would be enormous. Field of Glory will allow you to see what might have been had these forces been equally matched, using a points system, as each army can then be scaled up or down whilst retaining an individual mix and balance of troops to create &ldquo;what if&rdquo; encounters.&#10;&#10;We started with a blank sheet of paper and looked at a wide range of possible mechanisms. Some concepts are entirely new. Others may look familiar at first glance, but interact with the rest of the rules in a completely new way, giving Field of Glory a style all its own.&#10;&#10;In Field of Glory our most important objective is to make the game fun to play whilst retaining a strong historical feel. So whether you fancy being Alexander the Great or Ghengis Khan, it's up to you, happy gaming and may your dice roll high!&#10;&#10;",

During the battle, a bribe may be paid to the opponent to try to reverse the outcome.&#10;&#10;Players must be vigilant in positioning their forces (with the constraint of a maximum of one unit per province), keep an eye on their opponents, and take advantage of their two asymmetrical powers: that of their kingdom and that of their king.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dragon Master is designed by Reiner Knizia and originally published and released in Korea. Your aim is to create vertical lines that score lots of points. As you sit on neighboring (rather than opposite) sides of the playing area, your horizontal lines appear as vertical lines for your opponent, and vice versa. The game ends when both of you have played all your 8 cards into the playing area. The 4x4 grid is now complete. Count each of your 4 vertical lines individually and compare the weakest column from both players to determine the winner. Whoever has the higher score in this line wins. In case of a tie, compare all vertical lines. If all lines awarded the same number of points, the game ends in a draw.&#10;&#10;Based on the early Reiner Knizia games Sono and Prisma, and then reworked as Robot Master&#10;&#10;Note: the rules in the Victory Point Games promo edition are slightly different:&#10;&#10;1) There are only 20 dragon cards in the deck. Players are each dealt 8 cards; the remaining 4 are discarded without the players knowing their values.&#10;2) The grid size is 4x4.&#10;3) Each column is worth the sum of its values. A pair of cards in the same column counts as 10x the value (e.g., 2 &quot;2&quot; cards in a row would be worth 20 points). Three or more cards of the same value in a column scores 100 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It was far too easy to progress into this dark dungeon, far too easy...but you progressed anyway, and when you reached its very last level, you had the bad idea to wake up the sorcerer &mdash; the big boss &mdash; and now the only way you can survive is to rush out the exit.&#10;&#10;Rush Out! is an asymmetric and hectic game for 3-5 players, with 2-4 heroes trying to escape while the sorcerer casts spells against them. Everybody plays simultaneously, with each &quot;team&quot; rolling and re-rolling dice (three per hero, and five for the sorcerer) in order to complete cards. Each player can place dice on only one card at a time, and each ordeal card on the heroes' side can be completed by at most two people. As soon as a card has all of its symbols covered, you carry out its effect (in the case of the sorcerer), then draw a new card. The first &quot;team&quot; to draw the final card of their deck wins.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into trainings first, followed by scenarios. Each time you progress in the rules, you are invited to play game before going further, so step by step, you learn the following rules (which often add new cards to decks):&#10;&#10;&#10;     When the sorcerer completes specific cards, they can remove one or all of the heroes' dice from a card they are trying to complete.&#10;     By completing dracology spells, the sorcerer can move a dragon pawn onto a card on the heroes' side of the board. Heroes cannot remove this card from play, but can play on and remove other cards; by using wilds on their dice, the heroes can push the dragon back. If the dragon moves all the way onto the heroes' deck, the sorcerer wins the game.&#10;     By completing specific spell cards, the sorcerer can forbid a hero from using a specific symbol, although this restriction can be cancelled by the hero under certain circumstances.&#10;     By completing cards, heroes can experience, and they can use this experience to make their wild symbols more effective. (For each hero, normally a rolled joker on a die is equal to a specific symbol, but this experience gives you options).&#10;     The sorcerer can damage heroes, requiring them to heal themselves &mdash; possibly with the help of their friends &mdash; before they can attempt to complete ordeal cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rush Out! includes a half-dozen scenarios beyond the training games, and each scenario is played as a best-of-three series of games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players. When you attack, if you're outside Tokyo, you hit whoever is in Tokyo; if you're in Tokyo, you hit everyone else! If someone's health drops to 0, they're out of the game. (You can't heal damage while in Tokyo, and the only way to leave town is to have someone attack you...which might put you at death's door.)&#10;&#10;When you gain energy, you store it in cubes, which you can use to purchase power cards, which have a permanent or temporary effect.&#10;&#10;",

Their outer layer is made with silica, giving them a glass-like quality.

As part of your induction into the Society, you will each create your own entry for today&rsquo;s Exhibition of Microscopic Mosaics.&#10;&#10;In Diatoms, you compete with your fellow players to collect and place diatom shapes into a mosaic form. You take turns placing tiles representing algae colonies. From that placement you earn diatoms of different colors and shapes. You then strategically place these diatoms on your personal board, taking care to consider how your arrangement will be scored at the end of the game. In the base scoring, you'll want to achieve matching colors, shape variety, and symmetry along your mosaic's central lines. Each time you play, you may also have a &quot;guest&quot; judge card that brings a unique scoring criteria to the game.&#10;&#10;Diatoms also includes a solo variant where you collect diatom tiles as in the main game while trying to create a mosaic that fulfills specific requirements from mosaic commission prompts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the designer:&#10;&#10;&quot;Nemesis: The spirit of divine retribution against those who succumb to hubris&quot;&#10;&#10;While Burma was the backwater of WW2, it contained several of the most colorful characters of the war. The background was such that...&#10;&#10;General Stilwell, who despised both British and Chinese (and the current American, except Marshall) leadership, wanted to fight the Japanese with Chinese troops, in Burma or in China. Roosevelt, while having no interest in rebuilding the British Empire, was at the same time incapable of seeing the Chinese Kuomintang regime as fascist as it really was. He often wanted to sack Stilwell for repeatedly reporting on Chinese incompetence and corruption.&#10;&#10;Chiang Kai-Shek was more interested in getting his hands on the valuable lend-lease supply the US was sending him through Stilwell, who he hated, than fighting the Japanese. He was not keen on putting Chinese troops under Stilwell's command in Burma since they might become well trained and then possibly turn on Chiang. But he accepted doing so if Stilwell used them for opening up a supply route to China once again.&#10;&#10;Churchill was not interested in Burma at all and wanted to focus on Singapore. Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander in India and Burma, wanted to attack into Burma, but through an amphibious assault further south instead. Wingate (some thought him to be certifiably insane) wanted to land special trained brigades in the middle of Burma and from there reconquer Southeast Asia.&#10;&#10;General Slim, who had to put up with his rude and querulous colleagues, Stilwell and Wingate; his flamboyant chief Mountbatten; the hopeless and incompetent Chiang Kai-Shek, just wanted to defeat the Japanese there in the north and from there retake the rest of Burma.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, in 1944, the Japanese, being outnumbered and with hardly any supply, said &quot;enough is enough&quot; and attacked. Why not? It worked in 1942. But this time Japanese hubris met Slim, the best British General of WW2, in the west; Stilwell's well trained and hard fighting Chinese troops in the North; Wingate's Chindit brigades in the middle amongst them; Chinese Yunnan soldiers who, after Chiang finally let them loose, took heavy casualties when investing the Japanese in the east. This time, after many ferocious battles, the Japanese met their Nemesis and were, in the end, utterly defeated.&#10;&#10;Nemesis features my &quot;Open Game Turn&quot; system. The Game Turn consists of only four phases: Assault (where a unit may move and &quot;overrun&quot;); Attack; Supply Check; Reinforcement. The phases are drawn as chits, so you will not know in what order they will appear, with the exception of the first chit in a Game Turn which is chosen from the first three drawn chits in the previous Game Turn. Both players have a set of four Phase Chits each and they take turns drawing them. The game mechanics are easy to master. The game play may not.&#10;&#10;The quality of the unit is the most important feature. Basically it affects four aspects: Not only will a high quality give an edge in combat, it also decides what kind of ZoC the unit is able to exert. The quality will decide how long a unit can be out of supply before attrition strikes, and how capable the unit is to make an operational move (a &quot;double move&quot;). Since ZoC is non-existent except when preventing enemy units conducting operational moves, it is very important which units you position and where you do so. Especially so, if you are uncertain of which phases there remain to be played.&#10;&#10;The game will also feature my &quot;Active Combat&quot; system. A combat result will have step losses and probably a retreat result. Step losses are straightforward. The retreat result though has to be enforced by the attacker. That is usually not a problem if it is done by a high quality unit. A unit with lesser quality may have to pay with step losses in order to do so. The defender then decides to retreat or resist. If it stays, then it takes step losses, depending on its quality. Before any attack, the Japanese player has the option to get an DRM in its favor (in attack or defense). But it comes with a price.&#10;&#10;Finally, there will be a two layer Victory Point system. There is a Satisfaction point track for each player. Some points can be actively acquired by you but are given once, usually those that will please your local commander. Some points can be actively acquired by the opponent and will be deducted every Game Turn from your track as long as the enemy controls them, usually those that displease your superiors. Then again, it is the same thing for your opponent. Those that you have received once are also the ones that are deducted each Game Turn from your opponent's track etc. In the end, as the commander, you will have to prioritize, depending on the current situation.&#10;&#10;Nemesis has a high replay value and if you love tense games when in action as well as games that allow you to ponder on possible &quot;perfect opening moves&quot;, then this is the game for you.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Titan is a network construction game set in the distant future, in which you play as employees of Stardrill, an interstellar mining corporation. Stardrill has acquired the mining rights to Saturn&rsquo;s largest moon &ndash; Titan - and is sending in a team to strip it of its resources.&#10;&#10;Your task is to fill the hold of your ship with as many units of valuable resources from Titan as possible, in order to earn the most Credits by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To help its teams with their task, Stardrill has supplied a number of Extraction Plants - buildings which can be placed anywhere on the map. These extraction plants will allow you to obtain different types of resources. As you&rsquo;re all employees of Stardrill, once placed these buildings can be accessed and used by any player!&#10;&#10;Place pipes branching out from your main base to create the extraction network that will bring resources into the hold of your cargo ship. Each time you integrate an extraction plant into your network by joining a section of pipe to it, it activates, gaining you a unit of the resource of the building&rsquo;s type.&#10;&#10;Once obtained, these resources will have to be managed carefully, as you only have a limited amount of space in your hold! When full, no more resources can be added without spending or jettisoning others first. &#10;Some resources have value during the game and can be spent to free up space in your hold, while others can only score points at the end of the game - so you&rsquo;ll need to keep an eye on the space you have, and time your activations carefully.&#10;&#10;There are 6 resources available on Titan: Deuterium, Hydrocarbons, Silicium, Titanium, Water, and Tholin.&#10;&#10;However, not all of these resources are desirable. Titan hosts large quantities of Tholin, an organic substance which could potentially cause you to lose Credits at the end of your mission. Picking some of it up is impossible to avoid as you dig deeper into the centre of Titan, but don&rsquo;t let it get out of control &ndash; as well as losing you Credits, if you take Tholins into your hold when it is already full, some of your precious cargo will be contaminated!&#10;&#10;Stardrill has also supplied you with a team of trusty drones that will lend you on claw on your mission. As well as transporting valuable resources and moving Tholins away from your network, Drones can dock to an Extraction Plant to increase its yield or make it less costly to upgrade. These handy machines can also use Titanium to destroy pipe sections, either in another players network, or even your own!&#10;&#10;Earn Credits during the game by placing and upgrading Extraction plants, completing Stardrill&rsquo;s special Objectives, and fulfilling Planetary Orders.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll score Credits depending on the contents of your hold! The more Deuterium you have, the better, as long as it hasn&rsquo;t been contaminated&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Employee with the most Credits at the end of the game becomes Stardrill Employee of the Month!&#10;&#10;",

At the end of each player's turn they will have to roll the dice in order to add another zombie to the board, which may eat unsuspecting hoomans or get into Central Bark.&#10;&#10;If too many hoomans are eaten or too many zombies get into Central Bark, the Feral Tracker will reach 10 - and we become wild dogs, forgetting our love of hoomanity.

    "Description": "James Ernest once again stakes out some uncharted game design territory with Diceland: Deep White Sea.  The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2&quot; per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from &quot;mere paper,&quot; the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.&#10;&#10;The basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by &quot;killing&quot; your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.&#10;&#10;Attacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been &quot;wounded&quot; so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.&#10;&#10;A basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;List of Diceland sets and armies&#10;&#10;",

The result is a more intense and nerve-wracking game that takes place over eight turns (from the end of March to mid-April), at least half of which are composed of three operational phases. Both players will face difficult challenges. The German player needs to re-create the historic breakthrough and has to put in every effort to reach Amiens. The Allied player has to resist succumbing to panic in the first turns in order to organize an effective defense, and then a counter-attack near the end of the game.&#10;&#10;While the basic rules in Somme 18 are identical to those in Marne 1918 (with the exception of the air rules, which have been completely revised), the advanced rules will be very different. The principal reason is the length of Operation Michael, about fifteen days, which does not give an opportunity for the campaign management rules of Marne 1918 to be used.&#10;&#10;So, all of the unit management tracks have disappeared and have been replaced by one table that manages the replacement and re-construction of units. Strategic movement has also been greatly simplified and adapted to the tempo of the game.&#10;&#10;Somme 1918 will of course be enriched by numerous specific rules, simulating the particularities of this battle.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Petain&rsquo;s Reticence: Simulates the French command&rsquo;s lack of urgency in supporting their British allies.&#10;     The arrival of French reinforcements without their artillery support, allowing a quicker deployment of troops coupled with a reduction in their value.&#10;     Inter-Allied Cooperation: This will be extremely reduced at the beginning of the campaign.&#10;     Evolution of the use of Stoss: The doctrine of using assault troops had been principally introduced by General von Hutier, in Russia and Italy. At the beginning of Operation Michael, the generals commanding the Second and Seventeenth armies used their Stosstruppen in frontal assaults, wasting these elite forces and provoking fury from Ludendorff. A rule thus simulates the evolution of this doctrine.&#10;     The Doullens Conference: At the height of the German offensive, while the French Army under Petain prepared to cut its ties with the British, Haig accepted that he be placed under the command of Foch, finally creating an inter-Allied command. This rule simulates this conference, tied to German conquests. It also plays a part in obtaining victory points. In fact, this rule is really the heart of the game and we think that players will be pleased with the proposed system that will bring together the different parameters of this game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull; Boxed game&#10;&bull; 1 A1 single-sided maps&#10;&bull; About 560 counters&#10;&bull; 24 pages rules booklet in english&#10;&bull; 2 player aids in english&#10;&bull; Introductory historical booklet with design notes&#10;&bull; 4 dice&#10;&#10;(from Nuts Publishing website)&#10;&#10;",

The Deluxe Edition of the game adds the White Lions and the Cyborgs.&#10;&#10;The Silver River was built to provide a rich 4X experience (Explore, Expand, Exploit &amp; Exterminate), with all its trappings in under 2 hours.&#10;&#10;Players will take the role of one alien civilization, and work to earn victory points through exploration, colonization, technology, civilization building, politics, war, and peace.&#10;&#10;Unique gameplay elements include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Simultaneous Production and Resource Allocation: Gain raw production equal to your civilization's population each turn, and then allocate it to your areas of choice during simultaneous Governing phases. Use your allocated resources to take actions.&#10;     True Exploration: Explore planet-less sectors for rewards. Uncover mini-quests that can be completed for bonus rewards.&#10;     Choose War, or Choose Peace: Players may enter any occupied sector without forcing war, players always have the option to attack, or not to attack, and may even agree to co-habitate planets together.&#10;     Fast Tech Upgrades and Ship Movement: Move fleets of ships, whose size is not visible until they arrive, not individual ships. Upgraded technology applies instantly to all ships/planets/etc. This provides real progression in less time, and  with less micromanagement.&#10;     Ally Against Common Enemies: The center of the map is Sagittarius A*, a place where massive space monsters can be hunted for great rewards, on your own, or with other players.&#10;     Choose Your Victory Conditions: Players will have the ability to choose their victory conditions before the game starts to ensure every player can play the strategies they love, and avoid those they dislike. (War, Explore, Cooperate, Negotiate, Technology, Civ Building, Politics, Production, etc)&#10;     Unique Domestic Investment mechanic that provides resources and VP to players who pass early in an age to focus on their domestic agenda.

The nation was divided, unable to operate an efficient economy. A national agency of bankers was established as a means to connect all of China. With a network of banking created, wealth began to accumulate, and the city of Pingyao became the financial heart of China.&#10;&#10;Pingyao: First Chinese Banks is an economic dice-as-workers placement game in which players assume the role of famous Jin merchants in the Qing Dynasty. During the blossoming age of banking, players expand from Pingyao to open agencies across China, offering remittance services to businessmen in order to earn profits. The goal of the game is to build up money over eight rounds and be the wealthiest player by game's end.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players must recruit reliable managers to oversee their agencies, which can grant powerful abilities. With cash in hand, players may deposit their earnings to gain interest or offer loans in exchange for government favors and fame. Pingyao: First Chinese Banks also includes a solo mode in which you are challenged by a series of quests.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#147;&#229;&#133;&#137;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#153;&#137;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#233;&#166;&#150;&#229;&#137;&#181;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#232;&#153;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#233;&#138;&#128;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#233;&#128;&#144;&#230;&#188;&#184;&#229;&#159;&#183;&#230;&#142;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#233;&#135;&#145;&#232;&#158;&#141;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#128;&#153;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#233;&#135;&#145;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#230;&#156;&#131;&#230;&#137;&#174;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#189;&#141;&#230;&#153;&#137;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#229;&#133;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#136;8&#229;&#128;&#139;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#182;&#147;&#231;&#135;&#159;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#183;&#177;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#232;&#153;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#180;&#190;&#233;&#129;&#163;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#183;&#177;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#142;&#140;&#230;&#171;&#131;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#232;&#153;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#148;&#190;&#230;&#172;&#190;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#129;&#154;&#229;&#140;&#175;&#229;&#133;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#159;&#185;&#233;&#164;&#138;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#148;&#128;&#232;&#129;&#178;&#230;&#156;&#155;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#229;&#174;&#152;&#229;&#186;&#156;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#174;&#147;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#183;&#177;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#232;&#153;&#159;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#233;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#230;&#157;&#159;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#229;&#138;&#159;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#149;&#134;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#230;&#149;&#184;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (Chinese)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mage Noir is a strategy card game. In this dueling, deck-building game, players become true Mages and fight each other with the power of the elements. The game is focused on crafting spells and is packed with fireballs, crashing waves, devastating tornadoes and powerful magical abilities, all held in the palm of your hand.&#10;&#10;In Mage Noir, you&rsquo;ll combine lesser spells to create stronger ones. The spell crafting system is simple, logical and very thematic. Will you cast your spells for immediate effects or risk saving them to combine into a game-winning combo? Mana is shared at the center of the table, every action you take will change this amount, and you&rsquo;ll get to claim some of it at the beginning of your turn. But the rest may end up with your opponent, so plan accordingly. The separation of Mana from your deck also means no more failing to draw what you need to cast your spells!&#10;&#10;In Mage Noir, both players start with 20 Health Points (HP) . You achieve victory if you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s total Health Points to zero . Additionally, if a player has to draw a card but does not have a deck to draw from, they lose the game .&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Age of Sigmar began with the thunderous arrival of the Stormcast Eternals, borne upon the heavenly storm of the God-King Sigmar Heldenhammer. They are great heroes, snatched up at the moment of death and magically reforged &ndash; these golden warriors are thrown into battle against all who would corrupt, decay, and destroy the Mortal Realms.&#10;&#10;While Sigmar and his pantheon of Order strive for prosperity in these dark times, the Great Necromancer Nagash marshals the forces of Death in a bid to claim every last soul for his own. Meanwhile, Kragnos leads the wild forces of Destruction in a savage rampage across the civilised world, all while the Chaos Gods prepare to conquer the last uncorrupted bastions in a world of conflict and upheaval. This is a new epoch, a time of mighty battles and unending war. This is the Age of Sigmar!&#10;&#10;The Age of Sigmar is an epic setting populated by myriad armies, powerful heroes, and magnificent monsters. It plays host to vast, realm-spanning wars between the forces of Order, Chaos, Death, and Destruction. In the Warhammer Age of Sigmar Core Book, you&rsquo;ll not only learn the rich history of this war-torn age, but you&rsquo;ll also find all the rules you need to evoke these epic stories on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;Realms of War&#10;&#10;The Core Book starts with Realms of War, an overview of the Warhammer hobby with concise how-to guides on collecting, building, and painting your miniatures, as well as the various ways you can use them to play games of Warhammer Age of Sigmar.&#10;&#10;War Unending&#10;&#10;Discover the history of the Mortal Realms in the first lore section of the book, containing a detailed, illustrated story-so-far, from the arrival of mankind's God-King to the savage Era of the Beast. This covers three major ages:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Age of Myth, Sigmar&rsquo;s journey through the cosmos, his meeting with the Great Drake Dracothion and his exploration of the eight Mortal Realms. It tells of his awakening of other gods, the building of civilisations, and the fractious alliances that were forged.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Age of Chaos, brought about by the machinations of the Chaos Gods and their command of the Realm of Chaos, spitting daemon legions forth and destroying the peace that once reigned.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Age of Sigmar, in which the God-King's champions fight back against his enemies in all their forms. From the vengeful Realmgate Wars that cast Chaos back from many Order strongholds, to the cataclysmic Necroquake brought about by Nagash, God of the Dead, to the dawn of the Era of Beasts as the ancient Earthquake God unleashes hordes of rampaging greenskins into the heartlands of civilisation.&#10;&#10;&#10;Delve into background information on each of the eight Mortal Realms &ndash; Azyr, Shyish, Ashqy, Chamon, Ghur, Ghyran, Hysh, and Ulgu &ndash; which details their links, descriptions of the native civilisations that have risen and fallen, key events that have taken place and notable geographical features; along with details of the Realm of Chaos, a nightmarish dimension home to the Chaos Gods and legions of terrifying hellspawn.&#10;&#10;Clashing Empires&#10;&#10;Learn about the armies and alliances that fight across the Mortal Realms, each featuring a showcase of beautifully painted Citadel miniatures, split into four sections according to their Grand Alliances. Beginning with the forces of Order, you'll glean insight into each of the factions that comprise the last bastion of civilisation in the eight realms (even if they don't always get along), before moving on to parley with their nemeses in the forces of Chaos. Meanwhile, Nagash's alliance of Death plots to claim every last soul in the land, while Grand Alliance Destruction indulges their baser instincts on a roaring rampage of carnage alongside their newfound deity, Kragnos.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;&#10;The first rules section of this book contains the core concepts you need to start fighting battles in the Age of Sigmar, taking you through deployment, the battle rounds, combat, magic, and more. The rules are laid out in a clear and concise format with additional commentary from the designers, making this the easiest rulebook to reference in Warhammer history.&#10;&#10;Once you've got the basics squared away, find out all about the three core ways to play the game and the battleplans you can undertake in each.&#10;&#10;Open Play&#10;Let your imagination run wild as open play caters for re-enacting every kind of narrative storyline or tactical challenge you can think of, without restrictions.&#10;&#10;     Includes the Open War Battleplan Generator, which provides pre-set Maps, Victory Conditions, Twists, and Ruses.&#10;     Combining different options allows over 1,200 different types of Open War scenarios to be played.&#10;&#10;&#10;Matched Play&#10;Designed to put both players on an equal footing, matched play offers players an even chance of victory based around points-based army construction rules and a competitive set of battleplans.&#10;&#10;     Includes additional special rules, including Stealing the Initiative, as well as rules for additional objectives scored on either a turn-by-turn or end-of-battle basis.&#10;     Features much broader and more detailed requirements and restrictions than other game types, including restrictions on endless spells, reinforced units, and understrength units.&#10;&#10;&#10;Narrative Play&#10;Send your army on a Path to Glory and watch them develop across games with an overhauled section on narrative gameplay rules. Earn renown, gain new abilities, and even expand your army's territory while free of limitations on how, when, and where you can play.&#10;&ndash; Includes rules and guidance on a 5-step process to starting a Path to Glory campaign, including: Choosing Factions and Realms, Starting Sizes and Territories, Orders of Battle, Core Enhancements, and picking Quests to embark upon.&#10;&ndash; Provides guidance on how to fight battles against opponents both participating and not participating in a Path to Glory Campaign.&#10;&#10;Conquest Unbound&#10;&#10;The final section helps represent the vast array of battlefields and endless war that the overlords of the Mortal Realms fight across, including bespoke rules for the various, more niche type of battlefields you may come to fight, on, across, over, or indeed, under.&#10;&#10;It includes three variant types of games for players to enjoy, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Siege Warfare &ndash; all too often across the Mortal Realms, warlords and conquerors look to displace inhabitants of a territory or city that they have decided should fall under their control, and often the culmination of such a campaign is a brutal, no-holds-barred siege.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Triumph and Treachery &ndash; sometimes duty calls for an all-out brawl between all of your enemies at once, and, when that happens, these rules can be used to represent battles that take place between three or more factions at the same time &ndash; all are frantically fighting to win the day against all other opponents, but will you be the one to come out on top?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tunnel Fighting &ndash; deadly, close-quarters combat is commonplace across the Mortal Realms as armies cluster into labyrinthine cave networks, perfidious skaven skitter through the city sewers, and mind-bending tunnels open up in the unpredictable domains of Chaos.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Core Book closes out with a handy, alphabetised rules index and a photocopiable Path to Glory roster, Order of Battle, and Army roster.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
