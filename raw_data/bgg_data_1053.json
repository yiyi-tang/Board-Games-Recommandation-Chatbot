    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;In late 1916, Woodrow Wilson attempted to bring an end to the First World War. He failed.&#10;&#10;In another reality, he succeeded. The great empires survived, yet the peace proved flawed and world-wide war returned in 1940. That war is the background of our Second Great War at Sea series.&#10;&#10;Tropic of Capricorn is a complete boxed game in the Second World War at Sea series, bringing our alternative-history Second Great War story arc to the shores of South America. Argentina, assisted by Chile and Britain, faces off against Brazil in a naval war in the South Atlantic.&#10;&#10;Tropic of Capricorn includes one 22x34-inch operational map, the same &ldquo;Rio de Janeiro&rdquo; map included in our old Cone of Fire game (which will soon go permanently out of print). It covers the most important politically- and economically-important stretches of the Argentine and Brazilian coastlines including Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro.&#10;&#10;Tropic of Capricorn also has 180 new silky-smooth and die-cut playing pieces: 100 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 80 standard-sized ones representing small warships and aircraft as well as task force and flight markers. These represent the fleets of Argentina, Brazil, Britain and Chile, though not exactly as they appeared in our reality.&#10;&#10;Each of these fleets has undergone the expansion and reconstruction allowed by strong economic growth and relative political stability - without a German economic collapse to fuel it, the Great Depression is no more than a world-wide recession. Political and especially economic ties have aligned the Latin powers with their European partners: Argentina with Italy, Chile with Britain, and Brazil with the Central Powers of Imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary.&#10;&#10;Tropic of Capricorn tells the story of the Second Great War in South American waters in our popular story-arc format: there are 24 scenarios, tied together with a narrative of the wider events they represent. The Second Great War setting was designed to maximize battleship action, and Tropic of Capricorn delivers.&#10;&#10;Tropic of Capricorn is one of the first two new games to includes the Second Edition rules for Second World War at Sea: they&rsquo;re even easier to play with, with more options plus full-color play aids.&#10;&#10;",

There are 22 different pentahexes (hence the name of the game).&#10;&#10;Stack-22 is a new addition to the Pile-Omino family (SEVEN, Pent-Up and Counterplays) by the same designer. All of them play the same, but Stack-22 can be considered a step up from Seven.&#10;&#10;Warning: this is not a game for the casual player. It is recommended that you at least master SEVEN, Pent-Up or Counterplays before playing Stack-22, as if you don&rsquo;t know the tactics it can feel a bit cold at the start during the first games. Its depth can be overwhelming (22 opening moves and more than 3000 second moves; the branching factor is crazy), but it rewards those who dare to explore.&#10;&#10;Summary of gameplay: Players alternate turns placing one of their tiles according to some simple rules, trying to get the most of their pieces on the topmost layers when the game ends.&#10;&#10;a) The tile must be aligned with the hex grid.&#10;&#10;b) The selected tile must be placed on the highest level on which it can be placed legally.&#10;&#10;c) The tile must be placed either on the table and adjacent to a piece already on the table, or atop at least 2 tiles, regardless of their colour.&#10;&#10;d) The tile must lie flat, with every hex directly supported, either by the table or by a lower tile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Can your Hero solve the ever shifting Maze of Minos? &#10;In ancient times, the legendary artificer, Daedalus, built an elaborate and confusing structure for King Minos of Crete. Daedalus had so cunningly designed the Maze that he barely escaped its ever shifting walls after building it, so he left a secret trail of stars to mark the way out.&#10;&#10;Every season, King Minos would imprison several Heroes within the Maze to be hunted by the Minotaurs and beasts within. With aid from the gods, your Hero will race through the Maze of Minos, avoiding the Minotaurs, to discover three stars of Victory to win.&#10;&#10;Maze of Minos is a turn based strategy board game with two phases of play: the maze construction phase and the maze escape phase. During maze construction each player will place tiles and walls, in turn, to challenge the other players during the escape phase. During the escape phase the players will utilize the abilities of the Gods through cards to navigate the maze, avoid Minotaurs and collect Victory Stars. The Game is won when a single player discovers three stars belonging to other players. The game is for two to six players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a miniature card game published as a promotional item in 1875 by Charles Gooch, an American manufacturer of &quot;Noiseless Spring Beds&quot;. The deck consists of 56 cards that measure just 2.25&quot; by 1.25&quot;. The cards are printed with black ink on plain cardboard, with one side showing the name of a country followed by four geographical features related to that country. The back side is an advertisement for the company's beds.&#10;&#10;To begin, players first form a pool of face-up cards equal to the number of players. There are then two rules variations: players either start with a hand of six, leaving a face-down draw deck, or the entire remaining deck is distributed at the outset.&#10;&#10;Starting from the dealer's left, a player may first pick up a card from the pool if it completes a &quot;trick&quot; of the four cards related to a country. He then may ask any other player for one of the cards (by name and then feature) from a nation in which he already holds at least one card. If available, the other player must hand over the card, and the asking player may continue. As soon as the asking player fails to win a card, he must add one card from his hand to the pool, and play passes to the left. (If playing with the draw deck, a player takes the top card into his hand before discarding to the pool.)&#10;&#10;Whenever a player completes a trick of four, it is set aside, and the winner is the player who completes the most tricks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Utility is a card game played with small, square cards. Each player starts with a utility plant card, a house card, and a plain road card connecting the two. The utility plant and the house each have three utilities coming from them: gas, water, and electricity. The goal of the game is to be the first player to use utility tile cards (which each have segments of gas pipes, water lines, and electrical wires) to connect each of the utilities from the utility plant to the house.&#10;&#10;Each utility card has a unique combination of gas pipes, water lines, and electrical wires, so players must use spatial organization skills, puzzle solving ability, and strategic planning to ensure completion of their system before their opponent.&#10;&#10;The game is generally played with 2 players, but it can be played solo if desired. With two copies of the game, up to 4 players can play.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player begins with a utility plant card and a house card, connected by a plain road. The remaining cards are shuffled and placed face down in a stack.&#10; Objective: The goal of the game is to either be the first player to connect all three utilities (gas, water, and electricity) from their utility plant to their house OR to have fewer tiles placed than the opponent when the deck runs out of cards.&#10; Gameplay: Three cards are drawn off the top of the deck and placed face up in front of the deck. Players take turns choosing one of these cards and either adding it to their utilities OR replacing a previously-played card. When replacing cards, the card replaced becomes one of the three cards in front of the deck. When playing a new card, a card off the top of the deck is drawn to become one of the face-up cards in front of the deck. Cards may be placed adjacent to any card in play. Cards with roads can (but are not required to) be played on top of the starting road card.&#10;&#10;Connecting Utilities: Utilities do not have to align when placing a new card. In order to win, there must be a complete path from the utility plant to the house for all three utilities, and branches/alternative paths may remain unfinished. Water and gas align at the edges of the cards, and electricity aligns at the corners.&#10;&#10;Ending the game: The game ends when one player connects all three utilities from the utility plant to the house (that player is the winner) or when the last face-down card is drawn from the deck, in which case players count their utility cards and the player who has fewer cards in play wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Of War and Men is a WWII based, squad-level card game that introduces the individual heart of a soldier into the framework and strategies of war. Build effective fireteams and create or discover the land as you cross the war torn map and try to outflank, outmaneuver, and out gun the enemy. As any good leader, you must consider the individual strengths and weaknesses of your soldiers to make sure your Mission is a success.&#10; In one Mission, you must rescue or capture the Resistance soldier who has recovered secret plans and get them safely back to your camp. In another, you must parachute into the landing zone and capture the bridge in order to win the day. This 2-4 person game can be played within an hour, or track your soldiers across an entire campaign, awarding medals for courage and valor, while determining the ability of green troops coming in to replace lost heroes. Replay-ability is high since each encounter will vary based on Mission, fireteams, map builds, and general unpredictability of war. &#10; But these aren't just pieces on a board. You aren&rsquo;t just sending in soldier #2, but rather, you are sending in Corporal &ldquo;Pokey&rdquo; Johnston. His bio informs you that he's a down home roots kind of guy from Colorado. He hasn't been able to hit the broadside of a barn on this mission. However, you've been saving that &quot;Act of Valor&quot; card and you decide to play it with Corporal Johnston and he turns the tide of battle. These aren't just names on a roster. These aren't just numbers on a map. These are your men. These are your brothers in arms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As the citizens of the Kingdom prepare for the annual celebration, it's up to you, the players, together to pay respects to the Ancestors' Tree, where the Luck of the people can be stored for the coming year.&#10;&#10;Players decide when the game ends before beginning: First to X Coins (victory points that are also a resource in the game); Play X Rounds and whoever has the most Coins wins; Play until all Coins are taken from the Bank and the one with the most wins.&#10;&#10;Each player draws a hand of three villagers at the start of each round. On their turns, players play a card, add their villager's luck value to the communal score, follow the effect of their card, then draws 1 card from the deck and passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;But be careful - even luck has its limits, and you can't gather too much at a time without breaking the old tree. You can't play a card if it would raise the score over 99, and if you can't play any cards at all, you're out.&#10;&#10;The last player left standing wins their prize for the round, the deck is shuffled back up, and the fun begins anew!&#10;&#10;",

Hiding in the crowds, the hitman must work to find the opportune time to hit the Target. The hitman has an arsenal of guns, bombs, and poison to attempt to get the target, but one false move and it is game over!&#10;&#10;The game is setup by laying out 25 cards in a 5x5 grid that makes the town. The Target starts at a random location, but he moves throughout the night. With proper intel and planning, the hitman looks to get the upper hand and strike the Target at the right moment. But even with the Target right under his nose, if the hitman strikes at the wrong time the heat can be on him in an instant.&#10;&#10;The hitman only gets so many turns, until the Target will escape to the Helipad. During that time period, the Alert Level gets higher causing the cops and crooks to move further attempting to find and corner the hitman.&#10;&#10;Die Hitman plays in less than 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Die Hitman contains:&#10;25 Location cards&#10;19 Target cards&#10;5 Tool cards&#10;2 Player Aides&#10;Dice and counters.&#10;&#10;",

This game is unique in that it only contains Hearts, Spades, and wild cards.&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 20 cards face down. Players stack them in order without looking at them to form their &quot;stockpile&quot;. The Top card of the stock pile is turned face up.&#10;&#10;Each player is then dealt an additional 5 cards which form their hand. The remainder of the cards are placed in the center spot on the game board. The other 4 spots on the board are for community piles 2 for hearts and 2 for spades.  The player to the left of the dealer goes first.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may play any number and combination of cards from your hand, stockpile, or discard pile to their respective community spaces on the board. Wild cards may be played in place of any card in matching suit. Community piles must start with the number 1 and build consecutively to the number 5.&#10;&#10;Once a pile is completed place it to the side and start a new one. If you run out of cards in your hand immediately draw back up to 5.  When you play the top card of your stockpile turn up the next card. You may play a card as long as you have one available to play or until you choose to stop playing cards.&#10;&#10;Each player also has their own separate discard piles one for hearts and one for spades. To end your turn you must discard one card to its respective discard pile. Play continues with then next player in a clockwise fashion.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of your turn draw back up to 5 cards. If the draw pile runs out shuffle the completed community piles to form a new draw pile and place it in the center of the board. The first player to exhaust their stock pile scores 0 points. The other players score 1 point for each card left in their stockpile. When a player reaches 30 points the game ends. The player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;The game may also be played in teams and requires 4 players. All rules remain the same except during you turn you may play from your partners stockpile and discard piles. You may not play from your partners hand. play continues until both players on the same team exhaust their stockpiles. Scores are kept by teams and not by individuals by adding the number of cards/points from both stockpiles.&#10;&#10;Card C-Quence is a perfect mix of strategy and luck. Be the first to exhaust your stockpile and maintain the lowest score.&#10;&#10;",

The dealer starts by playing a number 7 of any group; Animal, Bird, or Fish, the next player must follow suit/group and play a number higher or lower. Or he may play a 7 of any group. If you cannot play you must pass. When a player runs out of cards he is the winner. He receives a score equal to the number of cards left in the other players hands. It has a bit of a trick-taking mechanic. Players play to an amount agreed upon before the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Because the cards are numbered it can also be used to play Rummy, Snip and Snap - which is similar to war, and Rally-up - a game where players try to get 12 consecutive cards of one group by passing 2 cards face down to the player on their left.&#10;&#10;",

This planet has only a rare source of energy the phospho-substance and one resource: the mutagen which is the main nutrient and a powerful vector of mutations.&#10;&#10;Glow in the darkness is a game halfway between the wargame card driven and the 4x, it's also a semi-cooperative horror game. Players start the game with 12 units, 3 source cities and 7 action cards. Dynamic gameplay: during its turn of play the player makes 2 actions chosen from a variable choice of programmed action&#10;&#10;Players embody evolved alien entities whose race is on the verge of extinction. Each player leads one of the 4 alien factions that try to guarantee their survival by plundering the genetic material (material token) of the opposing factions. The first player to acquire 4 material tokens wins the game. At the beginning of the game, the abilities of each faction are symmetrical (which also makes it easier to understand the game).  Each player develops his own faction's abilities during the game based on his strategy of adapting and his playing affinities, the game then takes on a highly asymmetrical twist.&#10;&#10;Players must conquer energy Source-cities, manage their energetic and opposing networks in order to increase their power. Players must also move their units carefully to guard against hostile reactions from the fauna and flora.&#10;&#10;Glow in the darkness has mechanisms and a unique gameplay including:&#10;- a common semi-hidden deckbuilding for the improvement of factions&#10;- a common action system with semi-hidden orders (which favors manipulation between players)&#10;- a controlled &quot;action anomaly&quot;promoting bold strategies&#10;- the morphe system for the specialization of faction capabilities&#10;- a sequential combat resolution system  &#10;- a biome with an autonomous and interactive evolution, including a mechanism of procedural generation associated with a comparative and adaptive mechanism of fauna and flora.&#10;- major evolution of the scary game (based on recent scientific studies concerning: fear)&#10;- the original and subtle management of resources through the construction of energy networks&#10;&#10;A game for 2-4 players 14+ years old.

If you draw an Always card you will do the wacky thing on your card every time it's your turn. A Whenever card directs you to do what the card says whenever another player does something specific. One wacky thing definitely leads to another in this zany game of craziness!&#10;&#10;SET UP&#10;&#10;     3 players randomly choose a prop card&#10;     Shuffle the action cards and put them facedown in a pile within reach of all players&#10;     Decide how many rounds to play. With 4-5 players, 8 rounds are recommended. With more players, less rounds. With less players, more rounds. When every player has picked an action card that is one round. &#10;&#10;&#10;PLAY&#10;&#10;     On your turn, draw an action card from the top of the deck and place it face up in front of you. Each time you draw an action card, add it to the row of action cards in front of you.&#10;     Read the action card aloud to all the players very carefully. Each card has a point value 1-12 based on the zaniness of the action.  &#10;     There are two types of action cards:&#10;         Always-if you draw an always card, do the zany thing immediately. Then repeat that zany thing every time it's your turn. &#10;         Whenever-if you draw a whenever card, do nothing right now. However read the card carefully because you will need to do whatever zany thing is on the card whenever another player does a specific zany thing.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Don't forget to read the Prop Cards and pass them around throughout the game. There are 3 different prop cards:&#10;         Funny Glasses-when you have this card, wear the glasses until someone stands for any reason. Then pretend you're a teacher and say something really smart. Then pass the glasses and card to the player on your left. &#10;         Microphone-when you have this card, hold the microphone until someone sings. Then sing into the microphone along with them. When you're done singing, pass the Microphone and Card to the person on your left. &#10;         Engagement Ring-when you have this card, wear the ring until someone kisses anything. Then run over, get down on one knee, and give the kisser the ring.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Once during the game, each player can pick one of his or her action cards and give to another player. But remember that in addition to giving that player something really zany to do, you are also givin g him or her points. And that might cause you to lose the game. &#10;     It's ok to remind players if they forget to do one of the things on the action cards in front of them. After all, the whole point of the game is to see everyone act really silly!&#10;&#10;&#10;WINNING&#10;&#10;     After the agreed upon number of rounds, players add up the points on the action cards. The player with the highest score wins. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fazes is a card game for 3 &ndash; 8 players. It has rules similar to Rook, Phase 10, Hearts, and other rummy like card games. The object of the game is to get the least amount of points by the end of the game. There are 6 fazes, each with its own set of rules. The last faze called &ldquo;madness&rdquo; combines all of the rules from previous fazes. Fazes is a fun and challenging card game for all skill levels.&#10;&#10;Starting Fazes&#10;Each player is dealt an equal amount of cards. The player with the green 2 begins play in each faze by leading with that card. Play continues in a clockwise direction. Players must play the color that is led. After everyone has played a card, the highest numeric card of the color played will take the hand.&#10;&#10;Trump&#10;Players who are out of the color led will have to play a trump card if they have it.  Red cards are TRUMP in fazes 1 &amp; 6 and when a red card is played it wins the trick. For example, if a player leads with a yellow card and the next player is out of yellow, they have to play a red card, if they have it, which trumps the trick. If two or more players have to trump any trick, the highest numeric red trump card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;Faze 1 : Red Trump&#10;Each red card is worth 5 points. If a player is out of the color that is led and they have a red card, they must play it, which trumps the trick. Once all of the tricks are won, count up each red card, and write down your points. Shuffle and deal all the cards for faze 2.&#10;&#10;Faze 2: Tricks &lsquo;R Pointr&#10;Each trick  worth  10  points. Trump  is  not  active  in  this  faze.  The  highest  numeric  card  of  the color  led  wins  the  trick  and  10  points.&#10;&#10;Faze  3: Yellow Pointers&#10;Each  yellow  card  is  worth  10  points. Trump  is  not  active  in this  faze.  The  highest  numeric  card  of the color  led  wins the trick. Each yellow card in the  trick  is worth  10  points.&#10;&#10;Faze  4: 13&rsquo;s&#10;The  #13  in  each  color  is  worth  25  points. Trump  is  not  active  in  this  faze. The  highest  numeric  card  of  the  color  led  wins  the  trick.&#10;&#10;Faze  5: Last Trick&#10;The  person  who  wins  the  &ldquo;last  trick&rdquo; get&rsquo;s 50 points deducted from their score.&#10;&#10;Faze  6: Madness&#10;Each  objective  and  rules  of  fazes  1  -&shy;&#226;&#128;&#144;  5  are  in  play!    Red  cards  (5  points  each)  are  trump  and have  to  be  used  if you don&rsquo;t have the card that is led.    Every  trick  is  worth  10  points  plus  the  value  of  pointer  cards  that  could  be  included  in  the  trick.  Yellow  cards  are  10  points  each.  The  13&rsquo;s  are  25  points  each.    Special  note  -&shy;&#226;&#128;&#144;  the  red  13  is  worth  30  points  (5  points  for  being  red,  25  points  for  being  a  13).  The  yellow  13  is  worth  35  points  (10  points  for  being  yellow,  25  points  for  being  a  13).  And  finally,  whoever  wins  the  last  trick  get&rsquo;s minus  50  points  from  their  score! The  player  winning  the  last  trick  must  still  account  for  any  points  within  the  trick  itself.&#10;&#10;SHOOT    THE    MOON&#10;If  a  player  wins  all  of  the  points  in  any  faze  they  have &ldquo;Shot  the  Moon!&rdquo;  The  reward  for&#10;&ldquo;Shooting  the  Moon&rdquo; is  all  other  players  receive  the  total  points  of  that  faze! For  example,  if  a  player  in  faze  4  receives  all  four  13&rsquo;s,  then  all  other  players  have  100  pts added  to  their  score!&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of all 6 Fazes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A fun, fast-paced combination of strategy and luck for great times with family and friends! You may think you have the upper hand until it happens&hellip; Tough Luck! This card game is sure to bring fun to any gathering! For 2 to 4 players or buy 2 decks for up to 8 players!&#10;&#10;Object of the Game: Be the first to play all of the cards in your hand and in front of you!&#10;&#10;Game Setup: Choose how many players you have and deal the cards according to the directions below.&#10;&#10;2 Players: The dealer deals both players 29 cards. Without looking at your cards (or letting the other players look at them) pick 8 cards out of your hand and place them in front of you face down.   Place one card face up on each of the cards you just placed face down.&#10;&#10;3 Players: The dealer deals all players 19 cards. (Discard any one card.)  Without looking at your cards (or letting the other players look at them) pick 6 cards out of your hand and place them in front of you face down.  Place one card face up on each of the cards you just place face down.&#10;&#10;4 Players: The dealer deals all players 14 cards. (Discard any two cards.)  Without looking at your cards (or letting the other players look at them) pick 4 cards out of your hand and place them in front of you face down.  Place one card face up on each of the cards you just place face down.&#10;&#10;5 Players: The dealer deals all players 23 cards. (Discard any one card.)  Without looking at your cards (or letting the other players look at them) pick 8 cards out of your hand and place them in front of you face down.  Place one card face up on each of the cards you just place face down.&#10;&#10;6 Players: The dealer deals all players 19 cards. (Discard any two cards.)  Without looking at your cards (or letting the other players look at them) pick 6 cards out of your hand and place them in front of you face down  .Place one card face up on each of the cards you just place face down.&#10;&#10;7 Players: The dealer deals all players 16 cards. (Discard any four cards.)  Without looking at your cards (or letting the other players look at them) pick 5 cards out of your hand and place them in front of you face down.  Place one card face up on each of the cards you just place face down.&#10;&#10;8 Players: The dealer deals all players 14 cards. (Discard any four cards.)  Without looking at your cards (or letting the other players look at them) pick 4 cards out of your hand and place them in front of you face down.  Place one card face up on each of the cards you just place face down.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;&#10;First&hellip; some simple rules:&#10;&#10;Only after a player plays all of the cards in their hand can they play the cards that are face up in front of them on the table.&#10;&#10;And&hellip;&#10;&#10;Only after a player plays all of the cards that are face up in front of them on the table can they play the cards that are faced down on the table. You flip over and play these cards one at a time (no peeking at the other cards!) &mdash; Keep these &lsquo;faced-down&rsquo; cards  face-down until all cards in your hand and the cards facing up in front of you are gone.&#10;In a 2 player game if you flip over a REVERSE card, flip over and play another card&hellip; If the card you played after the REVERSE has a lower value the the card played previous to the REVERSE card&hellip; &ldquo;Tough Luck&rdquo;!  You get to pick up all of the cards in the &lsquo;played pile&rsquo;.  If you play a higher value car it is the other players turn.&#10;&#10;The first player puts a low-value card from their hand (or any card value they choose) on the table face up on the &lsquo;played pile&rsquo;. (2 is the lowest value and 12 is the highest value card.)The next player places a card down from their hand that has an equal or higher value than the card previously played on the played pile.&#10;&#10;If a player has more than one of the same card they can play as many of those same valued cards during his turn.&#10;Example: If a player has two &ldquo;5&rdquo; cards in his hand, they can play both of the cards if they want to at the same time.&#10;When 4 cards of the same value are played consecutively in turn those 4 cards and all cards in the played pile are no longer played in the game and go into the discard pile.&#10;If the next player cannot play an equal or higher valued card onto the played pile from their hand, that player picks up all of the played cards on the played pile and adds them to their hand.&#10;The player that picks up all of the cards from the played pile has &ldquo;Tough Luck&trade;&rdquo;! They must play the cards in their hand before they can go back and play from the cards in front of them.&#10;&#10;End of Game: The first player that runs of out cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;It is possible that your last card may be a RESTART &mdash; Play it and win the game, a RESET &mdash; Play it and win the game or a REVERSE &mdash; Play it and win the game!&#10;&#10;Special Play Cards:&#10;&#10;REVERSE:  The REVERSE cards reverses the play of the game (counter-clockwise to clockwise, etc).  If a player plays a REVERSE card the next player has to match or beat the card they just played.  If you play a REVERSE card your turn is finished. In a 2-Player game if you play a REVERSE card you get to go again.&#10;&#10;RESET: The RESET cards clears the pile of cards that everyone is playing on.  These cards are no longer used in the game and go into a discard pile.  If you play a RESET card your turn is finished.&#10;&#10;RESTART: The RESTART cards resets the deck to whatever value card the player chooses.  The player plays the RESTART card and then can play whatever card they want to from their hand.&#10;&#10;Game Play Variation:Try playing with less cards in front of you and more cards in your hand or vice-a-versa to add a different challenge!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A tongue-in-cheek card game that has you racing against your opponents to reach 50 years of marriage first.&#10;&#10;Think you've got what it takes to make it all the way to 50 years of marriage? In this card game players compete to see who's marriage can withstand the challenges many couples face- such as naughty children, money trouble, pesky in-laws and even the much feared sex drought! But don't worry, for each challenge there is a solution.&#10;&#10;Game play is pretty simple. The game can be played with up to 4 individuals or 3 pairs(6 players total). Each turn involves drawing one card and playing one card. To win you must play year cards(1 year, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 years)to reach the total of 50 years before your opponents do. Before you can play any year cards you must play a married card. Once you're officially married you can start accumulating years.&#10;&#10;On your turn you draw a card: &#10;&#10;     from the top of the discard pile or &#10;     the top of the deck&#10;&#10;&#10;Then you choose ONE of the following as your play a card action: &#10;&#10;     Playing a card on yourself such as a Year card, Solution card or Immunity card(which protects you from specific Setback cards).&#10;     Playing a card on an opponent such as a Setback card or Divorce card to slow down their progress. &#10;     Or if you're unable to do either of those, simply discard a card. &#10;&#10;&#10;If you have either a divorce card or setback card played on you, you can not play any new year cards till those cards have been resolved. Marriage cards resolve Divorce cards, Solution cards resolve Setback cards of the same color.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Isabel is a two-player game portraying the War of Castilian Succession (1475-1479). The death of King Enrique IV in 1474 created a domestic crisis in the Kingdom of Castile. The two contenders for the throne were Isabel, Enrique&rsquo;s half-sister, and Juana, the 13-year-old daughter of the late monarch. Both women counted with powerful allies in their fight for the throne: in 1469 Isabel&rsquo;s had wed Fernando, heir to the Crown of Aragon, and Juana married King Alfonso V of Portugal during the early stages of the war. In Isabel, the players assume the role of Isabel and Juana and their respective allies as they compete to garnish domestic and international support for their cause. The players face a multifaceted conflict fought as much in the arenas of Spain and the African coast as in the undecided hearts of the Castilian nobility and population at large.&#10;&#10;Over four rounds, the players compete by maneuvering troops on the Iberian Peninsula and the Atlantic coast, and by gaining the alliance of various noble houses, public opinion, and international powers. Isabel&nbsp;incorporates streamlined mechanics that are attentive to the historical circumstances of the conflict. Every turn, players face multiple strategic choices which, taken secretly, require tactical reconsideration made in reaction to the opponent&rsquo;s chosen actions.&nbsp;Isabel&nbsp;forces the players to constantly consider the risk-reward of their choices. With a limited amount of available resources, players have to decide when to sacrifice assets to obtain substantial one-time benefits.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ever since we saw our first ninja movies in the 80's we&rsquo;ve all been wondering &ndash;Cowboys or Ninjas?  On the one hand Cowboys have their trusty six shooters and faithful horses to help them.  On the other hand, Ninja are well versed in the dark arts, possess secret knowledge and skills, and have no qualms about murdering you in your sleep if they think they might lose the show down at sun down.&#10;&#10;In Face Off Duels you are installed as the leader of one of these mighty factions and over three rounds of tactical combat you get to figure out which group, which leader, is the greatest of all time.&#10;&#10;What separates Face Off Duels from other fighting card games is a unique scoring system that forces players to not only play their opponent, but the board as well.  The result is a quick game that, like a great puzzle, you will want to return to again and again.  The Face Off scoring system plus the magical whimsy that is the Power Deck means no two games of Face Off Duels are the same.&#10;&#10;Face Off Duels present you with multiple paths to victory, a myriad of strategic options, and a sense of humor that is way more engaging than this blurb.  In order to win, you must be able to plan ahead, bluff when appropriate, and occasionally pull that one card off the top of the deck.  If you can do all these (and add seven plus five in your head) you just might be able to lead your chosen faction to glory.&#10;&#10;",

The illicit relationship of the young lovers, Tristan and Isolde, threatens to start a war with their neighbours and then there&rsquo;s the rumours about Queen Guinevere and Lancelot...&#10;&#10;Players play as ambitious Lords in the time of King Arthur, all vying to be seen sat next to the most influential people in court at King Arthur&rsquo;s latest banquet at Camelot.&#10;&#10;Gameplay involves playing a Scheme card from you hand that will allow your character card to move in various ways, or allows you to move the other members (King's Knights, Guests or VIPs) of the banquet.  Moving one character, however, may cause the character it displaces to also need to move in a specific way, and moves may chain beyond your control! For example, moving a Knight may require that knight to automatically move straight to the Royal Row, which may then displace a VIP such as Isolde who must move to be next to Tristan, who may then displace another Knight, etc.&#10;&#10;You have until the end of the final banquet course (or &quot;round&quot;, which varies depending on chosen game length) to manoeuvre yourself into the best position to gain points from adjacent guests AND to hopefully complete your secret quest for bonus points.  The player with the most influence points wins (and becomes the most influential Lord of the land)!&#10;&#10;Each game also has a random or specifically chosen common quest that changes the rules of the game slightly, which all players are affected by.&#10;&#10;When playing with less than 4 players, AI players called &quot;Rogue Nobles&quot; operate the &quot;missing&quot; players, moving around automatically and likely screwing up your well laid plans!&#10;&#10;",

All distances are measured in card lengths or widths, combat is resolved by poker hands, and magic by blackjack. Players alternate activating models. Game objectives are by scenario - the rulebook provides eight different ones, ranging from &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; to &quot;All Out Brawl&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game has a strong emphasis on campaign play, with players recruiting their gang, pitting them against one another, and seeing them grow (or wither) from game to game. Interestingly, the money you use between games to recruit can also be used during games to encourage your fighters, or bribe the enemy's. Money can also be stolen from enemy gangers during a game.&#10;&#10;Each game pits two players with their gangs against one another, but many players can participate in the same campaign, meeting various opponents across it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "War knows no end. Its victims are counted in thousands and each day we lose hope, little by little. Food is becoming scarce and our shelter is falling apart &mdash; yet we keep struggling.&#10;&#10;New faces can be seen around the city: the friendly ones at the makeshift market or in neighboring houses, the hostile ones in the night with blinding flashlights and clubs and knives. We seek new paths to travel through the ruins &mdash; sometimes even underground &mdash; just to avoid sniper fire and loot anything of value. It's never much, yet we keep struggling. We have no other choice.&#10;&#10;Tales from the Ruined City is the first expansion for This War of Mine: The Board Game, a story-rich game of survival in a war-torn city.&#10;&#10;The expansion introduces a range of game modules to enrich the base game:&#10;&#10;- Emira is the 13th Character complete with a personal background; you may introduce her in any playthrough&#10;- Desperate Measures cards empower you whenever you lose anyone from your group&#10;- Farmers module features the Market, where your choices affect the way people perceive you; it also gives you a chance to interact with people from outside the city&#10;- Sewers are full of unknown dangers and thrilling narrative, providing you with options for additional Scavenging runs&#10;- Five Scenarios offer many hours of thrilling gameplay; each features unique rules and components and winning one of them gives you access to a reward envelope with special legacy content&#10;&#10;Face atrocities of war and prove that from horrible desperation comes great courage.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Escape the Alps is a solitaire game that uses grid movement, dice rolling, and resource management.&#10;&#10;Synopsis:&#10;You are a captured WWII Airborne Ranger imprisoned by the German SS in a castle in the Alps. You've been put through hell and still you've only given your name, rank and serial number. As they take a break from interrogating you, you manage to break open the window to the room and climb out onto the ledge. You immediately notice the 500ft drop to the rocks below and feel the cool chill air of the Bavarian Alps. You work your way to the face of the mountain and look up to see sheer rock hundreds of feet straight up with occasional patches of snow covering section of the mountain. You have two choices; climb to freedom with no turning back or get recaptured and await certain death from the SS. Your choice is clear, climb the mountain and escape the Alps.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to climb up multiple rock faced cards using dice to manage your movement direction.  On each rock face card are hazards, benefits, rest points and location markers.  You must climb through natural rock conditions as well as snow conditions.&#10;&#10;Certain dice arrangement can gain you another movement die or allow you to modify existing direction die.&#10;&#10;Each game is different due to 12 individual rock face configuration and marker locations.&#10;&#10;WINNING CONDITION:&#10;Successfully manage your climbing piece up the face of a mountain to the top without falling. You must manage your climbing route and try to pass through specific zones while trying to avoid losing as little fatigue as possible.&#10;&#10;LOSING CONDITION:&#10;Become too fatigued or lose your grip and fall off the rock face; losing the game immediately.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, a player throws three D6, and if the result is 9 or higher, advances his piece one space. Each red space has an additional requirement that can lead to penalties or bonuses. Each track also has a battle to be won along the way (with the map noting the defending French commander). Moving past the battle requires a roll of 10 or higher on 2D6.&#10;&#10;Players put 6 marks in the pot to start, and may lose or win money from the pot along the way. The first player to reach Leipzig (space 14) wins whatever pot remains.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;A competitive collectable battle game where Bosses summon their minions and powerful effects to become the baddest Boss in the multi-verse.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Battle Bosses has you controlling a gigantic Boss, utilizing dice to gain Energy and Crystal resources to unleash devastating moves, spawn Minions to send to battle, and play innovative cards to gain tactical advantage specific to your Boss and Minions.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game, both players combine and set up their tiles to create a single battlefield, put their boss in the starting space, and draw 5 cards from their deck. On their turn, each player rolls 4 dice which will give them energy and crystals, sometimes even triggering Overload, a critical hit that allows you to reroll dice for extra bonuses. Energy must be spent the turn it is earned to utilize Boss abilities such as movement, creating minions, and unleashing their ultimate move, as well as extra abilities earned by playing cards. Crystals on the other hand, can be saved up or used right away towards cards to unleash additional special moves and devastating effects. Loyal minions are collateral damage as the last Boss left standing wins.&#10;&#10;Through our Kickstarter, the Deluxe Tier offers Arena Mode, which boasts MOBA-inspired gameplay for 4 or 6 players, where bosses respawn when defeated and two teams compete to destroy the enemy base.

Some of the war masks of the Nasier allow for limited yet powerful telepathic communication, and it is through these masks that the masters are able to bond with the hounds and help them through the binding with their elemental masks, creating a wonderful blend of intelligence, stability, superior senses, and predatory ability.&#10;&#10;Wrath of Kings: Izari Warhounds includes two characters and bases and a unit card for use with the base game.&#10;&#10;",

If you've ever wondered what would have happened if the Red Army had managed to win the Battle of Warsaw in 1920 - and then decided to take the Revolution into Germany - this is the game you've got to get on the table.&#10;&#10;This game is a drastic reworking of Brian Train's earlier and long out-of-print game Freikorps.&#10;The subject matter is the same - the Red Army, after winning the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920, decides to keep going west and bring revolution to Germany on the points of Soviet bayonets.&#10;But so much has changed: new map, new Orders of Battle, new mechanics and a surprising array of optional rules to keep play variable and interesting: Armoured Trains; the Trotsky Train; the Soviet Baltic Fleet; Tactical Doctrines; Marshal Pilsudski; Volunteer Legions; Entente units; the Virus of Revolt; Reichswehr variable deployment and construction; options for the Free City of Danzig; and Conscription on the March.&#10;&#10;The game also mates with Red Horde 1920 (itself a reworking of Konarmiya) from Tiny Battle Publishing, so you can play one long campaign for Central Europe, during the fateful summer and fall of a 1920 that never happened....&#10;&#10;176 die-cut, double-sided counters&#10;17 x 22&quot; hex map of western Poland/ eastern Germany&#10;John R.

    "Description": "PICKLE PICKLE PEPPER is a casual push-your-luck micro-game...which is a whole bunch of industry jargon that translates to, &quot;This simple game turns a small number of components into a ridiculous amount of fun!&quot; Designed to be playable by almost anyone in a very short period of time (5 to 15 minutes, on average), PICKLE PICKLE PEPPER is the perfect filler game, the perfect family game, and the perfect warm-up, cool-down, and/or in-between game for those marathon gaming days! It's also portable and fits in your pocket, so you can play it virtually anywhere.&#10;&#10;Put plainly, PICKLE PICKLE PEPPER is the perfect pastime for people with a passion for point-based pick-up play!&#10;&#10;(In this game, alliteration is part of the fun, so get used to it.)&#10;&#10;The basics are simple. Players start their turn by shuffling the whole deck, then pledging how many cards they intend to draw; that's your Pickle Pledge. If you're able to draw a number of pickles equal to your pledge amount without drawing a pepper, you can choose to stop and bank your Pickle Points. However, if you're feeling bold, you can push your luck (which we call a Pickle Push). While you're pushing, pickle cards are worth twice as many points, but if you draw a pepper card, you not only score zero points this turn, you lose some of the points you've already banked! Once your turn is over, pass the deck to the next player and repeat. The first player to bank a total of 20 Pickle Points wins the game!&#10;&#10;",
