When playing Curda, the values are reversed and a lower number wins over a higher number. Where the Chanta appears, the best card does not win, but the one that follows in value. Mu&ntilde;eca Brava beats any man, even Carlos Gardel. In turn, Cafishio beats any woman, even the Viejita. When Garufa appears, there is a party and the one who wins the trick has to give it away. Misteriosa Mascarita is a card with gender to define, will it be male, will it be papusa?&#10;&#10;The game is learned quickly and its rules barely occupies the first four pages of the book. The rest of the volume links pieces of tangos, memorable lyrics that act as background music for the game, breathing life into it and giving thickness to each card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the book back cover&#10;&#10;&#10;&iexcl;Ju&eacute;guese un tango!&#10;&#10;A partir de las historias que cuentan las letras de tango naci&oacute; Tango de Mente, una nueva baraja y un pasatiempo para practicar entre amigos.&#10;&#10;Sentados los jugadores a la mesa, las cartas van y vienen. Cuando se juega Curda, los valores se invierten y un n&uacute;mero menor pasa a ganarle a uno mayor. Donde aparece el Chanta no gana la mejor carta, sino la que le sigue en valor. Mu&ntilde;eca Brava le gana a cualquier hombre, incluso a Carlos Gardel. A su vez, Cafishio le gana a cualquier mujer, incluso a la Viejita.

    "Description": "Once upon a time&hellip; not a literature quiz! Focus on the stories! We ask you to write your own bestseller!&#10;&#10;Just like in an unforgettable novel, there are big laughs or even deep conversations waiting for you in this game. Once upon a time, there was no one - there was once a character you bring to life&hellip;, a dramatic turn that no one expects&hellip;, and the end result that puts the crown on your work. Creativity, playfulness, communication, imagination - all of which you will need in this great party game where the story can only be limited by your own imagination. Move the threads skillfully and be the best storyteller on your team!&#10;&#10;The game lasts for 10 rounds. The first 9 rounds have 3 phases, Inspiration, Writing, and Evaluation.&#10;In the Inspiration phase, we draw 2 characters, 2 dramas and 2 end cards to the playing field.&#10;In the Writing phase, each player thinks about which combination of 3 cards they think could make the most interesting story. It is important that you choose one of each category.&#10;&#10;Everyone will write on their page the letter combinations (for example, BAA) of the selected pages next to the current round number.&#10;In the first three rounds, the text of the selected Character Cards is recorded, in rounds 4-6 the text of the selected Drama card, and in rounds 7-9 the text of the End Card.&#10;&#10;In the Rating phase, players receive points for each of their teammates who have selected the same letter combination for their story. If exactly the same combination is written, everyone gets 4 points, if only the first 2 letters match, 2 points, if only the first letter matches, 1 point goes. No points are awarded if the first letter of the letter combination does not match anyone.&#10;&#10;The tenth round is the Synopsis. In this round, we do not put new cards on the game board, but the Inspiration phase takes place from the texts of the previously selected cards. So in the Inspiration phase, we write the final story from the text of the 3-3-3 inspiration cards previously written on the scorecard.&#10;As everyone completes in a row, tell the Final Story one after the other. Don&rsquo;t forget to give the story a title.&#10;After telling the Final Story, players secretly give each other points. Everyone can split 7 points among the other players, we give the most to the one who we think invented the best story.&#10;After telling the story, everyone adds up the victory points earned during the 9+1 rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Players are trying to get their tableau of cards down to the lowest total. If a top and bottom row card match, those two equal zero. At the end of the game, the lowest total score wins.&#10;&#10;The deck is numbered 1 to 8, with one 1, two 2s, three 3s and so on. Each number is a different sea creature.&#10;&#10;Players have a tableau of six cards face-down in two rows of three. Two are turned up and the highest total starts. On their turn, a player draws either from the deck or from the discard pile. The player then uses the drawn card to replace an existing card in their tableau. The new card goes face-up, the old card goes face-up to the discard. If the player drew from the draw pile, they can discard it instead.&#10;&#10;In this way, cards gradually get turned up. The game ends when either the draw deck is exhausted, or a player has all six cards face-up. The totals are calculated, and the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;However, the game has certain twists. For example, the 4 card is actually -4. The 5 card forces another player to turn up a card, possibly ending the sooner. Sharks must be placed as shown on the shark card, and so on.&#10;&#10;Because there are more high number cards, it is harder to get the score down. But players have more chances to match pairs and make them go to zero.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Monuments are powerful, but many of these epic Buildings have special requirements that must be met before construction.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Letters that are not part of a word are worth 0 points, and if every combination of letters on your grid forms a word, then you have created a &quot;perfect square&quot; and score 12 bonus points.&#10;&#10;The rules suggest playing multiple games until someone passes 500 points. Questo can also be played as a solo game, with a player trying for the best score possible, with 52+ being quite difficult.&#10;&#10;",

Some cards have very particular scoring, such as create a line of mummy, eye, eye, woman.

So you always have to decide which side you want to benefit from and which side you might concede to another camp.&#10;&#10;With these special abilities you can swap cards, turn them, or even knock other tribe members unconscious. This also allows you to influence the row of cards between the other two, because otherwise you can only place cards to the left or right of you, but not opposite.&#10;&#10;When all the cards are played, see which of you won this primitive debate. To do this, you add up the numbers that are facing you to the left and right. Your rivals claim the other halves of the cards for themselves. The one who could collect the most points after three rounds has prevailed over the others and decides the further fate of the troop.&#10;&#10;Additionally needed: 2 chips to mark the people protected by the warrior.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You're having a summer party in the garden. A few friends arrive early in the afternoon to help with the preparations: Beer tables are dragged, tablecloths laid out and space made for the drinks. In one corner of the garden, however, a loud competition breaks out over who will hang the most beautiful string of lights. Who will hang the coolest fairy lights at your garden party?&#10;&#10;All cards show three power lines with light bulbs and lanterns of different colors hanging from them. You place one of them in front of you as your own starting card. The rest of the cards are placed in the center of the table. Look at them carefully, because it's all about speed! Once you've all placed one hand flat on the table, you're ready to go.&#10;&#10;You grab cards with only one hand at a time, as fast as you can, and place them on your string of lights. Also make sure that the power lines are not always straight. This can get lost in the heat of the moment. You can also flip cards, because maybe the back side will be more useful. But you have to put your hand flat on the table again before you can return to the action.&#10;&#10;Whoever has laid the required length first, depending on the number of players, gives the signal to the others to come to the end. Now you can see who has really conjured up the best string of lights:&#10;&#10;The more light bulbs and lanterns of the same color follow each other in a line, the more points the chain of lights earns you. The lanterns are particularly valuable because, unlike light bulbs, they also count individually and even double the point value if they are part of a row. When your arms are unknotted and your eyes are no longer spinning, you can immediately start the next round.&#10;&#10;It's game 17 of the series &quot;Die Kleinen Feinen&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

In reality, Donkey, Dog, Cat and Rooster are the first professional gang of gangsters and are up to mischief in the otherwise quiet Bremen. Luckily, the police stand in their way!&#10;&#10;You get three cards in your hand, only whoever plays the first card gets four cards. Then you try to form rows of cards from 0 to 4. To do this, you always place the next highest or next lowest card.&#10;&#10;If you have a card in the same color, you may skip values. Since you are not allowed to fill up this gap, rows can remain incomplete.&#10;&#10;If you cannot or do not want to play a card, you must pass and take a card from the draw pile into your hand. You may play this card directly. When a row is finished - whether complete or not - or everyone in the round has passed, the round is over. Whoever placed the last card of the row gets the lowest card in his hand and starts the next round. All other cards in the row are discarded.&#10;&#10;Once the draw pile is empty, you may only pass if you really can't play. Whichever of you has no card left in his or her hand when he or she would have to play a card, wins the round. The losers then receive one minus point for each card in their hand, two for a policeman. Whoever has collected the fewest minus points at the end of a certain number of rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Dubbed the &ldquo;Easter Offensive&rdquo; by the US press, the Communist attack was the largest since those during Tet in 1968, and like that earlier offensive, the Communists hoped that the offensive would initiate insurrections throughout South Vietnam and the collapse of its government. One of the most violent battles of the Easter Offensive was fought over the town of Kontum. The central highlands town had been subject to many attacks over the years, but this was the most prolonged and unlike the earlier fights which were waged by the NLF, this was a large-scale conventional battle that included tanks and massive numbers of artillery and rocket support.

Some of them can lead to your death, such as not having any food or ammunition during a shootout; others can lead to defeat, such as having a love gauge at zero, which would lead to the separation of the couple. It is therefore important to fulfill the victory conditions before triggering any defeat condition.&#10;&#10;In easy mode, the goal is to finish your run with a shoutout in a farmhouse, with two bank loot and your love gauge raised to the maximum before the police &mdash; or someone &mdash; kill Bonnie or Clyde.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "TropeQuest pokes fun at everyone's favorite sci-fi and fantasy stereotypes and puts them literally into the hands of the players, who attempt to turn a pile of genre fiction cliches into a workable narrative. It's a creative, collaborative game with a lighthearted competitive element that uses cards and a board to make it fun and easy for players to improvise an original story. Best of all, it generates a unique tale each and every time it's played.&#10;&#10;The board provides the story arc, a plot map that packs as many cliched scenarios and overwrought plot twists as possible into fifteen squares. The deck brings the setting... a library of genre tropes and oblique pop culture references to tickle the imaginations of geeks and laypersons alike. Players and encouraged to mix, match, and try out new combinations.&#10;&#10;After a deck of tropes and a plot board are chosen, players are each dealt a hand of cards and take turns being the Narrator. The Narrator reads the prompt on the next available square and chooses a card from a pool of trope cards submitted by adjacent players (plus one random from the deck) to finish the prompt. While this may yield some hilarious results, the Narrator's work has not yet begun! Next, the Narrator &quot;sells&quot; the scene by elaborating, tying up loose ends, spicing it up a bit. Afterwards, the players redraw cards, the player whose card was picked draws an extra one, and the next player becomes the Narrator. Rinse and repeat until all fifteen squares have been played and the story has reached its thrilling climax.&#10;&#10;So, the story is over. What was the point of it all? Well, in a way, the goal of the game is to laugh, have fun, and tell a quirky story together. However, in another, more mathematical and literal way, the goal of the game is to win by having more cards than anyone else at the end of the game. But winning also comes with great responsibility! After the gloating is over, the winner then chooses their favorite scene in the story Narrated by another player. That player then becomes the Chosen One, Master of Tropes and The Uber-Winner of that round of TropeQuest.&#10;&#10;",

If battered river levees collapse, everything important to you will be washed away.&#10;&#10;Rising Waters is a co-operative board game built around area control, set collection, and variable player power mechanisms in which players are members of the African American community who are confronting two powerful and arbitrary forces: nature and the racism of white landowners. Resist by drawing on hidden strengths like your family, church, music, plots of land, and education. Can you manage the rising waters to stay alive?&#10;&#10;Rising Waters is played on a hex-based map of the Mississippi River and surrounding lands based on the area around Vicksburg, Mississippi. The game runs over a series of rounds representing different weeks during the flood, when players have opportunities to work cooperatively and individually to save their homes, families, and communities. During the flood, work together to keep your family and neighbors alive by minimizing losses during the flood. Players must also negotiate the arbitrary demands of white landowners.&#10;&#10;Yet African Americans weren&rsquo;t solely victims in the 1927 flood&ndash;as always, they maintained a sense of agency and sources of power to survive. In the game, this comes from the Community cards, which include blues, farm animals, church, garden, family, and education cards. The cards help players upgrade their abilities during the game as well as resist racism. Rising Waters serves as a powerful illustration of the difficulty of African American lives in the Jim Crow South. Through the game, students and teachers will be able to have challenging conversations about the endemic nature of racism and how it complicates life during a crisis. If players keep below the maximum level of losses for a certain number of rounds, they've survived the worst of the flood and win the game!&#10;&#10;",

The gameplay is heavily focused on player interaction with  intuitive rules that are designed merely as a catalyst for player interaction and serve the purpose to define available options.&#10;You are agents sent to investigate an incident in a local sanatorium. Upon arrival on the scene you realize there is an impostor among you.&#10;Your goal is to gather as much information as possible while making sure all witnesses remain alive for further questioning.&#10;&#10;Move through the Story by drawing Event cards and playing them during your turn in accordance with your agenda, the mandatory play means you will be faced with several bad choices - in this game most choices are bad. As the story advances more and more clues are found about the traitor, however reaching the end of any story Act with the traitor alive means that the agents lose the game. The traitor(s) must be stopped before reaching the completion of his mission. A unique story progress board is used to mark the progress of the team as a whole while individual Mind sheets follow players' descent into inevitable madness.&#10;The game ends either when the Agents win by discovering and eliminating the Traitor or when the Traitor wins by either eliminating all Agents or reaching the end of the story and completing his goal.&#10;The special 2 player game mode keeps the suspense, social deduction elements and paranoia with only minor rule changes.&#10;Included is one Investigation focus die made of wood, as imperfect as the world you are playing in and unique,, again.. as this world.&#10;&#10;",

The play order stays the same throughout play. Players create two score sheets, one for each of the left and right hand neighbors at the table. At the end of the game, each player will receive points for the number of gifts shown on the cards they collect for each of the scoring categories on the score sheet. Before play, decide whether the play will be &quot;generous&quot; or &quot;greedy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Beginning with the first player and proceeding in order, turn gifts face-up from the top of the draw pile until there are six or more gift icons showing. Choose who will get which cards. In &quot;generous&quot; mode, you must give away all but one card (but may give away all of them). In &quot;greedy&quot; mode, you must give away at least one card (but may give away as many more as you like, up to all of them). Players negotiate and make suggestions about who should get which cards, but ultimately, the current player decides. You cannot refuse a gift.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, count up the number of each kind of icon, and score points for each according to how your neighbors filled out the two score sheets they passed to you, except that you don't score any points for the type of icon you collected the most.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is called Iwok&aacute;: La Tierra sin Mal (The land without evil). It is played on the space of a board, between two players: one will be the Tupi-Guarani aboriginal people, and the other the viceroy with his army. But, while the game is played, the competitors -due to the characteristics of entertainment- will be invited to walk the path of historical knowledge; they will be able to know the circumstances of the time; the rituals, legends and cosmogonies of the aborigines; They will be able to delve into the war iconography of the time, the weapons and ships of the conquerors, their war tactics, etc. And, also, some continental geography.&#10;&#10;Two players or teams can play the Iwok&aacute; from the age of 9. One will be the Tupi-Guarani people, and the other will be the viceroy and his army. It is played with green and brown chips, in circular movements. On the board the most important place is the center called Arete (the promised land of the aboriginal people). The viceroy is occupying this sacred place: his objective will be to leave through four paths or exit points, from the center to the outside of the board, and flee by ship with the stolen riches. In the escape, he will be protected by his army.&#10;&#10;The Tupi-Guarani, who are around the Arete, have the mission of preventing the viceroy and his army from escaping with his riches. How do they prevent the flight of the conquerors? Enclosing them with tokens. The army can be &quot;eaten&quot; with the tokens and eliminated, but the viceroy must be locked up with the tokens.&#10;&#10;The invaders win if the viceroy reaches any of the four starting squares, and flee with the riches. The natives win if the viceroy is trapped between tiles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your challenge in Pyramiland is to rid yourself of the balls in your collection first.&#10;&#10;To set up, place up to sixty pegs in the holes of the wooden game board to create the field of play, and give each player the same number of wooden balls. On a turn, you place a ball on the playing area, then you can play again if you can place a ball so that it touches the ball just placed while also being on a higher level. You can continue to take extra turns so long as you can do this.&#10;&#10;When you place on the lowest level, your ball must be supported by four wooden pegs. On the second level and higher, your ball just needs to be supported by other balls, but due to the layout of the pegs, not all of the balls will be in identical rows, so you likely won't have a clean, regular-shaped pyramid as you build to higher levels.&#10;&#10;Whoever places their final ball first wins. If a player cannot place a ball or knocks a ball from the pyramid, including one just placed, the game ends, that player loses, and whoever has the fewest balls remaining wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Civilisations is a card game about building competing ancient civilisations over three Ages &#10;Each Age has a different deck of cards. At the start of the game the first Age is divided into a number of hands equal to the number of players plus an extra hand which is set aside.&#10;The set aside hand means that the card mix if different for each game, creating a strong replay value.&#10;Each player then chooses a card from their hand and these cards are played simultaneously, paid for with Gold from your civilisations treasury.&#10;Most cards have Military and/or Culture values and all cards have a special effect. When the card is played the special effect is resolved. These effects do things like enhancing other cards already in play, scoring extra points for certain cards, making certain types of cards cheaper to buy, removing or stealing cards from opponents and a host of other things to.&#10;Some special effects are triggered by circumstances and if not triggered when played will wait until a later turn when their trigger condition is met.&#10;Cards which target other players usually target a random card and/or a random player to prevent players ganging up one someone and ruining their fun.&#10;After playing a card, hands are passed round the table clockwise, giving you new options and choices to make.&#10;Once each player has played 6 cards the Age ends and the player with the card with the highest single Military score gains a Colonisation culture bonus and then players may choose to declare War on each other. Winning a war gets you a small amount of gold but, more importantly, destroys a random card from your opponent.&#10;At the end of the third Age Culture scores are added up to find out who won.&#10;The game was written with the following in mind:&#10;&#10;     A game should take 1-2 hours (my attention span now is about 2 hours.. age is great :)&#10;     The game can be played on a card or kitchen table&#10;     Set-up and take down time for a game is less than 5 minutes&#10;     You don't need to refer to the rulebook in play, everything you need to know is on the cards (e.g. card abilities are clearly explained in plain english)&#10;     There is a degree of randomness which stops players ganging up on other players&#10;     The game allows direct (war and espionage) and indirect competition (choosing cards which you know your opponent would like)&#10;     No one gets &quot;knocked out&quot; or falls so far behind as not to be able to win. Games are nearly always very close.&#10;     Every decision is interesting and important, you will nearly always want to play more than one of the cards in your hand and have to choose which very carefully&#10;     Choosing cards which interact with each other in positive ways is critical to victory, but the swapping of hands requires some careful forethought on what cards to play and when and also allows you to mess with your opponents by playing cards they want!&#10;     Each game is unique and you have to adapt to the cards you are given&#10;&#10;&#10;The core game focuses on the region around the Mediterranean sea and Carthage, the Celts, Greece, Rome, Persia and Egypt as playable civilisations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game that has the purpose of making visible and spreading the leading role that Latin American women have had in the construction of a different world, in the struggle to defend the rights of the oppressed peoples and classes.&#10;&#10;Transforming in each of its steps the history of the entire continent, breaking barriers, in no hurry to lose calm until patriarchy and capitalism fall.&#10;&#10;It is three games in one, or three modes to play with the same cards.&#10;&#10;The first mode &quot;Allies&quot;, each player must summon Allies to add more voices and defeat the Patriarchy.&#10;&#10;The deck of cards is taken and they will be revealed one at a time.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player can choose to take refuge with their Allies, or stay in the streets to gather more voices, but be careful, since the same deck can leave Violence cards, which will stop us in the fight for freedom.&#10;&#10;Violence cards include, Repression, Disappearance, Indifference, Capitalism, and Patriarchy. If one of these cards appears, we will be at risk, but we can continue fighting, if a second card appears, we will lose all the Allies that we had gathered that round.&#10;&#10;The second mode &quot;United&quot; is a very dynamic game in real time, where we will try to collect all the cards of the same fighter as quickly as possible, to get all the characteristics of each one, and to put an end to the disinformation of their stories. .&#10;&#10;We will have 7 different cards in our hands, and we will have to exchange cards with other players, with the only limitation that all the cards delivered must be from the same Fighter. The player who manages to collect the 7 cards of the same Fighter first, will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Finally, the third modality &quot;Abya Yala&quot;, is a cooperative game where we will try to reconstruct the story. For which we will have to put together a timeline ordering from smallest to largest the year in which the women who have fought to defend the rights of our peoples throughout the continent were born.&#10;&#10;But with a twist, since we will play with our cards upside down, so that we can only see the back of our cards, but we can see all the cards in hand of our partners.&#10;&#10;In turn, we will have to give clues to the other players about the cards in their hand, and thus be able, together, to put together the correct time lines.&#10;&#10;A lot of memory, a lot of commitment, in a beautifully illustrated game, with great quality components, which will help us become aware and build knowledge for the construction of a different, fairer and more inclusive society.&#10;&#10;",
