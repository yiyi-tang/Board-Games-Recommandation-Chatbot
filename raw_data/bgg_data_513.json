    "Description": "Several storm cells bear down on the town of Doomsville, Oklahoma (population 213). Each contains an F1 tornado that will grow in strength and carve its own path of destruction. Do what you have always wanted to...take control of one of nature's most dangerous forces: the tornado! Using your twister, destroy as much of the town of Doomsville and the surrounding countryside as you can - do a better job than the other players and win the game!&#10;&#10;To win, you will need to properly control the path of the tornado and manage its strength so that destroy high value buildings. Some buildings can only be destroyed by extremely strong F5 tornadoes, while others can be wiped out with only an F2. You will manage the strength and path using a pool of &quot;storm points&quot;. Each player starts with the same amount, but as you use them to plan your actions, the pools for each tornado will change accordingly.&#10;&#10;Doomsville rebuilds itself for each game; meaning that for each game there is a method for randomly building the town and the surrounding countryside. This makes each game play distinctly different and puts the tornadoes into a fight to get the higher value buildings before their opponents.&#10;&#10;So what are you waiting for...? Get to wiping Doomsville off the map!&#10;&#10;NOTE: This game was inspired a couple of months after a small twister (F0 probably) tore up some trees in my yard in July 2006 and discussing it with my son. Tornadoes are very dangerous and interesting facts and safety information about tornadoes will be included in the game.&#10;&#10;",

If you're &quot;flippin'&quot;, you can get right up next to a fish, but if you're casting, you have to stay a few spaces away and roll the die to see if you've caught it.  (Takes some initial strategy to make sure you have enough of the right jigs for the area you're planning to fish.)&#10;&#10;And those fish are crafty - you might lose a rod or a lure or pull in a mermaid or old tire instead of a fish.

When the subject of money is being discussed, they are right there like spounges soaking it up. I know because I was one of them, but my parents didn't take the time to teach me about money. Today lots of parents still don't teach their kids enough about money, and yet our kids will all deal with money most days in their lives and how early they begin to understand money, will directly influence their lifestyle. This game is for parents to encourage those little finance prodigies. The world is changing to where the cash in your hand is the crumbs from the table, while the banquet is inside the corporations. For Grade 5 and up, but best for teens and up.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Big Board&rdquo; is like a nickname for Wall Street, while &ldquo;Raiders&rdquo; are the teams of entrepreneurs, lawyers, accountants, brokers and investment bankers who engaged in hostile takeovers of the companies they pursue. In Big Board Raiders, players can gang-up by pooling their capital to promote a cause or stop another player, but alliances don&rsquo;t last forever and when they end, backstabbing is an inevitable strategy. Communication and deal making are very important enhancements to a player&rsquo;s game strategy. A few choice words can help your portfolio or have the opposite effect on your opponent&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s all about opportunities, timing and the hustle.&#10;&#10;There are two main objectives players engage in while playing Big Board Raiders; the first is to get elected by proxy as a director of a company and the second is to grow your portfolio using the many investment vehicles, so that you will have the capital to make your move to control your company; the company in which you were elected to the board by proxy. There are four trading companies: Yellow, Blue, Red, and Green. Six Subsidiaries, and each of these subsidiaries has a proxy vote that it gives to the players as they land on their subsidiary space on the game board. To win, grow your capital while collection the proxy votes to be elected as a director, then buy enough shares to take over control of that company.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is a parody of the Fleet Captain&rsquo;s Gold Hat Championship at Origins. The game reflects the final four rounds, although players could agree ahead of time to play all seven rounds (or any number of rounds). Each player draws opponents and plays various cards on themselves or the other players in an attempt to reach the gold hat before anyone else. The game is intended for 4-6 players and is extremely tongue-in-cheek, concentrating more on the humorous aspects of the game instead of the serious. It is not the intent of the designers or publishers to insult anyone but only to provide an entertaining distraction between four hour long tournament games.&#10;&#10;",

Players drew chips from a bag to determine which word on the host's card they had to spell correctly.  Paul Wing was an author and NBC staff director.  His show was originally heard only in the cities competing in each weekly broadcast, but the program did eventually (and briefly) gain full network status.  Cutting costs even in the 1930s, Milton Bradley's materials for this game were identical to the ones used in Vox Pop.&#10;&#10;The game was played by choosing a word caller, then going around the room and having people pull numbered disks out of a bag; the number on the disk determined the word you would spell (and some words were notably easier than others, so it was a bit of a game of chance). Correct moves got you a little green counter called a &quot;honey,&quot; and wrong moves got you a little red counter called a &quot;stinger&quot; (because it's a bee, get it?)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "PLEASE NOTE: This game description is out-of-date and needs to be updated.&#10;&#10;Sturm Europa! is a strategy game for one to five players that depicts World War 2 in Europe. Euro-style wooden pieces are used to depict resources, that depending on placement, represent air, land, and sea units. Each player has a privacy screen that creates &quot;fog of war&quot; by keeping resources and units not on the front line hidden.  Sturm Europa! will distinguish itself from other games of the genre in these key areas:&#10;&#10;Playability:  The entire war, Fall 1939 to the bitter end (Spring 1945 or later), can be played in 6-8 hours. No hexes, no counters, and low luck.&#10;&#10;Scale:  The map board employs area movement over land regions but the low unit density allows players to realize the full impact of mobile warfare and appreciate the daunting size of Mother Russia without slowing game play unnecessarily.  A unique front-reserve combat system allows for operational level details like blitzes, assaults, encirclements, feints, static defense, and defense in depth which are normally lost in grand-strategic simulations.&#10;&#10;Units:  Units are not only rated by movement, but attrition, assault, and blitz strength.  Elite units are created by combat experience, events, and tech research - introducing an extra dimension as units are upgraded and downgraded throughout the war, reflecting varying levels of experience, training, leadership, and technology.&#10;&#10;Production:  Sturm Europa! goes beyond the standard model of linking military production to a GDP estimate.  Nations must mobilize to achieve full wartime production but it takes much more to wage war than just massive production lines.  Manpower, oil, steel, and even trained pilots are all tracked without ANY bookkeeping through an innovative system of collecting resources as strategy cards are played.  Resources are consumed by prolonged offensives so logistics plays just as much a factor as unit strength.&#10;&#10;Strategy Cards:  Sturm Europa! is a card driven game (i.e. Paths of Glory). Events introduce historical and political events in a realistic fashion while eliminating scripting and &quot;look up&quot; rules.  There is a tangible cause-effect relationship to every event and nothing occurs in a seemingly random or ahistorical manner.  Players play the cards - the cards don't play the players.  Most importantly, the core mechanic of tough gut-wrenching decisions which make CDGs so fun is still preserved.&#10;&#10;Technology: Players can customize their units to fight the style of war that best suits their strategy. Germany can develop the He 100 long range fighter that greatly improves their chances in the Battle of Britain. The Americans can develop a heavy-medium tank instead of sending Shermans to get chewed up by King Tigers. Tough decisions will have to be made to implement new technologies though. New designs don't just start rolling off the assembly lines without causing a shortage of replacements on the front line while the factories retool and crews retrain...&#10;&#10;TENTATIVE COMPONENT LIST:&#10;(1) 867x668mm six-panel mounted map&#10;(4) storage boxes&#10;(4) player mats&#10;(500) stickered wooden blocks&#10;(150) 2&quot; double-sided strategy tiles&#10;(1) embroidered draw bag&#10;(84) intel and technology cards&#10;(150) 5/8&quot; punchboard counters&#10;(10) custom 6-sided dice&#10;(1) 16-page full-color rulebook&#10;&#10;Can be combined with Days of Infamy&#10;&#10;",

He sets out from Chang An, the cosmopolitan Chinese capital. Traveling across northern China and then to Central Asia, with a lucky roll of the die he will arrive at Samarkand, an important trading center. There, glass, fruit and horses may be purchased. At Merv, the traveler must decide whether to follow the overland or sea route. Going by sea, one has the opportunity to buy incense at the port of Hormoz, collect rubies, sapphires and pearls in the kingdom of Anuradhapura (now in Sri Lanka), visit the wondrous temples at Elephanta and Kancipuram and buy spices in Srivijaya (Sumatra). But beware! There are mighty perils on this route. On the overland route, the traveler visits magnificent Buddhist temples in India and beyond, encounter tigers in the jungles of Bengal and purchase luxuries such as kingfisher feathers and rhino horn at Angkor. The final leg of the journey passes through the the bustling port of Guangzhou (Canton) and then off to Japan and Korea where the traveler will be able to visit foreign temples and complete final trading before returning home by way of the Grand Canal.&#10;&#10;Each location includes a special paragraph of text describing what happens to the traveler there. Often they include special trading opportunities. Major trading centers have specific products which they sell and also another list which they want to purchase. Commodity holdings are shown by cards which list the differing values of these items at various locations. Includes short history and glossary of terms.&#10;&#10;",

Don't fall down there! First there is a thin chain that is laid around all players' pawns which are placed around that hole on the board. Each turn the player throws the die and moves as many fields to the outside as the die shows. When a rabbit reaches the chain it is pushed forward in an outside direction while opposite rabbits located in the opposite direction are pushed towards the hole and may fall into it when the thrown die shows enough eyes. The winner is the player who has at least one rabbit left at the end.   &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE CASE OF THE DEAD DUKE&#10;&#10;Sherlock Holmes has been called in to find out who killed Duke Richard. The Duke was unloved by all and found poisoned in his study. The players make up the clues Holmes finds. Clues point to who did it. Players try to pin the murder on one another. Someone has to be guilty.&#10;&#10;This is an Engle Matrix Game so players pick a character in the story to champion. Each turn they buy the right to make what action happens next (Like what clue Holmes finds...) Action are not automatic. They pick another player to be their referee. The ref sets the &quot;to happen&quot; roll. Other players may jump in with counter-arguments forcing big dice rolling contests. Bit by bit clues add up until one of he players is arrested. Since players never make up the same clues the game plays differently each time.&#10;&#10;The Case of the Dead Duke plays out like an episode of the TV show &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo;. First the players find clues then someone is put on trial.&#10;&#10;This is an intermediate level Matrix Game. It comes in a box with a 20x15 inch hard board map of London, character sheet booklet, rules booklet, scenario booklet, wooden counters, plastic gold coins and 2 dice.&#10;&#10;TYPE: Intermediate Engle Matrix Game&#10;PLAYERS: 2 to 10&#10;AGE: 12 to adult&#10;DURATION: 2 hours&#10;COMPLEXITY: Moderate&#10;REPLAYABILITY: High&#10;COST: $40.00&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;HP Lovecraft wrote about the reanimation of corpses when my Flapper Grandmother was doing the Charleston with the boy in the band (Grand Dad). In this intermediate level game you take Lovecraft&rsquo;s start and make your own story. First you find clues that reveal what is going on. Once the plot is outed you make a choice. Am I good or evil? Good guys try to stop plots, evil ones help them succeed. You never know whose side anyone is on till the end game.&#10;&#10;If you like Horror Board Games you&rsquo;ll love this game!&#10;&#10;July 2009&#10;&#10;Dead Man on Campus is an Engle Matrix Game that allows you to do real time story telling in a boardgame. Each player champions one of the characters at Miskatonic University in 1923. The game host reads an opening hook about how bodies have gone missing from the graveyard. At this point the players take over telling the tale. Each turn a player buys the right to make the next action in the game. They make up a short scene and pick another player to be their referee. The ref sets the &quot;to happen&quot; roll and the player rolls. It either happens and is written down by the players or doesn't. If players like they can buy the right to make a counter-argument to the first players action. A dice rolling contest settles what happens. As you see the rules are very simple but they allow a completely unique game every time.&#10;&#10;Players quickly learn how to play - it only takes a turn or two and then never need to look at the rules again. It does take creativity though. If you don't like making stuff up then this is not the game for you but if you do like quick paced back and forth creation then you'll love it.&#10;&#10;The boxed board game comes with a hard back board that is color and varnished but I must say that these are hand crafted by the game maker so this is more an art product than a slick made in China game. The game uses wooden counters with stickers but as you wish they can be replaced by metal figures. Cthulhu figures work great!&#10;&#10;",

Units are squad-sized, hexes represent about 100 meters across, and game turns are 60 to 120 seconds of real time.  Six small scenarios are provided.&#10;&#10;The rules are short and succinct, with no real surprises from the standard igo/ugo practice, with one exception ... players alternate, not in taking their full turns, but in initiating combat until all combat is completed, and then in moving until all eligible units have moved.  This tends to slow the game down somewhat, but the benefit is the ability of the players to respond to threats in a more timely manner.&#10;&#10;The components include four geomorphic map sheets, each 8.5&quot;x11&quot;; six pages of rules; and 166 uncut counters.  The production quality is low as the game, as well as the magazine in which it came (more on that in a moment) is photocopied.  Photocopied, remember, using 1977 technology.&#10;&#10;The magazine is Volume 1 Number 1, and therefore Issue 1, of Combat!, the International Magazine of Conflict Simulations.  It's published by Wellington Wargames, also known as Swedish Games Productions, the brainchild of Fredrik Malmberg, who is himself a bit of a prodigal.  He began his wargame producing career in earnest when he was 14 years old (see his design 'Fight for Tobruk!')  Only 200 copies of The Combat issue 1 were printed.&#10;&#10;",

The next throws are possible: 31 (lowest), 32, 41, 42, 43, 51, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, doubles 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66 and finally 21 (best throw). Whatever you say, the next player must throw a higher number than you said. You can bluff, and tell a smaller or a higher number. The next player must decide if he believes you or not. If you believe the number, you roll the dice again and gives a higher number. If you say that the player is bluffing, the bluffer must show the dice. If you're right loses the bluffer a banana. If the throw was right, you lose yourself a banana.&#10;When a player said 21, the next player decides if he believes the throw or not. Believing does mean not to look the dice and you lose 1 banana. Are you saying that the thrower is bluffing, then check out the dice. The loser pays 2 bananas.&#10;&#10;If during the game you shake the dice and you don&rsquo;t like the throw, you can shake you again. You may not look that throw and you must give it blind to the other player; and you must say a higher number.&#10;The player can also say &quot;more than enough&quot;. If the dice shows a higher number, you can call a low throw. So the next player has the chance to say a higher number without looking at the dice. The poker cup goes quickly around the table, but it could be a bluff.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who&rsquo;s left with one or more bananas.&#10;&#10;",

Features double sided board, double sided cards and auto-corrective tiles.&#10;&#10;This edition of Scrabble Junior has a two-sided board, one for English words and one for Spanish words. The rules play similarly to other editions of Scrabble Junior. The goal is to lay down letter tiles one at a time to complete words pre-printed on the board. Letter tiles are played twice per turn, and must be used from the beginning of each word and sequentially toward the end. All tiles are face up once held by a player. Kids learn the strategy of maximizing point values for themselves while preventing points for other players. They also learn its okay if other players do earn points because of the rules that a letter must be played if a space is available to play it on. Players use all the tiles available to cover all of the spaces on the board.&#10;&#10;",
