Players operate one of four plastic sliders that they may use to block the opening on their quarter of the circumference by sliding it back and forth, much like a hockey goalie.  As the turntable spins, the disk will bounce about the edges. Each player must prevent the disk from escaping through their opening by operating their slider.  Points are acquired for failing to block the disk from escaping, leading to player elimination.  Two plastic barriers are included to block player spaces that are either not being used or have been eliminated.&#10;&#10;",

In the course of the battle from March 28 to April 9, the American unit was completely surrounded by Japanese forces in the small 6 hut village (called &quot;Maggot Hill&quot; by the Americans). The vicious fighting under horrendous conditions ultimately produced nearly 400 casualties for each side.

    "Description": "The Future Art of War is a science fiction wargame, self-published by Leonard J. Meloche.&#10;&#10;The game map consists of 26 planets (one starting with each letter of the alphabet).&#10;&#10;Players start with one planet, and a small force of ships.  They occupy/conquer planets, collect and trade resources, build ships, supply their planets and attempt to discover Battleship technology.&#10;&#10;Players are eliminated when their home planet is conquered, and victory is achieved through the elimination of all other players.&#10;&#10;The Future Art of War includes a creative movement mechanic which adds to the &quot;fog of war&quot; effect.  Ships travel from planet to planet via &quot;hyperspace&quot;, and a chart indicates the number of turns (1-6) required to travel between each pair of planets. When a ship departs for a planet, the controlling player secretly writes the first letter of the planet and the number of turns required on the bottom of the ship counter, and places it on the first space in the hyperspace track.  Each turn, all ships in the hyperspace track move one space further down the track, and, when a ship has reached the appropriate space, the controlling player reveals the ship's destination.  Therefore, while players know how many ships their opponents have in hyperspace, they do not know the ships' destinations, or when they will arrive.&#10;&#10;The components of this game are quite good for a self-published game.  The map is poster-quality, and the cards, reference sheets, and money are comparable to many commercially published games.  The one component that clearly identifies the game as &quot;self-published&quot; is the ship counters, which are cut rectangles of flat plastic.  These, however, with a whiteboard marker, serve the &quot;hyperspace&quot; mechanic very well.  The game is packed in a large tube.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is played in rounds. In each round, a planet is picked. Players then try to conquer that planet by deploying the largest amount of troops. A conquered planet earns victory points. When Coruscant, the galaxies capital planet, is conquered, the game ends and the player with the highest victory point total wins.&#10;&#10;Troops are represented by cards; each card has one of six colors and a number from 1 to 5 on it. A set of cards of the same color can be deployed as the force trying to conquer a planet. The total sum of the numbers printed on these cards is the troop's strength. The strongest army wins the planet, earning 2 to 4 victory points for the player who deployed that army.&#10;&#10;Since the game is based on 2008's &quot;Clone Wars&quot; animated TV series, some characters from the series are featured as &quot;generals&quot;. For each color, there is a Jedi/Sith leader or general that can be earned during the game and then played to add a +3 troop bonus. Available leaders are Commander Cody, Yoda, General Grievous, Anakin Skywalker, Asaj Ventress and Obi-Wan Kenobi.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players rally new troops from the card deck to conquer the next planet.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is rather quick and simple, strategic options are limited, and some luck is involved in getting matching colored cards from the card deck.&#10;&#10;There is an alternate name for this game: &quot;Sith gegen Jedi&quot; (Sith vs. Jedi).&#10;&#10;",

Gavutu, Tanambogo and Gaomi are tiny islands off the coast of Tulagi. Between Gavutu and Tanambogo was 300 yard causeway constructed out of concrete and coral. These islands were to be taken in a small part of the main operation against Tulagi. Faulty intelligence had estimated that there were only a &quot;few dozen&quot; construction troops and snipers on these islands. The reality was more like 350 troops including SNLF dug into fortifications and caves.

NOTE THAT YOU MUST OWN A COPY OF &quot;B-29 SUPERFORTRESS&quot; TO PLAY &quot;HELL OVER KOREA.&quot;&#10;&#10;The time period covered in the Variant was chosen because it was the most dynamic period of the war for the B-29. Early missions (i.e., before November 1950) for the bomber met with little enemy opposition, with (relatively ineffective) raids against tactical targets.  North Korea&rsquo;s few strategic targets and industries were also quickly disposed of.  In November 1950, however, the Chinese Communists were in the war, and the B-29 began facing its first serious opposition with the introduction of large numbers of Soviet MiG-15 jet fighters.  It was now a real contest.&#10;&#10;",

For four hundred years the Sassanids battled first the Romans and then the Byzantines, until Arab armies fueled by the passion of Islam swept over both old foes.&#10;&#10;King of Kings is a new book supplement for the Series: Rome at War (Avalanche Press) family, using the same format as the many books we've published for the Series: Panzer Grenadier (Avalanche) or Series: Great War at Sea (Avalanche Press). It is not playable by itself; pieces and maps from Rome at War II: Fading Legions are required to enjoy all of its scenarios.&#10;&#10;But there are also new armies: Palmyra and Parthia fight both Persian and Roman enemies, and there are new units and leaders for Persia and Rome as well. All told there are 88 double-sized and 88 more merely large playing pieces (that's a full sheet and half of another); all of them scorchless, sootless laser-cut little works of art on our new tile-like material. There are also background articles and over a dozen new scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

I can assure them, it is much, much more important than that.&quot;  -  Bill Shankly&#10;&#10;In The League players take turns playing cards to attempt to build up an attack culminating in a shot on the opponent's goal or to foil that attack with a well placed tackle or save.  The two-player game pits the players head to head where the 4-player game has two players per team working as a partnership.  Each player starts with 7 cards, replacing cards played with cards from the deck and the game comes to an end after one run through the deck.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into attacking cards eg. Pass, Dribble, Shoot, defending cards eg. Tackle, Save, referee cards, eg. Offside, Penalty, and wonder cards, eg. Wonder Goal, Wonder Save.  The side with possession aims to build up a series of attacking cards leading to a shot thundering past the opponent's keeper, the defending side tries to get possession with a tackle or to get the keeper on the end of the shot with a save card.  Tackles have the risk of being countered by a referee dishing out a yellow or a red card or even a penalty which can only be saved by a Wonder Save.&#10;&#10;The game plays in under half an hour and makes for a good filler especially with football fans.&#10;&#10;",

A major component of the game is the large plastic shark into the mouth of which 4&quot; balloons are inserted.&#10;&#10;A plastic game mat lays out a path from the site of a shipwreck across several islands to the shore. The objective is to move your castaway towards the shore by the roll of the die.&#10;&#10;On the board are both red and white spaces. Each time the marker stops on a red space, the player is required to rotate the dorsal fin of the shark. As the shark's mouth closes, pressure is put on the balloon, eventually causing it to burst (two small pins inside the shark's mouth insure eventual destruction of the balloon). How much pressure is required is primarily dependent on the inflation level of the balloon.&#10;&#10;If the player causes the balloon to burst, he or she returns their castaway to the starting position and the shark is reset with a new balloon. The winner is the first player to successfully reach the shore.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Super Juegos&quot; was a pioneer Spanish magazine about both, board and computer games, which was published between 1984-1985. Every issue included a board game inside, with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&#10;&#10;Issue 5 included &quot;Acoso en Nicaragua&quot; which, despite its name (&quot;Pursuit in Nicaragua&quot;), it&acute;s not properly a wargame. The board is a squared one. Each player has a commandant and 36 soldiers (Americans and Sandinistas). Each turn, they move the commandant one square, then places a soldier counter (which can&acute;t never move) trying to immobilize the enemy leader. It&acute;s that simple.&#10;&#10;",

As with the previous version, the emphasis is on gaming entire battles of the black powder era.  While the emphasis of this edition is the Napoleonic period, rules are given for gaming the entire black powder era (approximately 1700-1890).&#10;&#10;Each stand represents from 1000-3000 men or 6-18 guns.  The scale is 1&quot; = 100 yards.&#10;&#10;Scenarios and orders of battle are included for:&#10;&#10;The Trebbia&#10;Marengo&#10;Austerlitz&#10;Auerstaedt&#10;Eylau&#10;Talavera&#10;Dennewitz&#10;Quatre Bras&#10;&#10;The important changes from the previous edition are:&#10;&#10;1) The Road to Glory is a system of creating realistic non-historical &quot;pickup&quot; games.  Players divide their starting force into multiple wings, then draw two deployment cards (include) and choose one.  Players deploy their wings in the order listed, and fight the battle to conclusion.&#10;&#10;2.  There have been significant changes to the skirmisher rules to better reflect the realities of combat between armies with poor and better skirmishing capabilities.&#10;&#10;3.  Linear infantry (typically pre- or early Napoleonic) has been strengthened relative to massed infantry and there are new rules for dispersed artillery (formerly called battalion guns).&#10;&#10;",

Rolls of 5 or 9 force you to give one of your opened gifts to the player on your right or left just like in stage 1. The roll of a 7,11 or double allows you to yell the word ZUNKER and then take a gift from anyone and place it in front of you. If you don't say ZUNKER you get to take nothing!  During this second stage you use the included timer which is set for 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes has expired the game is over and you keep whatever gift(s) that you have still in front of you.&#10;&#10;",

The game requires a print-and-play mapsheet, a standard deck of playing cards, and a six-sided die.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Historical Background (1519 - 1521): In the great Aztec city of Tenochtitlan Emperor Montezuma had reason to worry. It was the year of One Reed, when the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl would return to bring an end to Aztec civilization. A comet had been seen in the sky, a very bad omen.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Messengers arrived to tell Montezuma that powerful strangers had arrived at the coast. The strangers were Spaniards under the command of Hernan Cortes. Montezuma was paralyzed by indecision. Should he fight the newcomers or welcome them?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He would soon learn that the Spanish conquistadors were on a mission to conquer and loot the Aztec empire. They brought with them horses, powerful weapons, and deadly germs. Many of the local tribes saw the invaders as a chance to defeat their Aztec overlords and joined their army. Cortes and his men would destroy Tenochtitlan and the Aztec empire.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game ends once Cortes (controlled by the teacher) has conquered the Aztecs by destroying their armies or occupying their capital. Sample questions for classroom discussion are included.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;United States, 1864.  The civil war that both sides had expected to end swiftly has dragged into its third year.  The Union blockade of the South, the Anaconda Plan developed by General Winfield Scott and established in 1861, has finally started to take its toll on the Confederate military and its civilian population.  Southern logisticians estimate that with current supplies, the South will be forced to surrender due to inability to maintain its military and severe economic hardships in five months.&rdquo;&#10; &ldquo;Objective:  Be the first side to drive their opponent to the breaking point through a careful combination of naval strategy and army operations - force the surrender of the Confederacy by exhausting their war stocks (zero weeks remaining), or inflict an unacceptable additional 100,000 casualties on the Union (700,000 total), forcing the North to sue for peace.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Players of the same side sit side by side on one side of a table (or the floor), facing their opponents.  Each player along the line plays a regional military commander with one army regiment and one navy squadron assigned to his control.  Players can assume the identities of historic Union and Confederate generals and admirals, or simply be referred to as Commander 1, Commander 2, etc. down the lines.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This opposing line of players stretches from Virginia down the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coast to Texas and then up the Mississippi River Valley.  Any map of the eastern United States can be used, or an outline of the coast created with masking tape, but is not required for play.  Each commander has six cards; two navy, two army and two special cards.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;In multi-player games, players can only communicate by passing messages verbally to other commanders seated immediately beside them . . . Washington and Richmond can attempt to pass a grand strategy to the rest of the team at the beginning of a turn, but the word must be passed &lsquo;down the line.&rsquo;&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;It was during World War I that the airplane became an important weapon of war. At the start of the war the planes were unarmed and were used for scouting. Soon the pilots were taking weapons with them on their flights. These early efforts were crude, but Dutch inventor Anthony Fokker eventually succeeded in synchronizing a machine gun with an engine so the weapon could fire through the propeller. This led to the &lsquo;Fokker scourge&rsquo; as the Germans used the new invention to dominate the skies. The Allies soon followed suit and battled the Germans for control of the skies over no man's land. Successful &lsquo;aces&rsquo;, like the Red Baron, were lionized by the press and became living legends. By the end of the war the airplane's role in combat had expanded to include reconnaissance, artillery spotting, trench strafing, and bombing.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;A simple historical miniatures air combat game designed for classroom use in grades 6-8. The game may be played by eight players using 1/72 scale models on a Battle Masters mat (4x4 feet with five inch hexes).&#10;&#10;Each player uses an aircraft model (Allied or German) on a stand, a deck of maneuver cards, a laminated record card (for tracking damage and victories with a dry erase marker), and 5 six-sided dice. Each record card includes the name and picture of a World War One ace, his victory total, and brief biographical information.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;It is now spring of 1916.  Improvements in anti-aircraft artillery and airplane performance have begun to threaten the zeppelins&rsquo; invulnerability. While British arms manufacturers are busy developing incendiary and explosive ammunition (which would seal the fate of the flammable hydrogen filled zeppelins), the ammunition will not be widely available until the summer. The RAF 39 Squadron, flying the Bristol B.E.2c fighter and established to defend London from zeppelin raids, has just received word that a large formation of zeppelins is approaching the city!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;A simple historical miniatures air combat game designed for classroom use. The game is played by two teams representing the British and German forces. The British players have twenty Bristol fighters divided into five divisions and the German players have twelve airships divided into three divisions. The British players attempt to shoot down as many zeppelins as possible before the airships can move off the end of the board or time runs out.&#10;&#10;Designed to be played using models, or print-and-play paper aircraft, on a 7.5x5 foot hex mat with three inch hexes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A classroom game based on the Battle of Britain. Combat is resolved by drawing cards from a standard card deck. Other components required for play are German and British Flight Rosters, a Battle Board, the Reinforcements schedule, and the Combat Resolution Tables.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Divide the class into two groups - the RAF (Britain) and Luftwaffe (Germany). Each team must have an air marshal. Air marshals will be in charge of allocating resources and aircraft to targets, and filling in the flight roster. The remaining students will be pilots (German fighter or bomber pilots, British fighter pilots). If necessary, divide the students in small groups and call them &lsquo;wings.&rsquo; The German players start with 10 bombers and 10 fighters. The British players start with 6 fighters. This information should be put on the flight rosters.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The Battle Board should be drawn on the chalkboard, or someplace else where all the students can see it. On the Battle Board write the three targets: air bases, radar, and London. This is where each turn you will write down the number and type of planes sent by each side to attack or defend each target.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Objective: Germany must either destroy London OR both the air bases AND radar. The British win by destroying 15 German planes or preventing the Germans from winning. The battle will last 5 turns or until one side wins a victory.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",
