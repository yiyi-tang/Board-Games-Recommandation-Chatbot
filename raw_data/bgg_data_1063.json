    "Description": "Mosaic is a two-player board game like Go and Othello. However, what differs from Go and Othello is that it is a 3D game that extends the position not only in the plane but also in the vertical direction. You can solidify your footsteps first, expand the territory, or hold down the upper floors early to divide the opponent's piece or develop a complex bargain. And from the middle to the end of the game, the pieces of each other pile up at once, and a dynamic reversal play occurs. Once you play it, you should be able to understand the benefits.&#10;&#10;The game board has 7 x 7 = 49 holes, and a neutral piece is fixed at the center from the beginning.&#10;&#10;Two players each have 70 pieces. The game is as follows.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Starting with the first player, place your pieces one by one in the empty hole of the game board.&#10;     If four pieces are lined up in the smallest square shape adjacent to each other, pieces can be placed on them.&#10;     If four frames are arranged in a square, and three or four of the four are occupied by the same color, the frame of that color is automatically placed on it (apart from the turn).&#10;     The piece fixed from the beginning to the center of the game board becomes a neutral piece which is not that of either player. When a square containing neutral frames is created, frames are automatically placed on top of the square only if the remaining three frames have the same color.&#10;     Automatically placed pieces will create new squares, and if 3 or 4 of the squares are occupied with the same color, pieces will be placed automatically as well. In this way, pieces are stacked in a chain reaction. The pieces to be stacked may not only be the pieces of the active player, but also the pieces of the opposing player.&#10;     In this way, the person who put the piece in turn alternately and who finished all his pieces first wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;The fun of the game called mosaic is in the rule that &quot;pieces are stacked in a chain reaction by putting one piece&quot;. From the middle of the game, development accelerates at a stretch, and the situation changes rapidly. In the early stage, even if you allow the opponent to lead, I think that the feeling when the development of one-shot reversal at the last moment is reached is unique to mosaics.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Mosaic is identical to Margalith Akavya's Upper Hand, but with the action taking place on a larger initial playing area.&#10;&#10;--user summary&#10;&#10;&#10;Laplace is a two-player abstract strategy game in which your goal is to play all of your pieces before the opponent can.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 7x7 grid, and the players each have pieces of a different color. A piece of a third color is placed in the central square on the game board. On a turn, a player places one of their pieces into an empty space on the grid. If a player creates a square of four pieces and at least three of those pieces belong to that same player, then the player immediately places another piece on top of those four pieces; if the placement of that piece also creates a square meeting the same condition, then they place a piece on top of that square.&#10;&#10;Thus, as more pieces are placed, they collectively form a pyramid, with the bottom layer being 7x7, then the next layer 6x6, and so on. Whoever places their final piece first wins!&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Laplace is identical to Margalith Akavya's Upper Hand., but with the action taking place on a larger initial playing area.&#10;&#10;",

Its good location, the large gardens that surrounded it and its proximity to the Wax Museum were the incentives for a good number of people to decide to open their business there.&#10;&#10;Its many shops, crossed between generations, filled the area with life and color. Unfortunately, this situation would not last forever. The mysterious disappearances began to happen in the neighborhood, night after night. With them, businesses lost their customers.&#10;&#10;The result? The wonderful street turned into a dark and gloomy space. The only one who seemed to dare cross it was an old journalist, moved by his curiosity. He knew that a murderer was on the loose, but how to find him? In these cases, a saleswoman in a clothing store seems as suspicious as a vagabond ...&#10;&#10;After an intense investigation, he found the answer. He hurried to call the neighbors to communicate their suspicions, but when they arrived at the newsroom, the situation they found could not be much worse: the journalist had disappeared and, with him, any evidence.&#10;&#10;Inside the Strange Case of Morgue Street, we found a brochure entitled 'Rules of the Game'. However, it only narrated the setting and listed the components.&#10;&#10;Cefa proposed us to initiate an investigation. A group of young people would enter the mysterious street, ready to find the identity of the murderer.&#10;&#10;One of the owners of the inhabitants of the neighborhood would be marked as a murderer. The way and the way to discover it are the rules that you have to invent.

Surviving the challenge entails getting us one of the coveted chronicle letters. The six epochs are: Prehistory, Ancient Age, Middle Ages, Modern Age, Contemporary and Future Age.&#10;&#10;The board is divided into its central part by 6 seasons that can be skipped if you have the right passport, simply moving the vintage sheet so that they end up configuring a completely new board suitable for the time in which it is played.&#10;&#10;Around these moving sheets are the squares by which players will move to get the coveted passports with which to jump to the time whose chronicle letters need, or simply to face the challenges that the current era proposes.&#10;&#10;When changing the era, we will move the moving parts of the center of the board so that it changes along with the elements common to the era.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;El T&uacute;nel del Tiempo es un juego de mesa para 2 a 4 jugadores cuyo fin es el de reunir 3 grupos de cr&oacute;nicas hist&oacute;ricas independientemente de la &eacute;poca a la que pertenezcan.

Two players each set up 52 different circular paper markers representing different military units and officers. Different types of units can move and fire in different patterns around them. Each turn a player can move or attack with up to five units and five officers.&#10;&#10;Combat is deterministic based on the combat power of different units in close combat or when firing at enemy units at a distance. If one side is strong enough in a battle an attacked unit can be either eliminated or captured. If an attack is not strong enough the difference in combat power is recorded, per unit type, so that the next battle against a unit of the same time becomes easier. The remaining strength of individual units are not tracked, only an abstract counter per type of unit.&#10;&#10;Units in a player's capital city, located at two opposite sides of the board, can be covered and moved without revealing its type to the other player, providing some fog of war and introducing some uncertainty into the otherwise deterministic combats. Each player is allowed to have 10 covered units or officers.&#10;&#10;A player wins by eliminating the highest ranked officer of the other player, the king.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summmary&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, they don't have the best organizational skills and a lot of random junk is mixed in with their super hero gear. But there's no time to make excuses or search for the perfect gear. All they can do is use the first thing they grab to save the day.&#10;&#10;The Ultimate Adventures of The ULTIMATE ALLIANCE, is a fun, semi-co-operative card game for 3+ players. Where each player takes on the role of a Super Hero in an attempt to save the town from the latest threat. Each round the &quot;Mayor&quot; or judge creates a villain by drawing a Villain card, and then powers them up with 2 &quot;Bad-er&quot; cards (enhancement cards that make the bad guy bad-er), and a location card to set the scene.&#10;&#10;Players then each receive a gear card, some helpful some not, and must come up with a plan to defeat the villain. Each player then pitches their idea to the Mayor, who picks which hero to hire based off of their plans. The winning hero receives points based off of the threat level of the Bad-er cards (1-3). Heroes also have the option of teaming up with other players and their gear to win and split the points, or push their luck and go solo and claim them all for themselves. The Mayor role then rotates each round.&#10;&#10;The game ends at a preset point limit, decided before the game starts. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Based off of the characters and world of The ULTIMATE ALLIANCE comic books by JH Comics. The game doesn't require any knowledge of the characters to play, but will provide some recognizable gear, bad guys and locations to fans of the comic.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Clubhouse Defense Squad is a deck building, tower defense and strategy game all mashed up into one.&#10;&#10;Place randomized Gates in each of the 8 areas surrounding the Clubhouse as the first line of defense. These each also have a different game changing effect. Place 6 Bad Guys around the outside of the board, letting the D8 decide the fate of which Gate they will be attacking.&#10;&#10;Collect your allowance, buy new Arsenal or Equipment cards and then dive into the fight. Each player has their own number of Actions per turn. Your hand allows you to add damage to attacks, gain extra actions and much more.&#10;&#10;When your turn ends, the Bad Guys assault begins.

The counter art also has a hand-drawn appearance. The counters are printed on colored stock and need to be cut out. The rules are simply bound by a stapled corner. The combat results table card has a mix of typewritten and handwritten info.

    "Description": "Free game published in the February 2018 (GTM #216) issue of Game Trade Magazine.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Professor Elemental Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.&#10;&#10;Background: &#10;You and your friends are attending a &#10;series of parties, where you want to be seen with the &#10;fanciest people. &ldquo;Fancy&rdquo; was designed with the Professor &#10;Elemental Pairs Deck, but is compatible with them all.&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10; A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.&#10;&#10;Summary: &#10;The game is played in several rounds. &#10;Each is composed of eight tricks, or &ldquo;parties.&rdquo; The &#10;role of dealer passes to the left after each round. &#10;A full game is one round for each dealer.&#10;&#10;Each Round: &#10;Shuffle and deal a hand of eight cards &#10;to each player. Players look at their hands, and then &#10;pass two cards&#10; to the player on their left. The player &#10;on the dealer&rsquo;s left will lead the first trick.&#10;&#10;Each Trick: &#10;Each trick is a party. To score points, &#10;you can try to be the fanciest person, or to be seen &#10;with someone much fancier than yourself.&#10;&#10;Starting with the leader and proceeding to the left, &#10;each player plays one card face up. The card you play &#10;represents a party guest.&#10;&#10;Important Rule: &#10;A guest can&rsquo;t appear twice at the same party. You may play a duplicate of a card that was already played, but it will be discarded, scoring no points.&#10;&#10;Scoring the Trick: &#10;After each player has played (or discarded) a card, the trick is scored as follows:&#10;&#10;The Center of Attention:&#10; The lowest card played is the most fabulous in the room. This card scores its face value for the player who played &#10;it. This player will also lead the next trick.&#10;&#10;The Hangers-On: &#10;All other cards score points equal to the difference between themselves and &#10;the next-lowest card. For example, if the cards are 3-4-6-10, they score 3, 1, 2, and 4 points.&#10;&#10;Discards: &#10;Copies of earlier cards are discarded. These score zero points.&#10;&#10;After scoring, discard all the cards from this trick and play another, starting with the player who just played the lowest card. A full round is eight tricks, and a full game is one round for each player.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;The game ends after each player has dealt one round.  Then, the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player has 3 special cards that are character specific: one for attack, one for defense and one for movement. That makes for a total deck of 23 cards per player. Each player chooses three cards for the turn.&#10;&#10;2nd Players roll for initiative, to determine who will conduct his actions first for this turn.

    "Description": "Suckerfish Investing Game is a fun and educational tabletop game that teaches players the important life principles of value investing!&#10;&#10;The theme of this game is to not only survive but thrive within the deep sea of investing! This game is named after the smart and cunning &ldquo;suckerfish&rdquo; (aka a Remora) that swims alongside sharks and whales in the deep ocean. These fish are not scared of the sharks and the sharks are not bothered by the fish.&#10;&#10;They thrive together. The sharks catch big fish and the Remora eat up all the scraps! Then the Remora suction-cup their heads to the sharks (which remove any barnacles from the shark) in order to catch a free ride on the shark as it swims through the vast ocean.&#10;&#10;These suckerfish have a pretty good deal!&#10;&#10;In Suckerfish Investing players will follow alongside a whale and a shark as they rise and fall (in price) throughout the deep sea of investing! Players will learn the mental side of investing, such as buying low, selling high and collecting dividends. Likewise, players will learn the emotional side of investing, such as not freaking out, being patient and investing for the long term.&#10;&#10;In this game, players will start with $5,000 each and then receive an additional $2,000 contribution every couple of months. Each player will receive the same amount throughout the game, and it is their job to invest it wisely to WIN!&#10;&#10;This game consists of a deck of 44 playing cards, 8 player cards, and 2 company cards. Each company card has 26 tiles that represent units of stock, and each company has an electronic tally counter (2 total) that keep track of the price of each company as it moves. Each card (labeled NEXT MONTH) represents 1 month of time and the entire deck represents an investing journey of over 3 years!&#10;&#10;Once the game is setup and all players are ready, the game begins and players may buy Fast Growth or Blue Chip in increments of 100 shares. Players do not have &ldquo;turns&rdquo; in this game, rather, they can buy and or sell at any time and must help each other to double-check the math and accounting.&#10;&#10;When all players are ready, one player can flip the NEXT MONTH card on the top of the deck and follow its instructions to either:&#10;Update the numbers on the electronic tally counters by pressing the red or green buttons&#10;Distribute contributions to the player whose color matches the color on the card&#10;Pay dividends to all players who own the dividend paying company&#10;All players pay taxes when these cards arise&#10;&#10;Throughout this game, players have to keep track of two moving stock prices while deciding whether to buy, sell, hold or wait, and this game is an emotional rollercoaster ride of investing!&#10;&#10;Players will continue this throughout the entire deck of cards. When the last card is played, the player with the highest score WINS!  (Fast Growth + Blue Chip + Cash = Total Score)&#10;&#10;This game teaches players:&#10;1. Multiplication, addition, and subtraction&#10;2. Accounting of money and stock units&#10;3. Investing principle - buy low and sell high&#10;4. Investing principle - collect and reinvest dividends &#10;5. Emotional intelligence - don&rsquo;t let your emotions lead you to bad investing such as buying when the price goes up and then watching it go down, rather than watching it go down and then buying! &#10;6. Advanced strategy - keeping track of the spread and standard deviation between the two companies to take advantage (buy and sell) of opportunities in price swing  &#10;7. Advanced strategy - recognizing the patterns and building an investment strategy to take advantage of these growth and dividend payments patterns&#10;&#10;About the Two Companies:&#10;&#10;Fast Growth - a fast-growing company whose price is up and down and all over the place. You can make a lot of money with Fast Growth if you buy it at the right time. Buy low and sell high!  *Fast Growth does not pay dividends.&#10;&#10;Blue Chip ETF - a whole bunch of individual companies rolled into one &ldquo;exchange-traded fund&rdquo; or ETF. This stock will grow a bit slower than Fast Growth, but it pays big dividends!&#10;&#10;Each player may buy or sell either Fast Growth or Blue Chip in increments of 100 with a limit of 500 per month. The player with the highest score at the end of the card deck is the WINNER!&#10;&#10;&ldquo;I created this game because I truly wish I had this game when growing up. I didn&rsquo;t learn about this basic investing stuff until my 30&rsquo;s and I definitely wasn&rsquo;t able to cram 3 years of investing experience into 30 minutes! I believe this game can help educate and inspire a generation to become financially free!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Josh Vojtisek&#10;Game creator&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This German card deck produced in 1944 was aimed at hammering home the importance of every German in saving energy to support the war effort. The 33-card deck includes lavish colour illustrations of the many vital uses of coal during WWII, especially in producing coal gas and plastics vital for the military.&#10;&#10;While it is labelled as a &quot;Quartett&quot; game (Happy Families variant), it is designed to allow play of Schwarzer Peter (Old Maid variant) as well. For the former, 32 cards are divided into eight sets of four, and the player who collects the most sets wins. For the latter, the 33rd Kohlenklau card is added, and each set of four is divided into two pairs, one with red dots and the other with black dots. Players try to collect pairs while avoiding being stuck with the Kohlenklau card at the end of play.&#10;&#10;The eight themes illustrated are: Coal for Fighting; Coal Plastics; Coal Extraction; Coal Processing; Coal Burning; Coal in Industry; Coal Conversion; and &quot;Wonders from Coal&quot;, other uses including medicines, propellants, dyes, candles and soap.&#10;&#10;The game includes a calendar card showing the date 1944, with days of the week and dates correct for that year.&#10;&#10;",

Players are trying to find matching pairs of homonyms by reading texts on the backs of the cards. The title Doppel-Gengo means 'double words' but is a pun on doppelganger.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are 50 word cards, making 25 pairs of homonyms. On each card face is a picture and a word in Japanese, along with a guide to its proninciation. The deck is shuffled and the cards spread out face-down.&#10;&#10;On each card back is a short piece of text explaining the meaning of the word hidden on the card's face. Players read the texts, try to discern the hidden words, and then identify matching homonyms to claim pairs.&#10;&#10;The game is very language dependent and cannot be played without knowing a good range of common Japanese words.

    "Description": "Battle for the Ball is an original two-player sports board game simulating a soccer or international football match.  Playing on an 11&times;16 hex map of a classic football pitch, two teams with 10 player pieces on each side compete to control the ball, pass to forward players, tackle to control the ball, and advance to a position to make a goal.&#10;&#10;The game uses dice, player pieces, and cards to control the action. There are no springs or finger-flicking in this game; the rules, based on the 17 laws of soccer, the map, the cards and dice rolls determine success on the field and glory in the stands.  Each player side has two key phases: the initiative phase in which the side with a high die roll spends momentum points to move, pass, tackle, and score; and a teamwork phase in which the whole team moves, enabling the game to reproduce the flow and movement of the Beautiful Game.  Special cards may give special opportunities: a burst of speed or a cannonball kick; the hand of fate or owner interference... Ready your formation, lead your players to victory, and battle for the ball!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Court is a trick taking game with a twist. If you like classic trick taking games like Spades, Euchre or Hearts, you will love the extra strategy in Court which includes special card powers, varying objectives and set collection.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of cards, they take turns playing a card into the &quot;trick&quot; like traditional trick taking games highest card played wins the trick and a crown worth -2 points at the end of the game but in Court the lowest card played in the trick gets to trigger its card power. Winning tricks is powerful but sometimes you want to come in last to trigger that special power just at the right moment to swing the game. You have to watch out for the powerful character cards though, when played they not only win the trick but also get to use their power.&#10;&#10;After a trick is completed the winner gets to distribute the cards played to the &quot;Court&quot; in front of each player, the court serves two purposes, first the cards in each players court at the end of the hand is the players score for the round. Second after scoring each player picks up the cards in their court and that is their hand for the next round.&#10;&#10;There is also random special objectives in play rewarding players with negative points for getting specific card combinations in their court.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 3 rounds. At the end of three rounds the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn both Pitcher and Batter will compare their ratings factoring in any special abilities and roll off to see who will get control of the at bat. This is called the &ldquo;On Deck Phase&rdquo;. Whoever rolls higher factoring in all special abilities will try to maintain control by rolling their custom Pitcher or Batter die. If they maintain control they will then roll dice and compare the result with their respective key to find out the results of the at bat. Players can also decide to play Rally Cards which could also affect the outcome of the play.&#10; Whether you&rsquo;re a fan of baseball, board games, or both you&rsquo;re going to love the feel and excitement of reliving the good old days in RB8 Retro Baseball!&#10;&#10;Will you have what it takes to manage your team to victory?&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Annual 2016 Issue&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1861 the American Railroad Journal predicted that the majority of the railroads would be unaffected by the Civil War, a mistaken prophecy, indeed.&#10;&#10;Confederate Rails, designed by Richard H. Berg, is a unique type of railroad game. Players operate the historical railways of the Confederate States of America during one of the &quot;hottest wars&quot; of the 19th Century &ndash; the American Civil War - which ends up turning it into a kind of an &quot;anti-railroad&quot; game. Not only do players have to deliver goods, supplies and military loads during a difficult time, but they have to adjust to a dwindling rail network.&#10;&#10;Yes, paradoxically each player's rolling stock and rail net are at their absolute finest on the first turn. From there on in the players (representing the South's various railroad companies) battle Union military advances, each other, Confederate government decrees (and neglects), the rapidly inflating and worthless money, plus wear and tear on irreplaceable equipment.&#10;&#10;The system also contains far more &ldquo;outside events&rdquo; than most rail games... thanks to the war. As the tagline on the cover suggests, it becomes an increasingly against the odds situation to stave off hunger and defeat among the South's armies.&#10;&#10;Maps - One full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;Counters - 280 full color die-cut counters&#10;Cards - 24 full color cards&#10;Rules length - Around 12 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2&#10;Complexity - Low&#10;How challenging is it solitaire? - Poor&#10;Playing time - Up to 3 to 4 hours for each game&#10;&#10;Designer - Richard Berg&#10;Development - Lembit Tohver&#10;Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher website&#10;&#10;",

I designed 20 cards with famous artwork and added some bad art and a set of forgery cards. Money cards are also included for players to make bids.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Players begin by getting three Forgery Cards and then choosing one each. The chosen Forgery Cards are set aside until the end of the game. Each Forgery Card matches each of the Art Cards.&#10;&#10;Eight Art Cards are then chosen randomly and players look at all of them before the game begins so that a strategy can be considered. The eight Art Cards are then shuffled and put into a pile called the Catalog. Each player then gets ten Money Cards.&#10;&#10;Play is done in rounds. For each round, the top Art Card from the Catalog is revealed and players make an initial bid. Players can then increase their bids until a winner for the round is determined. Special Cards can also be played during the round. Rounds continue until each Art Card is revealed and bid upon.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game is to win high priced artworks without running out of money or taking in a forgery.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the Forgery Cards are revealed and their matching Art Cards are eliminated. Players then count up the values of the Art Cards they possess. The player with the highest value of art is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to bring them to the chambers. But each kind of animal only brings victory points if they are in a chamber with just their kind.&#10;&#10;Each time a chamber is revealed to the building market two animal tiles are drawn and placed on that chamber. There are 6 different animal kinds in the game, each awarding points at the end, but only if it is kept in a chamber which only has his kind on it. In order to move the animals to the desired chambers a player has the option to play a money card at the end of their turn, moving an animal one space (from building to building) for each value on the card plaid.&#10;&#10;The player who organizes their animals most cleverly will earn additional victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Contents: 18 animal chips&#10;&#10;Buildings of Power:&#10;The Towers in the game are replaced with new ones, each having a special ability:&#10;&#10;Blueprint - The player rolls a die and draws that many building tiles, choosing one to keep. The others are returned to the draw tower in the order the player chooses. The building tile the player kept can be placed on the building market at the start of any player's turns, replacing any already on the tableau. The exchanged tile is placed back in the draw tower.&#10;&#10;Loan - The player rolls a die and draws that many money cards from the draw pile, choosing one of them to keep. The others are returned to the top of the draw pile in the order the player chooses.&#10;&#10;Discount - The player rolls a die and places it on the tower. Every time the player purchases his first building in the round, he can choose to decrease the value on the die by one to decrease the purchase prize by one.&#10;&#10;Pinnacle - The player rolls a die and places it on the tower. When scoring walls that number is added to the shortest external wall. This can propel the smaller wall to be the biggest and therefore score more points for the player.&#10;&#10;Contents: 11 alternate tower tiles, 4 white dice, 32 black dice, and 1 purple die&#10;&#10;Travelling Craftsmen:&#10;The Craftsman came from the far away&mdash;Carcasonne to Andalusia&mdash;to help build the Alhambra.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player will receive one traveling craftsman which can be used for their ability on a future turn. Once used, the craftsman travels to the next player in clockwise position who then can use him. The craftsman have various abilities that can give a player bonuses on their turns. Following are some of the abilities:&#10;&#10;Switch - Before buying a building tile the player may swap two buildings on the building market.&#10;&#10;Change - The player may exchange an money card in his hand with one from the display.&#10;&#10;Direction - A player may build a building in their Alhambra, rotating it in any direction desired.&#10;&#10;Contents: 6 craftsmen cards&#10;&#10;",

With these dice the player forms a result by adding and/or subtracting each die to the result.&#10;&#10;When the result corresponds to a building number in his Alhambra, he can place a helper with the victory point side up on that building. Only one helper is allowed per building. With each scoring the player gets as many victory points as the biggest area of orthogonal adjacent helpers in his Alhambra. The helpers stay till the end of the game.&#10;&#10;When the result matches a building number on the building market the player places a helper next to one of the 4 building spaces with the +1/-1 side up. Next time the player wants to buy a building from that space he can adjust the purchase price by +1 or -1 to make it easier to match the exact price. Once he buys a building of that space he returns his helper to his supply.&#10;&#10;Use your helpers to get the most points during scoring while also making it easier to get your desired buildings from the building market.&#10;&#10;Contents: 48 handymen tokens and 3 dice&#10;&#10;Gates Without End by Michael Rieneck:&#10;&#10;The expansion will feature hexagonal tiles, with six bonuses, one on each corner of the hexagon.

When a player buys the arcade, they take the bonus tile as well. Then, they orient the tile such that one bonus points at themselves.

With the Fresh Color expansion players decorate their buildings with ornaments, mosaics and fresh colors to gain even more victory points for their buildings during scoring.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player gets a decoration board that holds the decorations for each of the 6 building types. Additionally a common task board is placed next to the building market. On it the different decoration tiles are placed.&#10;&#10;Every time a player overpays for a building he can either claim a decoration tile from the board and place it on their decoration board, or get colors. Which colors the player gets is determined by the board and with what money type he paid.&#10;&#10;Each decoration tile shows what kind and how much of certain colors is needed in order to build it. Once a player has all the colors needed for one of his decorations he can, as an alternate action in his turn, build it. Each finished decoration awards 2 extra victory points for each corresponding building in the players Alhambra.&#10;&#10;Contents: 6 player task boards, 1 common task board, 18 task tiles, and 36 color tokens&#10;&#10;",

The board is separated into 4 areas each housing 3 randomly drawn extensions for the buildings.&#10;&#10;The new action players can take is to go and build those extensions to increase the value of their already build buildings in their Alhambra. Each extension is individual to one building. In order to buy an extension from one of the areas of the new board the player has to pay with money cards depicted above each area. The value of the money card is hereby irrelevant, only the colors have to match. Once purchased the extension is placed on a corresponding building on the Alhambra. Each building can only hold one extension. During scoring each building with an extension counts as two buildings of that kind.&#10;&#10;The extensions alter the game play and strategy greatly and make for a whole new experience while playing Alhambra.&#10;&#10;Contents: 12 extension tiles and 1 extension board&#10;&#10;The New Building Ground, a brand new expansion by Dirk Henn, players are given more choices to build the building they most desire through the construction sites.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game 8 construction site tiles are mixed in with the rest of the buildings. They only show a number and the construction symbol. If one of these tiles shows up at the building market, players can buy it with the corresponding money as normal. But instead of placing the construction site in their Alhambra they can choose a building from a display of buildings that is set-up at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The display has 4 columns each holding 3 randomly drawn buildings. From which column the player can choose, depends on the value shown on the construction site purchased. Each column is dedicated to one of the values. This gives the player more freedom and maybe give you that one building you need to win at a scoring.&#10;&#10;Contents: 8 building ground tiles, 12 construction tiles, and 4 number chips&#10;&#10;",

Technologies such as tanks and combat airplanes razed the european landscape while chemical weapons were unleashed upon the youth that was fighting for their countries. In October 1918, the forces of the alliance and the entente reached a stalemate at the Argonne Forest, when a mysterious mist appeared. A whole american battalion immediately disappeared, it expanded across the Argonne line and consumed most of the american offensive. Attempts to explore the mist, dubbed the Miasma in search for survivors failed and rescuers either disappeared or were driven insane by what they witnessed within. In response to this, an international secret agency known as the Phalanx initiative was formed, with the purpose to assess the threat of Miasma and contain it before it consumes all of the Wounded Earth.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You jump in your T-top and head down to Record Town!&#10;&#10;Vinyl is a game where players are aspiring vinyl collectors. They have some knowledge of what they would like to collect, but immediately get immersed in the experience. Players will acquire morsels of information after visiting the &ldquo;Mag Rack&rdquo;. That information will lead them to the bins where they select albums to add and expand their collection. Albums can be played at the listening booth to increase the value of a player&rsquo;s collection and their ability to collect even more albums. Unfortunately, the inventory is limited and other customers may be targeting the same vinyl gems. After the final round is concluded, players will tally their collection&rsquo;s value and determine who is the Elite Collector of Vinyl!&#10;&#10;How does it differ from other Vinyl Editions?&#10;&#10;In Totally Awesome 80s, we have opened up the Trade Counter. You will now be able to trade unwanted or low-value records in to gain attributes that you may use in later turns.&#10;&#10;Collection rewards have been reduced to max out 4. The lower end will now be 2 albums in a small collection and this will increase the number of records that a player may retire during the game. In addition, the Extended Play format and the Long Play format have been added as attributes and these albums can provide a bonus to your collections for end-game scoring. There is still more, however.&#10;&#10;We have also added 12 new Loyalty Cards which will help to bolster your end-game scoring even further. Taking all of this into account, over 150 new components added to the game!&#10;&#10;We will also introduce gameplay with 5 Genres in play instead of 4. This will give players a different style of game in this expansion. There are 6 Genres added so that players can choose which 5 Genres they would like to play with.&#10;&#10;- 6 New Genres:  Dance, Hip-Hop, New Wave, Glam Rock, R&amp;B, Reggae&#10;&#10;",

The western league is on the rise &amp; this contest could help put it on the map among HOCKEY's elite. However! In the same building: The Stock Show &amp; Rodeo is preparing to open AND the BULLS have all escaped in chaos &amp; are stampeding the rink. Manage your team &amp; crew to profit from this unique situation. The puck must drop, so there will be a winner-- but today there might be BULLS.&#10;&#10;GOAL: Have the most $$ after 3 periods of hockey&#10;&#10;Players compete on several fronts to put some $$ on the scoreboard by a variety of mechanisms:&#10;&#10;AREA CONTROL: Use barricades to control the four quadrants of the hockey rink in order to manipulate the routing of BULLS.&#10;&#10;ROLL &amp; MOVE: Each quadrant is subdivided into 16 sectors where actions may be selected by the end location of the erratic &amp; rapid transit of the PUCK token. The PUCK moves according to hockey actions, it can be moved by TIME CARDS &amp; PLAYER CARDS and it can travel by a strict P1/P2 roll &amp; move procedure.&#10;&#10;SIMULATION: Players compete in statistically realistic head-to-head hockey combat based in an abstracted dice &amp; block war-game system. The puck-shaped timer cards provide situational responses as well acting as the &quot;clock&quot; for each period of hockey. Once the deck is depleted, the buzzer sounds.&#10;&#10;STOCK HOLDING: Each barricade &amp; player card are shares of the team &amp; league value indexes represented by a 2-Axis 'tug of war' pawn index tracking the scaled value of each team's contribution to the night &amp; establishing current market prices for removing bulls &amp; scoring goals. The index is driven by the categorical accumulation of player actions. Judicious buy/sell strategies may be required.&#10;&#10;HAND MANAGEMENT: Players must manage the multi-purpose TIMER CARDS &amp; HOCKEY PLAYER CARDS for more effective operations in each phase of play, as well as more control over deterministic mechanisms within the game.&#10;&#10;CAN ALSO BE PLAYED SOLO VS. THE AUTOMATED CONSOLE&#10;NOTE: This speculative scenario is statistically &amp; historically plausible &amp; reflects accurately a confluence of scheduling in Denver, CO, January 1972.&#10;&#10;",

Make your enemies your friends and your friends your enemies as you jostle to be the first one served! What could be more fun than actually waiting in line? Playing a game about waiting in line!&#10;&#10;Out of Line: Food Trucks is a take-that party game for 2-6 players that plays in 15-20 minutes. To start, set-up your food trucks and make some lines. Once the initial lines are formed with foodies, the players add themselves to the back of the line. Then the game is simply a backstabbing race to the front of the line and be the first player to be served completely. Out of Line: Food Trucks is a blend of strategic positioning, card play, and pure dumb luck, where you shouldn't be afraid to cut in line or use distractions to your favor.&#10;&#10;A player's turn consists of 3 easy steps:&#10;    1. Roll a dice and move that line up &#10;    2. Take an action (play a card, move to the back of a line or just discard a card)&#10;    3.  Draw your hand back up to three cards&#10;    &#10;Player cards allow you to do things like:&#10;    &bull; Move a player to the end of a line&#10;    &bull; Force a player out of line&#10;    &bull; Let a foodie cut into the front of the line&#10;    &bull; Add a food(ies) to the end of a line&#10;    &bull; Temporarily close down a food truck&#10;    &bull; Stop another player from playing a card&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warning: This is a hard game with some prime number math involved. As such, this game is not for everyone, but it is very rewarding when played well.&#10;&#10;A little girl named Mina and her best pal, a friendly yeti named Yuki, play hide-and-seek in a magical frozen forest. Not only do the trees grow perfectly aligned in a 10&times;10 grid, but the trees themselves grow straight up. This means that a skinny little girl could easily hide behind one. A yeti, however, is far too big not to be seen. So, that is why Mina always hides, Yuki always seeks, and they always have fun! But seeking takes a lot of energy for someone as big as Yuki, and the trees also happen to be very much to Yuki&rsquo;s tastes. So he cannot resist munching every last splinter of every tree he encounters. In fact, if he runs out of trees to eat, he gets too hungry and gives up.&#10;&#10;One player plays Yuki and the other player plays Mina. Yuki and Mina take turns moving from tree to tree. Yuki moves slowly, because with every step, he devours an entire tree (don&rsquo;t worry, no real magical trees will be harmed during the game). On the contrary, Mina moves as far as she wants.&#10;&#10;EQUIPMENT&#10;&#10;- Board with 10&times;10 tree spots&#10;- 70 snow spots (white discs)&#10;- Yuki (an &lsquo;ice&rsquo; meeple)&#10;- Mina (a red meeple)&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN:&#10;&#10;One player plays Yuki and the other player plays Mina.&#10;&#10;Play twice swapping roles to see who does best. In many cases Yuki eventually catches Mina, but sometimes she manages to leave Yuki with no valid moves.&#10;&#10;- If both players win playing Yuki the one that ate fewer trees wins.&#10;&#10;- If both players win playing Mina, the one that ate more trees wins.&#10;&#10;- If a player wins playing both Yuki and Mina this player is clearly a hide-and-seek master!&#10;&#10;The paradox:&#10;&#10;The strategy on the second game will depend on the result of the first one:&#10;&#10;- If Yuki wins the first game, the player playing Yuki in the second game must eat fewer trees (catch Mina sooner).&#10;&#10;- If Mina wins the first game, the player playing Yuki in the second game (who won as Mina), must eat as many trees as the other player did (trying to catch Mina later!) just in case Mina eventually escapes.&#10;&#10;",
