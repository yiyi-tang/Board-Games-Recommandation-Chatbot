    "Description": "Crystopolis is ravaged by crime! Arch villains rule the streets, making life downright miserable and dangerous for our good citizens. Their only hope is a small band of local residents, dedicated to upholding the law, protecting the public and banishing the evil, marauding monsters from this once great city.&#10;&#10;No-one knows the true identities of these local heroes (except for Mrs McGinty, who knits their superhero outfits) and you, a member of the Tight Red Pants Alliance.&#10;&#10;It's time to pull them up, and take them down! The villains that is. Tight Red Pants is a simple to play, fun super hero battling card game that will keep your little heroes and grown up ones entertained for hours. Comes with everything you need to play including the world's first flat dice! A game for 2-4 people aged 8 plus&#10;&#10;How to play Tight Red Pants the game&#10;&#10;You control a bunch of home grown heroes and have to save the General Public (GPs) from evil villains before Teatime. The game ends when either: The Teatime card turns up 3 times or if all four locations are out with one villain and one GP or one hero wins 5 battles&#10;&#10;When setting up you remove the dice card and put all the green bus stop (GP cards) to one side, public side down. Choose a location card and place face up on the table. Shuffle the rest and deal three hand cards face down to each player, then place the remaining cards face down as the draw pile. Shuffle and use again when depleted. The discard pile will go next to this.&#10;&#10;Play. On your go pick up one card and play as many hand cards as you wish. Do not hold more than five. &lsquo;Red Pant&rsquo; cards are always played or discarded if no effect. Play goes clockwise&#10;&#10;MAKING A SCENE. As you lay cards fights break out all over the city (table) but first you need a location card then a villain and finally one GP from the bus stop. Place this on the location. This scene is then complete&#10;&#10;HOW TO FIGHT VILLAINS. Players then (on their go) use any hero in their hand to fight that baddie. Defeat the villain to collect and save the GP cards to eventually win the game. Save your GPs to one side. If you play all your cards pick up another three and have one more go. Move on after one fight.&#10;&#10;PUNCH-UP Process Once a location, a villain and some GPs are in place any hero can battle the villain. Use the Dice Card to fight, adjust the stats for any item or henchmen cards added.&#10;&#10;Note these stats down before fighting on the score pad.&#10;&#10;Now try to roll your Attack or below to hit. If you do, then roll again for damage to reduce the villain&rsquo;s HPs to zero. Villains then roll in the same way. Ask another player to roll for them. Continue until either is defeated. If you win you get to keep the GPs, if you lose the villain stays on play and another GP is added to scene. You go is over.&#10;&#10;The game continues in the same way each player challenging the villains at the locations. Collect and use your item cards to help your heroes and eventually the tea time will turn up 3 times.&#10;&#10;Then it's game over. The player with the most GPs wins or nobody wins if the villains overrun the city&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They use the unique skills of brave fruit fighters to make their own cocktail even better or spoil your opponents. Every Wojowoc is different and unique in its own way. Only a clever combination of their capabilities will give this unique effect that you are looking for. Wojowoce, is a simple card game that gives so many possibilities during the game, that will provide a lot of fruity fun for dozens of games.&#10;&#10;Create the best fruit cocktail and do not be outdone by other players.&#10;&#10;The game in &quot;Wojowoce&quot; begins with preparing the deck for the game. For the game, we choose one deck more than we have players at the table (there are a total of 6 decks in the game). Cards are mixed, we give away to players, and among the last cards we place the Heat card signaling the end of the party.&#10;&#10;During the game, we play the card, effect it, place it in our game area (cocktail) in the same color fruit column and draw 1 card from the general deck (basket). There are four types of card effects in the game - attack, power (immediate effect), effect (permanent effect) and the reaction that we can play in response to the opponent's attack.&#10;&#10;At the moment of getting the advantage over the opponents in the number of fruits in one color, we obtain a corresponding card providing additional points, however this bonus is transitive and we can lose it along with the loss of advantage for another player.&#10;&#10;The game ends with a round after drawing the Heat card from the deck. At the end of the game, we count points on the cards in our Cocktail, points from the above-mentioned bonus cards for the advantage and after point for each card in hand. The player with the highest number of victory points won wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;POLISH VERSION BELOWProsta gra karciana o owocowych wojownikach&#10;&#10;Gracze prze&#197;&#155;cigaj&#196;&#133; si&#196;&#153; w tworzeniu niepowtarzalnych koktajli owocowych.

After some maneuvering in northern Georgia in an attempt to disrupt Sherman's supply line, John Bell Hood moved the Confederate Army of Tennessee westward and then to the north. George Thomas's Army of the Cumberland, which was dispersed but growing, stood in the way. Hood's plan had objectives such as defeating scattered Union armies, bringing in thousands of recruits from Tennessee, taking the city of Nashville, and after that even moving into Kentucky and beyond. These goals were optimistic in the face of Federal strength, but Hood was determined to gamble&hellip;&#10;&#10;Hood's Last Gamble is an operational-level game for two players exploring the 1864 Franklin-Nashville Campaign. It shares some similarities with the designer's earlier games More Aggressive Attitudes and Objective Shreveport!, but has its own identity and flavor. This one has a larger map with many tricky terrain challenges and more Special Event Cards around which to build your strategy. It utilizes a streamlined approach to the tracking of unit Strength Points that reduces counter clutter and allows for more elegant hidden movement opportunities. Supply counters are crucial to getting the most out of your units, and with winter just around the corner, the Confederate Player must act quickly and decisively in order to change history.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1918, newly independent Finland is in turmoil. The Senate and the Parliament are paralyzed, restless Russian troops are still stationed all over the country, and pro-government and revolutionary paramilitaries are clashing. The Senate flees the troubles from the capital to the north, while its army, the White Guard, starts to disarm Russian garrisons. At the same time in the capital, the People's Delegation declares a revolution and its Red Guard starts to seize power in southern Finland.&#10;&#10;In more detail, 1918 is a two-player strategy game of the Finnish civil war. Players are in control of the pro-government Whites and the revolutionary Reds and their respective allies. All factions are unique with different kind of units, creating asymmetrical but balanced gameplay. The game has three scenarios, with different set-ups, objectives, and durations that depict different stages of war. In addition, there is the Grand Campaign, covering the whole war.&#10;&#10;Rather than simulating mere fighting and battles, 1918 combines combat, type and quality of units, supply, casualties and fog of war into more complex warfare. On a strategic level, players have to create and maintain an army, keep an eye on the enemy, and secure their supply routes. On a operational level, players must take into account different kind of terrain and infrastructure affecting battles, in addition to their fighting forces.&#10;&#10;All factions differ from one another. Factions also differ in every scenario or campaign, both by units available and the phase they come into play. Different objects of scenarios also change the entire way of playing with different sides.&#10;&#10;Set-ups, units, and objectives of each scenario and the campaign are converted from real events and situations of the Finnish Civil War. Also each sides' support in the country, their means of support, and the infrastructure and the terrain are taken from respective real-life equivalents.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Big Boss Dens come into play when a Big Boss is discovered.  Each gang have their own Big Boss Den that is designed for the abilities and flavor of that specific gang.  Big Boss Dens are tough to beat, but reward the player with more victory points and wild tokens than even the toughest dens in a standard game of Vengeance.&#10;&#10;Gambling Dens add a further challenge in your quest for vengeance in the form of fortified doors.  Fortified doors make it harder to move through and block shooting for both you and the baddies.  But for the deft ones that infilitrate them, there's more wild tokens to be had.&#10;&#10;Big Boss and Gambling Dens increase the difficulty of a game of Vengeance while rewarding players if they overcome them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Goosebumps: The Card Game of Monster Mayhem is a furious battle between monsters. Giant Mantis versus Werewolf. Slappy versus the Mummy. This easy and fun card game uses different characteristics to determine which monster will come out on top. Features large oversized cards with art from the Scholastic books.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the monster cards, Slappy card, and Mastermind card together and deal all 60 cards. All players place their cards face down in a draw pile in front of them.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 6 rounds. In each round, players battle their monsters to win a trophy. Trophies are awarded in the same order as outlined on the monster cards. Ie: in round 1, players only use the Strength ability when battling each other.&#10;&#10;Player 1 takes the top card from their draw pile, places the card face up on the table, and declares either &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo;. All the other players flip over their top card and place them face up on the table. Players now battle by comparing their monster&rsquo;s ability ratings. If &ldquo;high&rdquo; was declared, the monster with the highest rating wins the battle. If &ldquo;low&rdquo; was declared, the monster with the lowest rating wins the battle.&#10;&#10;Both Slappy and Mastermind are special cards. They have a 1 or 9 rating for all abilities (depending on whether &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo; is  declared).&#10;&#10;The player who wins the battle places all the cards from the battle into their winnings pile, and then takes the top card from their &#10;draw pile and declares &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo; for the next battle. Play continues in this manner until all the monsters have done battle and there are no monster cards left&#10;&#10;When the round is over, players count the number of cards in their winnings pile. The player with the most cards wins the round, and collects the corresponding trophy card.&#10;&#10;Repeat this process 5 more rounds for the remaining abilities and award trophy cards in the same manner.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all 6 trophies have been won. The winner is the player with the most trophies.&#10;&#10;",

The rules of the game strive to balance entertainment and playability, scientific accuracy, and educational value. The target audience includes students, science enthusiasts, nerds, and word game fans interested in learning an entirely new &ldquo;language&rdquo;. The style of play is familiar to those who have played other crossword-style board games, and the rules for compound formation come from chemistry itself.&#10;&#10;Players make moves using a hand of ten tiles. Each tile is an element from the periodic table, although not every element is represented--only those found in relatively common compounds. A valid move creates a neutral compound with balanced charges. Compounds may be either binary (like carbon dioxide, methane, water, or ammonia) or involve polyatomic ions (sulfate, nitrate, hydroxide, etc.) Subsequent turns build new compounds using both new tiles and tiles already on the board. Players score points based on the point value of each tile (some elements are worth more than others), whether they are utilized in one direction or both horizontally and vertically, and whether they are played on special bonus squares. The game ends when one player runs out of tiles following the exhaustion of the general supply; at this time, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Use Ranged and Melee weapons to deal damage to the attacking zombies, but watch out, one of the other players may attempt to turn on you in an instant. Game includes over 180 cards, 2 D6 Dice, 20 Bite tokens, and the &quot;Rules to live by&quot; instruction booklet.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:  Be the last living Survivor. Help or betray your friends to survive and win!&#10;&#10;SETUP: There are 3 decks. The Zombie Deck, Loot Deck, and Event Deck. Shuffle each deck and place them face down. Each Survivor (player) is dealt 5 cards from the Loot Deck for their starting hand. Now you&rsquo;re ready to fight some zombies!&#10;       &#10;HOW TO DIE: Each time you attack a zombie and do not kill it, the zombie bites you and you receive 1 Bite Token. If you have 5 or more Bite Tokens and you have no way of healing yourself, you die and are out of the game.&#10;&#10;THE LINE: The Line is where zombies go when they&rsquo;re revealed. The Line is how you fight multiple zombies you encounter. Zombies are set one after the other in a line in the order they are revealed. When you enter your combat phase, the first zombie in the line becomes the Active Zombie. (See Combat Phase for more information.)&#10;&#10;HOW YOUR TURN WORKS: If it is your turn, you are the Active Survivor. To start your turn you&rsquo;ll encounter a zombie.&#10;&#10;ENCOUNTER PHASE: Reveal the top card of the Zombie Deck and put it on The Line.&#10; PREPARATION PHASE: You have a chance to play or trade Loot Cards from your hand before engaging the Active Zombie in combat. You may also ask for help and make a Contract with any Survivor(s). (See Contracts for more information.) When you&rsquo;re done preparing, move to the Combat Phase.&#10;&#10;COMBAT PHASE:&#10;The first zombie in The Line becomes the Active Zombie.&#10;The Active Zombie or Event&rsquo;s ability takes effect (if any).&#10;If it is a zombie card, you may try to run. (See Running section for more information.)&#10;If you fail to run or don&rsquo;t want to, declare which weapon you're attacking with and attack the Active Zombie. (See Weapons and Combat for more information.)&#10;Repeat this process until all of the zombies on The Line are dead and then loot their corpses.&#10;&#10;LOOT PHASE: &#10;Draw Loot cards for all of the zombies you have killed. (The number of loot a zombie gives is next to the treasure chest at the bottom right corner of the Zombie card.)&#10;Events such as Smoke Bomb and Bad Luck prevent you from receiving loot on that turn.&#10;Running from zombies and making contracts will change how much loot you receive.&#10;Survivors may play, trade, give away, or discard any cards they can before the end of a turn.&#10;&#10;When the Loot Deck runs out of cards to draw, do not re-shuffle the Loot Deck. Once the loot is gone, zombies are worth zero loot and you must survive with what you have!&#10;&#10;END OF TURN:  All Survivors must discard down to 5 cards or 10 if they have an active Backpack.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Houston, we have a problem! Meteors incoming! The llama armageddon (llamaged&oacute;n in short) is coming and llamas are afraid of it. To brace themselves for the end of the world, they need to build shelters.&#10;&#10;Llamaged&oacute;n is a slightly strategic and light card game that combines mechanics such as hand management, take that and set collection. On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck. If they draw a Shelter card, then they have to play it immediately by placing it down. Shelters can also be built by combining resources. Beside playing shelters or building them, a player can use one action card which might involve attacking or stealing shelters, swapping one card for another, skipping the next player's turn, protecting your shelter, drawing two cards from the deck or even canceling the action of another player.&#10;&#10;Eventually, a player will draw the Llamaged&oacute;n card from the deck (which was randomly shuffled into the lower half of the deck) and this means everyone gets another two turns. After that, whoever has the most shelters is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 60 cards plus 5 reference cards and it's in both Spanish and English.&#10;&#10;If you like llamas, meteors and sheeps, then Llamaged&oacute;n might be a good fit for you.&#10;&#10;",

Thanks to an innovative initiative system, combat in Obsidian Protocol is fast-paced and brutal, and every turn offers new tactical choices on the path to victory.&#10;Obsidian Protocol has four different modular sectors. For instance, mecha (as the biggest and core modular sector, it has three kinds of mechas itself. you have different ways to control them.),hive mind, ship and army. Each modular sector can be a unique game. Players can also choose two or more modular sectors to play, which brings better game experience. The core parts of Obsidian Protocol are assembling and fighting. Different modular sectors have different ways of assembling. For example, players can use different parts to assemble a mecha or choose different types of arms, vehicles to form different armies to fight. After assembling, with the attribute the parts provide, players can create their own strategies, brings more fun to the game. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery.&#10;Different from most war-games, you can make only one action such as movement, melee combat, ranged combat not a series of actions in a round. We will use inch rulers to decide movement range, weapon range. Dices will be used to determine the damage.&#10;One game usually last 45-90 mins. To win, the players need to act as commanders and accomplish quests under the obstruction of the enemies with your squad or just kill them all.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simple roll and move game where players travel race from the earth to the moon. &#10;Players choose their course by the roll of the dice, with 1 and 2 travelling along a black path, 5 and 6 along a red path and 3 and 4 along a yellow path. Along the way various challenges are encountered such as faulty air supply in the rocket or not enough acceleration to leave earth and penalties are applied.&#10;Players pass through the constellations on route to the moon and landing on certain numbers assists or hinders the players progress. &#10;Landing on the moon is accomplished by throwing a 6 on the dice. First to land on the moon is the winner.&#10;The game was published by the Fritz Homann A.G company of Germany who produced a few board games to promote their Fri-Ho-Di margarine brand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Magorum is an exciting, fast-paced customizable fantasy card game where players take the roles of powerful Mages that do battle by casting incredible spells, perform enchantments, conjure up magical items, and even call forth powerful incantations. The big difference is that in Magorum the player doesn&rsquo;t control any units such as monsters or robots or fighters. Instead, YOU are the center of the battle and you use YOUR power to perform amazing feats of magic and destruction in order to defeat the opponent. The only permanent cards on the field are the magical items that empower the player. In this fast-paced magical warfare, players have to use wit and strategy to overpower their opponent.&#10;&#10;The main box set consists of 200 different cards which are divided into 5 different schools of magic: Ignogan (Fire), Aqualibrium (Water), Winderis (Air), Terrakov (Earth) and Gromnik (Electricity). Players can mix and match cards from different schools to create their ideal deck.&#10;&#10;The players mix and match cards from each school to create a deck of 57 cards, and a side-deck of up to 7 cards. The players then take turns placing cards in the manapool and using the mana they've accumulated to cast spells and deal damage. Each point of damage equals 1 card discarded from the top of the opponent's deck.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to deal enough damage to the opponent to discard all of the cards from their deck, thus winning the duel!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You can discard a card just if it follows one of these two simple rules:&#10;&#10;     You can discard a card of a colour on one of the same colours;&#10;     You may discard a card with a certain character on one that depicts the same character.&#10;&#10;&#10;Characters are identified both for their clothes and for a typical object (shown at the top left of the card).&#10;Other characterizing elements are the number of fingerprints and the number in the upper right, which will become relevant only for older children.&#10;&#10;The player who first discards all their cards wins.&#10;&#10;In the Advanced game, you can also play with special cards with funny e&#31;ffects:&#10;We advise you to insert them gradually in 3 progressive steps, but you are absolutely free to introduce them in an order chosen by you, perhaps by reason of the younger players' preferences towards a character rather than another. All special cards have a bottom part with showing colours on which they can be played, and an upper part which shows their effect on the next player's turn. The only exception is the wolf, which has a special effect. &#10;The Special cards are organized in three difficulties steps. This allows to introduce into the game the complexity by following the need of the children.&#10;&#10;",

In addition, it contains warplanes and six other campaign games featuring Italy, Britain, Germany, the USA, Japan, AVG China, Poland, and the Netherlands from 1939-1942... 119 warplanes in all.  It also provides six new &quot;stand alone&quot; scenarios--a first for the system--such as Rommel himself trying to escape behind lines in a Storch, or a short campaign scenario pitting a single Chennault's Fighting Tiger (without spare parts) against the Japanese, or flying against an Me-109 on escort duty (rather than on its own), and more.  Also new is guidelines/formula for rating the value of warplanes yourself, based on game ratings, to allow for more in-depth comparison of aircraft.&#10;&#10;The game system is identical to and compatible with Battle over Britain. This 52-page full color, illustrated book includes standard rules, advanced rules, solitaire rules, and historical scenarios.  In fact, the aircraft and campaign games include those contained in Battle over the Pacific (Vol. 2), Faith, Hope &amp; Charity (Vol. 3), and Flying Tigers (Vol. 4). (See descriptions below for details.) This edition is a handsome volume and comes with new North African and  Additional Plane counters, featuring aircraft new to the system, plus others such as the RAF Battle and Hudson, the Italian C-32 and SM-82, American P-38 Lightning, Australian Boomerang,  and German Storch and Ju-52 Tante Ju.  Also included is a &quot;points system&quot; for rating planes (or design-your-own scenarios), and new stand-alone game scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The sixty-five cards each show one of the beings found in Norse mythology: gods, trolls, giants, animals, and more. For each, the card describes the being, their strengths and weaknesses, and their story. With the information on the card, you can play six fun and educational games. You can even play out Ragnarok!&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;Ragnar&ouml;k &ndash; Destiny of the Gods. This is a unique intellectual work of Reynir A. &Oacute;skarson made from original sources. The deck of card is designed as an edutainment deck of cards and a souvenir&#10;about Norse mythology, where the 65 cards describe all the main characters of the Norse mythology. In the deck, all the characters get points, showing their locations, influence, and power according to the original sources, and these points give people insight in how Nordic people saw the world in the age of the Vikings. It's even possible to play out the events of Ragnar&ouml;k as they appear in the ancient texts of V&ouml;lusp&aacute; and Gylfaginning!&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (English)&#10;&#10;Ragnar&ouml;k - Destiny of the Gods.
