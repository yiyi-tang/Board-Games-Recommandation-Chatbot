    "Description": "At the beginning of each round, a new pool of VP tokens is added. The number of VP tokens in said pool is determined by a dice roll (2d6).&#10;&#10;Starting with the start player, players take turns taking one of the four cards.&#10;&#10;They then play them simultaneously, with either the green or the red side face up.&#10;&#10;The player who played the highest value of red becomes the start player next round. All other players who played red gets nothing.&#10;&#10;Then starting with the player who played the highest value of green, players get to take the number of VP from each separate pool equal to the value of the green card that he played. This continues in descending order of the value of the green cards played.&#10;&#10;Pool/s with leftover VPs are left as is going into the next round. (So theoretically there could be any number of pools for each round. If the pools have 6, 4, and 3 tokens, and the highest green played was 4, that player gets to grab 4, 4, and 3 tokens from each pool respectively before anyone else gets to grab anything. Yes it's broken. That's why being the start player is important.)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A traditional game played the Pequot Indians of North America.  Each player starts with 5 scoring sticks and tosses five sticks or rocks in a bowl.  If all five land with a colored side up a player wins 2 points.  If three pieces land with colored side up, a player wins 1 point.  Any other combination yields no points.  If you win any points, you get to go again. If you don't win points, play passes to the other player.  For every point lost, you must give the other player 1 scoring stick.  The game ends when one player has no sticks left.  During play it is traditional to shout &quot;Hubbub&quot; out-loud.  This is where the name of the game derives from.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to All-tes-teg-enuk&#10;&#10;&#10;The American Heritage Dictionary possibly attributes the origin of the word hubbub to this game. Quote:&#10;&#10;It has often been remarked that the early Celtic inhabitants of Britain contributed very little to the stock of English words. Perhaps this should not surprise us, given the difficult relations over the centuries between the people of Germanic stock and the people of Celtic stock in England and Ireland. It seems likely that a certain English contempt resides in the adoption of the word hubbub from a Celtic source, which is probably related to ub ub ubub, a Scots Gaelic interjection expressing contempt, or to abu, an ancient Irish war cry. In any case, hubbub was first recorded (1555) in the phrase Irish hubbub and meant &quot;the confused shouting of a crowd.&quot; In addition to the senses it has developed, hubbub was again used, possibly in an unflattering way, by the New England colonists as a term for a rambunctious game played by Native Americans.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A crossword card game from the late 1930s during a craze of such games, published by a newspaper company.  Its games are a slight twist on the usual rules of its rivals.&#10;&#10;There are 54 cards in the deck.  52 of them have a letter and a value from 10 to 50 (the Q card actually has two letters, QU); there are also 2 jokers (wild cards) worth 100.&#10;&#10;The rules to 6 games are given:&#10;&#10;Cross-O-Grams: For 2+ players (but if 4 or more, 2 decks are recommended).  Deal 12 each.  In a turn a player either makes a word on the table from his hand, or draws one and passes; if his hand only X, Y or Z he may discard one of those before drawing.  Words are at least 2 letters long, and after the first word, new words must intersect or extend previous words, crossword fashion.  A hand ends when a player goes out or the draw pile runs out.  The value of the cards in hand goes to the winner of the round, and the highest total wins after an agred time; or, players get their own totals in hand at the end of a round, and when one player reaches 500, the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;An-O-Grams: For 2-8 players, but use 2 decks for 4+ players. Deal 12 each.  In a turn, a player: plays a word of 3+ letters to the table in front of him; or adds 1+ letters to a word on the table to make it a new word (without changing the letters' order), taking the word to himself; or draws 1 card and passes.  Simple endings (-S, -ED, -ER) are forbidden.  The round ends when a player goes out or the deck runs out.  Each player scores the points in front of him minus the points in hand; a player who goes out before the deck runs out doubles his table points.&#10;&#10;Casino-Grams: For 2-4 players.  Take out the jokers and deal 4 to each player and 4 face-up to the table.  In a turn a player plays one of his cards to the table and does one of the following: A) makes a word with it and other table cards, placing the word in front of him; B) builds toward a future word, combining 1 card with table cards, announcing the letter(s) he has that will be played later; C) steals a word from someone else by adding a letter to it and making a new word; D) leaves it on the table with the other table cards.  After the cards are played, 4 more are dealt to each player (but no more to the table), and play continues.  After all the cards are played, the one who made or stole the last word gets the remaining table cards.  Each player gets 1 point per card he has on the table; the game is won on reaching 100.&#10;&#10;Cross-O-Gram Solitaire: Like Klondike, 7 piles are dealt out of height 1-7 cards, the top one exposed.  Combine the visible cards to build words into a crossword array.  When stuck, start turning the remaining deck 3 at a time and use those cards to continue.  (Or, do it 1 at a time, going through the deck only once.)  You win if you use up the whole deck.&#10;&#10;Cross-O-Gram Double Solitaire: The solitaire above played with 2 players, with decks of different colored backs.  Take turns playing until you can play to the table.  The game ends when neither can add anything to the crossword, and the one with the most cards out wins.&#10;&#10;Canister Solitaire: Deal the whole deck into 8 columns face-up, fanned vertically so you can see what's coming.  There will be 6 each in 4 columns, 7 each in the other 4.  Repeatedly make words only from the letters at the bottom of the columns, discarding them as they are made.  You win if you use all the cards up.&#10;&#10;",

Then they can put an &quot;egg&quot; (wooden ball) into the nest. The player who placed most eggs at the end of the game, wins.&#10;&#10;- &quot;Balance&quot;: The game board is placed upright, with one brick under it in one corner. Another brick is placed on top of that corner. All players then take turn placing bricks into the other side of the base, trying to make it topple. The first player to suspect an imbalance can lift the brick on top of the corner. If the board topples, that player wins.&#10;&#10;- &quot;Die h&auml;ngenden G&auml;rten der Semiramis&quot;: The game board is turned over. Two rubber bands are stretched over the bottom, then bricks are piled up by the players. Whoever topples the fragile construction, loses.&#10;&#10;",

There are 4 themes for the trivia questions - history, science &amp; technology, nature &amp; animals, geography.&#10;&#10;The board game part is quite simple; move the pawn to a place with a chit, or draw a plane or a joker if you have none. Once one player has 3 chits of the same color, or the last chit of a color gets drawn, a quiz round occurs.&#10;&#10;For the trivia round, a card is turned up with a question and 12 possible answers; an unknown number of them is right (example: which of these towns were members of the Hanseatic League). Each player can now use his knowledge chits of the proper color to bet on the answers he assumes are correct (one chit per answer) and score points.&#10;&#10;",

JoffW also helped a lot in finding some holes in the tiles and clarifying the rules.&#10;&#10;The Story&#10;You just finished your program, right on time. Now you only need to process it through the computer and print your report; it&rsquo;s going to be a major breakthrough for mankind.&#10;As you go by the hall, you see that strange fellow that works at the other end of the laboratory, and, of course, you never liked him. As you walk you realise he is going to the same computer room as you.

The game comes with six dice (three red, three green) and a rules leaflet (printed double sided).&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to create combinations of dice on a table comprised of two columns and six rows. The red dice go in the left column, the green dice on the right. Points are awarded for creating certain combinations with the rolled dice (duplicates or streets).&#10;&#10;Each player gets a maximum of 6 rolls per turn. After every roll at least one die must be placed on the table. If certain combinations are rolled, the player may place more than one die on the table.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player with the highest total after at least one player has reached a total of 250 points or more and all player took equal turns.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This was Milton Bradley's entry in the crossword card game craze of the late 1930's.  The deck has 60 cards, 2 of them Keystone cards which act as wild cards, and the rest having 1 letter and an associated value.  The rules describe three games:&#10;&#10;1.  Crossword Card Game: For 2-7 players; deal 10 each for 2-4, 7 each for 5-7.  In a turn a player plays up to 4 cards to make a word (of 2+ letters) on the table.  The first word is alone, but all later words must intersect a previous word, crossword fashion.  If unable to make or extend a word, a player discards 1 card and draws 1 from the draw or discard pile.  The hand ends when a player goes out of cards; the rest add the sum of values in their hand to their running total.  When someone's total reaches 100, the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;2.  Solitaire Lettergrams:  Deal 6 cards face up, and place the rest in a pile, with the top card exposed.  Make and discard words from the face-up cards, filling in blanks from the deck.  You win if you use up all the cards.&#10;&#10;3.  Lettergram Anagrams:  Spread the cards loosely on the table, face down.  In a turn, a player: draws cards (3 their first turn 2 thereafter), and either lays down a word (2+ letters), lays down a word fragment, or adds letters to a fragment, or adds letters to an existing word to make a new word.  When a player lays down a 2-letter word fragment he says what word he is aiming to make; any player may complete it.  Words that are completed or extended are placed in front of the player who did it, even if it was in front of someone else.  When all cards have been played, the player with the most words wins.&#10;&#10;",

The players alternately play Hands, which involves casting the wands; both players then roll the dice for procession of the points represented by the wands cast.&#10;&#10;The skill of the game is to determine whether to risk playing the Hand cast or to pass it.

Then do the same with the Bid Wheel, keeping in mind that there are different values on each side of the Bid Wheel. Once your Prediction and Bid are at the 12:00 o'clock position, you're ready. Line up the two wheels so that only the Bid is visible.&#10;&#10;Both players place their Set of Wheels on the table at the same time, with their selected Bid value touching the selected Bid value of their opponent. Once both are on the table and each player has confirmed, slide your Bid Wheel toward you slightly, revealing the Prediction.

    "Description": "The Mexican War is a simple, card-driven game of the war between Mexico and the United States that was fought from 1846 to 1848. It is a two-player game in which one player plays the military forces of the United States, and the other plays the forces of Mexico. The U.S. player attempts to conquer Mexican territory and to compel Mexico to surrender, while the Mexican player attempts to avoid this outcome long enough for public war-weariness and regional divisions to compel the U.S. withdraw.&#10;&#10;&#10;Prominent military leaders, army strength points, U.S. naval forces, and political concerns and conditions are all represented. Historically, although many contemporary foreign observers thought that Mexico had the advantage, the war was one of the most one-sided victories in U.S. military history. This game allows players not only to explore what conditions contributed to this outcome, but also whether the Mexicans might have been able to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Played on an authentic 19th-century map of Mexico, Mexican War includes both introductory and standard rules. Based on the rules system of the popular introductory game We The People, it is ideal for introducing youngsters and new players to the hobby, yet substantial enough to attract the veteran gamer. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).&#10;&#10;",

Their objective, a bridge along the main axis of advance. But first the men of No. 11 Commando will have to silence a menacing battery of Vichy howitzers.&#10;&#10;BC3: 42ND STREET CRETE, May 27, 1941: German mountain troops stream over the rocky hillsides pursuing what they think is a beaten enemy. But as they approach a major Allied supply dump, they bump into a fighting patrol from the Australian 2/7th Battalion. The Aussies launch a bayonet charge which could be their last of the war.&#10;&#10;BC4: TIN CANS TIN HATS, SYRIA, July 8, 1941: A Vichy tank sitting on a bridge is holding up the Allied advance. The Australians send a company of infantry to evict the unwanted vehicle but the R35 has friends and won&rsquo;t go quietly.&#10; BC5: STORMING THE AMPHITHEATRE, BOUGAINVILLE, February 6, 1945: The whistle of shells and the dull thud of smoke rounds alert the Japanese defenders on their fortified ridge line. Before long the Australians emerge from the shroud and into a wall of withering fire.&#10;&#10;BC6: WALKABOUT, BOUGAINVILLE, March 30, 1945: A rumble of tank tracks and the sight of the lurching armoured monsters sends panic through the Japanese ranks sitting in their muddy foxholes, but their leaders steady their charges and order them to fire at the supporting infantry now coming into view.&#10; BC7: BRIGADE HILL, NEW GUINEA, September 8, 1942: The Australians defending along the Kokoda Track face an unprecedented disaster. Somehow the Japanese have enveloped an entire brigade and cut the line of communication to headquarters. It&rsquo;s time for the Aussies to break-out or perish.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A collectible card game that features Major League Baseball players.&#10;&#10;The game plays much like Top Trumps.  Each card has ratings in three categories: Fastball, Changeup, and Specialty.  The pitching team selects one of his pitchers, then the hitting team places down one of his hitters, face-down.  The pitching team then chooses one of the three categories, the hitter's card is revealed, and the higher total in the selected category wins.  Each team gets to play 9 hitters, and the team with the most hitters' victories wins the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011, additional rules were added to form the &quot;Major League&quot; rules, and the original ruleset was dubbed the &quot;Home Run Derby&quot;; cards were designed with additional information for the new rules. Under the Major League rules, the game takes place on a &quot;baseball field&quot; poster provided in the starter set. One pitcher pitches for an entire inning, but may not throw the same pitch twice in a row. Hits are no longer automatically home runs, but the batter moves a number of bases as indicated on his card. Players have offensive and defensive abilities that allow them to change the effects of hits, pitches, runs, and outs. Ball fields and mascots were added to the card set, and can affect the game.&#10;&#10;From the starter box back:&#10;&#10;Introducing Topps Attax, the new card game that puts you in charge of the action!  Manage your team, call your pitches and battle against your friends.  Or take the action online!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dragon's Hoard is a competitive dungeon crawling game for one to four players.  The catch is that the adventurers must exit the dungeon before time runs out, lest they be engulfed in darkness and perish.  The game is designed to use a standard piecepack and as many colors of Icehouse pieces as you have (at least four colors, though).  You should also have two opaque bags or cups out of which you will draw random Icehouse pieces.&#10;&#10;The piecepack tiles are set up to represent the area that the dungeon will occupy, and players explore that area, using Icehouse pieces to represent the dungeon's rooms, passages, treasures, and creatures as they are discovered.  The game's pace is set by a pre-determined, fixed number of turns; however, escaping the dungeon in time may be complicated by what you find along the way....&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Fallacy of Rank is a game of strategy, bluffing, and combat for two to four players, played with three standard piecepacks.  Each layer sets up her corner of the board, formed with face-down piecepack tiles, by placing her two pawns (commanders) and fourteen coins in a 4&times;4 grid.  The coins are placed value-side down, such that the only values known to your opponents are the commanders at value 7 (2 higher than the best &quot;soldier&quot;), and whatever they can manage to remember from your fourteen soldiers.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last army with any commanders in play.  Elimination of units comes through combat, and the attacker, defender, or both could be eliminated.  Combat uses a value-plus-boost mechanism, with the boost coming from tiles and coins in your &quot;hand&quot;.  Between the coins on the playfield with their hidden values, and the boosts played from your hand, there is ample opportunity for bluffing in The Fallacy of Rank.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Fantasy Flight Games:&#10;we have developed an expansion to the AGoT LCG Core Set, and we&rsquo;re calling it the: Kings of the Sea. Kings of the Sea was developed with three major goals in mind:&#10;&#10;The first of these goals was to bring House Greyjoy back into the LCG environment. From this perspective, the expansion consists of a Greyjoy deck that is similar to the out-of-the-box decks that you&rsquo;ll find in the AGoT Core set. With a mixture of both new cards and old school Greyjoy reprints (some modified and updated for the LCG environment), House Greyjoy can once again stand proudly alongside (or, if you prefer, against) Houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen in the LCG environment.&#10;&#10;Secondly, I insisted on using the design of the Kings of the Sea expansion as an opportunity to address some of the context and synergy concerns noted earlier. In this product, you&rsquo;ll find numerous King and Queen characters, some new Kingdom locations, and a spattering of Military Battle, Intrigue Gambit, and Power Struggle plot cards. Additional use for crested characters is also prevalent (particularly Holy and War), and a major black hole in the AGoT LCG metagame, a realistic check on powerful locations, has been confronted.&#10;&#10;Third (and not unrelated to the context and synergy discussion), we wanted this expansion to have something for everyone, even if they&rsquo;re not at all interested in House Greyjoy. Thus, each House gets at least 1 King or Queen, and the plot deck (with the exception of an important House Greyjoy only plot reprint) along with many of the neutral cards were selected as cards that could potentially be useful building blocks in the widest possible array of decks. So even a die-hard Lannister player (there aren&rsquo;t really any of those out there, are there?) should be able to find something of use in this set.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hextiles are a new domino system based on hexagon pairs.&#10;&#10;Hextiles are domino-like tiles composed of two conjoined hexagons, each marked with a number of pips between 0 and 6. The standard &quot;double six&quot; hextile set contains all unique pairs of pips for a total of 28 tiles:&#10;00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 33, 34, 35, 36, 44, 45, 46, 55, 56, 66.&#10;&#10;Like Dominoes, Hextiles are a not a particular game but a gaming system with which a number of games can be played. This section describes some examples; all are played with the  following rules except where stated:&#10;&#10;*&#10;      All tiles start randomly shuffled and upside down in the boneyard.&#10;    *&#10;      Players draw tiles until a double is drawn - this becomes the first tile played and the drawer the first mover.&#10;    *&#10;      Players then draw seven tiles each to form their pool (players cannot see each others' pools).&#10;    *&#10;      If the current player cannot move they must draw additional tiles from the bone yard until they can move.&#10;    *&#10;      Tiles must be played adjacent to at least one existing tile, subject to the constraints for each game.&#10;    *&#10;      Players must replenish their pool with a tile from the boneyard after each move.&#10;    *&#10;      Players cannot pass unless there is no legal move and no more tiles.&#10;    *&#10;      Play continues until neither player can move. Players then add their remaining pips to the opponent's score and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;http://www.cameronius.com/games/hextiles/&#10;&#10;",

This is the most unusual one in having &quot;cards&quot; made of thin wood slats (which are somewhat fragile, at least after 70 years).  There are scrabble-like stands to hold them.  The cards each have a letter and value 2-10, except two &quot;Key&quot; wild cards worth 20.&#10;&#10;Deal 8 letters to 2-3 players, 6 each for 4-6.  In a turn, a player plays up to 4 letters to the table, making words of 2+ letters; or, discards a letter and draws a new one.  All words except the first must intersect other words, crossword fashion.  The hand ends when a player runs out of cards, at which point each player adds the points left in their hand to their total.  When someone reaches 200, the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;There is also a solitaire version.  Take out the key cards and deal yourself 10 letters.  Build a crossword array from your hand as above; when you are stuck, draw new letters until you can make another word.  Continue until going through the whole deck.  You win if you use up all the letters.&#10;&#10;Later versions from the '50's &amp; '60's use plastic tiles, with slight scoring differences, &amp; include rules for different games using the same components.&#10;&#10;",

Age of Imperialism substantially covers a full century of history with the shifts in technology, economic conditions, and politics that constantly changed the imperial equation.

Intended to teach as well as to entertain, the game addresses the causes nineteenth-century imperialism as well as its effects on international relations amongst the imperial powers. &#10; Played on an authentic 19th-century map of the entire world, Age of Imperialism includes several scenarios, each playable in an afternoon, covering different stages of imperial expansion, as well as a campaign game that covers the entire century.

    "Description": "1812 is a simple, card-driven game of the Anglo-American conflict that was fought from 1812 to 1815. It is a two-player game in which one player plays the military forces of the United States, and the other plays the forces of Great Britain. The U.S. player attempts to conquer Canadian territory and to compel Britain to sue for peace, while the British player attempts to do exactly the same against the United States, perhaps with the aid of some Native American allies. The fledgling United States are making a huge gamble. Can they drive the British from Canada and unify North America, or will the Empire strike back and put the upstarts in their place and end their dreams of &quot;manifest destiny&quot;?&#10;  Prominent military leaders, army strength points, Native American forces, and political concerns and conditions are all represented. Historically, British and U.S. forces, though sorely mismatched in terms of professionalism and leadership, fought each other to a stalemate. This game allows players not only to explore what conditions contributed to this outcome, but also whether the either might have been able to achieve a decisive victory that would have changed the shape of the North American continent. &#10; Played on an authentic early-19th-century map of the United States and Canada, 1812 includes both introductory and standard rules. Based on the rules system of the popular introductory game We The People, it is ideal for introducing youngsters and new players to the hobby, yet substantial enough to attract the veteran gamer. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).&#10;&#10;",
