    "Description": "&quot;With the end of the 2nd. World war, the world enters a new political configuration headed by two great blocs: the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite the climate of hope in the division of defeated Germany, a series of suspicions begin to emerge among the old allies. The Russians with control of so-called Eastern Europe awoke among Western allies suspected of a possible breakthrough in 1946.&#10;&#10;The Americans, along with the British, began to reposition the bulk of their troops on German frontiers and started a program to ship supplies and ammunition to their units. In 1947 the Russians also began to move in this chess, with the increase of their military personnel in occupied Germany. In 1948 the first case occurred when Stalin&rsquo;s armies block Berlin, barring access to supplies and new troops. The American response comes in two nuclear attacks, one on Moscow with a new American bomb called BlueToddler and another attack on the Soviet heavy industries in the Urals with three small tactical weapons known as Nuke Candy. The Russians advance their conventional forces on the allies, and a new conflict begins. The allies are now mortal enemies, on the one hand, the Americans, the English, and the French, and on the other hand the Russians and the Chinese, who proclaim themselves communists in 1947, joining the so-called Soviet Federation.&#10;&#10;In 1949 is invented by the Russians the engines of macro combustion enabling the introduction of so-called combat mechs. These armaments recover the ground lost by the Soviets, pushing the allies to the borders of Poland. In 1950 the first Russian nuclear bomb exploded over New York, taking the world war to the American soil! In 1951 the Allies entered with their mechs of combat in Europe, bringing the conflict to unimaginable levels.&#10;&#10;In this scenario, a powerful organization arises, formed by old Nazis who dream of having a great Germany again: the Werwolf Korp. Hidden in the Bavarian Alps in dark Nazi fortresses, they emerge as a fighting force with fantastic weapons and black magic. These represent one more weight in the pendulum of history.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hot War is a wargame of miniatures past in an alternate world where the 2nd. World war becomes a third due to the postwar cold war climate.&#10;We add fantastic elements like mechs, Nazi black magic, among other things, in a simple game system focused on skirmish (few minis) for quick matches and that allow the player to have fun in full. Another point is that our main miniatures made for 3D printing and also allows the use of other companies' minis for the infantry units. (our intention is for very soon to launch the infantry units even for 3D printing). We are initially launching the fast rules with only two factions to set players in the universe and the game system. Our core book will be released in 2019/2020 with much more news, including the German / Nazi faction, which is not present in the fast rules.&#10;&#10;In our fast rules, there is everything necessary for the player to start having fun!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wunchunk is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players that is played on a &quot;hexhex&quot; board (a hexagonal shaped board made of hexagonal cells).  Recommended playing sizes are boards with 5 to 8 cells per side.&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing stones on a hexhex board, until the board is full or until all players pass consecutively. Groups of like-colored stones are &quot;chunks&quot; if they contain two or more stones; single stones are merely &quot;crumbs.&quot; The winner is the player with the fewest CHUNKS in his/her color of stones at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In the case of a tie in the number of chunks, the tied player with the &quot;fewest smallest groups&quot; wins. That is, tied players compare their number of CRUMBS; the player with the fewest crumbs wins.  If the number of crumbs is also tied, then players compare their number of groups consisting of exactly two stones; the player with the smallest number of size-2 groups wins -- and so on up through the various sizes (size-3, size-4, ...) until the tie is broken.  (In the two player game, an &quot;all the way up&quot; tie is mathematically impossible so long as the players did not prematurely pass; eventually the tie will necessarily be broken as players compare larger and larger groups. In the multi-player game, an &quot;all the way up&quot; tie is theoretically possible but non-existent in practice.)&#10;&#10;On his/her turn, a player is allotted a number of stones equal to his/her current number of chunks. (The initial board configuration begins -- Othello-like -- with each player having one chunk already on the board.  See the  &quot;Starting Configuration&quot; posting in the rules forum for details.) A player may play any number of stones from 0 (a pass) up to his/her allotted number.  A player may play any color of stone (even an opponent's color); multiple stones can be any color or color mix.&#10;&#10;In the two player game, in order to offset the first player advantage, the PIE rule applies:  After Player 1 plays his/her very first stone, Player 2 then decides whether to play a stone to the board or switch colors with Player 1.  (If &quot;switch colors&quot; is chosen, then the player who was formerly Player 1 is now Player 2, and immediately plays a stone as his/her turn #1 move.)&#10;&#10;Honors&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wunchunk won 3rd place in the Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game Contest of 2019&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Example&#10;&#10;&#10;     This forum posting gives an example of a Wunchunk endgame, which shows the above rules in action.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player tries to become the most glorious one by accomplishing missions, obtaining money and equipment cards, recruiting the crew and enlarging the vessel. Other actions as trading, exploring new islands and plundering other captains, can be accomplished to get more power.  By doing so, and by attacking other players, the captain obtains &ldquo;fame points&rdquo;, which eventually lead to victory and eternal glory.&#10;&#10;Thanks to the 11 mixable components, each board will be different from the other. The panel combinations are more than 30 mln, allowing the best gaming experience. By merging the components the &ldquo;game world&rdquo;, with islands and seas, gets its shape.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each glorious sailor gets a basic ship and an unskilled crew.  To each one  is randomly given a specific ability as well as the ship details. These are: speed (how far can this vessel go), maneuverability (crew members needed to move), holds (how many goods can the ship carry), cannons (to attack other ships). Finally there are 5 seats for the brave crew.&#10;&#10;Before each round, the first player draws a &ldquo;wind card&rdquo; out. This card decides the direction of the active flows. Moreover, it outlines the goods&rsquo; productions sites, events taking place in inhabited islands and prices&rsquo; variations. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of two actions happening on inhabited islands. Those activities need to be chosen among: simple movement, entering the pub to recruit the squad, selling goods or buying a ship part. &ldquo;Free actions&rdquo; (healing, fixing, loading goods and one attack) are allowed as well on these islands. While, the only action allowed on an uninhabited island is the sole exploration.&#10;&#10;The sea is calm, are you now ready to sail?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It will be quite possible to create scenarios thanks to the various explorations cards and related events without forgetting encounters and monsters.&#10;&#10;When discovering a new exploration card, a player draws an encounter card on which a small ambient text is described and what the heroes discover. When all the players cross an area together we draw an event that we just place on the storyline at the bottom of the board, describing the scenario and its stages. Specific event cards to each scenario are added to the common ones.&#10;&#10;The monsters encountered also depend on the scenarios: Kobolds and undead. All monsters (except bosses) are also drawn randomly.&#10;It is possible to change the difficulty of the game by adding events and / or exploration cards to increase the exploration time. It is also possible to play with higher level monsters.&#10;&#10;The game offers a great life because of all these elements. Each game will be different even if the same scenario is played several times thanks to all the exploration mechanics of the dungeons.&#10;The core box will propose 4 heroes and several decks of experience cards that will allow you to evolve them. Many treasures and equipment will also be part of the contents of the basic box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Strategic treatment of the American Civil War.&#10;The American Civil War was by far the most destructive conflict in US history. This game gives players a chance to change the outcome. The Confederate player must maintain a viable economic and political core, while the Union player attempts to divide and conquer the southern states. Victory is checked every turn: Union progress can have political consequences or possibly end the game if either player fails to achieve expectations.&#10;During each quarterly turns, players recruit additional forces, then conduct a pair of impulses. During each impulse, each player moves forces and fight battles. Movement rates are high, but enemy forces can react by retreating, blocking further movement, or counterattacking. Battles are decided by a combination of good leaders and relative strength. The Confederacy starts with a decided advantage in leadership. Union leaders appear only after fighting battles: the Union player may have to lose a few battles to get the leaders needed to win the war.&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters&#10;&#10;",

The borders of two opposing sides of the board are colored black; the remaining two sides have white-colored borders. (If a Go board is used, mark the ownership of sides as follows: place a black stone near one side of the board and then place another black stone near the opposite side; do the same with white stones and the remaining sides.)&#10;&#10;A player&rsquo;s goal is to connect his/her two same-colored board sides with a group of orthogonally-connected stones of his/her color. On each turn, a player must place a single own-stone on any empty point. If as a direct result of the placement, a player has two own-stones that are orthogonally adjacent to an enemy stone at a right angle, then that enemy stone is converted to an own-stone. If the newly converted stone creates conditions for a similar capture, then that capture takes place immediately, and so on in a chain reaction. A capturing pair (i.e. the two own-stones that bring about a capture of an enemy stone) must contain at least one newly placed or newly converted stone, otherwise no capture takes place.&#10;&#10;For examples of captures, see the Rules Forum posting titled &ldquo;How Pinch captures work.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In order to offset the first player&rsquo;s advantage, the PIE RULE applies. (After the first stone is placed on the board, the other player decides which color of stones he/she wants to play.)&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pandeng is a climbing card game for 2 to 4 players using a deck of 57 cards. 4 players can also play as teams of 2 sitting opposite each other.&#10;&#10;A similar game is said to have been played by Imperial officials during the Han Dynasty in China ... for money!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;&#10;In Pandeng you want to collect as few cards as possible. Each player starts with a hand of six cards from a deck that contains 57 cards numbered 2-11. One player starts by playing a single card or multiple cards with the same value, calling out the sum of those cards as they are played. Then draw back up to 6 cards from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;So if the player plays a 4 (or two 2s) he deals it to the center of the table and calls out &ldquo;4&rdquo;. The next player has to play a card (or cards of equal value added together) to surpass that sum or else collect all of the cards played to the center of the table. The player then starts with one or more cards again.&#10;&#10;The number 8 (long regarded as the luckiest number in Chinese culture) is the strongest card in the deck, it beats them all! So what beats an 8? Two 8s! And two 8s succumb to three 8s and so on. There are eight 8's in the deck, and when to use these 8s is a key strategy in Pandeng!&#10;&#10;But be WARNED! Those 8's can count against you at the end of a round! More on this in a moment.&#10;&#10;As soon as the draw pile of cards is gone, and one player is out of cards, the game ends immediately, and everyone else adds the cards still in their hands to the cards they've collected, counting each card as a point for a score. If you are stuck with any 8s, each 8 counts as an additional 8 points, so you don't want to be too precious with the 8s during play.&#10;&#10;After playing as many rounds as the number of players at the table, whoever has the lowest score is the winner!&#10;&#10;The 57 card deck consists of:&#10;&#10;Three  2s&#10;Three  3s&#10;Four   4s&#10;Five   5s&#10;Six    6s&#10;Seven  7s&#10;Eight  8s&#10;Nine   9s&#10;Nine  10s&#10;Three 11s&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Axis and Allied armies had surged back and forth across the Western Desert for just over two years, each time managing to recover from defeat and eventually stage a counter-offensive.&#10;&#10;...could the stalemate have continued? And now we've answered with this 24-scenario supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series, complete with 130 playing pieces. Certainly each side had difficulty bringing sufficient force to bear, and both German and Italian leaders thought they could continue the war in the western desert after Alamein. Significant events would have to place in other theaters of war to allow the Italian Navy to maintain supply lines across the Mediterranean and prevent the United States from bringing its massive resources to bear.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trials &amp; Triumph was designed by a criminal defense attorney to guide teens in their interactions with law enforcement. The game uses a simple roll-and-move format to chart the course of a player navigating between the World of Possibilities and the World of Trouble. The object of the game is to get out of the World of Trouble with a Clean Slate by being the first player to arrive at the Triumph space.&#10;&#10;Some spaces on the board require a player to draw a Flashing Lights card and read it aloud. The cards present over 50 different scenarios involving encounters with law enforcement. The scenarios are based on the designer's 19 years of experience as a criminal defense attorney. The cards do not permit the player to make any choices, they merely spell out the scenario and provide a result. The result of a Flashing Lights card can be positive (e.g. advance your pawn two spaces) or negative (e.g. move your pawn to the World of Trouble, a circular track representing the criminal justice system).&#10;&#10;There are various ways a player may leave the World of Trouble track: If a player is convicted of a misdemeanor, the player returns all the way to the Start space in the World of Possibilities; being acquitted allows a player to return to the World of Possibilities on the Clean Slate space; however, if a player is convicted of a felony in the World of Trouble, the player may be eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;The game designer's key lessons are captured in a list of the &quot;7 R's of police encounters,&quot; a summary list of do's and don'ts that are echoed throughout the game: Don't run, reach, resist, or run your mouth (i.e. make a statement to the police); do refuse all DUI tests, refuse consent to search, and request a lawyer.&#10;&#10;A supplemental Game Guide ebook is available for separate purchase. The Game Guide aligns with the scenarios on the Flashing Lights cards to provide background information about the criminal offenses and legal concepts involved in the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Object of the game: To capture the most pebbles.&#10;&#10;Starting: Cards are shuffled and each player draws three cards. A card is drawn from the pile and placed in the middle face up. This will be the card that the first player builds on. Group chooses who will go first and players take turns going clockwise. Figure 1 below shows an example of a card being played on from the deck. Noticed that a pebble is placed on two overlapping red squares.&#10;&#10;Cards: There are 80 cards made up of three colored squares per card. Cards are placed on top of each other so that at least one of the three squares on the card lays on top of another square of a card with the same color.  Red squares can only go on top of red squares, blue squares can only go on top of blue squares, etc. More than one square can go on top of other squares if the squares laid on top of other squares matches the same color. If a player is unable to lay a card on top of another card then they are skipped to the next player. Figure 2 below shows how a card can be placed on top of two other cards.&#10;&#10;Cards must also be able to match colors when adjacent sides are touching other adjacent sides. Figure 3 shows an examples of a card that is not acceptable because the yellow square does not match the red square.&#10;&#10;Pebbles: Players draw from the pile of black pebbles when placing a pebble on a square. Only black pebbles are played on cards, white and red pebbles are used to reduce the number of black pebbles needed in a game. Black pebbles have a value of one point. Every time a player collects 5 black pebbles they turn them into the pile to replenish it and take one white pebble which is worth the 5 black pebbles. A red pebble is worth 10 black pebbles.&#10;&#10;Pebble Placement: Where ever a card square overlaps another card square a pebble is placed on that square. Up to three pebbles can be placed in one turn if a card is placed that overlaps three squares of the same colors. Figure 4 shows an example of one card being placed on top of three other squares. Three black pebbles are placed on top of each square that matches.&#10;&#10;Capturing Pebbles: Capturing is done by jumping pebbles. A pebble can jump another pebble as long as there is a space (square from a card) to jump into over a pebble. Pebbles can jump in any direction. Multiple jumps can be made in one turn as long as there is a pebble next to another pebble and a space to space to jump into. Figure 5 shows an example of jumps that can be made in one turn. There are other combinations to jumping than what is shown in Figure 5.&#10;&#10;End of Game: The game ends when all the cards are used up from the deck and the player&rsquo;s hands. Who ever has the most points in their pile wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trolls eat Moles uses the &lsquo;Rock-Paper-Scissors&rsquo; concept and made it into a board game. Three people play this game. It is a game that requires strategy, diplomatic maneuvering, and luck.&#10;&#10;Object of the game: To be the last of three players with pieces on the board.&#10;&#10;Pieces: There are 3 sets of pieces, each set having: 6 Trolls, 6 Moles, 6 Holes and 1 Skull.&#10;&#10;Trolls: Trolls eat Moles and can ONLY capture Moles. Each player has 6 Trolls.&#10;&#10;Moles: Moles dig Holes and can ONLY capture Holes. Each player has 6 Moles.&#10;&#10;Holes: Holes bury Trolls and can ONLY capture Trolls. Each player has 6 Holes.&#10;&#10;Skulls: Skulls go boom and eliminate ALL pieces whose squares shares an adjacent side with the Skull square. The Skull is also removed. Each player has one Skull each.&#10;&#10;Set up: Players take all their pieces and place them face down to mix them up. The red player selects 14 of their red pieces and slides 5 pieces to the side, not to be looked at. The green player selects 16 of their green pieces and slides 3 pieces to the side, not to be looked at. The blue player selects 18 of their blue pieces and slides 1 piece to the side, not to be looked at.  Players take turns placing one piece at a time face down on the board starting with red, then green, then blue until all the pieces are placed. Figure 1 gives an example of what the board would look like when setting up the pieces. The pieces are flipped over after all the squares are filled up.. Any pieces sharing an adjacent side with a Skull is removed along with the Skull. Players then start moving, starting with red, then green, then blue, and continuing in that order.&#10;&#10;Moving: Players move one space at a time in any direction; horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, either onto an empty space, or an occupied space that will allow a capture. Pieces can move multiple spaces in one turn if they are capturing.&#10;&#10;Capturing: Pieces can only move onto an occupied square if it can be captured by the incoming piece. Trolls can move onto squares occupied by Moles, Moles can move onto squares occupied by Holes and Holes can move onto squares occupied by Trolls. A piece can capture as many pieces in one turn if they are joined together either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Captured pieces are placed under the captor to form a stack.&#10;&#10;Rounds: A round is when pieces have to be shuffled and placed on the board. This can happen if there are remaining pieces on the board from two or more players that cannot be captured. The player with the most pieces combined in their stacks after a round will have the advantage in the next round. That player will be the first player to move after all the pieces are set up and their pieces will be immune to any Skulls. The remaining players take all of their pieces that have not been captured and reshuffle them. Players then place their pieces any where on the board where there is not an occupied piece starting with the one who had the most pieces in their stacks.Players take turns filling the squares until either the spaces are all filled up, or there are no more pieces to place on the board. There is no limit to the number of rounds, though it would be rare to go more than three rounds.&#10;&#10;Winning: Winning happens when there is only one player left with pieces on the board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nature&rsquo;s Card Game: The magic of nature&rsquo;s patterns can be written in the language of numbers. The Phinacci game has taken that numbering pattern and made a card game out of it.&#10;&#10;How to Play: You have two teams, four players, 53 cards, and 144 points needed to win the game. The object is to be the first team to reach 144 points. Each card taken in a pile counts as one point. Teams capture cards in a pile by matching the pile value with the card they throw down onto the pile. There are two groups of cards; colored cards with black numbers and black cards with white numbers. The colored cards are used only in subtracting the number that is on the card from the value of the pile, and the black cards can be used to either add or subtract the number on the card from the pile. If a player does not match the value on the pile then players continue going clockwise to lay down a card until the value is matched. The pile value changes each time a card is placed on the pile. The team (lead team) who lays down the first card of the hand has the advantage of either matching or exceeding the number value on the pile to take it, where as the other team must match the pile value exactly. If neither team has the cards to match or go over (lead team) the value on the pile then the cards go to the (non-lead team), and they become the lead team on the next round. There will be times when a player is unable to place a card and they are skipped to the next player. There will also be times when a player will run out of cards before the other players do.&#10;&#10;An example of play: The deck is shuffled and dealt to all four players with one extra card going into the middle face up.Let&rsquo;s say the extra card is a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo;. Team A (lead team) easily takes it by throwing a &lsquo;colored 1&rsquo; card on top of it. Any card they throw down will take it because all they have to do is match or exceed the pile value. Because there were two cards in the pile they receive two points for their team. The player that takes the pile gets to lead out. Now let&rsquo;s say the player who took the pile leads out with an &lsquo;8&rsquo; card. The player on the left, Team B (non-lead team) member can place an 8 down if they have one and take the pile of two cards to collect two points, or let&rsquo;s say they choose to throw down a &lsquo;colored 1&rsquo; card which subtracts from the existing &lsquo;8&rsquo; making the pile value 7. The next person on the left is a member of Team A cannot match that pile number, because there are no &lsquo;7&rsquo; in the deck, but because they are the Lead Team they can use an &lsquo;8&rsquo; or larger card to take the pile, but it would only be three cards. Let&rsquo;s say instead they decide to throw down a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo; card. Now the pile value is 6 with four cards in the pile. Now let&rsquo;s say Team B throws down a colored &lsquo;2&rsquo; to bring it down to a value of 4. Again there are no &lsquo;4&rsquo; cards and the lead team has to either use a &lsquo;5&rsquo; card or larger to take it. Let&rsquo;s say Team A throws down a black &lsquo;5&rsquo; and chooses to use that &lsquo;5&rsquo; to add to the pile instead of subtracting. Now the pile value is 9 and again there are no &lsquo;9&rsquo; cards in the deck, so Team B will be unable to take the pile at this point. Let&rsquo;s say they throw down an &lsquo;8&rsquo; card bringing the pile value to 1. Team A decides to take the pile with a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo;, thus gaining 7 more point from this pile.. The hand will continued to be played until either all the cards are used up, or nobody is able to play a card. At that point the cards are reshuffled and dealt out with the team taking the last pile leading off. Team B&rsquo;s strategy is to keep the pile value so high that the other team will not be able to match or exceed its value, thus giving them the pile and becoming the lead team for the next round.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wars Cans is a multidimensional strategy game where your pieces move based on their composition. Whoever is at the top of a stack controls the entire stack. The game is over when only one player is able to move. Each game is unique as the board layout is randomized and evolves as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;Objective: To keep your opponent from moving.&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player starts with 8 pieces placed on the board as shown below.&#10;&#10;Board: The board is made up of 40 black squares overlaid with 40 green tile squares as shown above. Pieces can move across black squares, but can never land on them. Green tiles are removed from the board when a piece or stack of pieces moves off the green tile. A black square is exposed when a green tile is removed. Each black square counts as a move when passing over the square. Below are two examples of green tiles that have been removed in some opening moves.&#10;&#10;Pieces: A single piece can move one space in any direction,as long as it doesn&rsquo;t land on a black square. Pieces can land on other pieces, both their own and their opponent&rsquo;s. When one piece combines with another piece, whether it be their own, or an opponent&rsquo;s piece it gains the ability to move another space in any direction. Every piece in a stack enables the stack to move that number of spaces. For instance, if a stack has 3 pieces it can move 3 spaces as shown in the figure below. Pieces must always move in a straight line.&#10;&#10;Capturing and Releasing: When a piece is placed on top of an opponent&rsquo;s piece or stack that piece, or stack belongs to the one with their piece on top of the stack. If a the top piece of a stack is moved from the stack and the piece on the top of the remaining stack is the opponent&rsquo;s then the stack goes to the opponent.  Below are two showing a before and after example of a player capturing another player&rsquo;s pieces.&#10;&#10;Winning: When a player is unable to move the game is over and the one who made the last move wins. Below is an example of a game played out with black winning.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Last Move Wins!&#10;&#10;Making the last move is how you win this game. Each player has six cubes that can slide, push and spin. Each cube starts out with the ability to move in three different directions; horizontally, vertically or diagonally. All 12 cubes will remain on the board throughout the game whether they are able to move or not. Cubes must always move in a straight line and cannot pass another cube diagonally if that cube&rsquo;s side comes in contact. A cube may not jump over another cube, or land on top of another cube. A cube loses a direction of movement as indicated by colored triangle when a cube from the other player is pushed into it. It is possible to engage more than one cube at a time. Cubes without colored triangles are considered dead and are unable to move on their own, though it can be pushed by other cubes. Cubes can push other cubes, both their own or their opponent, but for this to happen there must be more triangles pointing in the direction of the push than there are triangles opposed to the push. If two cubes have opposing triangles that point into each other, they cancel each other out and there is no push either way. Cubes may not pull another cube. Cubes can only move forward in the direction of the 90 degree triangles. Triangles can turn a round when they reach the three gray squares at each end, and can move back and forth from those gray squares. When a player runs out of moves the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Object of the game:&#10;The object is to capture your opponent&rsquo;s four kings. What might feel like an advanced form of checkers will surprise you in its complexity of moves and strategy. It requires a nimble mind and the forward thinking of a chess player. Be alert because the balance of power can shift very quickly in this game.&#10;&#10;Game basics:&#10;Each player starts out with 4 kings and 13 squires. Kings must always stay on white squares and squires must always stay on brown squares. Only squires can capture kings and only kings can capture squires. Capture happens when a king or squire moves into an adjacent space that shares the same sides. Both kings and squires can jump forward if they have a piece to jump over. They can jump over their own pieces or their opponent&rsquo;s pieces, or a combination of both. When a player&rsquo;s king or squire reaches the opponent&rsquo;s side of the board their king changes into an emperor or their squire changes into a knight. These changes give the pieces enhanced abilities to move. It is possible to reach the opposite side of the board in one jump, or a combination of multiple jumps in a single turn.&#10;&#10;Examples of moves:&#10;&#10;     A silver squire moves into an adjacent space to capture an emperor. Squires must always move a forward motion and cannot move sideways.&#10;     A silver squire jumps over an opponent&rsquo;s squire and king to capture the king. Bridges can be formed from both a players pieces and an opponent&rsquo;s pieces.&#10;     A silver king makes multiple jumps to reach the opponent&rsquo;s side and change into an emperor and capture two silver squires. Capture only happens at the final resting point and not at each junction where a piece launches from one jumping point to the next.&#10;     A silver king traverses across two spaces to capture four gold squires. Kings, emperors and knights can traverse (go sideways) as long as there is not another piece blocking its path. A piece cannot jump over or go around pieces when traversing.&#10;     A gold squire makes two jumps to become a knight and capture two silver kings.&#10;     A silver knight traverses three spaces to capture two gold kings. When a squires changes into a knight it gains the ability to traverse and move forward or backwards. When a king changes into an emperor it can also move forward or backwards, but it also has the ability to jump to the next row of white spaces without needing a bridge.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The once peaceful Aderstrom has become a world full of darkness torn apart by the violent struggle for dominance. Amid this darkness one beacon of hope has arisen. Thea, using the same power of the world&rsquo;s core, fights to redeem her world from the chaos that now prevails.&#10;&#10;In Massive Core, players use a leader deck representing a faction from Aderstrom.  The players create a &ldquo;board&rdquo; using locations cards and leader cards to create a 5 x 5 grid.  They then battle each other by playing characters, some revealed and some unrevealed, and blasts to do damage to their opponent&rsquo;s forces and CoreTap.  If a player can do 24 damage to the opponent&rsquo;s CoreTap, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;Massive Core is a free print and play game released with a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

    "Description": "The Darkwoods is no more a forest than a mountain is a hill, or an ocean a pond. It ranges all of northern Trudvang east of the Great Iron Tooth, south of the Great White. A bird might ride thermals forever above a sea of green that stretches beyond every horizon and never find its borders. A squirrel might run from the Great Iron Tooth to Icepeak Mountain leaping from branch to branch, never touching the ground below. Clearings dot the map where trees as large as castles topple, quickly overgrown by hungry young saplings, eager for light. The twilight world beneath the boughs can match any cavern for gloom or any tomb for silence.&#10;&#10;Cartographers distinguish between the Darkwoods and the Eastern Darkwoods, but these are mere lines on mortal maps, fragile and brief. The Darkwoods stood when the world was wrought and will stand when Trudvang ends. The Darkwoods lives and breathes, and while roads and trails might crisscross the land between the trunks, take ten paces off the path in any direction, and you look upon a place that has never known the tread of mortalkind, not since the first of us blinked in the young sun&rsquo;s dawn.&#10;&#10;The Darkwoods is not unknowable, but it holds its secrets dear. Even seasoned Elven rangers with centuries behind them will speak of forgotten wonders and unknown horrors concealed in the stillness. It&rsquo;s a hinterland, a wild land, not an enemy to mortalkind, but no friend either for travelers unprepared for its challenges. The Darkwoods does not suffer fools, no matter how kindly intentioned. The Darkwoods watches.&#10;&#10;Trudvang Legends: Darkwoods is an expansion that features a brand-new campaign that brings players a branching story inside the large and eerie Darkwoods Forest, a majestic albeit sinister woods where darkness broods. Rumors have it that a demon has taken refuge in its depths, twisting and manipulating creatures, terrorizing all who come near it. It's up to you to investigate the source of this rumours, and to try and survive the expedition itself! In addition, features a brand new playable Class, the Demon Hunter, who masters the dark forces and twists the limits between good and bad.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Storm Over Europe is a grand strategic game, that recreates the entire European conflict during the Second World War. Designed with wooden pieces are used to depict resources, that depending on placement, represent air, land, and sea units.&#10;&#10;Play the entire war, starting from January 1939 to the bitter end of Spring 1945 or later, can be played in 4-6 hours for a scenario and 10-15 hours for a the full campaign. No hexes, no counters, and low luck.&#10;&#10;The map board employs area movement over land regions but the low unit density allows players to realize the full impact of mobile warfare and appreciate the daunting size of Mother Russia without slowing gameplay unnecessarily. A unique front-reserve combat system allows for operational level details like blitzes, assaults, encirclements, feints, static defense, and defense in depth which are normally lost in grand-strategic simulations.&#10;&#10;Units are rated by movement, but attrition, assault, and blitz strength. Elite units are created by combat experience, events, and tech research - introducing an extra dimension as units are upgraded and downgraded throughout the war, reflecting varying levels of experience, training, leadership, and technology.&#10;&#10;Production: Storm Over Europe goes beyond the standard model of linking military production to a GDP estimate. Nations must mobilize to achieve full wartime production but it takes much more to wage war than just massive production lines. Manpower, oil, steel, and even trained pilots are all tracked without ANY bookkeeping through an innovative system of collecting resources as strategy cards are played. Resources are consumed by prolonged offensives so logistics plays just as much a factor as unit strength.&#10;&#10;Strategy Cards: Storm Over Europe is a card driven game (i.e. Paths of Glory). Events introduce historical and political events in a realistic fashion while eliminating scripting and &quot;look up&quot; rules. There is a tangible cause-effect relationship to every event and nothing occurs in a seemingly random or ahistorical manner. Players play the cards - the cards don't play the players. Most importantly, the core mechanic of tough gut wrenching decisions which make CDGs so fun is still preserved.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of your shift you'll dispatch a team of servers to the different food stations, gathering the items needed, to complete your Monstomers' orders.&#10;&#10;As you serve the Monstomers they will give you tips in the form of chocolate chip cookies based on their happiness level. However, with each passing round, the Monstomers get more and more frustrated waiting for their food and will leave smaller tips. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll leave the restaurant if they are not served fast enough. If that happens, plan on giving Harry some of your cookies. Harry doesn't like to lose Monstomers.&#10;&#10;Sounds simple, right? Not so fast, because you&rsquo;re not the only lead server working tonight. You'll be competing with other players who are trying to serve their Monstomers as well. Spaces are limited. The orders are piling up. It may be wise to share some of your cookies with the chefs, so you get the food you need first. If all goes well at the end of the night, you'll be the player with the most cookies to win the game.&#10;&#10;",
