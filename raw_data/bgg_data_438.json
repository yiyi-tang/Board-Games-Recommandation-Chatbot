The game has 400 question cards in 3 categories: numbers, cities, people. Furthermore there is a board with a 8x8 grid, containing symbols of the 3 categories and 64 chips, grey on one side, black on the other.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game 2 gray and 2 black chips are placed in the middle of the board. If you have 4 players, you'll play in 2 teams. On your turn you place a chip in your color on the board next to one of your opponent. Your goal is to capture your opponents chips.&#10;&#10;How is that done? First you try to close your opponents chips in. For that you need to have your chips on both sides of your opponents. This can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Then you try and capture the chip(s) by answering a question. When answered correct, the opponents chip(s) are turned over. When answered incorrect, nothing happens and your opponent takes his/her turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the board is full or when no player can place a chip or when all chips are one color. The player with the most chips up, wins.&#10;&#10;",

The period covered runs from the late 1950&rsquo;s onwards, and allows also for the use of aircraft and helicopters.&#10;&#10;An important aspect of the rules is that the units can start as unidentified &ldquo;blips&rdquo;, which might be dummies, and there is a simple detection and identification system that changes the status to &ldquo;contact&rdquo; (detected as an enemy vessel) and &ldquo;target&rdquo; where the model is deployed. If you can get out of radar &ldquo;sight&rdquo; then you can revert to &ldquo;blip&rdquo; status again.&#10;&#10;The shooting system allows for guns and missiles of various types, and damage is recorded in a graded system with 5 states from intact to sunk. Vessels can take Special hits when damaged which further degrade their ability. There are simple rules for operating helicopters from ships, as well as rules for anti aircraft fire with guns and missiles.&#10;&#10;There are also additional rules for unconventional craft, mine warfare and operations against coastal targets.&#10;&#10;They are rounded off with extensive data tables for missiles, torpedoes, guns, rockets, SAM systems, Air to Air missiles, ships, helicopters and aircraft.

Each player is dealt a card and looks at it secretly.&#10;&#10;When it is a player's turn, that player returns the card to the bottom of the pile and draws another if it is not a gunman or a sheriff. If a player has a gunman, that player can choose to eliminate another player by saying, &quot;Stick 'em Up!&quot; If the chosen player responds by revealing a card whose cowboy doesn't have his hands up that player is eliminated.

They are specifically designed for jet versus jet combat and unlike other products that go into too much detail, each player can handle several aircraft. The rules operate in three dimensions while only physically using two, height being indicated beside an aircraft.&#10;&#10;There are guns, air to air rockets, Infra Red and Radar guided air to air missiles, SAM sites, etc. Data for over 200 aircraft in use by many nations from the 1950&rsquo;s onward are included.&#10;&#10;The skill of aircrew is very important and the system provides for this. The players can decide how good the crew are by deciding the level of training they think is appropriate, though a random system for skill generation is also provided.&#10;&#10;Radar and electronics are handled within the rules by means of a Tech Level system that allows for systems to be improved or obsolete within the game, but without extra complication. Ground attacks are possible as part of the game mission mix, though the effect of the attack will depend on using the right weapon. SAM and AAA sites are also included.&#10;&#10;Note&#10;&#10;The game rules were developed specifically with jet fighters in mind and the data calculation reflects this. We took a decision NOT to include propeller driven aircraft (with a very few specific exceptions), and this has provoked comment from some users, especially if fighting the Korean war.&#10;&#10;Summary of Contents&#10;&#10;INTRODUCTION: Scales; Definitions and concepts; Technology Levels; Designers&rsquo; Notes&#10;&#10;MEN AND MACHINES: Aircrew Training and  Skills; Skill Rolls; Dazed, Wounded or Dead Aircrew; Crew Survival; Aircrew Experience; Aircraft Capability; Equipping Stores; Miscellaneous Stores; Jettisoning Stores; Destruction of Aircraft&#10;&#10;SETTING UP A GAME, DEPLOYMENT: Points Values; Organizing a Game; Starting the Game; Deploying Surface Targets; Deploying aircraft; Off Table Reserves; Air Superiority Missions; Ground Attack Missions; Intrusion Missions; Interception Missions; Rearming and Repairs; Victory and Defeat&#10;&#10;SEQUENCE OF PLAY: Ending the Game; Summary of Crew Activities and Skill Rolls&#10;&#10;FLIGHT FUNDAMENTALS: Formations and Movement; The Effect of Altitude on Performance; Speed and Fuel Use; Order of Movement Actions; Movement; Turning; Effects of Damage on Turning; Climbing; Zoom Climb; Climbing Half Loop; Diving; Diving Half Loop; Displacing Models and mid air collisions&#10;&#10;GAME ARCS&#10;&#10;RADAR AND DETECTION: Contact Markers; Detection&mdash;Visual; Detection&mdash;Search Radar; Detection of Objects on the Ground; Losing Contact&#10;&#10;SHOOTING GUNS AND AIR TO AIR ROCKETS: Guns; Arcs of Fire; Lines of Fire; Target Priority and Timing; Aircrew Shooting; Shooting Procedure; Modifiers; Hitting the Target; Multi-barrel weapons; Automatic Hit Bonus; Ammunition Supply; Damaging the Target; Critical Hits; Effect of Formations on Shooting; Air to Air salvo rockets; AIR-2 Genie air to air nuclear missile&#10;&#10;SHOOTING AIR TO AIR MISSILES: Air to Air Missiles; Obtaining a Lock; Losing a Lock; ECM Aircraft; Breaking a Lock; Firing Missiles; Damaging the Target&#10;&#10;ATTACKING A SURFACE TARGET: Spotting the Target; Identifying the Target; Attack and Ammunition Types; Attacking an Identified Target; Defensive Fire; Attacking an Unidentified Target; Ground defenses; Unlisted Air to Ground Weapons&#10;&#10;GROUND DEFENSES: AAA Guns; Air defense Zones; SAM Batteries&#10;&#10;AIRCRAFT DATA: Understanding the Aircraft Data Tables; Filling in the Aircraft Record Sheets; Data for Civilian and Transport Aircraft; Data for Combat Aircraft; Aircraft in Action&#10;&#10;TABLES: Payload types and location; Miscellaneous Equipment; Surface to Air Missiles; Air to Air Missiles; Air to Surface Weapons&#10;&#10;1 AND 2 SEATER RECORD SHEET; LARGE AIRCRAFT RECORD SHEET&#10;&#10;",

The ball may move neither on the game field border nor on the segments marking the past moves but it bounces from them, i.e. a player who moves the ball into a position where there is already an end of a segment or a game field border gets another turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to place the ball in the opponents goal wins the game. The game may also end when a player does not have a valid move (he or she loses automatically).&#10;&#10;",

Each column has a blank space on either end (starting spaces), one blue space with a picture of a grenade, one red space with a picture of a bomb, and 4 spaces with a picture of a different target (there are 6 different targets).&#10;&#10;You move up and down the columns according to dice rolls (each pawn staying in its column) trying to collect weapons. When two of your tokens land on matching weapon spaces, you collect a weapon - take a blue chip for a grenade and a red chip for a bomb. You collect two weapons (chips) of the appropriate color if you end your movement with all three pawns on spaces picturing the same weapon. If you land on your opponent, send them back to their start space.&#10;&#10;Before rolling the dice on your turn, you can turn up a target card. Up to two target cards may be face up at one time. Each card shows a picture of a target and the 'cost' in weapons to successfully attack it. If you don't have the the weapons to successfully attack it, you lose all your weapons. If you 'Double land' (as described to collect weapons) on a target that is face-up, you attack it. You 'pay' the proper weapons to collect the target card. If you turn up a 'sabotage' card, you lose all of your weapons. First to collect 6 target cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

To defeat  the enemy, you must either sink his flagship or immobilize his fleet.&#10;&#10;Flagships has one basic rule: ships may be sunk only by a superior force, either a single more powerful ship &#10;attacking by right or a joint force of ships, one of equal power to the target ship attacking with the support of any other member of its fleet. No ship may ever sink a more powerful ship, even during group action.&#10;&#10;Each player commands a fleet of nine warships: one flagship, two frigates, two sloops and four corvettes.&#10;Only a flagship may sink the enemy flagship, and only if it has the required support.  &#10;Frigates, dominant in an open sea, can lose maneuverability as the fleets close for action.  &#10;Sloops, wayward and easily outflanked, can also be unreliable in support.  &#10;Corvettes, vulnerable at the outset, can determine the outcome of the closest battle.&#10;&#10;Playing on a hexagonal shaped hex board of 37 hexagons, the two fleets are disposed as if sailing from opposite directions;&#10;Each player in turn moves one piece in any permitted direction, moving from one hexagon to the next across their common dividing line. Lateral movements (north/south) are called movements abeam. Diagonal movements are called movements forward or astern&#10;&#10;The various ships move as follows:&#10;Flagship   One space forward or astern or any number of spaces abeam&#10;Frigate     Any number of spaces forward, astern or abeam&#10;Sloop       Any number of spaces forward or astern, never abeam&#10;Corvette   Any number of spaces in an arc around any adjacent space&#10;&#10;Sinking:&#10;i) A ship is sunk by any enemy ship of superior power moving onto its space, and is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;(ii) A ship may be sunk by any enemy ship of equal power moving onto its space, provided the &#10;attacking ship is supported by another member of its fleet, the support ship being in a position &#10;adjacent to the target vessel and on course to occupy its space.&#10;&#10;(iii) No ship may sink a vessel of superior power, even during group action.&#10;&#10;Support:&#10;Support is only provided by vessels lying adjacent to the target vessel. Sloops may not support an attack while lying abeam of the target because they may neither move nor attack in that direction. Flagships may not support whilst disabled.&#10;&#10;Disabling:&#10;A flagship is disabled by any two enemy ships being in spaces adjacent to its own (even by sloops in positions abeam). Whilst disabled, a flagship may neither move, attack nor support an attack by any other vessel, but may form part of a cordon disabling the opposing flagship.&#10;&#10;Winning:&#10;Sink the enemy flagship or leave your opponent with no legal move.&#10;&#10;",

Army lists are provided for Philippian/Alexandran Macedonian; Late Achaemenid Persian; Roman Marian/Caesarian; Celtic/Gallic Barbarian; Norman Conquest; and Late Saxon armies.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence is determined through an initiative system.  Armor and Shield protection is key to defining defensive capabilities.  Multiple categories of mounted, infantry and missile troops are distinguished.  Leadership is represented through several tiers of Leaders.&#10;&#10;The system is primarily geared for 25/28mm figures.  Conversion instructions are included for 15mm and 40mm armies.  Armies usually compose from 100 to 300 figures per side; the standard system figure ratio is 1?40.&#10;&#10;Army statistics, including General characteristics, War Machine attributes and Army List Templates are recorded on copies of forms provided with the rules.  Referral to these lists suffice for determining combat and morale outcomes in a game. Games featuring armies of this size can be completed in three to four hours once the system is understood.&#10;&#10;Publisher website: www.battlestandard.com&#10;&#10;",

According to the description, the original title of this game from Derek Carver was &quot;Loot&quot;.&#10;&#10;6 or 8 (!) players start with 2 treasure hunters and 1 guard in the middle the board to search for 16 treasures of different value. The board has 8 rings with an increasing number of spaces on them; the 16 treasures are placed at some of the 28 outer spaces of the board.&#10;&#10;The tokens can have 4 different colors and 4 different shapes in a 8-player's game (3 and 3 in a 6-player's game), but each player has 3 equal tokens. That means, one player may have 3 blue round tokens, another 3 red square tokens, a next 3 yellow hex tokens, and so on - each color and shape on a total of 6 tokens.&#10;&#10;Unique is the idea, that treasures can only be dug out by more than 1 player! How many and what kind of tokens are needed, is marked on each treasure chest, which covers the treasure (e.g. 3 tokens of different shape, or 4 tokens of 4 different colors).&#10;&#10;Once, a treasure is dug out, it belongs to the whole group of tokens, but it must be transported back to the middle of the game board, where only 1 player can claim it. Needless to say, that several alliances, (broken) promises and other bluffs are usual, especially since the guard pieces can attack the hunters to steal the treasures from them.&#10;&#10;The game ends, when all treasures are dug out, or when one player has claimed a certain amount of treasures - or when a certain time limit is reached.&#10;&#10;",

However. there&rsquo;s a Monster in the cabbage field that needs to be fed. If everyone ignores the Monster, it&rsquo;ll get so hungry that it&rsquo;ll eat everyone (Everyone loses the game if this happens.). That means that you have to balance your need to harvest cabbages with the threat of letting the Monster in the Cabbages eat everyone.&#10;&#10;On your turn you can Harvest Cabbages or Feed the Monster.&#10;&#10;If you choose to Harvest Cabbages, roll two dice and add them to your score (under Cabbages).&#10;&#10;If you choose to Feed the Monster remove a die from the Monster Cup, mark a Feeding on your paper, then roll the dice in the Monster Cup (see below for the possible ramifications of this).&#10;&#10;If the Monster Cup is between you and the next player at the end of your turn, it gets to take a turn. On the Monster Cup&rsquo;s turn, add a die to it, then roll the dice in the Monster Cup.

Ties go to the player with the least number of feedings removed.&#10;3 or 4: The player who did the most feedings wins. Ties go to the player with the least cabbages.&#10;5 or 6: Multiply your cabbages by your number of feedings. If your result is the biggest, you win. Ties are shared victories.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Universal Soldier Miniature Rules (1977, RAFM) is a stand-alone comprehensive set of rules for wargaming with military miniatures (25mm or 15mm). The emphasis of the rules is to provide a method for fighting battles with both historical and fictional armies. The rules include simple, easy to remember, combat and missile fire systems that use six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Chapters cover how to form units, orders, movement, missile fire, melee combat, morale, control, fatigue, and special weapons and tactics. There is some simultaneous movement allowed, which will sometimes require pro-rating moves to determine where units contact. Units are rated for attack and defense, using a letter system (&quot;A&quot; being the best, &quot;E&quot; being the worst). There are three ranges for missile-armed troops, as well as ammunition rules. About 6-24 six-sided dice are needed, depending on the size of the game. This is a casualty-removal system. There is a point system for designing games with balanced sides.&#10;&#10;Most of the examples and scenarios are from the late medieval / early renaissance period, but the rules can be applied to earlier periods.&#10;&#10;Although an old set of rules, it was a good miniatures rules set for new players that wanted to try tabletop miniatures wargaming, and less complex than other contemporary miniatures rules of the time that covered the ancient through medieval periods.&#10;&#10;RAFM actively promoted these miniatures rules through the 1980's at major conventions, such as ORIGINS, as well as historical miniature shows (such as HISTORICON) by hosting historical-based battles.&#10;&#10;",

There are 2 sets of 24 blocks made of reclaimed wood, a base with a 5&times;5 grid, and two bags for each player's blocks.&#10;The idea in placing a block is to set yourself up with as many future options as possible while trying to eliminate placement options for the opponent.&#10;This game is an excellent tool for teaching small motor skills and spatial recognition.  It can be played by children age 6 and up.  It's one of those games that take 5 minutes to learn, and a lifetime to master.  It offers great replayability as each game is short, and each tower you build is unique.&#10;&#10;",

Scale is 1:1200 (60 inches = 1 mile).&#10;&#10;Ten-sided dice are needed, as well as a random direction die or spinner. A ruler or tape measure is also required. Turn rate templates are provided, as well as status sheets that can be photocopied and used to record ship abilities.&#10;&#10;The rules cover initiative, movement, fire, ramming, boarding parties, morale, fires, and naval versus land combat. Comes with reference charts, ship rosters with their game capabilities, and many ship templates.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Holy Hack - Hacking by the Book (1996, Black Falcon Publications) is one of the &quot;Hack&quot; miniatures rules set, but this rules set specifically covers ancient warfare in the Biblical period. The rules are for either 25mm or 15mm miniatures, and while it recommends a basing system that is common with several other miniature rules sets (such as DBA, DBM, WRG 7th Edition, and WARRIOR), it allows for the use of any existing basing system the players currently use (an important consideration for miniature owners looking into a new rules set).&#10;&#10;The rules cover the organization of miniatures into units, the variety of formations possible, and the importance of leaders and morale. Units are issued order chits (or blanks to confuse the opponent) at the beginning of the turn sequence, which commits units to specific actions for that turn. Orders are revealed simultaneously. The rules cover charges, movement, missile fire, and melee. Both missile and melee combat use damage tables with modifiers to determine casualties, which are converted into a percentage. Percentage dice (2 x D10's) are used to determine if a percentage fraction &quot;hits&quot; or not.&#10;&#10;Although the rules use a casualty removal system, the most a side can lose is 3 figures per missile or melee round. Morale has a strong influence in the game, and the side that can force more morale tests upon his opponent will often win the game.&#10;&#10;The rules come with  a sheet of order chits/status markers, which can either be cut out or photocopied (using different colored paper can help to further distinguish the orders or unit status at a glance). This is not as complex a set of miniature rules as compared to Warrior: Miniature Wargame Rules for Ancient and Medieval Warfare 3000BC to 1485AD, but it can get a bit involved for new players.&#10;&#10;",

In one spot, one man can be matched with a suitable woman. Matches are determined by having at least two matching characteristics with both the location and the partner. These can be different, though. Players always have four characteristics, locations have two to six. There are influence cards which can break up matches as well as destroy them. Thankfully there are also other cards which offer protection against jealousy. The first player to reach a pre-set number of matches wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game will be bilingual (German / English) and come with 120 individually illustrated cards. Since most will recognize the characters, it will be great fun to match those who might not seem to be such a good match to start.&#10;&#10;",
