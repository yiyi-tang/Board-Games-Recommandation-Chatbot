    "Description": "Following a series of calamities that left civilization in shambles, societies around the world are being rebuilt anew in harmony with nature. Scotland lies in ruins and the ancient clans have taken it upon themselves to restore the land. As clan leaders you will compete for strategic control of the land by rebuilding its prestigious castles.&#10;&#10;Rebirth is a new, tile-laying game from Reiner Knizia. The game revitalizes this classic genre by combining Knizia&rsquo;s elegant mechanics with Mighty Boards&rsquo; evocative world building. The result is a eurogame with smooth gameplay, set in a lush and hopeful future.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players draw a tile from their supply and place it strategically on the board. These tiles represent your clan&rsquo;s contribution to rebuilding the land. Rebirth rewards strategic foresight and clever tactical play, with tougher decisions emerging over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Balduin, the house ghost, found an old camera in the castle cellar. Immediately he photographed everything that he loves to make disappear when he is haunting&thinsp; &ndash; including himself, of course. Unfortunately, the enchanted camera takes many photos in the wrong colors. Sometimes the green bottle is white, at other times it's blue. Looking at the photos, Balduin doesn't really remember any more what he wanted to make disappear next. Can you help him with his haunting and quickly name the right item, or even make it disappear by yourself? If you grab the right items quickly, you have a good chance of winning...&#10;&#10;The lightning fast shape and color recognition game that is sure to test the reflexes of kids, families and gamers alike. In Ghost Blitz, five wooden items sit on the table waiting to be caught: a white ghost, a green bottle, a cute grey mouse, a blue book, and a comfortable red chair. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way. With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?&#10;&#10;&#10;    If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book.&#10;&#10;&#10;The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected. Once the card deck runs out, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Knapp daneben, released in 2004 by HABA.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player can place whatever sum is rolled into an empty shape in a row that matches the color of one of the dice. Two rules must be followed when placing a sum in a row:&#10;&#10;&#10;    All numbers in a row must increase from left to right.&#10;    No number can be repeated in a vertical column.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player does not have to enter the number in a row, but if the active player, the one who rolled the dice, doesn't do so, then they must mark a misthrow box on their scoresheet.&#10;&#10;The game continues until someone has filled two rows on their scoresheet or someone has tallied four misthrows. Players then tally their points: For each completed column on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the number in that column's pentagon. For each completed row on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the rightmost number in that row. For each incomplete row on their scoresheet, a player scores one point per number in that row. For each misthrow, a player loses five points. Whoever has the highest sum wins!&#10;&#10;",

In each game of ROVE, the player will face a series of mishaps that can only be solved by arranging the 6 module cards in a specific pattern. Moving a module requires Movement Points gained by discarding cards from hand for the listed amount. Players may gain additional Points if their current module layout matches the pattern shown on the discarded card.&#10;&#10;Each module costs 1 Movement Point per activation and uses its own unique movement style, such as only moving diagonally or pushing other modules a single space. Modules also have powerful single-use abilities that can help get players out of a tight spot. Properly timing these abilities -- as well as effectively using the limited number of Movement cards -- will help the player complete ROVE&rsquo;s mission successfully.&#10;&#10;",

There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is &quot;lynched&quot;, reveals their role, and is out of the game.

Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.&#10;&#10;Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.&#10;&#10;2015 edition:&#10;The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem. Whoever scores the most gem-points after nine rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you in the cockpits of the world&rsquo;s best Close Air Support aircraft. In Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll zoom through canyons hunting enemy tanks and troops while dodging their AAA fire and SAMs.&#10;&#10;Stuffing all this heavy metal in one box has allowed us to expand the normal Leader component set! This game comes with 168 cards and 5 counter sheets!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you down in the weeds in 8 campaigns spanning the globe. The game system creates immense replayability by pairing a Tactical Situation card with the Campaign card to create a unique environment for the campaign. This means that your campaign in North Korea might be part of a Holding Action, Show of Force, Rapid Deployment, or General War.&#10;&#10;The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridge-line to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!&#10;&#10;You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, S.P. Artillery, APC, Infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft.&#10;&#10;While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy SAM and AAA assets?&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy tanks before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it won&rsquo;t be able to fly the next day.&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader or Phantom Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Thunderbolt-Apache Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following aircraft:&#10;A-10A Thunderbolt II&#10;A-10C Thunderbolt II&#10;AH-64A Apache&#10;AH-64D Apache Longbow&#10;AH-1 Cobra&#10;F-16 Fighting Falcon&#10;AV-8B Harrier II&#10;AC-130 Spectre&#10;RQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;MQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;&#10;Scheduled Campaigns:&#10;Iraq 1991&#10;Pakistan 2013&#10;Libya 1984&#10;Iran 2014&#10;Taiwan Defense 2008&#10;North Korea 2011&#10;Israel Defense 2001&#10;North Atlantic WWIII 1986&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following weapons: Mk.82 Iron Bomb, Mk.83 Iron Bomb, AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-92 Stinger, LAU-68, LAU-61, ECM Pod, AGM-114 Hellfire, AIM-9 Sidewinder, Mk.20 Rockeye&#10;&#10;Target Audience: &#10;This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played co-op (like our other Leader games) by splitting-up the aircraft and planning/resolving missions as a team.&#10;&#10;Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each campaign consists of 2 to 6 turns in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each day.&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Thunderbolt/Apache Leader&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The Black Death reaches Europe, and during the next 4-5 years, the population of Europe will be halved.&#10;The players settle in the various regions of Europe, while the plague spreads throughout all of the continent. The players gain help from the various classes of the middle ages: the Peasants provide population growth, the wise Monks keep the rats away, the rich Merchants flee when the plague approaches, the warfare conducted by the Knights spreads the plague to new areas, the Witches control the spread through magic and witchcraft, whereas the Kings avoid the plague by staying in their fortified palaces. But the plague does not make any distinction: when the rats arrive, no one can feel safe. &#10;When the plague withdraws and the game ends, the player with the highest surviving population wins.&#10;&#10;Rattus is a medium-strategy game that takes place in the Dark Ages during the black plague.

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The next great technological revolution is here. Sentient robots for information, transportation, industry &mdash; all at our fingertips. Building them is now the easy part. Programming them has proven to be more complicated. A handful of companies have emerged claiming to pull it off, but only one will win out. Your mission is clear: Procure valuable bots and plug them into your network. They'll have an effect on your systems. Anticipate it correctly, program your bots effectively, and attract the right investors to win and lead the sentient revolution.&#10;&#10;In Sentient, players are tasked with choosing from available robots to program in their factory. Each robot that is added modifies your board and attracts the interest of investors for your company. Program your bots efficiently and collect the support of your patrons to build the most formidable operation.&#10;&#10;Description from GTS article:&#10;&#10;Sentient is a dice-manipulation game by J. Alex Kevern (World&rsquo;s Fair 1893, Gold West). As with his other games, Sentient is filled with smart, simple, and rewarding choices. Each turn involves choosing an available bot, adding it to your factory, and deciding how to divide your resources between optimizing your bot and wooing investors. Players who enjoy a satisfying puzzle will appreciate the difficulty in adding the chosen bot to their factory. Each slot has a die on either side that will be modified based on the chosen bot card. But, adding another adjacent bot the next turn will modify the dice once again. The dice at the end of the round will determine how efficiently your bots were programmed and will grant you varying points based on the dice numbers. You may have everything perfectly sorted out &mdash; that is, until the last bot you choose changes the adjacent dice. Your plan can crumble and points can easily be lost with an errant decision or wrong choice!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Caught in an enigmatic storm, a modern-day luxury ocean liner crashes ashore on an otherworldly island. As one of the ambitious survivors, you soon learn that the island is home to a multitude of majestic and fiercely territorial dinosaurs. With the cruiser beyond repair, you have no choice but to establish a foothold on the island, withstand the onslaught of the dinosaurs, and sow the seeds of what will one day become a strong and tenacious community capable of discovering the mystery of the island.&#10;&#10;Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles introduces the first two episodes in a series of euro-style dice-drafting / dice-placement strategy games. The saga will ultimately consist of four episodes, telling the story of a group of survivors becoming a mighty civilization on a hostile island. As each episode features unique characteristics and a different game feel, they are playable as standalone medium/heavy games but also as a continuous campaign. The theme and story unfolds through evolving game mechanisms across the episodes, also making the rules easier to learn. In the campaign mode, the outcome of each episode influences the next, but the game has no legacy elements and no hidden rules; the whole storyline is infinitely replayable.&#10;&#10;In Episode 1, players are striving to develop and protect the foothold town of Perseverance, besieged by the dinosaurs of the island. By building walls, traps and settlements, mounting defenses and partaking in the early political power struggles of a forming community, players gain followers to establish themselves as leaders. Episode 1 introduces the signature dice placement / area majority mechanism that evolves and spans through the series, and also features a defense mechanism against waves of attacking dinosaurs, unique to this episode.&#10;&#10;In Episode 2, the survivors have successfully defended the city of Perseverance, completing a massive wall to stop the dinosaur onslaught. Under the guidance of the ship&rsquo;s senior officers, the players now set out to explore the surrounding wilderness, expand the settlement beyond the walls, and chart a path to the mysterious structure on the horizon. This Episode adds new actions to expand the core mechanism and allows for a deep customization of your Leader and faction through dozens of unique skills. The previous episode&rsquo;s defense mechanism evolves into hex-based adventuring and expansion, allowing you to build outposts beyond the city walls, but beware - the dinosaurs are still not your friends...yet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Volume V in GMT&rsquo;s COIN Series takes us back to the struggle of the American Patriots against their parent British government.   A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war.&#10;&#10;Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor.&#10;&#10;Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) &#10;    Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) &#10;    Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals)  for battles and skirmishes with line infantry &#10;    Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids&#10;    Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French &#10;    French blockades to confound British plans&#10;    French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort&#10;    A large deck of 110 + cards for great play variety &#10;    Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges:&#10;&#10;As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region.  With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will.  You will muster Tories to support your efforts.  They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover.  You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map.  The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive.  With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align.  Each leader brings something new to the war effort.  If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order.  If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up!&#10;&#10;As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army.  You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas.  Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars.  Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance.  Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive.  Will the French be there when you need them?  Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up.  Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British.&#10;&#10;As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British.  You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages.  The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region.  War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack?&#10;&#10;As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America.  With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection.  Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle.  You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British.&#10;&#10;As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent Commands and capabilities.  Rabble-rousing, Indian Raids, Persuasion, Naval Pressure, Letter of Marque, Looting, Trading, Skirmishing, and Foraging and more options are available.  Flow charts are at hand to run any faction short a player&mdash;solitaire, 2-player, 3-player, or 4-player experiences are equally supported.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;    A 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; mounted game board.&#10;    A deck of 110+ playing cards.&#10;    166 red, green, tan, blue, and white wooden playing pieces, some embossed.&#10;    6 black and 6 gray wooden pawns.&#10;    4 foldout Faction player aid sheets.&#10;    2 foldout Non-player Faction aid sheets.&#10;    2 Sequence sheets.&#10;    A Random Spaces sheet.&#10;    2 sheets of markers.&#10;    Rulebook.&#10;    Playbook.&#10;    1 black six-sided die&#10;    3 blue six-sided dice marked 1-3 twice. &#10;    3 red six-sided dice marked 1-3 twice.&#10;    9 plastic leader stands.&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Harold Buchanan&#10;SERIES DEVELOPER: Mike Bertucelli&#10;SOLITAIRE SYSTEM DEVELOPER: Orjan Ariander&#10;MAP ART: Terry Leeds&#10;COUNTER ART: Charles Kibler, Terry Leeds, and Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:    One year per Campaign between Winter Quarters&#10;MAP SCALE:     Area movement&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     1 to 4&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Edge of Darkness is the third Card Crafting Game from Alderac Entertainment Group designed by John D. Clair. Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style board game of 60 to 120 minutes for 1 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;Players are the heads of powerful guilds in the City. Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the City in a desperate struggle against great evil. But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.&#10;&#10;The Guilds exert their control in the city by sending agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions. Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of the City. Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to the City's infrastructure.&#10;&#10;To win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends. Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the City such as defending it from external and internal threats.&#10;&#10;Here are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Card Crafting: Similar to the original card-crafting game, Mystic Vale, all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on one third (1/3) of the slip and are transparent on the other two thirds (2/3). During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense). However, unlike Mystic Vale, the transparent cards are double-sided, and when you upgrade the &quot;good&quot; side of the cards (front), you also add strength to the &quot;bad&quot; side of the cards (back).&#10;     Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: Rather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to. Different players will have the allegiance of different cards in that deck. Using other players' cards means you have to pay them. During the game you can claim allegiance of more cards in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal.&#10;     Card-driven worker placement: While your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost. Advancements don't have a cost, instead they require the use of workers to a greater or lesser degree depending on the power of the card. e.g. many effects require placing or pulling workers from different city locations as dictated by the card effects. Since you have a limited number of workers to use, you will constantly be choosing to forgo one useful thing in order to do another.&#10;     Threat Tower:  There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and whom Threats will attack. Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Threat Board, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn. These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes of a given color accumulate on a card, it attacks the City. If the color matches one of the players, it attacks that player. If the color is black, it attacks all players!&#10;     Modular set up: Edge of Darkness will come with 12 Locations. Each game you use only 10 of these Locations, which can be specifically selected or chosen randomly, making for a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you will need to employ. These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Crafting Slips. Location Boards may specify special rules for worker placement, or extend the basic rules with all new systems. For example, a combination of Location Boards can be used to assemble a party of heroes to take the fight to the Threat Tower and engage in a Monster Hunt!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dungeon Twister is a 2-player high level strategy game where 2 teams of adventurers with various powers are trapped in a dungeon. The board is composed of 8 rooms that can be moved and rotated by the players. Each turn, a player is able to spend actions to move around the dungeon, pick up and use items, battle with the opponents team, or turn and move the rooms of the dungeon.&#10;&#10;The goal is to reach 5 victory points.  Points are collected by moving adventurers out of the dungeon or by killing an opponent's adventurer. Objects are disseminated across the whole dungeon and will bring the adventurers well-needed powers.&#10;&#10;Each player has the same characters, each with different powers. Some run fast, some fight or disarm traps. The cleric heals, magician burns everything in sight, and the goblin is so weak that the simple fact of getting him out will bring you two victory points.&#10;&#10;Combat and actions are managed via cards. To move, fight, heal, or turn a room, you must manage action points obtained by playing cards. Those cards are not drawn but selected from a set of cards by both players. Both players have access to the same panel of cards at the beginning of the game, so the game is really about managing the resources and adapting to the changing environment.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Twister is the original game in the Dungeon Twister series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;This year, we want the best, or nothing at all. We don't want tradition. We want to live in the present, and the only history that is worth a tinker's cuss is the history we make today.&quot; The famous founder is standing in front of his team giving a motivational speech. &quot;You all know our first customer was a lunatic, and the second had a death wish. So they bought our brakeless bangers. So there were a few accidents. But the only mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. This year, customers demand safety. Of course, active safety features include rapid acceleration for safe overtaking! I know it will be hard to add the new motorblock section to the factory, but before you say you cannot do something, try it! To every engineer, every planner, every mechanic, and every salesperson in this great company I say: If I can dream it, you can do it!&quot;&#10;&#10;Horseless Carriage is a game about the dawn of the automobile, a time when cars were invented, and no one quite knew yet what this new contraption would look like and what features would be essential. Early cars sometimes used levers or pedals to steer and a wheel to accelerate. Brakes were not always seen as essential, but sometimes an outside spot to take along an onboard mechanic was. This early, super innovative period occurs in the development of many new product categories. Players are cast as aspiring industrialists trying to find out what features the public will value when buying these new, expensive, and utterly unfamiliar horseless carriages.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BattleTech (aka &quot;BT&quot;) is a science-fiction tactical wargame in which players battle one another with various war machines.  The heart of the game is the &quot;BattleMech&quot; (aka Mech), a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own Mechs from scratch.  The game is typically played on one or more hex mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play.  An extensive line of pewter figurines (Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)&#10;&#10;As in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available.  The current versions are the BattleTech: Beginner Box (contains 2 plastic Mechs, a map, and simplified quick-start Mech rules). Designed to immediately follow this is the BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat box (8 plastic Mechs, mapsheets, cardboard Mech standees, and the full rules for Mechs and basic gear).  Lastly, the BattleTech: Clan Invasion box adds further Mechs and maps and slightly expands the rules to include more advanced technologies and unit types, while moving a player forward through the game's timeline.&#10;&#10;The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of rulebooks.  The primary ones are either Total Warfare, which covers combined arms (Mechs, combat vehicles, battle armor, aircraft etc), or the BattleTech: BattleMech Manual, which continues on from the introductory box sets in offering more advanced but still Mech-only play.  The rest of the current in-print rulebook line is covered below.&#10;&#10;BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history.  Accompanying these are pregenerated PDF record sheet collections, which have full gameplay statistics for each unit in a corresponding Technical Readout and are designed to be printed out for tabletop play.  Also common are map sets, which add additional mapsheets for scenario variety; era-based sourcebooks detailing the history and factions of the setting; and the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).&#10;&#10;For about six years the game was known as &quot;Classic BattleTech&quot;, to differentiate it from the WizKids-produced collectible miniatures game &quot;MechWarrior: Dark Age&quot;.  This branding has been long since abandoned and no longer appears on any products, but many BGG entries still feature it even if not applicable.&#10;&#10;Rulebooks&#10;&#10;     Total Warfare (standard game rules for the most common unit types)&#10;     BattleTech: BattleMech Manual (a Mech-only rulebook, but rewritten for clarity and featuring most relevant gear from Tactical Operations and Interstellar Operations)&#10;     TechManual (standard unit construction)&#10;     Tactical Operations: Advanced Rules (advanced ground rules)&#10;     Tactical Operations: Advanced Units &amp; Equipment (advanced equipment and unit construction)&#10;     Strategic Operations: Advanced Aerospace Rules&#10;     BattleTech: Interstellar Operations (era-specific equipment, various strategic wargaming rulesets)&#10;     Campaign Operations (rules for campaigns and running your own mercenary group)&#10;     A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (RPG rules)&#10;     A Time of War Companion (RPG supplement)&#10;     MechWarrior: Destiny (separate, narrative-style RPG)&#10;     BattleTech: Alpha Strike &#226;&#128;&#147; Commander's Edition (fast-play BT variant with simplified units and a higher unit count)&#10;&#10;&#10;Introductory Supplements&#10;&#10;     BattleTech Technical Readout: Succession Wars&#10;     Record Sheets: Succession Wars&#10;     Map Pack: Grasslands&#10;     BattleTech: Technical Readout &#226;&#128;&#147; Clan Invasion&#10;     Record Sheets: Clan Invasion&#10;&#10;&#10;Other Supplements (partial list)&#10;&#10;     BattleTech: Chaos Campaign&#10;     BattleTech: Battle of Tukayyid&#10;     BattleTech: MapPack &#226;&#128;&#147; Battle of Tukayyid&#10;     BattleTech: Shattered Fortress&#10;     BattleTech: Era Report &#226;&#128;&#147; 3052&#10;     BattleTech: Era Report &#226;&#128;&#147; 3145&#10;     BattleTech: Field Manual &#226;&#128;&#147; 3145&#10;&#10;&#10;Superseded Rulesets (partial list)&#10;&#10;     BattleTech: CityTech&#10;     AeroTech: The BattleTech Game of Fighter Combat&#10;     AeroTech 2&#10;     Classic BattleTech RPG&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba, home of legendary rum and birthplace of the revolution! The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.&#10;&#10;In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says &quot;broker&quot;, but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships &ndash; and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your &quot;connections&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, nine locals &ndash; the Cubans &ndash; are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.&#10;&#10;Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice &ndash; one for each type of good &ndash; then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.&#10;&#10;All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)&#10;&#10;If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods. If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place &ndash; unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.&#10;&#10;After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs. The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money.&#10;&#10;Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You and your opponent are rival time travelers trying to erase each other from history. To prove you are the one true inventor of time travel, you must use your invention to find your enemy in time and murder them &mdash; before they get you!&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, since your enemy has strewn many copies of themself across the timeline, you may have to do the terrible deed many, many times before it sticks. Just make sure you don't get erased first!&#10;&#10;That Time You Killed Me is an abstract narrative game of time and murder that introduces new scenarios with unique rules and components as you play. As with any game about mucking about across time, you must play through this content in a strict, unalterable order.&#10;&#10;To set up, place three game boards in a row to represent past, present, and future. Each player starts with a player piece in the same location on each 4x4 board, with the start player having their focus token in the past while the other has it in the future.&#10;&#10;On a turn, choose a single copy of yourself on the board where your focus token is located, then take two actions with this copy, with actions being movement to an adjacent orthogonal space, time travel forward to the next board (travel from the past to the future is not allowed), or time travel back to the previous board, leaving a copy of yourself in the current location when you do. Sure, you traveled to the past, but if you stick around long enough, you'll be right back where you started, so now you're there, too! At the end of your turn, move your focus token to a different board.&#10;&#10;Under the basic rules, you murder a copy of your opponent by pushing them into the wall of the game board. You have a limited number of copies of yourself in reserve, and murdered copies don't return to your reserve because that would be gross. If you run out of copies, you can no longer travel to the past since you can't leave a copy of yourself behind.&#10;&#10;If on your turn, your opponent has copies of themselves on only one board, you win!&#10;&#10;Play through four chapters of escalating difficulty, adding more wild time-travel shenanigans and unlocking more content as you master the game!&#10;&#10;",

The Subterra Bravo facility has been thrown into chaos through the players actions in [ESCAPE], and now the government has sent in a top-secret, highly-trained special forces unit to shut down the facility and eliminate everything remaining in the base.&#10;&#10;In [Omega Protocol], one player takes on the role of the Overseer while two to five other players take on the role of the elite Special Ops team. The Overseer's role in the game is to control all of the alien denizens and challenges the players face throughout the game. The players are trying to achieve specific scenario-based objectives by exploring a map that's laid out at the start and fighting off the hordes of aliens that the Overseer sends their way.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is based around adrenaline, which is the currency that the soldier players use to perform actions. They generate adrenaline to do things such as move, attack, and perform special actions like activating an objective space. That generation also has a negative effect for them, as that adrenaline transfers to the Overseer player, who then uses it to spawn aliens, create new threats, and hurt the soldiers' chance of success during the scenario. The more actions the Special Ops players take, the more resources the Overseer player has to work with.&#10;&#10;Characters in [Omega Protocol] are represented by miniatures, and each Special Ops and alien character has different attributes, powers, and customizable skills and equipment.&#10;&#10;",

To combat this threat, Lady Penelope, the Thunderbirds&rsquo; aristocratic English secret agent, and her chauffeur Parker lead a network of agents to uncover those behind the disasters caused by deliberate sabotage.&#10;&#10;A criminal mastermind known as &ldquo;The Hood&rdquo;, operating from a temple deep in the Malaysian jungle and in possession of strange powers, often engineers events to allow him to spy on the Thunderbird machines with the goal of selling their secrets to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;The iconic Thunderbirds are designed by the Tracy family&rsquo;s close friend &ldquo;Brains&rdquo; and are assigned to each of the five Tracy brothers:&#10;- Thunderbird 1, piloted by Scott Tracy &ndash; a hypersonic rocket plane used for fast response and rescue-zone reconnaissance, and as a mobile control base.&#10;- Thunderbird 2, piloted by Virgil Tracy &ndash; a supersonic VTOL carrier which transports their major rescue equipment in detachable pods.&#10;- Thunderbird 3, piloted by Alan Tracy &ndash; a single-stage, vertically launched spacecraft&#10;- Thunderbird 4, piloted by Gordon Tracy &ndash; a utility submersible for underwater rescue, launched from Thunderbird 2&#10;- Thunderbird 5, manned by John Tracy &ndash; a space station in geo-stationary orbit that monitors calls for help from across Earth.&#10;&#10;Finally, Lady Penelope has the iconic FAB 1, driven by Parker &ndash; a pink, amphibious car.&#10;&#10;Thunderbirds is a cult 1960s British science-fiction television series, created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. It was produced using a combination of marionette puppetry and scale-model special effects, which was dubbed &ldquo;Supermarionation&rdquo;. Two series, totaling thirty-two 50-minute episodes, were produced, along with two films using the same techniques.&#10;&#10;Players will work together using Thunderbirds characters and vehicles to complete rescue missions and save the day.&#10;&#10;",

You get three actions a turn to buy cards which then let you lay tiles to control land and herds, or you may buy extras, such as waterholes or the haciendas of the title to get bonus points.&#10;&#10;The game has two card decks, one showing the different land types on the hex map, the other the different animals (pigs, cows, horses and sheep). Some cards are laid face up and you pay 3 pesos to buy the ones you want, or 2 pesos for an unknown card from the draw deck. You spend the cards to put your markers on land and to place your animal tokens on the board. Animals of a type go together to make a herd naturally, and each time a herd touches a market town on the board, you earn money for the size of herd and land attached. With careful hand and herd management, you can make good cash gains and also block your opponents. You need the money to buy more cards of course. 12 pesos also buys waterholes you can place next to your herds, or haciendas to go on your land or herds. If you run short of money, you can call a harvest and get cash off your land.&#10;&#10;But the game is not about money. You score victory points halfway through the game and at the end. The more markets you are serving, the more points you get. The herds and the land get you points. The water and haciendas get you bonus points as well, which can be crucial to your success.&#10;&#10;It should be noted, the game board has two sides: a symmetrical dog-bone shape of land types (appears in most of the photos), and a &quot;random&quot; more varied pattern of land types.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.spielbyweb.com/ (turn-based)&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In the winter of 1848 a man building a sawmill on the South Fork of the American River spotted some bright nuggets in the tailrace waters below. Sure enough, it was gold! Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, word spread quickly and it triggered the California Gold Rush of &lsquo;49.&#10;&#10;Thousands of people arrived from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing boomtowns in the country. Claims were staked, camps and makeshift homes were built, and hotels and saloons sprung up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their cut of the land&rsquo;s wealth. For many it was Coloma or Bust!&#10;&#10;In the game of Coloma, you are a pioneer who has recently traveled out West to strike it rich and make a name for yourself. You will prospect for gold and use your windfalls to recruit workers, rustle up horses, and establish businesses. You will also get opportunities to explore the surrounding riverways and frontier lands. But alas! You are not alone&mdash;every other pioneer seems to have gotten the same idea! Therefore, it will take extra cunning tactics on your part to not go Bust with the rest of them&hellip;&#10;&#10;Overview of Play&#10;At the beginning of each chapter, you and the other players will simultaneously select an action to perform on the board. Once your selections are revealed, you must check if a majority of players chose the same action. If so, it is a Bust&mdash;which disables the Boom bonus that would be included otherwise. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons on the map, building bridges and businesses, and placing camps and gunmen. After that, a section of the board is rotated&mdash;slightly changing the layout of the actions for the upcoming chapter.&#10;&#10;When the rotating section hits high noon, the round ends with a bang: a shootout against an ever-growing number of outlaws! If you and the other players can outnumber the outlaws with your combined gunmen, you will get your fair share of the rewards. But if not, the rewards drop, and some of the gunmen will go to the graveyard... The game ends after the third shootout, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Coloma is a fast moving game with many paths to victory. It offers unique twists on simultaneous action selection, resource management, and engine-building. The town cards in your tableau allow you to play more efficiently, gain extra actions, and bend the rules to your advantage. With these cards and the bridge tiles (which add points based on what you achieve), you can create the perfect combination for your strategy and play style.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "20 Strong is a new deck-based game system from Chip Theory Games, capable of being played in about 30 minutes or less. We say &ldquo;game system&rdquo; because the idea behind 20 Strong is a small nucleus of simple, adaptable rules that can then be applied to a variety of unique decks, each with their own set of mechanics. We are launching 20 Strong with three such decks &ndash; one set in the world of Too Many Bones, one set in Hoplomachus: Victorum, and one in the new universe of the space-faring Solar Sentinels. We have more decks in development and plan to release them regularly if our customers are excited by them. For now, 20 Strong is a solo-only game, but even that could differ in future decks using the ruleset.&#10;&#10;The object of a game of 20 Strong is to progress through a shuffled deck of cards, each card bearing a unique challenge. This challenge could be in the form of an enemy, a unique scenario, or some other requirement (for example, players of the Too Many Bones deck might expect to see a Lockpicking challenge or two). Challenges usually require a certain number of successes to complete, which you earn by rolling a set of 17 dice with different odds for a hit (these dice, along with three adjustable stat dice, make up the &ldquo;20&rdquo; in 20 Strong).&#10;&#10;If you roll enough successes, you complete a card&rsquo;s challenge and gain its rewards. If you don&rsquo;t, you take damage and move on to the next card &ndash; unless, of course, your HP stat is reduced to 0, costing you the game. If you manage to make it through an entire deck, you take on one of the deck&rsquo;s final bosses, attempting to score enough hits against this powerful enemy to claim ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Of course, it&rsquo;s never so easy that you&rsquo;d want to spend all of your dice on a single card. In addition to your HP Stat, you&rsquo;re also keeping track of your Strategy (which controls how many rerolls and items you have) and your Recovery, which controls how many dice return to your pool after taking on a challenge. If you roll more dice than your Recovery, those dice are exhausted, lowering your pool for your subsequent challenges. It&rsquo;s a game of pressing your luck, strategic decision-making, and resource management. We think you&rsquo;re going to love it!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.&#10;&#10;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.&#10;&#10;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Featuring over 65 highly detailed miniatures, unique decks for fighters &amp; enemies, custom dice, and lightning-fast gameplay, Street Masters lets players match up powerful fighters against villainous organizations in a wide array of exciting scenarios. Designed by Adam Sadler and Brady Sadler, the game offers modular and elegant gameplay set in a unique and exciting world of brutal combat.&#10;&#10;THE STORY&#10;&#10;Warriors from around the world, known for their legendary fighting abilities and skills, receive mysterious invitations to participate in a martial arts tournament. During the tournament, the organization surrounding it reveals their true identity &mdash; The Kingdom &mdash; and their purpose to recruit fighters to join their militia or enslave those against them. While several of these warriors made it out in time, many were never heard from again.&#10;&#10;Five years later, a government project called &quot;Street Masters&quot; initiates in order to counter-act the war against The Kingdom, now having divided and seized control over the world by several of its factions. Those who join the Street Masters project must work together to take down each faction, crippling parts of The Kingdom before they're able to launch their end game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1888, and Steampunk technology has advanced at a prodigious rate! Probes have been sent to Mars, and soon astronauts will be manning rockets in order to mine the planet for newly discovered resources. The first is a brand new element, Celerium, that could prove to be a combustible energy source the likes man has never seen. The second is Sylvanite, an incredibly dense material unlike anything found on earth. In addition to these resources, glaciers have been discovered on the planet. Whoever controls these icy masses could work to create a livable atmosphere on Mars&#10;&#10;In Mission: Red Planet, players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials. Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources: Celerium, Sylvanite, or Ice. After rounds 5 and 8, players gain score tokens for every region where they control the majority of the astronauts. At the end of the game, players score one final time, adding any bonuses received from Discovery Cards and Bonus Cards. The player with the most score tokens at the end controls Mars, and all the riches it can bring!&#10;&#10;From Bruno Faidutti&#039;s website:&#10;&#10;This one, designed with Bruno Cathala, started with the theme. We wanted to make a game about colonizing Mars, with shuttles leaving the blue planet towards the red one. The theme is strong, and well caught in the steampunk graphic style decided by Asmod&#195;&#169;e. In Mission: Red Planet, each player plays a colonial power which sends astronauts, in space shuttles, to occupy the most promising zones on the planet. For scholars, the systems merge a majority game, &agrave; la El Grande or San Marco, with a character/action card system, somewhere between Citadels and Hoity Toity/Adel Verpflichtet. Nothing really new here, but there was much work on it and we're really proud of the result.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Machina Arcana, players take on the role of explorers who are investigating an ancient subterranean complex of unknown origin. They face monsters inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos in a steampunk setting. The adventurers collect equipment, interact and utilize their environment, fight monsters, and immerse themselves in the rich narrative elements.&#10;&#10;The complete story is broken down into different scenarios that represent a self-contained game. All of these scenarios contain chapters, each with its own narration and specifics. The objective of the game is to progress through the tale and face the endgame at the finale of each scenario.&#10;&#10;The main goal behind Machina Arcana is to provide players with a chilling game that can never be played the same way, mechanisms that enable varying strategies and approaches, and an extensive framework that combines everything smoothly. The game scales by default; there is no need for special conditions based on the player count. As the story progresses, so does your gear. But beware! If you are too slow, horror might very well prevail and devour you whole...&#10;&#10;The 2nd edition has a lot of improvement to the rules; as well as a new manual, new illustrations, new graphic design, and additional content. The 3rd edition includes no rule changes aside from rewordings to make the game more easier to understand, and to help the new players with the learning curve. On the other hand, the 3rd edition is the first one to offer other languages than English: French, German, Polish, and Spanish.&#10;&#10;For extensive list of changes check the changelog page:&#10;http://machinaarcana.com/changelog.html&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&#10;&#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Decorum is a cooperative, hidden information game where you and your partner share the same objective: decorate your home in a way that makes you both happy. The problem is, different things make each of you happy and nobody says exactly what they need. Can you find a happy compromise, or is it time to move out?!&#10;&#10;-Play through 30 unique scenarios, each introducing new twists and challenges.&#10;-Keep your conditions a secret, they say how you want the house decorated.&#10;-Add, remove, and swap objects or repaint rooms to make the house look just right&hellip; for you.&#10;-Respond with &ldquo;Love it&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hate it&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Fine with it&rdquo; to work together toward a perfectly decorated home.&#10;-There is a solution for each scenario, the trick is figuring it out in time.&#10;&#10;At its heart, D&eacute;corum is a pretty straightforward logic puzzle. There are a small number of ways to arrange the internal pieces that meet all the requirements listed on the player&rsquo;s rule sheets simultaneously. The twist of D&eacute;corum is that it&rsquo;s also a hidden information game. No player has all of the rules. While playing, the players will have to watch their partner&rsquo;s moves just as carefully as they&rsquo;re planning their own. Even more crucially, they&rsquo;ll have to communicate why they&rsquo;re making the moves they&rsquo;re making&ndash;using the very limited means we&rsquo;ve provided them.&#10;&#10;D&eacute;corum might be about solving a puzzle, but it&rsquo;s really a game about communication and compromise. The real challenge isn&rsquo;t just solving the problem with the limited information you and your players have; it&rsquo;s dealing with the frustrations that will inevitably occur when your partner does something that messes up your plan. In order to be successful in D&eacute;corum, there will come a point where both players will have to let go of their initial strategy for how they were going to finish the board and start paying attention to what their partner is doing instead. By introducing and providing an incentive to resolve conflict, D&eacute;corum mechanically encourages (or even requires) a positive form of compromise.&#10;&#10;Each player draws a &quot;Scenario&quot; card that lists a set of criteria of what types of d&eacute;cor a room must have or cannot have.  For example &quot;No room may contain a lamp&quot; or &quot;Every room must contain a wall hanging&quot;.  Players keep their criteria secret.&#10;&#10;The play surface is a board displaying various rooms in a house.  Each room has multiple items that can potentially be placed in the room.  Players take turns placing, moving, or removing colored tokens on the board, where each token represents an item of home d&eacute;cor.  Each token placed may conform with, or violate, the other players' criteria.  After each token is placed, other players may state they like the item of d&eacute;cor, as placed, or they do not like the item of d&eacute;cor, as placed.  Further discussion or explanation is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players' criteria are satisfied.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a dark and claustrophobic deep sea mining site, the uncovering of a mysterious &ldquo;Sphere&rdquo; is dragging everyone nearby into the endless madness. The fears deep within one&rsquo;s mind are amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing one's body and testing their sanity. Only those with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp. Deep Madness is a fully cooperative board game for 1-6 players with 66 amazingly detailed miniatures, depicting a sci-fi horror world inspired by Lovecraft&rsquo;s work and the Alien series. In the game, players assume the roles of investigators, venturing into the seemingly empty yet perilous deep sea mining site to find out the truth behind the lost contact event. Unimaginable horror and madness from the dark fear within is waiting.&#10;&#10;Deep Madness is based on multiple scenarios from a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique board setup, rules, special effects, and goals. From resolving fatal crises to struggling with overwhelming bosses, the investigators will face various quests filled with strategical decisions and fierce combat. With each scenario achieved, they are one step closer to the truth, but also one step deeper into the world of madness. Each scenario of the game plays in a limited number of game rounds, if the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed. Each game round consists of 4 phases: Devour Phase, Spawn Phase, Activation Phase, and Refresh Phase.&#10;&#10;In Devour Phase, the Devour Marker progresses one step forward along the Devour Track, indicating the world going deeper into madness. As the Devour Marker progressing, more and more rooms (map tiles) are flipped to their madness side. These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators or to boost the monsters.&#10;&#10;In Spawn Phase, different types of monsters with unique abilities are spawned in the flipped rooms. Monsters do not show their existence in fixed locations, they could be spawned right next to the investigators if they ventured carelessly.&#10;&#10;Activation Phase is the core of the game, the investigators and the monsters take turns to act alternately. Monsters do not wait for all investigators to finish their turns like in other cooperative games, but do act between them, so careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they had a chance to act.&#10;&#10;In Refresh Phase, some maintenances are performed, and some special effects are resolved.&#10;&#10;In each investigator&rsquo;s turn, it is crucial that the player chooses 3 actions to take wisely. Each kind of action has its own value, and every single decision could be life and death in Deep Madness. Unfortunately, the correct decision is rarely obvious. Moving, attacking, searching, exchanging items, locking the doors, and recovering sanity are the basic actions. Additionally, each investigator also has his/her own unique and irreplaceable abilities to activate. Different combinations of investigators provide distinctive strategies and game experiences.&#10;&#10;Monster acts according to its own action pool during its turn. In Deep Madness monsters are highly characteristic, not just in stats, but also in abilities and behaviors. Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges. And due to the intertwined activation mechanism, even different turn orders of the monsters make each game session different. However, no matter how the monsters setup is, Deep Madness will be a very challenging game, even death could be a strategy.&#10;&#10;In the game, investigators battle the horrific monsters, survive the harsh crises, and above all, save their own minds from the devouring of madness. They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate their abilities, to use the effects of items, to reroll the dice, and etc. However they are vulnerable when the sanity is low. After an investigator with insanity tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his/her mind, by permanently flipping the insanity tokens into madness tokens. As the madness token cumulates, horror haunts the investigator by resolving Madness Cards, and each of them has unique negative effect and terrifying flavor text.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the card-driven board game Rialto, the goal is to earn the most victory points (VPs), which are awarded for a variety of things. The game board displays the six districts of Venice, and players earn VPs for placing council members into these, for building bridges and placing gondolas to connect the districts with one another, and for building advantageous buildings.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds, with each round consisting of three phases:&#10;&#10;1. Acquire cards: Each player takes a set of cards.&#10;2. Play cards: Players use cards to perform certain actions.&#10;3. Activate buildings: Players may take advantage of their buildings and use their powers.&#10;&#10;In phase 1, sets of eight cards are displayed (with six cards face-up and two face-down). Each player takes one set, then reduces his hand to seven cards. A card shows one of six specific characters (Architect, Merchant, etc.) or is a wild card.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 consists of six sub-phases in a fixed order, one for each character. In each sub-phase, players choose whether or not to play one or more cards of that specific character. Each card allows them to perfom that character's action, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take one piece of gold for each Merchant card you play.&#10;     Place one council member into the current district for each Council card you play.&#10;     Take a building with a value equal to or lower than the number of Architect cards played. The higher its value, the better its function.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whoever plays the most cards in each such sub-phase receives a bonus of one free action of that type. In case of a tie, whoever is farthest along the &quot;Doge&quot; bar gets the bonus &ndash; and of course to advance on the Doge bar, players need to play Doge cards.&#10;&#10;Finally, in phase 3, players may take advantage of their buildings. For each piece of gold paid, a player may use one of his building's ability.&#10;&#10;Players collect VPs both during the game &ndash; from special buildings and by building bridges between districts &ndash; and at the end of it &ndash; for majorities of council members in each district. The value of each district evolves during the game: Each district is adjacent to four other ones, and at the end of the game, they will be connected either via bridges or gondolas. A bridge increases the value of the adjacent districts by 3-6 victory points, whereas a gondola increases this value by 1 point. The player with the most council members in a district earns VPs equal to the district's total value, the player with the secondmost council members earns half this value, and so on. While it's important to establish majorities in the districts, it's also crucial to control their values by cleverly placing those bridges and gondolas.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "CloudAge is a strategy game from Alexander Pfister and Arno Steinwender. The award-winning authors have created a dark and dystopian world for 1 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;Fifteen years ago, the mysterious secret society &quot;Cloud&quot; set fire to countless oil production sites and burned down large forests to destabilize the world. The resulting environmental catastrophe had disastrous effects on the entire planet. Now, years later, you travel above the dried-out landscape in your airships, searching for a better life. You visit cities, send out drones to collect resources, and battle Cloud militia.&#10;&#10;An innovative sleeving mechanism makes a new, more immersive, form of resource gathering possible. Players try to predict which cloud-covered terrain will contain the desired amount of resources or where additional actions are possible. Resources allow players to develop useful upgrades for their airships or attract new crew members.&#10;&#10;CloudAge is a mix of engine-building, deck-building, and resource management. The campaign system makes it easy to start playing quickly, with new elements being introduced into the game as players progress through the chapters. While you play, you also experience and help guide the story. If you prefer, you can also play standalone story spin-offs as single scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ulm is at its historic heyday: There is a constant hustle and bustle in the prosperous free imperial city. At the beginning of the 16th century, the city has one of the largest municipal territories within the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Success and wealth are not only due to Swabian thriftiness, but mainly the result of the citizens&rsquo; business acumen and skilled craftsmanship. Trade in works of art and commercial goods such as wood, wine, salt and textiles is flourishing; for the most part, these goods are shipped by barge or raft on the Danube river. People are busy building the cathedral - the social heart of the city - that will at one time have the tallest church steeple in the world. Everybody of distinction meets around the cathedral. The influential guilds and patricians dominate city life; and if you want to accomplish something, you need to be in the good graces of the right people.&#10;&#10;In Ulm, players try to expand their spheres of influence and to make optimal use of the hustle and bustle on the marketplace around the cathedral. The game has one simple basic rule: Push 1 Action tile into the Cathedral area and carry out the 3 associated actions! This way, the Cathedral tower gets taller and taller over the game. The objective of the game is plain and simple: try to accumulate the most victory points through activities in different areas of city life in Ulm and do it before the end of the 10th round, when the construction of the Cathedral is concluded.&#10;&#10;Who will make the best use of his means and resources over time and will go down in the annals of the city&rsquo;s history as an important citizen?&#10;&#10;",

Included in this game are 4 unique 60 minute escape room puzzles that will test your cranial skills. Use images, gears, words, keys, shapes, maps and more to solve the three stages within each escape room. An analog timer on the Chrono Decoder centerpiece incessantly counts down, emitting ominous noises to create an environment shut out from the outside world. If the puzzles stump you for too long, slide a hint card into the Hint Decoder to keep your team moving. Slide 4 keys into the Chrono Decoder when you think you have the answer... but beware, if you're wrong, a precious minute will be taken from you.&#10;&#10;The 4 escape rooms vary in difficulty, designed to give any group the experience they expect and deserve. If you're craving more puzzles, Escape Room expansions will be available, but you'll need the base game first as the Chrono Decoder is essential to the experience. Included in the base game in order of difficulty is: Prison Break, Virus, Nuclear Countdown, and Temple of the Aztec&#10;&#10;Prison Break: Ten years in prison for a crime you didn't commit. Ten years of your life wasted for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, it hardly seemed fair. You know the guards will reach your cell during the rounds in an hour. Every bone in your body tells you this is the opportunity of a lifetime; you're 60 minutes away from freedom!&#10;&#10;Virus: What a time to faint! You swear you could kill your lab partner, but you know that won't be necessary. The liquid that's oozing out of the broken bottle will kill everybody in the room soon enough...&#10;&#10;Nuclear Countdown: The table is filled with all kinds of materials that send shivers down your spine. At that moment your phone rings and your worst nightmare becomes reality, the bomb threat is real!&#10;&#10;Temple of the Aztec: The stories told about the temple were numerous.

Each of the playable nations have their own unique opportunities and challenges.&#10;&#10;Europa Universalis is a Strategic level board-wargame that gives players a full 4X game experience in a historical setting.

You can place as many tiles as the total symbols depicted on your Seishi tile and any or all of your Growth cards. Each symbol will let you place one tile of the corresponding type.&#10;&#10;During the turn in which your bonsai matches or exceeds the requirements of a Goal tile that is still in the middle of the table (i.e., the Goal tile has not been claimed yet by any player), you must immediately choose whether you want to claim that tile or if you want to renounce it in order to try to achieve a harder Goal tile.&#10;&#10;When the last card from the deck is revealed, the game end is triggered.

Ideally the players create a network of routes that connect the cities showing on their secret ticket cards. Players score points both for claiming routes and for completing tickets, with incomplete tickets counting against a player's score.&#10;&#10;In addition to scoring points for tickets, whenever a player places a route on the board, they claim a passenger from the two cities that form the endpoints for that route (assuming that the passengers have not already been claimed). At the end of the game, whoever has the most passengers of each of the six colors scores 20 points for that color; whoever has the secondmost passengers in a color scores 10 points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Germany combines most of Zug um Zug: Deutschland and the Deutschland 1902 expansion in one box. Zug um Zug: Deutschland, published solely for the German and Austrian market, consisted of the same map as Ticket to Ride: M&auml;rklin, but ZuZ:D didn't include the passenger mechanism from M&auml;rklin in which players scored additional points by moving passengers from city to city. The Deutschland 1902 expansion introduced a different method of scoring passengers, and that method is now present in this collection.&#10;&#10;",

The game also includes items you can equip to your heroes, 1V1 challenge cards, and roll modifiers to tip the odds in your favor.&#10;&#10;The first person to successfully slay three monsters, or build a full party with six classes, wins the game!&#10;&#10;Every player gets to choose a party leader character to represent them throughout the game. Each party leader card has a class and a skill that gives you an edge over your opponents. Whether you enjoy fighters, bards, wizards, or thieves, you'll find a party leader that's right for your play style - but choose wisely, because you only get one party leader for the whole game!&#10;&#10;Your heroes are brave adventurers, ready to attack monsters and go head to head with your foes! The game includes over 40 unique heroes. Each hero card has a class and an effect, and each hero&rsquo;s effect has a roll requirement. In order to use a hero&rsquo;s effect, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that effect&rsquo;s roll requirement. Heroes take advantage of items, magic and modifiers to increase their chances of making their dice rolls.&#10;In order to slay that monster, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that monster&rsquo;s roll requirement.&nbsp; Be warned: Each monster has a roll range in which they&rsquo;ll fight back, and if you score within that range, your party might be in grave danger&hellip;&#10;&#10;Don't like what your opponent just played? Throw down a challenge! Challenge cards can be played instantly to try to stop another player from playing a hero, item, or magic card. Playing a challenge card initiates a 1V1 challenge in which you and another player both have to roll the dice. If they win the challenge, they still get to play their card, but if you win the challenge, you get to send their card directly to the discard pile!&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In ancient prehistoric times, you have discovered a new land with plentiful lakes, mountains and forests (and apparently many stone rocks that shall be called dice). Your people can develop new things like basketry or find oxen or simply GROW and conquer.&#10;&#10;In Rise of Tribes, players control a tribal faction in prehistoric times looking to GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and LEAD their people. The board is modular, composed of hexes in various terrain types. Each hex has a population limit. Players manage the number of tribe members they place on any one hex to either trigger or avoid conflict.&#10;&#10;Each turn the active player rolls two dice, then selects two of the four actions to take -  GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and/or LEAD. Each action is resolved one action at a time. The power of each action taken depends on the die roll plus the last couple of dice placed onto the action board on the selected action by other players. Once both actions are taken, the active player resolves any Conflicts. The final step of each turn is the time to build villages and complete goal cards.&#10;&#10;Victory is possible in a couple ways: gathering resources to build villages and/or completing development and achievement goal cards for your civilization. Villages (limited to 1 per hex) score 1 point for the tribe that built them at the start of that tribe's turn. Goal cards will score points immediately when completed. Every tribe's ambition is to score 15 points. The tribe to score 15 points first wins the game.&#10;&#10;Solo mode, with the addition of Rise of Tribes: The Vul'Keth Invasion (required and sold separately), is a very challenging way to play Rise of Tribes.&#10;&#10;Rise of Tribes - Microbadges&#10;&#10; Rise of Tribes fan&#10; Rise of Tribes fan&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; &mdash; the guild of cloth finishers and merchants in foreign cloth &mdash; was one of the greater guilds of Florence, who arrogated to themselves the civic power of the Republic of Florence during the Late Middle Ages. The woolen cloth trade was the engine that drove the city&rsquo;s economy and the members of the Calimala were the elite of Florence.&#10;&#10;Throughout its long history, the Arte di Calimala supervised the execution of artistic and architectural works. Most Florentine guilds performed such activities, but the Calimala distinguished itself from other guilds through the number and prestige of the projects and the sites administered, including the construction and decoration of some of the major churches of the city.&#10;&#10;Players of Calimala are cloth merchants in medieval Florence, with a number of trusted employees that they assign to various streets within the city to carry out actions. (Each street connects two places where particular actions can be taken.) While taking these actions, players produce and deliver cloth and contribute to the construction and decoration of various buildings across the city. Employees stay on their assigned places for a while, carrying out their actions whenever the street is activated, and eventually are promoted into the city council, triggering a scoring phase.&#10;&#10;Depending on the number of players, each player has a number of action discs. In turn order, they can put one on a space between two actions, performing both actions and activating all other discs on the same space. When the fourth disc is placed on an action space, the lowest one is promoted to the city council, which triggers a scoring. After the last action disc is placed or the last scoring phase in the council is triggered, the game ends. The positions of the action spaces and sequence of scoring phases vary from game to game, making each game very different. Secret scoring objectives and action cards add uncertainty.&#10;&#10;",

As soon as the mediums think they know what this clue word is, they yell &quot;Silencio&quot;, and the spirit stops writing. The other team of mediums might see only the letter &quot;Y&quot;, but if you know the question is &quot;What color is it?&quot;, then you know the clue must be &quot;yellow&quot;.

The others will take the first opportunity to stab you in the back, so you better do it first...&#10;&#10;Each player controls gangster cards that serve to either gain money or attack other players.

The players bargain, spy, threaten, and deceive each other.&#10;&#10;Each of the four rounds brings new action cards into the game, and the number of gangsters increases. Thus, the possibilities for actions become more diverse, the jobs more profitable, and the attacks more powerful. Co-operation gets more attractive and treason alluring because at the end of the day money is the only thing that counts.&#10;&#10;",

The ever-changing climate was their first adversary, forcing them to remain constantly on the move. But weather was not their only problem. In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!&#10;&#10;In Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos. You guide their migrations to temperate climates, you acquire the perfect genes to develop your Dinos and mutate them, and you push out other creatures that have yet to learn the meaning of the term &quot;dominant species&quot;. At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you've evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else.&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of  prehistoric life. Players earn and spend mutation points to adapt their species for survival &ndash; but don't spend all of them as the remainder are counted to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;With every round of play a meteor moves one step closer to earth. When the meteor strikes (determined partly by dice), the game ends!&#10;&#10;",

Some cards also allow you to play a second card, so you can chain actions.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player draws a secret personality with specific victory conditions, which means that you can never be sure what the other players need to do in order to win.

Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.&#10;&#10;The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&#10;&#10;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&#10;&#10;",

In the early stages, simple materials will be needed, and as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period, the builders will require food and water, and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with five cottages. Each cottage houses a worker. Each turn, every worker will try to move into one of the fields adjacent to their cottage in order to gather resources from the land. These resources are required for building the Keythedral.&#10;&#10;Problems, however, are at hand. Firstly, no one is ever quite sure what the building requirements for the next stage of the Keythedral will be until the previous stage is completed. Secondly, once more workers arrive, the fields will become crowded, and some of the workers will be idle. Players may choose to fence off some of the fields in order to keep out their opponents' workers. However, the workers are quite partial to the odd tipple, and for a couple of barrels of wine, they can be persuaded to remove any one of the fences that a player has taken offense to!&#10;&#10;Good luck in your endeavors to keep your workers productive and to get the right building materials at the right time.&#10;&#10;Keythedral is Richard Breese's fourth game in the key series.&#10;&#10;",

Whether it&rsquo;s the Abbot, the Tailor or any of the six playable characters, each prisoner is represented by a character card and a custom character die showing that prisoner&rsquo;s unique endowment of Might, Cunning and Wisdom &ndash; the game&rsquo;s three traits.&#10;&#10;Embarking on a desperate quest to escape, the players must work together using custom dice and item cards to overcome the castle&rsquo;s many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, illustrated chapter card. At the beginning of each game, 15 of these chapter cards are drawn at random from a larger deck to create a unique castle every time.&#10;&#10;Gameplay involves one player revealing a new chapter card each turn, in a motion like turning a page of a book. When a card is turned, the next chamber or passageway into which the prisoners have stumbled is revealed. There is no turn order. Instead, players decide as a group who will turn the next chapter card, and there are often grisly consequences for the one that does!&#10;&#10;Once revealed, the chapter card will explain the situation facing the group and what must be done to get through it. In the style of choose-your-path adventures, most chapters offer the group a choice about how to proceed. Bribe the drunken guards or attack them? Charge the beast or lure it out? Steal from the kitchen stores or keep moving?&#10;&#10;Each chapter is a mini-game and a variety of mechanics are required to complete it, from RPG-style skill tests for an individual character, to push-your-luck dice rolling as a team, to the playing of item cards collected along the way to bolster the tactical abilities of the group.&#10; &#10;When the players choose to enter (or fail to avoid) combat, all players roll their unique character dice simultaneously to make an attack against the enemy. They need to collectively muster the right combination of Might, Cunning and Wisdom to defeat the foe in question, or risk taking damage. Blocking, Resting, and the use of Weapons, Relics and Potions will help to keep the prisoners alive.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is for the group to complete every chapter in the castle deck, then defeat the final boss. To win, they must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately.&#10;&#10;",

But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.&#10;&#10;It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Arabana-Ikibiti&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A midnight bell tolls on the streets of Wildegrens as the villagers shutter their windows against the darkness.  Something moves through the night&ndash;in the forest, through the fields, across the old battlefield.  The isolated village is in danger.  Crops are failing, animals are dying, and villagers are disappearing.  Townsfolk are scared.  Some of the women are fighting back, but the villagers suspect that these women may be dealing with the devil himself.  From behind the old school a shadow crosses to the town well.  A feeble light reveals two witches who nod to one another, shutter the lantern, and make their way towards the dark woods.&#10;&#10;Witchcraft! is a fast-playing, card-driven solitaire game where you lead a coven of witches in a  fantasy world where magic is real&ndash;and so are the monsters.  Building on the hidden / revealed mechanism of Resist! you will decide when to use magic to defeat the challenges you face&ndash;revealing yourself to your fellow villagers and being imprisoned for witchcraft.  As you complete missions and defeat enemies you will try to prove to the villagers that magic is not evil, and convince a jury that you are protecting the village.  Three jurors will decide your fate and their conviction is strong.  Can you persuade them?  Or will evil overcome you and the village?&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game you assemble a coven of witches from families of women represented by a deck of cards.  Selecting multiple witches from a family makes that family more powerful.  Each family is focused on different tasks in the game&ndash;revealing challenges, increasing attack power, uncovering the conviction of the jurors, or capturing familiars to help you in your fight. The fight is real and each of the eight jurors face a different villain.  Is it the Headless Horseman, Baba Yaga, the Scarecrow, or some other fiend?  On setup you choose three jurors, their missions, and their unique challenges&ndash;providing 56 possible combinations with great variety in the types of challenges and monsters you will face.  If you fail two missions or lose five villagers, you lose the game.  Even if you defeat the missions you still face the trial, and you are only sure of your fate when you reveal the conviction of the jurors and see if you have done enough to persuade them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Libert&eacute; covers the French Revolution from 1789 and the meeting of the Estates General to the Directory and Bonaparte&rsquo;s coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1799. &#10; The game is played in four turns. In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.&#10;&#10;The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.&#10;&#10;Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!&#10;&#10;It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.  Do not despair!  Once you have completed your first game you will realize that amongst the apparent chaos of the game there are many opportunities for long-term planning.&#10;&#10;Libert&eacute; is #6 in the Valley Games Classic Line&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome, dear Imperialists. It's the year 2415. The interplanetary federation (IPF) has done a great job in the last centuries. All necessary precautions have been taken to conquer this planet named &quot;Steam&quot;. The core of the planet consists of a 6,500&ordm; Celsius hot source containing different resources, including water. It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.&#10;&#10;But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.&#10;&#10;Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious. However, only through shrewd resource management and clever manipulation of supply and demand can a player reign supreme!&#10;&#10;",
