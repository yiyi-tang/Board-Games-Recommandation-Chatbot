Bid to score points or to drive your opponent's price down -- whatever your strategy, leave your dignity at the door and get ready to commit some random acts of nonsense! Pull a challenge card and read it to the group, then start the bidding war. You can bid zero to 10 points on each dare, but whoever bids the lowest performs the challenge -- and gets the points! Before you perform your challenge, spin the spinner -- depending on where it lands, you could earn extra points or force another player to do the dare. Whether you're the one performing the dare or the one watching, the results are seriously funny. The first player to reach 10 points wins. So, how low will you go to reach the top? Bring laugh-out-loud fun to game nights and get-togethers with this party game for adults and teens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One player, &lsquo;The Critic&rsquo;, picks the next Awkward Family Photos card and places the card on the table for everyone to see. All other players decide which one of their eight movie lines best captions the photo, by placing their selection facedown in the play area.  &lsquo;The Critic&rsquo; reads each card aloud and picks the movie line that he/she thinks best captions the photo in play. The player with the winning card wins the round! First player to get 10 cards win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you can move any of your stones after you have moved a pawn you must move a stone before passing the turn.&#10;&#10;You may only move in a straight line, no turns along the path. You move your pawns from node to node (the cross-sections on the board).&#10;&#10;You move your pawn one or two steps.&#10;&#10;You move your stones as far as you like and are able to along a straight line.&#10;&#10;You may not end your movement on an occupied node (cross-section).&#10;&#10;If a pawn or stone is adjacent to the pawn this player is about to move, the player may jump over it, capture it and remove it from play, as long as there is a place to land on the other side. This jumping to remove a game piece is considered as pawn movement of the turn. You could jump over both your own and your opponent&rsquo;s pawns and stones, removing them from play.&#10;&#10;If a player is out of stones, loses its last pawn or is unable to move any pawns at all during its own turn, this player loses the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Race to play all of the 6 Gruffalo cards you have been given. Join terrible teeth or rocks together to make a growing path through the wood. If you can't place a card then change it for a new one. The first player to play all their cards wins.&#10;&#10;'What's a gruffalo?' Can you be the first to complete your gruffalo? Each player has ten Gruffalo tiles and a board to place them on. Turn over a card that shows a part of a Gruffalo and try to turn one of your matching tiles over. If you find the right part then add it to your board. If you are wrong then turn it back over and leave it where it was. Whoever turns over Mouse gets to choose which part everyone is looking for.&#10;It's surprisingly tricky to remember where the right tile is.&#10;&#10;'His eyes are orange...' Earn Mouse tokens for scaring away the animals in this quick card game. Pick two cards or swap with another player to get the sets of three cards to scare Fox, Owl or Snake. Read out the phrases and earn a Mouse token. The first to get  five wins. 'He has knobbly knees, and turned-out toes, and a poisonous wart on the end of his nose.'&#10;&#10;'Oh help! Oh no!' Hide five of your Mouse tokens in the wood. Flip the Gruffalo boards to make a big woodland scene. Turn over cards to find where to hide your Mouse tokens - rocks, the path, the stream and so on. Then throw your Mouse token onto the board.&#10;If it lands in the right place leave it there - if you miss take it back. The first player to hide all five mouse tokens wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Standard cards depict a one of four parts of a house (of which there are five different constructions).

    "Description": "This is both a collectible vinyl miniatures series and physical manipulation wargame. Each player builds his army (Green or Blue) based on a points limits, with each figures' points value based on the unit's rarity and value to the game. Each players' &quot;Prized Possession&quot; is placed on the gaming area, this represents the enemy's objective in the battle, traditionally this is a bowl of Kale (for the Blue player) and a bowl of Cheeseballs (for the Green player). Players then take turns placing their figures, with no figure being more than 2&quot; forward of the protected objective. Obstacles are then placed and the game can begin. Each player has a total of for actions per turn, with the first player taking all 4 actions, then the 2nd player goes. Actions consist of Marching and Shooting. To March the player places a move token next to the figure intended to move and flicks the token forward, after that the figure is moved up to the token. Shooting is similar, the Shoot token is placed and flicked toward the intended enemy target. Figures are captured or wounded based on these their characteristics and the characteristics of the shooing figure. Many of the rarer figures in this game have special skills and rules. Some of the figures are: Generals, Tankers, Flyers, Snipers, Privates and Paratroopers. The physical manipulation mechanism is reminiscent of Subbuteo.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes the role of a Faction seeking to attack or defend the Republic of China: the aggressive Japanese, the harried Government (represented by the Nationalist party), the rebellious Chinese Communist Party, or the unruly, fractious Warlords who are obedient when convenient but have their eye on gaining state power.&#10;&#10;Using military, political, and economic actions and exploiting various events, players build and maneuver forces to influence or control the population, extract resources, or otherwise achieve their Faction&rsquo;s aims. A deck of cards regulates turn order, events, victory checks, and other processes. The rules can run non-player Factions, enabling solitaire, 2-player, or multi-player games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Volume XIII of the COIN Series.&#10;&#10;",

The map is randomly populated with solar systems and gas clouds. In addition to the player-controlled solar systems, which are all inhabited by technologically advanced &quot;spacegoing&quot; civilizations, non-player systems are generated by the referee. These non-player systems vary by industrial level, military resistance, and spaceflight capabilities (if any). Spacegoing non-player systems have randomly determined race and culture characteristics which serve to impact the War Roll (a die-roll determination of whether a meeting between opposing spacegoing forces is peaceful or results in conflict). The War Roll is also impacted by the government types of the involved civilizations. Finally, the Referee's Manual includes rules for research and technology that allow solar systems to advance and develop more powerful weaponry and spacecraft, including improvements in spacecraft propulsion ranging from sublight to hyperlight speeds.&#10;&#10;The Player's Manual explains the various planet types, the process for planetary industrialization, and the planetary installations that players can construct. The details of spaceship construction and associated costs are set forth for the game's two general classes of vessels: warships and merchants. Three classes of troops are available to the players: combat troops, engineers, and android troops (also referred to in the rules as robot troops). The Player's Manual includes the game's rules for movement and combat. These rules cover both tactical space battles (with distinctions for sublight and hyperlight vessels) and man-to-man land battles. Both types of battles rely on tabletop-miniatures-style rules, with movement being simultaneous based on written orders. The game also allows for &quot;strategic combat&quot; on the galaxy map in the form of minefields laid in space.&#10;&#10;In addition to the rules booklets, the game requires hex sheets, paper/notebooks, pencils, two to four 20-sided dice, one (?) 10-sided die, and an unspecified number of six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Usually, the first run of the game takes about double the estimated time, for the players to go through the rules and understand the basics of the game. The suggested age span for players is 13-100 years old.&#10;&#10;The player characters make their living in the game by undertaking quests, each of which offer rewards and opportunities, but under a constant threat of injury, depression and loss of incentive. Throughout their quests they gather resources and wealth, improve in Skills and Items, increase their reputation, gain Companions. On the other hand, each of their failures brings enemies and perils they will need to face before the end. Between quests the characters rest, recover and use their resources to better prepare for the following, bigger challenges. Alas, all they do bring them closer to facing the final challenge, also known as The Battle of Fate. The Battle of Fate is made against an unknown enemy, named the Enemy of Fate. Characters who succeed in the Battle of Fate, are named Champions of Fate. All others are forgotten, as bitter failures of history.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cicera bigia or Ciccia or even Ciccera, is a card game closely related to the more common card game of &quot;scopa&quot; (broom). Cicera is played mainly in the province of Brescia (northern Italy). Cicera is a traditional game, with many local variants and an unspecific origin, so there isn't a standard set of rules, but there are many local or familiar differences, though the core rules are always the same.&#10;To be able to play this game the specific deck of cards of brescia, which consist of 52 card (and not 40, as its common in other italian decks). The available cards are king, knight, knave, 10, 9,8,7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, ace(1). It's also possible to play with a standard french/international deck (taking out the jokers).&#10;&#10;Preparation and goal:&#10;You play with four players (but there is also a 2 player variant), in pairs, two against two, each sitting in front of his partner. Every player has an hand of 12 cards, the remaining 4 cards are put face up on the middle of the table. The dealer is initially chosen at random, but after each hand, the dealer turn passes to the person who is at his left hand (clockwise).&#10;The first pair that reaches 51 (sometimes 41, 31 or 21) or more points at the end of the game wins. If both pairs reach 51 in the same hand the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The game: &#10;The player to dealer's left plays first, and continue until you play all the cards in the players's hands. &#10;A turn consists of playing one card from their hand on the table, face-up, and clearly visible, which can take (or not take) one or more cards placed on the table itself. &#10;If the value of the card played matches that of a card (or a sum of cards) placed on the table, the cards on the table can be taken and put face down in front of you, to be scored at the end of the game. &#10;The numeric cards from 1 to 10 have a value equal to the value of the card itself and can take 1 card of the same value or more than 1 card, but the sum of these cards must have a value equal to the played card.&#10;The faces (king, knight, knave) can take only another card of the same face. &#10;You can choose freely the card to play, you are also free to choose to take card(s) or not, and you can also choose which cards to take, as long as the values match.&#10;After playing all the cards, the last player who has taken cards also takes all the cards remaining on the table.&#10;&#10;The scoring system:&#10;At the end of the game the players of a couple put together their own cards. &#10;There are 6 points that are always assigned, each to one or the other player or pair, regardless of the conduct of the game (the so-called &quot;Honours&quot;). &#10;All the other points may or may not be assigned depending on the progress of the game. &#10;Cards (2 points): The pair that takes more than half of the cards gets 2 points, in case of a tie (26 to 26) every pair gets one point.&#10;Swords (1 point): The pair that takes more than half (7) of the cards of the swords gain 1 point.&#10;Good cards (1 point for card): The 2 of swords, the knave of cups and the ten of coins are worth 1 point each.&#10;Neapolitan(or Naples): If a couple takes the ace, two and three of swords, they get a number of points equal to the highest card of the swords captured which is present in an unbroken sequence of cards of swords: for example, if you made the following outlets: A-2-3-4-5 and 7 of swords, the score will be 5 because 5 is the highest card of the sequence uninterrupted.&#10;&#10;You can also score points during the rounds (traditionally you keep track of this point by placing a face up card in front of you, while the card taken are normally face down):&#10;&#10;Scopa (Broom): You realize 1 point when you leave the middle of the table empty of cards. &#10;Picchiata (Hit) or Surprise: You realize 1 point for Hit if you play a card of the same value just played by the previous player (and take the two cards of the same value).&#10;Similar: It produces 1 point if the card played and taken are all of the same suit and if their number is more than 3.&#10;Quadrille: You realize 1 point for a quadrille if you play a card that takes a group of three or more cards (not necessarily of the same suit) from the table.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Players are recruiting performers to form a new idol unit.&#10;&#10;Players scout idol candidate girls, found in various places, to form new idol units. The cards show a variety of young women with different skills and abilities. The winner is the player who formed the highest level unit among the completed units, with the level of the idle unit determined by the final combination of members.&#10;&#10;The game is designed as a management training tool to encourage job-hunting students to understand the role of a recruiter to a business. By experiencing the recruiter perspective, the players can be better equiped to find new jobs themselves.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published with a 40 card deck (in a pink box), but this was quickly replaced with an expanded 60 card deck (in a yellow box). Early owners of the game who presented their pink box at a game show were given the extra 20 cards for free.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "If rumours are to be believed, the origins of Blood Bowl lay in Lustria, home of the ancient and powerful Slann, and their Lizardmen servants, at the very dawn of time. Though the game has moved on and evolved in the Old World, the Lustrian League is working with the NAF to bring the old and new closer together. The Gwaka'moli Crater Gators have made the leap across the world-pond to match their skills against some of the biggest names in the sport, and their natural talent and unconventional playing style have proven to be a massive hit with fans.&#10;&#10;If you're looking for a funky and fresh new twist to the game, Lizardmen teams are where it's at. They have access to the best of both worlds: with players that are strong and tough, plus fast and agile ones. Once you get the hang of using your Saurus Blockers (not to mention Kroxigors if you really want to make an impact) to protect the nimble Skinks long enough to perform some slick plays, you'll find yourself scoring again and again. Add their unconventional aesthetic to the mix, and you've got a team that looks great, plays well and scores big.&#10;&#10;This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you need to assemble the Gwaka'moli Crater Gators, a Lizardmen team for use in games of Blood Bowl, containing 6 Saurus Blockers, 4 Skink Runners, and 2 Chameleon Skinks, plus a roster sheet. Also includes a transfer sheet, 2 Slann-statue turn markers, egg-themed balls, and 12x 32mm Citadel round bases which feature holes to place the ball.&#10;&#10;The rules to use Lizardmen teams in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in Spike!

Of boldly going where no one had gone before.&#10;&#10;Captains like Garth, Alexander and Travis charted new worlds by the score, leading scientific and diplomatic missions to the edge of explored space. Following the examples of Magellan, Shackleton, and Lewis and Clark, they were scientists and idealists, dedicated to peaceful first contact whenever possible.&#10;&#10;It was inevitable that they would run into a hostile power. Under the command of Kharn the Undying, the Empire saw humanity&rsquo;s peaceful ambitions as a mockery of its own greatness, its constant need to expand to maintain its cultural vitality.&#10;&#10;Unprepared for hostile first contact, the human-led explorers and their underarmed fleet soon faced their greatest peril: an invasion orchestrated by a military genius.&#10;&#10;Four years of warfare, ending in the Battle of Axanar, shaped everything that followed.&#10;&#10;This product requires the Squadron Strike 2e Boxed Set (ADA 1700) to play!

The other players are the advisors, who must decipher the challenges on the advisor cards, then tell the hacker how to break into the different modules. The advisors can look at the cards, but not the Hackathon console. The hacker can look at the console, but not the cards.&#10;&#10;There are eight advisor cards, and each card has a series of puzzles and brainteasers on it. The advisor cards are divided among the advisors at random. The advisors must complete the challenges on the cards, and then will get a set of instructions to read out loud to the hacker. Since the hacker cannot see the card with his or her own eyes, the hacker must rely solely on verbal instructions from the rest of the squad as to which buttons to press and which switches to turn to open the console.&#10;&#10;The console has a timer on it, and the team must break through successfully before the alarm goes off. Players can set the timer to whatever amount of time they&rsquo;d like, with a minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;If the team is able to decode all the modules successfully in the set time, the team wins.&#10;&#10;",

Then, both players will receive a number of cards from a deck of ordinary playing cards, and play them onto Diplomatic, Information or Military Fronts (or keep them in a Reserve, for a later turn). After this, players will compare the totals of cards played to see if one player will score Victory Points on a given Front, and whether one or both players will lose cards and Victory Points.
