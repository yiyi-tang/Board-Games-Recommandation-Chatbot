    "Description": "Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dice Masters is a game that utilizes WizKids Games' proprietary Dice Building Game platform in which two players take the role of warlords, collect and assemble their &quot;party&quot; of adventurer dice and battle in head-to-head gameplay.  Each turn, players roll the dice to see what resources they have available, buy dice, send their party members into the field, and then strike at the enemy warlord. There are multiple cards available for each type of die so players get to choose which one  to use. This lets players specialize dice to suit play style.&#10;&#10;The name and theme of the new expansion set will be the Tomb of Annihilation, set in the Forgotten Realms.  This set will offer new adventures, monsters, and spells for the game, as well as a new &ldquo;Draft Pack&rdquo; format, designed for tournament play.&#10;&#10;Each Draft Pack will include 2 Basic Action cards, 12 Character or Action cards, 24 dice that match the 12 cards, and a rules insert.  All components can be used with other Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dice Masters sets, but the sets have been designed for better use in draft-based games. Any Dice Masters Starter Set will be required to play (for starting NPC dice and Basic Action color indicator cards and dice).&#10;&#10;The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dice Masters: Tomb of Annihilation will be sold in countertop displays.  Each display includes eight Draft Packs.&#10;&#10;",

BUT... guess incorrectly and lose all the points from that turn! The only way to keep your points is to elect to stop, at which point the next player continues from the current number.&#10;&#10;Extra care is needed on the first guess of each of your turns too! You can elect to guess and start earning more points, but get your first guess wrong and you will lose half of all the points you have in your 'bank'!!!  Or, if its too risky, pass straight away to the next player, but this will cost you one point from your bank. If you've nothing in your bank, you must call!&#10;&#10;Players on low points at the start of their turn, get another go if they get their first call wrong.&#10;&#10;Counters mark which cards have already been drawn on a simple mat, so while this is a brilliant game of risk for anyone to play, it's also perfect for developing numerical and probability skills with children of all ages!&#10;&#10;For 2-6 players, aged 8 and upwards, and a playing time of 10-40 minutes.

    "Description": "A card game for 2 players based on the movie &ldquo;Sorcerers Apprentice&rdquo;. One player is the good Merlinians. The other is the evil Morganians.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck containing cards of seven types: &#10;Merlinian Sorcerers, Morganian Sorcerers, Spells, Amplifiers, Objects, Events and Defence.  Most cards have a power rating which is used during the duel (combat) phase.&#10;&#10;The Merlinian player starts with Balthazar in play and the Grimhold which is equipped to Balthazar. The Morganian player starts with Horvath in play.&#10;&#10;Both players draw 5 cards.&#10;&#10;Each turn has 6 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Lore Phase&#10;-   Both players draw 2 cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;2.  Recruit Phase&#10;-   You may put one sorcerer into play from your hand and any number of objects. Sorcerers may give their objects to each other (max 3 objects per sorcerer). Excess objects are discarded. &#10;-   The Merlinian player may only recruit Merlinian Sorcerers. &#10;-   The Morganian player may only recruit Morganian Sorcerers.&#10;&#10;3.  Event Phase&#10;-   Starting with the Merlinian player, players may take turns discarding cards with event abilities to activate and immediately resolve those abilities.&#10;&#10;4.  Encounter Phase&#10;-   Each player randomly picks one of their sorcerers to undertake a duel.&#10;&#10;5.  Duel Phase&#10;-   The two Sorcerers who have encountered each other will now fight as follows.&#10;-   Each player will make an attack combo which are then revealed simultaneously. For their attack combo each player may play one spell, one event and up to 3 amplifiers&#10;-   Derive a power total for each sorcerer = the sorcerer&rsquo;s power + equipped objects + spell + played event + amplifiers.&#10;-   Each player may play up to one defence card. These will cause certain opposing cards to be discarded, thus changing the power totals. &#10;-   The sorcerer with the higher power total is the combat winner. The losing sorcerer is discarded.&#10;-   The combat Loser may play a protection spell. This prevents the losing sorcerer from being discarded and his objects from being stolen.&#10;-   The winner takes the losing Sorcerers objects AND looks at his opponents hand AND then steals one target card from his opponents hand.&#10;&#10;6.  End Phase&#10;-   Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;-   Check for Victory Conditions. Record Time Markers.&#10;&#10;The Merlinian player has 2 ways to win: &#10;1.  Destroy Morgana: Defeat her by 7 or more power in a Combat. &#10;2.  Prime Merlinian Succession: Keep Dave Stutler in play for 7 consecutive turns.&#10;&#10;The Morganian player has 1 way to win: &#10;Cast the Rising Spell: Keep Morgana in play for 5 consecutive turns.&#10;&#10;Both players may win by the following method: &#10;Army of Sorcerers: Have 6 more sorcerers in play than your opponent in the end phase.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2-4 players based on survival and accomplishment in the Florida City of St. Augustine.&#10;&#10;St. Augustine was founded in 1565 by Pedro Menendez. It is the oldest, continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. For the first 200 years of its existence, it was controlled by Spain. The town itself was always very small and poor, but it held an important strategic position. It helped defend the treasure fleets on their way back to Spain by preventing the English and French from building their own settlements along the Gulf stream.&#10;&#10;In this game players actively recruit townsfolk, earn gold, gain military glory, and build structures while being mercilessly subjected to hurricanes, raids, disease, and hostile indians.&#10;&#10;Each turn is equal to about a decade. The game ends after 20 turns, at which point, historically, the British take control of the city.&#10;&#10;Each Player gets a player mat which is divided up into 7 boxes: Government, Churches, Forts, Population, Gold, Glory and Victory Points. Tokens are placed in the boxes on player mats to keep track of each players score in that category. Each player starts with 7 population, 5 gold, and 3 glory.&#10;&#10;There are 2 Common Decks: &#10;1.  The Event Deck - one random event occurs each turn. &#10;2.  The Action Deck which comprises four suits:&#10;-   Economic (Types: Industry, Agriculture, Trade)&#10;-   Military (Types: Fight the French, Fight the English, Control) &#10;-   Population (Types: Indians, Blacks, Europeans)&#10;-   Buildings (Types: Government, Churches, Forts)&#10;Each suit has 3 types of card with 4 cards for each type. In addition the deck has 4 leader (wild) cards.&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided into 7 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Draw Phase&#10;-   Each Player fills their hand to 10 action cards.&#10;&#10;2.  Trade Phase&#10;-   Players may trade action cards with each other and may also trade tokens on their player mats.&#10;&#10;3.  Meld Phase&#10;-   Players may make melds. A meld consists of 1-4 cards of the same type. One card in a meld may be a leader. One card in a meld earns 1 token. Two cards in a meld earns 3 tokens. Three cards in a meld earns 6 tokens. Four cards in a meld earns 10 tokens. &#10;-   You can make a max of 4 melds, one from each suit. &#10;-   Tokens earned go into the relevant box on the player&rsquo;s mat. (e.g. tokens from a population meld go into the population box, tokens from a military meld go into the glory box).&#10;&#10;4.  Building Phase&#10;-   Buildings provide bonus resources. Tokens are awarded for having the highest and second highest church, government and fort scores.&#10;&#10;5.  Event Phase&#10; -  Flip over the top card of the event deck. The event is resolved immediately and affects all players.&#10;&#10;6.  Score Phase&#10;-   Players gain Victory Points (VP) in based on their population, gold and glory scores.&#10;&#10;7.  End Phase&#10;-   Players may discard their action hands down to zero cards.&#10;-   Each player loses one half his gold rounding down. &#10;-   Each player loses all his Glory.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 20 turns.  The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Be it a knight or a magician, when we lie down to sleep the unconscious thoughts seem to transcend all realities. It is up to us, which is the connection between desire and thought, and the best children to all as persons. There are so many dreams created that are not so much that they have nicknamed our house of Factory of Dreams!&#10;&#10;Take control of a mystical character such as Fairy, Unicorn, Gnome or Ente and build the dreams that citizens both crave in thoughts. Each character has a special ability that assists in their production and each citizen's card has a different dream to be built. During a match, it is necessary to send out items and emotions cards on the table according to what each citizen card is demanding.&#10;&#10;How about joining that magnificent sword, a little courage, and giving the Warrior the glory of that very successful moment for him to kill the fearless Dragon ... in his dreams, of course! Can you be the best mystic in the game and be the employee of the month in the Factory of Dreams? Come and test your gifts, come and dream of us!&#10;&#10;GAME SETUP: Each player stands at one end of the table. Your position is important because it determines whether a Desire card is valid for you or not according to the arrows of the cards. All players choose a character. Shuffle the Wishes deck (6 types) and reveal 16 cards in the center of the table placing four cards per row creating a 4x4 square. Shuffle the deck of Dreams and deal 2 cards to each player. The Dream cards are the template from which the player must form the same configuration with the cards arranged on the table.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY: F&aacute;brica dos Sonhos is divided into turns and actions. Each player on his turn performs the following mandatory actions:&#10;World Change - You must remove a Wish Card from the table and place it in your hand, then replace that card with another one from the top of the Desire Deck or another one in your hand ( maximum of three cards in the hand). If you exceed the limit, before you pick up a new card, you must discard one of the cards in your hand.&#10;Intercept - Choose between moving Desires Cards on the table or buying a new Dream card. The movement of Desires is simple. The movement points you have are equal to the number of players +1 . You can swap two orthogonally adjacent cards, or two cards diagonally that are on the corners of the 4x4 diagram. You can still rotate a letter anywhere. Each change of position or rotation counts as a point of movement.&#10;&#10;GOAL: The objective of the players is to format the cards of the table according to the template of the cards of Dreams in their hands. The winner is the player who can achieve 3 dreams first.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;1 Rules Book&#10;4 Character Sheet&#10;20 Dreams Cards&#10;38 Desires Cards&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the 108 custom playing card deck and deals 1 card face down on each one of the 12 Battlefield Events.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Each player is then dealt 7 cards. The unused cards are placed face down as the Draw Deck and the top card is flipped face up to form the Battlefield.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;To start a round, the dealer shuffles the cards in the Draw Deck, Battlefield, Battlefield Event Wildcard and the Discard pile. Seven cards are then dealt out to each player from the Draw Deck, and the top card is flipped face up to form the battlefield. On the first round either roll high (d12) or if playing a series of games, the player with the highest score in the previous game flips over any one of the 12 face down cards in the Battlefield Event Area that is the Battlefield Event Wildcard that is in play (Revealed!) for the current round.&#10;&#10;On rounds 2 thru 9 the player that &ldquo;Won&rdquo; the previous round and gained the Crown Jewel flips over any one of the remaining face down cards in the Battlefield Event Area, and places it in the area noted on the game board as the &ldquo;Battlefield Event Wildcard&rdquo;. &#10;&nbsp;&#10;Order of play begins with the person to the left of the dealer and proceeds in the direction determined by the card played on top of the existing card in the Battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#10;     - If the Played card is lower rank = Play Direction Reversed to Counter Clockwise (Right).&#10;     - Played card is higher rank = Play Direction Advances Clockwise (Left).&#10;     - Played card is of equal rank (Stalemate) = player chooses direction of play left or right. &#10;&#10;&#10;If the Draw Deck is depleted, the battlefield (except the top card) is shuffled and becomes the new Draw Deck. Cards in the discard pile may only be shuffled into the Draw Deck at the beginning of each new round.&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence: &ldquo;Order of Play&rdquo;&#10;1.   Royal Decree Phase:  Player may choose to play a Monarch Card using the card&rsquo;s Royal Decree.  The Royal Decree invokes any one Revealed Battlefield Event that the player chooses; if the Monarch card is played in this manner it is placed in the Discard pile and removed from play for the remainder of the round. There is no limit to the number of Monarch Cards that can be played during the players Royal Decree Phase using the Monarch Royal Decree. Regardless of whether or not a player plays a Monarch Card during the Royal Decree Phase, the player proceeds to the Battlefield Play Phase or Draw Phase of their turn.&#10;&#10;2.  Battlefield Play Phase:  The player has several options to choose from, if available.&#10;&#10;&#10;     - The player is not required to play a playable card in their playing hand if he/she chooses not to.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     - The player may play an Emissary or Scales of Justice card from their hand on top of any card in the Battlefield. Automatically changes faction currently in play to the faction type of the Emissary card. Continue on to the Battlefield Result Phase: The outcome of the battle is a Stalemate. After the faction change effect is resolved the rank value Emissary card is zero (0) for the next players turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     - The player may play a Monarch card as a Faction card from their hand on top of the card in the Battlefield. If the Monarch card either matches the faction or rank of the card in the Battlefield, continue on to the Battlefield Result Phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     - The player may play a Minion card as a Faction card from their hand on top of the card in the Battlefield. If the Minion card either matches the faction or rank of the card in the Battlefield, continue on to the Battlefield Result Phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     - The player may play a Minion card that matches the Rank of the Battlefield Event Wildcard that invokes any one of the Revealed! Battlefield Event that the player chooses. Resolve the Battlefield Event, and continue on to the Battlefield Result Phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;3.  Draw Phase:  If the player was unable to play a card or chose not to play a card onto the Battlefield during the Battlefield Play Phase, they must draw a card from the Draw Deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;     - If the card drawn by the player can be played as specified in sequential order of the preceding Royal Decree Phase or Battlefield Play Phase, the player may opt to do so.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     - The player is not required to play the drawn card even if it is a playable card.&#10;&#10;&#10;4.  Pass Phase:  (end of players turn) If the player does not or cannot play a card onto the Battlefield, the player passes and play moves on to the next left (clockwise) player.&#10;&#10;5.  Battlefield Result Phase:  (end of players turn) If the player has played a card on to the Battlefield, the Battlefield Result is determined by the card played on top of the existing card in the Battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#10;     - Played card is lower rank = Play Direction Reversed to Counter Clockwise (Right).&#10;     - Played card is higher rank = Play Direction Advances Clockwise (Left).&#10;     - Played card is of equal rank (Stalemate) = player choses direction of play left or right.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players take on the roll of the mane six ponies from the animated series and work together to prepare for a confrontation with one of the series villains. If the ponies have made enough progress, they can thwart the villain.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players move their ponies around the game board, which is a map of Ponyville and Equestria.  They then attempt to deal with plot issue cards by rolling dice; other ponies can help them by rolling additional dice.  Successfully dealing with the issue cards allows them to advance on their Element track.  When they advance far enough, they will gain their Element of Harmony.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the villain is plotting.  The villain has a progress track which advances each turn and when new issue cards come into play.  Villain event cards will come into play as the track advances and which will cause problems for the ponies.  Once the villain track reached the final space, the confrontation begins.  Ponies then attempt to defeat the villain with a series of dice rolls.  Their success will depend largely on how many Elements of Harmony they have obtained during the game.&#10;&#10;Each of the mane six ponies has her own special ability: Twilight Sparkle can advance Element tracks by doing research, Rarity can collect gems to help her resolve issues, Fluttershy is good with animals, Rainbow Dash's movement is faster than the others, Applejack is good at helping other ponies resolve their issues, and Pinkie Pie can help other ponies avoid setbacks.&#10;&#10;Players can play stand-alone games or a campaign game made up of a series of games, with a different villain in each game.  The ponies can gain new abilities and even become alicorns as the campaign continues.&#10;&#10;",

Shard Eaters are elementals with an appetite for raw power. Sunshards are a delicacy to the Eaters, and each shard consumed allows them directly to harness its pure energy. The Eaters then use the imbued light of the sunshards to repel the corrupting curse that is spreading throughout the Valley of Life.&#10;&#10;The Shard Eater advancement has the lowest mana cost for a growth symbol in the game, allowing you to add a growth to your deck as early as the first turn. However, this early power comes with a longterm price of lowering your mana during future turns while it&rsquo;s in your field. Placing a Shard Eater advancement in a card with a Cursed Land will neutralize its decay symbol, allowing you to sow your field with more cards.&#10;&#10;The promo pack includes 3 Shard Eater advancements (one advancement for the top, middle, and bottom slots). This allows players to craft cards with Shard Eater for any slot position.&#10;&#10;",

But this game is all about  &#229;&#146;&#140;&#232;&#143;&#147;&#229;&#173;&#144; (wagashi), traditional Japanese sweets. So an English title might be 'Sweet Talking'.&#10;&#10;Kashi-Katariki is a word game with some similarities to Apples to Apples, but there's little language dependence, so the game is playable with a crib-sheet. The game has cards for different Wagashi, and cards for subjects. Players are trying to give new Wagashi interesting names.&#10;&#10;The Dealer draws a random Wagashi card from the Wagashi deck. That is the Wagashi to be named. The Dealer then chooses some subjects from the subject cards. For example, the subjects are like &#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153; (outer space), &#233;&#162;&#168;&#230;&#153;&#175; (scenery), &#232;&#135;&#170;&#231;&#132;&#182; (nature). Each of the other players must choose a subject, and think of a name that fits the Wagashi and subject. The Dealer chooses the best name. The named player gets a point, and the next player becomes the Dealer.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Wagashi, is to be enjoyed with all five senses.&#10;&#10;Beautiful colors and shape, a bit of incense, tactile feelings from your fingers and your mouth, rich taste. And, with a nice ringing name.&#10;&#10;There are many kinds of Wagashi. Yokan. Manju. But in Wagashi culture, in addition to those names representing the types of Wagashi like Yokan, they name their Wagashi with a specific name, called a &quot;Kamei&quot; (&#232;&#143;&#147;&#233;&#138;&#152;: name of Wagashi).&#10;&#10;You are a confectioner in a bizarre Wagashi shop named &quot;Kashi-Katariki.&quot;, having a selection of bizarre Wagashi-s.&#10;&#10;Your colleagues have just created a brand new original Wagashi, but couldn't come up with a good Kamei.

    "Description": "User summary&#10;CABARET CONFIDENTIAL is a 3 player only game from Japan. It uses the mechanic known in Japanese gaming as 'butting', where equal values negate each other and the next player down gains.&#10;&#10;Each player acts as an owner of a Cabaret, and headhunts dancers. Dancers have three needs: Fame, Money and Love. For each dancer dealt up from the deck each round, players try to negotiate to get the dancer to join their troup.&#10;&#10;Negotiation is done by simultaneous blind-bidding on one of the dancer's needs. Each player chooses a card of one type and places it face down. When the three cards are turned up, the player who didn't match the others wins the bid and takes the dancer to their tableau. For example, Alice and Brenda bid on Fame, Cathy bid on Money, so Cathy wins the bid. When the game ends, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Dancers may have special abilities. Some may be triggered when turned up from the deck, some may have one-off effects when placed on your tableau, some may have permanent effects. There is also a &quot;management policy&quot; card which is drafted before the first round, and activated before counting points at the end. This might mess up the other players' scores.&#10;&#10;The special effects on the dancers add some language dependancy to the game but the game is still playable with crib sheets or paste-ups for the cards.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;In Paris, end of 19th century.&#10;Each player is the owner of a Cabaret, and negotiate with the casts to bring success for your stage.&#10;&#10;But beware. Casts are artists, and artists have mannerisms. With thoughtful negotiations, assign casts in the best position to produce the best stage in town.&#10;&#10;The player producing the most gorgeous Cabaret wins the game.&#10;&#10;19&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#180;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#230;&#184;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#175;&#142;&#230;&#153;&#169;&#231;&#185;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#186;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#229;&#138;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#179;&#168;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#138;&#184;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#232;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#153;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#231;&#153;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#183;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#230;&#184;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#232;&#143;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

The Endless feed off each other and the more of them on the board, the more dangerous they become.

    "Description": "Description from the designer:&#10;&#10;Blood and Dust is a game of strategy and adventure enabling players to participate in fierce battles between armies of Medieval times. The game faithfully reenacts the harsh combat reality of this period - heavy cavalry charges breaking enemy lines, lethal salvoes of archers or brutal infantry melees. Players have to choose the right tactics making flank or rear attacks as well as organize their regiments in proper formations. It is also important to take advantage of the lay of the land and use special abilities of commanders and units.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in three different game modes for 2 to 4 players: standalone Scenarios designed by the author, standalone Scenarios custom-build by the players and the Campaign. In the Blood and Dust Campaign, the players become captains of mercenary forces who sell their military services in a world full of dangers, intrigues and brutal battles. Your heroes start from commanding a small detachment of units, but as the Campaign progresses, they will muster additional units for their armies. They will improve skills and search for fresh recruits, while their soldiers will gain experience in uncountable skirmishes. For a sack full of gold they will accept commissions, helping the wealthy and the powerful attain even more influence. Alternatively, they will seek glory and money on their own.&#10;&#10;",

Each player would get 10 cards.&#10;&#10;BAITING&#10;&#10;Each player selects and place 5 CARDS that would serve as BAITS for the fight. These cards are chosen based on the player's choice on elements such as high number, HUT colour etc).&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;&#10;1. At their turns, players try to eliminate other player's BAIT by placing a higher number HUT (with the same colour) on the BAIT to be eliminated.&#10;&#10;For instance, if a PLAYER has baits with number 9, 9, 8, 7, 8, an active player (player whose turn it is) who places a card with higher number of the same colour as the BAIT collects the BAIT and other cards on it if BAITS has been HEXED, DEFENDED or INVADED (see below).&#10;&#10;HEX:&#10;&#10;Players can use their turn to HEX any BAIT (either theirs or another players). They do so by placing ANOTHER HUT COLOUR with the same number as the BAIT to change the colour. This is a very important in the game strategy.&#10;&#10;DEFEND:&#10;&#10;Players can DEFEND their BAIT by placing another card with HIGHER NUMBER but MUST be the same HUT colour as their BAIT. This is a strategy for defence in the game.&#10;&#10;INVADE:&#10;&#10;ACTIVE PLAYER can weaken another players BAIT by INVADING. This is done when Active Player place a card with LOWER NUMBER on another player's BAIT but must be the same COLOUR. This makes the BAIT weaker and easier to eliminate at next run by any player.&#10;&#10;WHEN GAME ENDS:&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player has EXHAUSTED their FIVE BAITS.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN???&#10;&#10;THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF BAITS AT THE END OF THE GAME WINS.&#10;&#10;In situations where there is a TIE, the players FIGHTS and the FIRST to lose a BAIT gets ELIMINATED TILL THEIR IS ONLY ONE PLAYER LEFT.&#10;&#10;",

There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Defenders The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.&#10;&#10;These new features include a Campaign Mode, with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.&#10;&#10;Caravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.&#10;&#10;Skills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.&#10;&#10;The Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part of the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As player progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans are critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.&#10;&#10;&#10;For a deluxe edition of this expansion, see Tiny Epic Defenders: The Dark War &#226;&#128;&#147; Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;",

Yet, you are all careless, and always forget which ones you are. Also, NO table talking is allowed because you are also too proud to call each other to ask.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to show up to the battle in a unique Ranger suit, matching no other Ranger's color.  Matching another ranger simply will not do, and you will refuse to fight and just go home.  It's embarrassing.&#10;&#10;Basic rules: Players have 5 cards each in their starting hands: one card for each of the 5 costume colors (add more colored cards for more players than 5).  Choose a starting player (a lead Ranger) and everyone secretly picks a color costume to wear and puts that matching color card face down in front of them.  Starting with the leader and going clockwise, you will flip your card face up in front of you and yell &quot;[Insert color you played] RANGER GO!&quot;.&#10;&#10;If all the colors are different, you fight the threat and save the day.  If not, you take any non matching cards into your hand or discard any colors that matched another player (place the discarded card in front of you, face up, so everyone can see what color you lost).&#10;&#10;You refuse to ever experience that humiliation again and throw the costume out.  If the same color card is lost by all players, the game is impossible to win, and you instantly lose.&#10;&#10;Lastly, (this can be a variant or base rule, your choice) a Ranger will never show up in the same costume twice in a row, so for the following round you must pick a different color to play (eg., yellow, yellow, blue is not allowed, but yellow, blue, yellow is).  Players need to use deduction and pay attention to what costumes are out of play to come out on top!&#10;&#10;",

In this highly social game, players secretly look at a movement card and try to direct the active player on how to use that card. Sometimes players will cooperate to make the pyramid together and other times they will straight up lie to secure their position.&#10;&#10;Once the top three spaces of the pyramid are formed, the game ends. The player who is not on the pyramid loses the game and, naturally, gets a pie to the face.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Final Round Fighting Card Game is a two-player card game which emulates Arcade Fighting Games of the 90s.&#10;&#10;In Final Round Fighting Card Game, players play cards to simulate attacking and defending against their opponent as they attempt to deal damage to one-another, removing cards from their opponents deck as damage is done. The players deck is made up of cards, each of which represent a move the character they are playing as is able to perform. Cards lost from the deck through damage become a resource from which players draw.&#10;&#10;As with Arcade Fighting Games, there are Basic Attacks (simple 1-button punches and kicks), Special Attacks (more complicated or specialized moves, frequently unique to a character), Basic Block and Special Blocks (Basic Block is reusable throughout the game, Special Blocks have an additional effect) and Ultimate moves (the big, flashy finishers).&#10;&#10;Cards/Moves in Final Round Fighting Card Game are balanced by i. Attack Speed (how fast a card is), ii. Combo Speed (the maximum Attack Speed of the card to follow it in a Combo), iii. Damage (the number of cards your opponent loses from their deck when they're hit with the attack alone or in a Combo), and iv. Card Abilities.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of playing cards defensively to your own High, Mid, and Low zones, or playing a card aggressively to Attack your opponent in one of their three zones (the zones are largely thematic, to represent the &quot;spacing&quot; aspect from fighting video games). Attacks are successful when they are faster than the card in the zone they were played to, with Blocks being an automatic success for the defending player, and ties being broken by revealing the top card of players' decks and using the Attack Speed of the revealed card. On successfully attacking the opponent, players have the ability to play additional cards, making a Combo, with each successive card in a Combo requiring having an Attack Speed which is equal to or less than the Combo Speed of the last card which was played. During a players turn, they have two Actions, in which they can play defensively to draw cards and reset their defenses, or to attack.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The other player is the Machines. Each player has their own unique deck. Each deck has 6 suits. Each card has a force value and a special ability. Some special abilities require their ability to be activated, other abilities automatically take effect when the card is recruited or as a Free action discarded from the hand or in-play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 3 Empire Tokens.&#10;&#10;Each round has 6 Phases.&#10;&#10;1.  Initiative Phase &#10;-   Players roll high on 1D6. High roll is the attacker. Low roll is the defender.&#10;&#10;2.  Fate Phase&#10;-   Each player draws 5 cards from the top of his deck.&#10;&#10;3.  Strategy Phase&#10;-   Each player may discard up to 2 cards and draw replacements.&#10;&#10;4.  Battle Phase&#10;-   Players take turns starting with the attacker. On his turn a player can either Recruit (put a card into play face up in front them), Activate (use the activation ability of a card in play if it has one) or Pass. &#10;-   If both players Pass, one after the other, the Phase ends. &#10;-   Once a player passes, he must continue to pass, unless his opponent causes one of his in-play cards to be discarded or eliminated. &#10;-   Normally, during the round, a player can only recruit a max of one card from each of the six suits. Some cards as their special ability allow you to recruit more than 1 card of a particular suit. &#10;-   A card can only be activated once per round.&#10;&#10;5.  Resolution Phase&#10;-   Add up the modified force values of all the cards in-play. The player with the highest score wins. If tied, players roll high on 1D6 to determine winner. &#10;-   The winner takes an Empire Token from the loser. &#10;-   The winner causes one target in-play card of his opponent to be discarded.&#10;&#10;6.  End Phase&#10;-   Each player can allow up to 9 of their in-play cards to remain in play. Excess cards must be discarded. &#10;-   Max hand size is 3 cards.

    "Description": "A card game for 2 players in which players take turns controlling the Byzantine Empire. On a player&rsquo;s off-turn he represents the many foes of the Byzantines. The game is divided into 3 ages - the first 4 turns are the Early Age, turns 5-8 are the Middle Age, turns 9-12 are the Late Age. Each player will get to be the Byzantines for 6 out of the 12 turns.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10 Legacy Tokens. The Byzantine Empire starts with 10 Territory Tokens (TT). The most TT it can have is 20. If at any time the Byzantine Empire is reduced to zero or less Territory Tokens the game ends immediately and the current Byzantine player loses 3 Legacy Tokens.&#10;&#10;There are 2 decks: The Byzantine Deck and the Foes Deck. Cards are of certain types and have a force value. Some cards are only useable during specific Ages. At the start of the game all Middle and Late Age cards are removed from the decks and set aside. When the Middle Age starts the Middle Age cards are shuffled into the decks. When the Late Age starts the Late Age cards are shuffled into the deck.&#10;&#10;Each turn has 6 Phases: &#10;1.  Draw Phase&#10;-   The Foe player fills their hand to 8 cards. &#10;-   The Byzantine player fills his hand to 9 cards in the Early Age, 8 cards in the Middle Age, or 7 cards in the Late Age.&#10;&#10;2.  Age Phase&#10;-   Discard any cards in your hand that are not useable in the current Age and draw replacements. If the discarded cards are from an earlier age, remove them from the game.&#10;&#10;3.  Redraw Phase&#10;-   Each player may discard up to 4 cards and draw replacements.&#10;&#10;4.  Meld Phase&#10;-   Each player makes a Meld. &#10;-   A Byzantine meld may have up to 1 leader card, 2 recovery cards, 4 troop cards, 1 negotiation card and 2 legacy cards&#10;-   A Foe meld may have up to 1 Northern foe card, 1 Southern foe card, 2 disaster cards (Max 1 Natural Disaster) and 4 troop cards&#10;-   If a negotiation card is played, the Byzantine player may discard 1 target Foe card. The Foe player may replace it immediately with another Foe card if he has one in hand. &#10;-   Each player totals the force of the cards in his meld. The side with the higher force total wins. If tied the Foe player wins. &#10;-   The Byzantine Empire gains or loses Territory Tokens equal to the difference in the Force Point Totals.  &#10;-   All Meld cards are discarded. Unique Meld cards are removed from play.&#10;&#10;5.  Legacy Phase&#10;-   The Byzantine Player (BP) potentially earns Legacy Tokens (LT). If the Empire lost TT this turn the BP loses 1 LT. If the Empire gained TT this turn the BP gains 1 LT. &#10;-   The BP gains LT equal to the legacy value of the legacy cards he played in Meld Phase.&#10;&#10;6.  End Phase&#10;-   If you have cards left in your hand, discard down to 1 card and pass it to your opponent. &#10;-   Players switch control of the Emperor Token.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 12 turns. The player with the most Legacy Tokens at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Civilization type game using dice, map, and record keeping for 2-7 players.&#10;&#10;A map of the Mediterranean is divided up into multiple areas (about 20 per player).&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of units of a unique colour. There are 2 types of units, Population Tokens(PT) and City Tokens(CT). Each player starts by placing 7 PT onto one empty area on the board.&#10;&#10;A pad and pencil is used to keep track of Idea Points, Resource Points, Victory Points, and Advances.&#10;&#10;There are 8 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Leader Phase&#10;-   Roll once on the Great Leader Table. Dependant on result a player will receive population tokens or points (Idea, Resource, Move or Victory)&#10;-   The old Leader dies and a new leader is rolled for each of your turns.&#10;&#10;2.  City Phase&#10;-   Roll once on the City Table for each City you control. Dependant on results a player will receive a population token or a point (Idea, Resource, Move or Victory)&#10;&#10;3.  Advance Phase&#10;-   Gain 1D6 Idea Points (IP). Idea points are saved from turn to turn. &#10;-   A player may turn in 5 IP to gain 1 random advance.  This is determined by rolling once on a Research Table. &#10;-   The second advance you buy in a turn costs 7 IP, the third 9 IP and so on. &#10;-   Maximum IP you can store is 15. Excess is lost.&#10;&#10;4.  Growth Phase&#10;-   Gain 1D6 Population Tokens (PT). These may be placed in any areas a player controls. &#10;-   Max PT a single area can maintain is 10 (plus 1 city). Excess is lost.&#10;&#10;5.  Build Phase&#10;-   Gain 1D6 Resource Points (RP). A player may spend 5 RP and discard 5 PT to build a City in any area he controls. An area may contain only 1 city. &#10;-   A player may spend 10 RP to gain 1 Wonder of his choice. You cannot build more Wonders than you currently have Cities. &#10;-   Max RP you can store is 15. Excess is lost.&#10;&#10;6.  Disaster Phase&#10;-   A player rolls 1D6. On a roll of 5+ his culture experiences a disaster. &#10;-   Next a player rolls 1D6 to determine how many Population Tokens he loses. These are taken from any of his areas.  A city may be broken down into 5 PT to take losses. &#10;-   If you have an Advance that mitigates a disaster you get -2 to the casualty roll.&#10;&#10;7.  Clash Phase&#10;-   For each other Civ a player is adjacent to, he may choose either trade or war. &#10;-   If he chooses trade roll on a Trade Table to determine results&#10;-   If he chooses War, attacker picks 2 adjacent areas, 1 controlled by each player.  Each player rolls 2D6 and adds bonuses from War advances. &#10;The higher War roll total wins (Defender wins ties). Loser loses all units in the area lost. The winner gains control of the opposing Area by placing 1 PT from off the board onto the newly conquered area.&#10;&#10;8.  Migration Phase&#10;-   Roll 1D6 to get that many Move Points (MP). &#10;-   A player may use 1 MP to move 1 PT to an adjacent area. Sailing and road advances allow PT to move further. &#10;-   Move points are not saved from turn to turn.&#10;&#10;The Game ends when any of the following happens: All areas containing land are occupied; all wonders are built; any one player has 7 or more cities or only 1 player is left (automatic winner).&#10;&#10;At end of game add up Victory Points from advances and Iconic Leaders, city rolls + 1 per area you occupy + 5 per Wonder built.  The player with the highest VP score wins.&#10;&#10;",

These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.&#10;&#10;By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.&#10;&#10;Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards, special actions, and terrain sectors to build the map!  Kingdom Builder: Big Box ramps up this variability by including all expansions to date, ensuring you'll never play the same game twice!&#10;&#10;Kingdom Builder: Big Box includes the four expansions Nomads, Crossroads, Marshlands and Harvest as well as three Queenies (Capitol, Caves and Island).&#10;&#10;(The first edition Big Box has only the first 2 expansions and queenies.)&#10;&#10;Note: At least the first printing of Kingdom Builder: Big Box (Second Edition) had misprinted Task cards for the Crossroads Expansion. The back of the cards are printed with the same back as regular Kingdom Builder Cards. During setup, sort them out before drawing Kingdom Builder Cards and the game works fine.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#228;&#190;&#141;&#233;&#179;&#165; (Samurai Dori) is a Japanese dexterity game. The publisher gives an alternate name &mdash; &quot;Samurai-Dori &#239;&#189;&#158;Wings of Bushido&#239;&#189;&#158;&quot; &mdash; to reflect the activity. The first edition was published in 2016 in Japanese but a new edition is being prepared for SPIEL '17, with English, German and French rules. The game includes printed cubes which the players arrange in more or less challenging targets. It's important that players are respectful, and they must bow before making their shots.&#10;&#10;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#232;&#136;&#136; (T&#197;&#141;senky&#197;&#141;), created in Japan during the Edo period, is a traditional target practice game in which you have to throw a folding fan at a target placed on a stand and knock it down. Samurai Dori has simpler rules than T&#197;&#141;senky&#197;&#141;. We have arranged the gameplay to make it easier for anyone to play. The cubes and targets represent animals, and folding fans are hunting birds. You compete to see who can hunt the most animals. You can play eight different scenarios depending on how you arrange the three cubes. Even though it is a simple game, it has a deep feel to it, which even children and older people can enjoy.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#177;&#159;&#230;&#136;&#184;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#231;&#181;&#177;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#232;&#136;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#229;&#176;&#132;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#190;&#141;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#232;&#136;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#139;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#139;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;3&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#133;&#168;8&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#165;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#183;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#228;&#190;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#229;&#175;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

There&rsquo;s just one problem: there&rsquo;s a fire in the gunpowder room! Once the flames reach the powder kegs, the ship will be blown to smithereens and your treasure with it. So grab as much swag as ye can and jump overboard before the ship goes BOOM!&#10;&#10;Shuffle the cards and place the pile face down in the center of the table, next to the treasure chest filled with coins. There are 29 Coin Cards with a value of 1 to 5 coins, but there are also unpleasant cards in the form of eight Pirate cards and the BOOM! card.&#10;&#10;All cards are mixed to form a face-down stack and in turn everyone takes their turn and draws a card.&#10;&#10;Every player hopes to draw coins cards, but these will only be paid out when you disembark the ship. When a player draws a Coin Card he keeps it in his hand. On the next turn, he draws another card. But he can also decide to jump overboard! To jump overboard, the player adds up the value of the cards in his hand and collects the same number of coins from the Treasure Chest. He then places his cards on the discard pile and sits out the rest of the round.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a Pirate card, he executes the action. Examples of this card are taking cards from fellow players or even throwing them overboard. The player will collect the value of his cards in coins and sit out the rest of the round. With the Davy Jones&rsquo; Locker card, you are safe from the next five cards drawn&mdash;you can sit back and relax.&#10;&#10;But if the BOOM! card is drawn, all is lost! Players still on board the ship must return all their Coin Cards. No coins are collected (except by the holder of the Davy Jones' Locker card). All players discard their cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends when all players have jumped overboard or the BOOM! card has been drawn. The discard pile is then shuffled and used as the draw pile for the next round. The player that drew the BOOM! card in the last round goes first.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more coins in the Treasure Chest. The player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The cards have 7 basic characteristics: Enemy, Disaster, Men, Control, Action, Fight and Victory. Each suit performs one or two of these basic characteristics.&#10;&#10;There is a common set of Victory Tokens (VT) and Cossack Tokens (CT) and one Hetman Token (HT).&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of one Cossack enemy: Russians, Poles, Ottomans, or Tatars.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 7 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Fate Phase&#10;-    You draw 3 cards. You may discard a control card to draw 2 additional cards.&#10;&#10;2.   Sich Phase&#10;-    You may trade cards, CT, and VT with other players.&#10;&#10;3.   Control Phase&#10;-    You may discard a control card to gain possession of the Hetman Token. &#10;-    You may discard a disaster card to cause a target player to &#10;discard 3 random cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;4.   Cossack Phase&#10;-    You may discard men cards: If you discard 2 men cards gain 3 cossack tokens (CT); 3 men cards gain 5 CT; 4 men cards gain 7 CT and so on. Add 1 CT if one or more cards are from the same suit.&#10;&#10;5.   Raid Phase&#10;-    To go on a raid, you must be the current Hetman and you must discard 1 enemy card and 1 action card, otherwise skip this phase. &#10;-    You cannot play an enemy card corresponding to the role that is yours. &#10;-    Roll 3 dice and add them up to get a raid total. Subtract this total from the number of CT you have. If the result is positive gain that many VT. If the result is negative, lose that many VT. &#10;-    You may discard a fight card to cause a 1 of the 3 dice to be rerolled or to cause a roll to be reduced by 1. &#10;-    Discard all your CT. &#10;-    If you won, the player with the role of that enemy loses VT equal to the amount you gained.&#10;&#10;6.   Glory Phase&#10;-    If you are the current Hetman gain 1 VT. &#10;-    If you went on a successful raid last phase you may discard 1 victory card to gain 1 VT, 2 victory cards to gain 3 VT, 3 victory cards to gain 5 VT and so on. &#10;-    You may also play an enemy card of the same suit of the enemy card you &#10;played in Raid Phase: Gain 3 VT for each such card played.&#10;&#10;7.   End Phase&#10;-    Discard an enemy card or reveal your hand to all players. &#10;-    Max 10 CT. Discard excess CT. &#10;-    Max Hand size is 4 cards. Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate 35 Victory Tokens wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2-4+ players set in the HALO Universe.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck comprising 6 basic types of cards: Spartan (S), Mission (M), Weapon (W), Enemy (E), Vehicle (V), Special X).  Each card has a Mission Point Value (MPV) ranging from 1 to 5. Some of the types have sub-types. There are 15 cards each for Spartan, Mission, Vehicle, and Special. There are 30 cards each for Weapon and Enemy card types. Each player starts with 10 cards dealt from the deck.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10 Shield Points (SP). If a player ever has less than Zero Shield Points, he immediately discards 3 cards and loses 5 Mission Points. He then immediately goes back up to 10 SP. 10 SP is the Max, you cannot go over this.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn having 5 Phases:&#10;&#10;1.    Insertion Phase&#10;-     Fill your hand to 10 cards.&#10;&#10;2.    Action Phase&#10;-     You may play (discard) one of your cards to activate its special ability.  Each card type has 1 special ability associated with it.&#10;&#10;3.    Attack Phase&#10;-     You may play (discard) one card to attack 1 target opponent. The card must be either an enemy card or an alien weapon or alien vehicle. The target player loses shield points equal to the MPV of the attack card. You cannot pick the same target the player immediately before you picked.&#10;&#10;4.    Objective Phase&#10;-     If possible, you may make one or more melds in this phase - there are 30 types of melds possible. Score mission points equal to the combined MPV of all of the cards in the meld. Discard the melded cards.&#10;&#10;5.    Extraction Phase&#10;-     Regain 2 shield points. &#10;-     Discard down to 9 cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate 100 mission points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Platoon Leader is a stand-alone game compatible with both.&#10;&#10;THE WARS HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS.&#10;&#10;The Gaea Prime Empire is still hungry and still has many enemies, including a new one &ndash; the Zhuh-Zhuh. The Bug menace is at its worst and everyday there are reports of Hishen gains, closer and closer to the Home World. Darkness is coming and the body count is growing.&#10;&#10;I like to think we&rsquo;ve got them where we want them.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;re a Platoon Leader in command of three Squads. You can lead Gaea Prime soldiers, Hishen clones, Grath creatures, Zhuh-Zhuh &ldquo;monkey boys&rdquo;; heck even bone crunching Bugs, it&rsquo;s all up to you.&#10;&#10;Although we&rsquo;ve increased the size of your games, we&rsquo;ve kept the detail from 5150: Star Army while streamlining the mechanics. Now you can play with more figures in less time.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve expanded the Campaign Rules, not made them harder. We&rsquo;ve built upon those found in 5150: Star Army to now include the option to fight from planet to planet. In short, more fun, less work.&#10;&#10;Inside you'll find:&#10;&#10;     Rules to easily handle a full platoon for infantry and their support weapons.&#10;     A pre-generated campaign linking your Missions, yet still allowing you to play one-off battles when desired.&#10;     A planetary conquest campaign.&#10;     A system that rewards your successes and punishes your failures.&#10;     New Aliens to fight, plus the old Hishen and Bug standbys.&#10;     A color sheet of printable top-down counters for Hishen, Grath, Symons, and Star Army troops.
