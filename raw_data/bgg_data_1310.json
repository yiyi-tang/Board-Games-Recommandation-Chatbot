The millennial generation has generated more intrigue than any other. And rightly so in our opinion. That&rsquo;s why we created Millennial AF: the &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s most likely to&rdquo; card game that&rsquo;ll reveal the biggest bottomless brunching, quinoa munching, Insta-influencing millennial in your group.&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s how it might play out&hellip;&#10;Jess: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s most likely to&hellip; text &lsquo;I&rsquo;m outside&rsquo; rather than ring the doorbell?&#10;Josh: &ldquo;Well that can&rsquo;t be me. I&rsquo;d never do that.&rdquo;&#10;Sam: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s totes something you&rsquo;d do, Josh!&rdquo;&#10;Jess: &ldquo;Josh IMHO.&rdquo;&#10;George: &ldquo;Josh. Without a doubt.&rdquo;&#10;Josh: &ldquo;WTF?!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Josh then gets that card. And at the end each player tallies their cards; the one with the most is the most millennial of them all.&#10;&#10;Millennial AF is the generational game based on typical millennial traits. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at just how millennial we all are&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

The game where you decide how the storylines unfold on TV!&#10;&#10;Total Control Wrestling provides players with an entire game system focused on a wrestling promotion with a weekly TV show. Every week, the show builds on the characters, storylines, feuds, and angles of the previous shows. It&rsquo;s like watching your favorite weekly wrestling show on TV. You never know what will happen, who will show up, or what matches you may see. But one thing is for sure&hellip; it will lead to a knock-down, drag-out, feud-settling match down the road!&#10;&#10;Create your own wrestlers or use those included in the game to get right into the action! The random creation process allows you to generate a wrestler&rsquo;s physical stats, never knowing what you may get. Will it be a giant? Or a luchador? Then you decide the wrestler&rsquo;s style and attributes to fit the prototype. Alternately, players can disregard the random process and assign any stats and attributes as they see fit, making the wrestler of their dreams! Perhaps you want to make replicas of the stars you watch on TV? You can do that, too!&#10;&#10;The game system allows players to customize and use whatever elements they want and disregard the rest. Players can track everything built into the game system or use the most basic aspects for matches. Only want to use the Match Charts to determine winners in one-off matches? You can. Want to leave out the XP and Character Progression? You can do that without affecting the rest of the game. If detailing all the Feuds is too much work, leave that out and let the charts tell the stories from one show to the next. For the ultimate experience, get out some paper and pencils and run an entire promotion, keeping track of every stat, win, loss, storyline, angle, and feud from beginning to end.&#10;&#10;The Chart Manual guides the general action of the TV show. However, players add the details, develop the personalities, and use their own creativity to enhance the show as it tells the stories from week-to-week. Angles, interviews, and scenarios will build Feuds between rivals until they can settle it once-and-for-all in the ring. New feuds will emerge, old feuds will re-start, wrestlers will turn on each other, and more! The game system provides the methods and means, but it is up to you to decide how and why it happened.&#10;&#10;You have Total Control!&#10;&#10;",

Prussia plans for its troops to cross the Sudetes and penetrate Bohemia by 4 different passages with the objective of confronting the principal Austrian Army in a decisive Napoleonic battle. The outlet of one of these passages was here, near the towns of Nachod and Skalitz. The Prussian V Corps was in position to take control of it and allow the VI Corps to follow it before converging with the other Prussian corps on the centre of the Austrian presence. General Steinmetz is appointed commander of the Prussian 1st Army in 1870 and will have to confront the Austrian troops sent by General Benedek.&#10;&#10;As a new unit of the series &ldquo;Battles in the era of Napoleon III&rdquo;, Nachod-Skalitz is the first game of a series that will cover the principal clashes of the campaign in Bohemia of 1866, concluding with the battle of Sadowa. Players will have the option of playing the battles one after another in a campaign mode, resulting perhaps in a very different situation by the time they arrive at the decisive battle of 3 July 1866.&#10;&#10;Using the series &ldquo;The Great Battles of Napoleon III&rdquo; (VaeVictis # 55, # 73 and 138), the system is simple and dynamic with an accent on the engagement of the troops against deadly defensive fire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Scale :&#10;&#10;Game turn : one hour&#10;Counters : regiments and battalions&#10;Map : one hex. = 750 m&#10;Complexity : 5/10&#10;Solo playability  : 7/10&#10;Duration : 2 to 4 hours depending on the scenario&#10;&#10;(sources : rulebook and description from the Publisher)&#10;&#10;The second volume of the campaign of 1866 is Trautenau/Soor (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/372473/trautenau-and-soor-1866)&#10;The third volume of the campaign of 1866 is M&uuml;nchengr&auml;tz/Gitschin (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/418334/munchengratz-gitschin-1866)&#10;&#10;",

On paper, the Bolivians should win handily: they enjoyed a three to one superiority in manpower against the Paraguayans. However, to reach the front the Bolivians had to overcome long lines of communication, impossible terrain and low morale. The Paraguayans, on the other hand, saw the war as a life-or-death struggle. Thanks to their superior morale and leadership, the Paraguayans inflicted a series of defeats to the Bolivians and won most of the Chaco in the post-war peace settlement.&#10;&#10;Components: 22x34 inch map, 176 die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;World at War #86, OCT-NOV 2022.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "First, all the marbles are placed on the board behind the start line. Marbles will be moving to the right or counter clockwise during play. Two dice are rolled to determine the odds for each marble racer from the inside track to the outside track. For instance, if on the roll for marble racer number one a 5 and a 2 are rolled then the odds for that racer is 7 to 1.&#10;&#10;The house starts with $1,000,000 (Million Dollars) and each player starts with $100,000 each to place bets on the racers. (This starting amount can be changed).&#10;&#10;Each racer is worth $1,000 a race (again this amount can be changed or even randomly set by the roll of the dice) Example, if a player loses on a racer, they lose a thousand bucks! But if they win on a racer they get paid whatever the odds are on that racer: Example, if the racer has odds of 5 to 1 then they win $5,000. A player can place bets on more than one racer at a time.&#10;&#10;The dice are rolled for each racer until one racer crosses the finish line. One designated player can roll all the dice for the game or each player can take turns.&#10;&#10;The end of the game comes when someone loses all their cash or when a set number of races are run as determined by the players before the start of the game.&#10;&#10;With this game you have the option to even make up your own rules, maybe you have some good ideas for how to set up betting for this game.&#10;&#10;&quot;&mdash;description from the publisher&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Watch on the Oder: January 1945 is a hypothetical two-player game allowing the players to examine the strategic possibilities inherent in the campaign that may have taken place had Hitler decided to send the forces he used historically in the Ardennes to the eastern front. Both sides&rsquo; orders of battle are entirely historic within that context. Each of the eight game turns represents four days, and each large hex on the map equals 20 miles. The map runs from the Oder River on the west to the Riga-Pinsk line on the east. Units are German corps and Soviet armies. The turn sequence is I-Go-U-Go, but both players decide if their force will move and fight or fight and move. Playing time is about three hours, and is easily adapted for solitaire play. Complexity is low-medium. The German has to strike hard and fast at the beginning in order to weaken the inevitable Soviet counteroffensive.&#10;&#10;World at War #82 February-March 2022&#10;&#10;",

We recommend playing your first games without it, though. Gratitudes, when you&rsquo;re ready to use them, will let you experience a new layer of strategy.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, you receive 5 Gratitude tokens. Each of them corresponds to one of the crystal colors. When you place a crystal on a Queendom Map board, you flip the Gratitude token of the corresponding color face up, thus activating it. From now on, you may use it. Each token grants you a special one-time ability. When the token is used, it flips face down... until you retrieve it again by placing the crystal of its color on the Map board. Each Gratitude token is a very powerful tool if used wisely. For example, green token allows you to swap any 2 Queen&rsquo;s Domain tiles on the Map board, and red one can replace up to 3 crystals on the Crystal Holder tiles.&#10;&#10;&bull; Royal Jewelry mini-expansion:&#10;&#10;This expansion adds a whole new level of strategy. In the base game, crystals from the Spell Books you activate are discarded. Royal Jewelry gives these crystals a second life. After you activate a Spell Book, instead of discarding crystal(s), you move them to your Royal Jewelry card. You may choose to put crystal(s) in the Treasury or add it to your Tiara. At the end of the game the Treasury generates 1 VP for every 2 crystals in it, and The Tiara can generate up to insane 10 VPs!&#10;&#10;&bull; Great Wizard solo mini-expansion:&#10;&#10;What do wizards do when there are no other wizards to compete with? Well, they perform special quests for their Queen! This solo mini-expansion is&#226;&#128;&#175;fully compatible with other mini-expansions and allows you to experience almost the same gameplay even when there are no other wizards around.&#10;&#10;When you play solo, replace common Spell Books with 8 special ones and remove all but 20 crystals from the game. Create patterns out of enchanted crystals as usual and do your best to score as many VPs as possible. Compare your result with the chart and measure your success on a scale from a mere Charlatan to a truly Great Wizard!&#10;&#10;",

Each monster has an ability such as triggering the top card of your discard pile. You don't play cards from your hand; you take cards from a 4-card pool and trigger the card as you take it. At the end of the game players discard down to their best 2 cards. Neutralizers then destroy their corresponding monsters, and the player with the best surviving combination of cards wins.&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;End the game with the highest combined point total between your final 2 cards.&#3;&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Shuffle all cards and deal 4 face-up into the center row (the Pool), and one face- down into each player&rsquo;s personal discard pile. At any time, players may look at (but not rearrange) their discard pile. Choose a random &ldquo;start player&rdquo; to begin.&#3;&#10;&#10;EACH PLAYER&rsquo;S TURN (proceed clockwise)&#10;Draw a card from the Pool, say its name and number aloud, and trigger/resolve  its primary ability. (If another card gets triggered, reveal it and resolve it.) Fill the Pool back to 4 from the face-down deck.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you exceed your hand limit (3 cards), discard excess cards face-down to your discard pile. When the draw deck is empty, continue taking turns until everyone has had an equal number. Then Resolution begins.&#3;&#10;&#10;NEUTRALIZER CARDS&#10;These do nothing when drawn/triggered; instead they are used during Resolution. Most Neutralizers negate the points granted by 2 specific Monsters (in any players&rsquo; hands). Neutralizers are not Monsters; their points can&rsquo;t be negated.&#3;&#10;&#10;RESOLUTION (combine / score your 2 cards)&#10;All players discard down to just 2 cards. In turn order, each player dramatically reveals their highest-number card. Then they reveal their other card. Resolve all Neutralizers. The player with the highest total score wins the game. If there is a tie, the tied player with the highest-value surviving Monster is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

All pieces have to remain connected at least diagonally. A piece moves into the direction of the cone tip, jumping over all other connected pieces in front of it (like in Reinhold Wittig's old game Wabanti, which inspired the name). An upright cone means placing a new cone in the central area, a second upright cone means removing a piece anywhere. &#10;The winner is the first player who has a piece leave the game board on their side.&#10;&#10;",

The Soviets have Second and Third Ukrainian Fronts, as well as the Romanian army.&#10;&#10;Budapest Campaign ends just prior to the start of Spring Awakening (World at War #73) which covers the final German offensive on the Eastern Front.

NEI is a combined naval-air-land campaign, in which operational capabilities can be decisive. The game system shows the effects of various operations over the course of a scenario. Players conduct Actions which encompass discrete combat, logistical, intelligence and other operations. A player can conduct one or more Actions per turn. All units in the game use a similar combat system. The system shows the interaction of naval, air and land forces.

There are 2 ways to earn ducats, either from your own cargo or from the cargo of your fellow players, which you take from them with the help of the buccaneers. The routes are always determined anew, if a ship has reached a target port, thereby one can equip a ship also again. Each ship must be moved once per turn, the range depends on the wind.&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of influencing wind direction, setting buccaneer courses, moving merchant ships, moving buccaneers, passing a marker.

    "Description": "First game in the The Glory and Empire series.&#10;&#10;Glory and Empire is a fresh look at grand tactical command, maneuver and combat during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Period.  The system is focused on command, maneuver and combat that is fast playing, yet accurate and rich with detail.&#10;&#10;The game is 125m per hex. Units are battalions and companies for infantry, regiments and squadrons for cavalry and companies for artillery. Each strength point is 100 men for infantry, 50 men and horses for cavalry or  one section, or 2 guns, for artillery. Counters are 5/8&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules consist of a Soldier's, Battalion and Brigade rules set. Players can learn the basics with the Soldier's rules, move to a full fledged simulation with the Battalion Game and pick and choose rules from the Brigade Game to suit their tastes. Or players can jump right into the Brigade Game and understand how grand tactical maneuvering was practiced on the battlefield during the 18th and 19th centuries.&#10;&#10;The Soldier's Game gives players new to the era an introduction to foundational concepts of tactics in the horse and musket era. In the Soldier's and Battalion Games there are the usual Line, Column, Square and skirmishers.  The Battalion game has two types of Skirmishers, introduces important concepts for maneuvering forces on the battlefield and has more detailed close combat procedures. The Brigade Game adds close columns, attack columns, closed square, Austrian division masses.  Artillery is simplified for the Soldier's and Battalion Games, but the Battalion Game adds artillery ammunition. The Brigade Game adds bombardment zones, bounce through, howitzer fire and separate ammunition tracking for round shot, shell,  canister and shrapnel. The Brigade Game also gives players more tools to react to enemy moves.&#10;&#10;The piece de resistance of the Brigade Game are the command rules. Players choose to form their brigades into Grand Columns or Lines of Battle. To deploy for battle the player must decide which evolution to use to form Line of Battle and shake his men into fighting order.  To cross a bridge or move through a defile in the face of the enemy will take careful planning to avoid being embarrassed by the enemy when the columns emerge on the other side. Keeping the troops in good order is all important if  the day is to be won.&#10;&#10;The system will make its debut with Lock 'n Load publishing, featuring Wellington's first victories against Napoleon's forces in the Peninsula,  with the battles of Roli&ccedil;a and Vimeiro. If all goes well we'll follow it up with Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and Salamanca.&#10;&#10;Play Glory and Empire and learn the trade of fighting a Napoleonic period battle and earn your marshal's baton.&#10;&#10;Facebook Page&#10;&#10;",

Who has more imagination?&#10;&#10;The structure cards are placed in the center of the table in order from 1 to 5: these will provide the players with the guide for the construction of the stories.  The dealer shuffles the inspiration cards and arranges them face down and scattered on the table.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to conquer a succession of cards from 1 to 5. In turn, starting with the player to the right of the dealer, each draws a card from the table until he has 5 cards each (uncovered in front of him).  If no one has a sequence from 1 to 5, the game continues: each player, in turn, draws a new map and discards one in his possession, placing it face down on the table.  If a player rolls a series of 1 to 5, stop the game and try to tell a story by connecting the 4 images with the final map and using the structure cards as a template (on the back of each there is a short description for each phase of the  story that helps the player to create the tale).  After telling the story, the other players give a score from 1 to 10 to the narrator (the votes add up and form the score of each narrator; the scores can be written on a sheet of paper).  he used blankets on the bench randomly and draws five more.  The game continues in the same way with the player to the right of the last narrator.  Whoever gets to 100 points first (or more or less at the choice of the players) wins.

    "Description": "A fun collection of strategy games in a practical format, for many one-on-one challenges, wherever you want and with whoever you want.  Are you ready? Choose the game, take the marker and think about the right move!&#10;&#10;The pack contains 7 boards on which the boards of the following classic abstract games are shown: GOMOKU - NIM - DOTS &amp; BOXES - SNAKES - MAMMA VS PAPPA - CHINESE WALL.&#10;&#10;GOMOKU It is an ancient strategy game also called &quot;five in a row&quot;. The players take turns marking a square with their symbol (eg &quot;O&quot; and &quot;X&quot;). The first player to get five of their own symbols aligned, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, wins the game.&#10;&#10;NIM It is an ancient game of unknown origins. The players take turns erasing one or more cans from a single row.  They must remove at least one jar and can remove any number of cans from the same row.  The last player able to move wins.&#10;&#10;DOTS &amp; BOXES It is a &quot;pencil and paper&quot; game with countless variations. How to play The two players take turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines between two adjacent points.  If a player completes the fourth side of a square, he marks that square with the initial of his name (or a letter of recognition) and must immediately draw another line (as if it were an extra turn).  When all squares have been filled, the player who has captured the most squares is the winner.&#10;&#10;SNAKES It is the &quot;pen and paper&quot; version of an old video game.  How to play It is played on a 7 x 7 point matrix.  The first player starts from the green &quot;S&quot; point in the upper left, while the other starts with the red &quot;S&quot; point in the lower right, as shown in the image.  Players take turns growing their snake, extending it one segment at a time by drawing a horizontal or vertical line from the previous point to an adjacent one.  The first player unable to move loses.&#10;&#10;MOM VS PAPPA It is a &quot;pen and paper&quot; strategy game: the aim is to recreate the word MOM for one player and the word PAPPA on the grid for the other. At the beginning of the game, the players decide who plays for PAPPA (inserting the letters P and A) and who for MOMMA (inserting the letters Me A).  On his turn, the player inserts one of the two letters of his word in any box, without having to use the same letter every turn.  The player who is the first to spell his word horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.&#10;&#10;CHINESE WALL is a simple and fun game.  The aim is to be the last player to create a wall that spans three territories.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

A game of language skill and strategy to train the minds of young and old.&#10;&#10;Mix the letter tiles and arrange them in the center of the table forming a 5x5 square.  Each player takes a marker, a word-form board and a joker triangle.  Procedure The youngest player places the black placeholder on a letter-card of his choice.  Each player then chooses a letter (present in the selected tile) and writes it on their word-form board (in one of the circles).  Then the next player moves the placeholder onto another letter-card adjacent to the previous one (the movement can take place by one step).  The process is repeated up to that the players have not completed the six letters on their wordform board.  At this point the players, within 30 seconds, must write a meaningful word using their transcribed letters.  Each player will earn as many points as there are letters in the written word.  The score achieved by each player must be written in the corresponding space on the scorecard.  Jolly Triangle During a round, players can play the joker by placing the triangle of their color on the active letter-tile: in the word formation phase, they will be able to use a letter present in that tile an infinite number of times.  New round The trailing player takes the placeholder and starts a new round in the same way as the previous one.  The game continues and ends when a player reaches 20 points (or more or less at the players' choice).  He will be the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Who will resist until the end?  &#10;A card game for everyone with an engaging mechanism, from 4 to 10.&#10;&#10;Each player is given five tokens of the same color.  The oldest player shuffles the cards well and places the deck in the center of the table.  The objective of the game is not to remain at the end of the round with the lowest card in hand.&#10;&#10;Starting with the player to the right of the one who shuffled the cards, and proceeding counterclockwise, each competitor draws a card from the deck, observes it and keeps it face down in front of him.

The round continues counterclockwise and ends when all the competitors have made their trades. The last player of the round (the one who shuffled the cards) can decide whether to keep the card he drew (or received from an exchange), or he can make the exchange himself by drawing a card from the top of the deck.

If a player realizes that he has used the poisonous letter, he does not score points and also loses all those previously earned.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, the hand passes to the next player and the procedure is repeated.

The quizzes are expressed in such a way that each player must find a correspondence between a figure on his card and a figure on the bank card (see example).  The first to find the right figures takes the dealer card (you have to be quick!) and shows the correct match.

    "Description": "What do you think about when you see a gift? You are happy Amazed?  Or are you sad because you think about the gift you haven't received yet?   In this party game both the guesser and the one who makes guess the right emotion win!&#10;&#10;A player acts as the narrator: he draws an inspiration card and places it face up on the table clearly visible to all.  He observes the card for the time necessary, thinks about a real or imaginary fact that aroused one of the emotions on the appropriate board and chooses the card corresponding to the emotion he felt, placing it covered in the appropriate space on the board.  He then gives him a clue by briefly recounting the fact or describing the situation he imagined, avoiding pronouncing the emotion or making too explicit references to it (otherwise the turn is blocked and we proceed with another heat).&#10;&#10;Immediately afterwards, the other players try to guess the emotion felt by the narrator, placing a vote-token on the board, near the square that represents the emotion that each one believes has been experienced and chosen by the narrator.  You can use them for voting tokens of value 1, 2 or 3 depending on how convinced one is of one's intuition.  Players vote one at a time, starting with the player to the right of the narrator.  Once the voting is finished, the narrator turns the emotion card showing it to everyone and the bets are checked and any progress on the scoreboard is carried out.  The turn passes to the next player starting a new game round.  The first to complete two full laps of the board wins.&#10;&#10;If only one player guesses correctly, the narrator advances by a number equal to double the token bet by the player he guessed right.  &bull; If two or more players guess the emotion, the narrator stands still in his position.  &bull; If no one guesses the emotion, the narrator goes back three boxes,&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Are you more logical or creative?  &#10;Here is a very original party game that tests your problem solving skills, stimulating lateral thinking: the winner is the one who finds the most solutions using unusual tools and unleashing ... genius!&#10;&#10;The player whose turn it is draws 4 instrument maps, placing them face up and side by side.  Then he draws a situation card and reads aloud the text corresponding to the color where his placeholder is on the board.  At this point each competitor, within the time of an hourglass, must find an effective and brilliant solution using the greatest number of tools discovered.  Solutions must be written on the slate.  If the current player is on the pencil box, the competitors will have to describe the solution only through the drawing.  In this case the player whose turn it is reads any problem from the drawn card.  When the time is up, the players present their solutions and calculate the scores.  The game continues with another round: the new player on duty draws an instrument map and replaces it, at his choice, with one of those already active on the table, then draws a situation card and proceeds to a new game.  .  Scoring and end of the game If a solution is not considered valid by the majority of the players, it is discarded.  The players who find a valid solution advance one square for each map-tool used.  If a competitor has found a different solution from the others (original solution), he doubles the score.  The winner is the first to finish 3 laps of the board (or more or less, at the choice of the players at the start of the race).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Who was Napoleon? How is the golden eagle made? In this fun party game, the winner is whoever provides the most news and information on a topic, among seven fields of knowledge.&#10;&#10;The deck of knowledge cards is shuffled and placed face down in the center of the table.  Each competitor takes a marker, a slate and four plus tokens (Where? How? When? And Why?) of the same color. The youngst player starts spinning the spinner and draws a knowledge card.  All players must write on their slate attributes, qualities, characteristics or other elements, up to a maximum of four, which identify the topic present in the knowledge card in correspondence with the symbol indicated by the spinner.  The first one who writes four attributes says &quot;STOP&quot; and counts up to 15, after which the other competitors also stop and score points.&#10;&#10;When the spinner points to the wedge with the little face, the choice of the category is at the player's discretion.  The game continues in the same way with another round (change the player whose turn it is clockwise). The winner is the one who reaches 30 points first (or more, or less, at the choice of the competitors).&#10;&#10;Each competitor earns 1 point for each attribute identified.  If the attribute is original, or was not identified by any other player, it is worth 3 points.  The score can also double: after the spinner has been turned, but before the knowledge card is drawn, each player can decide to play one of the four plus tokens.  Competitors who have played the token doubles the score for each attribute that answers the question contained in the token played: How? Where is it? When? and why? Played plus tokens must be set aside and can no longer be used.  Furthermore, plus tokens cannot be played when the spinner lands on the wedge with the face.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Do you really know the meaning of the words you use?  &#10;Find out with this fun party game in which competitors compete to formulate the definition of more or less difficult words: the winner is whoever is more convincing!&#10;&#10;Procedure For each round there is a player who acts as a reader.  The reader turns the spinner and draws a vocabulary card.  He turns the hourglass and the other competitors will have to write a definition of the word on the card that corresponds to the color indicated by the spinner, while the reader searches the dictionary for the exact definition of the word.  At the end of the time, each player votes for the most suitable definition but he can't  vote his own), placing his vote token on the corresponding slate.&#10;&#10;At this point the reader reads the definition of the dictionary and decides which is the best definition. The author of the best definition earns 3 points.  In addition, each player earns 1 point for each vote received by his definition, even if it is incorrect.  The points are marked in the appropriate form.  The winner is whoever has scored the most points after a full round (i.e. after all players have taken their turns as player).  Competitors can decide, before starting the race, to make the game last two, three or more laps.&#10;&#10;The challenge: If the spinner indicates the wedge with the little face, the word card is not drawn but the reader indicates an opponent to challenge and the game is played in the following way: the reader chooses a word of his choice (taken from the knowledge base) and search the dictionary for the correct definition. He writes two definitions on his own slate, one right and one wrong, trying to trick the opponent.  The opponent chooses the definition. If he gets it right, he wins 3 points, otherwise 3 points go to the player.&#10;&#10;",
