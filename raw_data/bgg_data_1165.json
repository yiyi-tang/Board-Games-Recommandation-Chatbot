Use your cards wisely to gain information about the other players, slay your opponents, betray your allies, and hasten the Revolt!&#10;&#10;The goal of Revolt is to determine which of the other players are on your team and slay your enemies.  However, teams are hidden at the beginning and will change throughout the duration of the game. You need to use your memory, induction, and political machinations to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Use cards from your hand to slay opponents, betray your allies, forge an alliance with your enemies, steal other players cards, and stop other players from using their cards.  You may play as many cards from your hand as you would like on each of your turns.&#10;&#10;The game is won when all the players left alive agree that they are on the same team. They then reveal their team to all players.  If they are correct, victory is achieved. However, if they are wrong, all living players are dead and all other players are alive and gameplay continues.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Animal Relay is a fast paced, entertaining game of racing in a highly portable package. In Animal Relay players manage an allocation of Animals to contest a relay race by choosing their optimal team.&#10;&#10;Players are assigned six animals from a pack of 48 unique options from which they must choose and programme* their preferred team. Animal&rsquo;s combined speed will be central to a winning strategy, however, other characteristics such as height, width and natural predatory instincts, may influence progress in neighbouring lanes. Each player will have information regarding their own team, with other teams revealed as the game progresses. Players strategies should allow for possible opportunities and interruptions from neighbouring lanes.&#10;&#10;The game is suitable for 1-6 players. More players can compete with the additions of more packs. When playing with less than six players, one or more players may contest with more than one team or the random allocation of cards permits unallocated (but sub-optimal) teams to challenge for the win. &#10;The game is a perfect ice-breaking social game because of its easy to explain rules, intuitive setting, fast pace and flexible player count. It is also a great filler game to pass 15-20 minutes while waiting for players to assemble for a longer game. Its quick and changeable gameplay however, often lead to contests of best of three, best of five&hellip;etc&#10;&#10;The game contains: &#10; 48 No. Unique Animal Cards;&#10; 4 No. Progress Track Cards;&#10; 6 No. Individually Coloured Dice;&#10; 6 No. Individually Colour Player Markers.&#10;&#10;The game is not intended as an educational game, however additional scientific information is presented for each animal.&#10;&#10;Please don&rsquo;t take offence at these animals sticking there tongues out at you; each was requested to prove they had no illegal devices to aid in the carrying of a baton!&#10;&#10;&#10;     To programme is a modern gaming term for simply organising options in advance where all players choices are then played out without alteration in sequence. Compliant programming choices in this game are easily comprehensible by simply lining up linking graphics of batons.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Every conceivable actions are possible, it is up to the GM to adapt them to the game.&#10;When PCs enter the catacombs the game play is in turns.&#10;2/Game turn&#10;During a game turn, there is first the PCs&rsquo; turn then the GM&rsquo;s turn and each turn is divided into 3 phases.&#10;PC&rsquo;s turn :&#10;Phase 1: The characters recover all their action points (A.Point).&#10;Phase 2: One of the PC&rsquo;s (by turns) draw an unexpected card at the start of each turn (except in the first turn of the game) and the PCs suffer its effects. Take care of all the various effects affecting the PCs and their allies (Fear, Burning, Poisoned...), and remove expired markers.&#10;Phase 3: Each PC does his actions (walk, run, attack, search ...). Each time a PC does an action, he removes the equivalent action points as indicated by the action&rsquo;s cost. When a character is activated, they aren&rsquo;t obligated to spend all their action points in one go. For example, they may do one action then let another PC or ally play their actions and finish their actions afterwards. But once the PC&rsquo;s turn is over, all remaining action points are lost.&#10;GM&rsquo;s Turn:&#10;The GM repeats the 3 phases of a turn, like during the PCs&rsquo; turn (bare in mind that the GM doesn&rsquo;t draw an unexpected event card). The GM&rsquo;s characters play in the GM&rsquo;s desired order.&#10;3/End of the game&#10;The game ends when the main quest is completed or all PCs are eliminated.&#10;The GM then reads the conclusion of the quest and the PCs intervene verbally describe their actions.&#10;The PCs add up the experience points, Ecus earned and the treasures found during the game and share them equally.&#10;Then the PCs spend their experience points to develop their characteristics and gain new skills. They can go to town in order to buy new equipment with their hard-earned ecus.&#10;&#10;- description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Siege Artillery will play an important role being necessary to destroy fortresses before an assault. In addition to the operational battles,  A linked campaign will be included so players can carry their losses across multiple scenarios and compare their performance to their historical counterparts. The allies have multiple options when it comes to landing and conducting amphibious operations. Forces from the allied navies along with the black sea fleet are present as well.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The series rules use a hack of the tried and true NLB mechanics in order to simulate what was, at the time, the largest campaign since Leipzig. 1859 occupies an interesting place in military history, post Crimean war, tactics had barely improved much beyond their Napoleonic forefathers. Cavalry had been rendered nearly useless in terms of shock, and artillery began to dominate the battlefield even more so than it already did.&#10;&#10;1859 also is notable as it features one of the last successful campaigns of Napoleon III and the French Second Empire. The French martial philosophy of Le Systeme D&rsquo; (loosely translated to &lsquo;Muddling Through&rsquo;) which doomed them to failure in 1870 against Prussia, propelled them to victory against a much lesser opponent in Austria. Fresh off their victory in the Crimea, France and Piedmont were considered two of the finest armies in the world.&#10;&#10;&quot;For Liberty &amp; Lombardy: 1859&quot; includes 4 stand-alone wargames on the major battles of the campaign.&#10;&#10;",

The scenarios can be played in a few hours while the campaigns will take longer depending on the number of players and variant being played. Augury cards which dictate events and certain modifiers are placed in order of their occurrence in the scripted game, whereas the sandbox campaign has players randomize the Augury cards creating an absolutely wide open situation without the realities of history bearing down on the player&rsquo;s decision-making.&#10;&#10;Funeral Games expands on the foundations presented in The Earth As Their Memorial and adds on a thin layer of chrome in order to abstract the myriad idiosyncrasies and shifting alliances throughout the wars of the Diadochi. The Operations of Antiquity Series is supported by obsessive and manic research into the logistic capabilities of ancient supply trains and the armies they supported.&#10;&#10;What results is the first hex and counter, operational-scale model of the Diadochi wars allowing students of history as well as grognards alike to study the volatile realities of military campaigns in antiquity. Players will also need to manage/improve their holdings, building infrastructure or cultural landmarks if they wish to gain a decisive advantage against their opponents.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Guns of the Americas is a strategic scale hypothetical that examines what a renewed conflict between the states would look like during the first world war. The history behind the game is that the South manages to win a truce during the Civil War and the USA remains divided up until WW1. The North allies with Germany while the South allies with the Entente (the rationale being both the ethnic makeup and trading relationships of both regions). The North must execute a Schlieffen-like plan to take out the south before they can coordinate fully with their Canadian and Mexican allies.&#10;&#10;The game includes units for the USA, CSA, Germany, Japan, France, Canada and Mexico. 2 large maps depict north America from Mexico City to Quebec. The game&rsquo;s mechanics are derived and inspired from Mark Simonitch&rsquo;s The US Civil War while introducing several new ideas and layers of complexity such as Naval and Air operations as well as card assisted mechanics.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trierarchs is a modern take on ancient Tactical Naval Warfare during the 5th century with a special focus on and surrounding the Peloponnese War. The naval conflicts of the ancient world were strategically and logistically vital to any nation&rsquo;s ambitions of expansions and colonization. Thucydides himself was exiled as a result of his failure to prevent a Spartan landing at Amphipolis and the subsequent death of Athenian general and politician Cleon at that battle.&#10;&#10;The period is notable for the relative ferocity and unique nature of naval conflict. The primary tactic being to ram your opponents ship via it&rsquo;s broadside as quickly as your oarsman could row. Triremes were packed sparingly along with several hoplite marines and archers who could either attack or board enemy ships if close enough. Athens was primarily the dominant naval power until the end of the war and even had an original tactics where they could maneuver a ship parallel to an opponent going in the opposite direction, pull in their oars, and shear off the oars of their enemies leaving them dead in the water. The quality of a crew would frequently make up for inferior numbers in combat making for interesting and thrilling scenarios, of which Trierarchs is packed.&#10;&#10;A basic and advanced version of the rules will be included where players may easily pick and choose what rules they wish to include. The advanced rule increase the playing time and relative complexity of the rules in order to more accurately reflect the nature of ancient naval warfare. Optional rules are included for simultaneous movement, double-blind refereed games, as well as limited combined-operations with land forces.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Violent Schoolmaster Tactical Series (VSTS) is a new take on combat from the prehistoric to the late 16th century. This Introduction Module allows players to affordably experiment with VSTS and allows players to re-fight one of military history, along with western civilization&rsquo;s most decisive moment, the battle of Marathon in 490 BC.&#10;&#10;Emperor Darius I of Persia resolved to crush Athens for aiding the Ionian revolt by sending ships and other means of support. Greece, through the development of the city state and democracy created the hoplite phalanx in which each man must hold their space in a tightly packed linear formation packed with over a thousand men with spear and/or shield. The Phalanx in formation became a heavily armed juggernaut that would continue up until the Roman development of Legion tactics.  The Persians on the other hand used completely opposite arms and tactics, relying on speed, delay and missile tactics to harass an enemy, leaving the heavy combat to their cavalry.&#10;&#10;Athenian democracy was tested as citizens debated what to do as Persians began to unload men, horses and supplies on the shores of Marathon. After 5 days of debate and noticing that the Persian cavalry was being reloaded onto ships for redeployment likely to ravage the rest of the Athenian suburbs, the Athenians decided to act offensively against the Persians while at a numerical disadvantage.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the battle, the Athenian center were pushed back but quickly rallied and outflanked the Persian forces before they could unload enough troops proficient at shock combat. Unable to delay and harass the Greeks by withdrawing and using ranged combat, they ended up getting totally slaughtered by the Greeks as they were completely ill-prepared for hand to hand combat with heavy infantry.  Driven back into the sea, the Athenians had achieved a major symbolic victory, managing to severely damage the Persian attempt at establishing a beachhead for a further invasion of Attica from Marathon. The Greek way of war had proven itself as superior to the Persian, which had been the dominant power in the region before this point in history, that all changed with Marathon.&#10;&#10;VSTS is inspired by the PRESTAGS set of games from SPI, GBOH from GMT, and Battle Hymn by Compass Games. Wings of each army are activated by chit pull; the combat phase is also initiated by a chit pull followed by an ongoing melee phase after all chits have been pulled. While ranged combat uses a traditional CRT type mechanic, melee combat has players rolling a handful of d10s in search of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; against their opponent. dividing the number of dice thrown between all enemy units in front hexes. The base chance for hits depends on the morale of the units involved as well as facing, terrain, the presence of leadership, and more. Units absorb Disruption Points and as they do so, become progressive susceptible to Routing, automatically routing once they reach a level of DP equal to their SP. Exclusive Rules for Marathon are focused on recreating the various speculative conditions academics have argued about in relation to Hoplite combat, Phalanxes drift to the right when mobile, Phalanxes advance at variable rates towards an enemy, Locking Shields as a tactic to create a more shock-resistant Phalanx, as well as loose-formation rules for Phalanxes which allow for limited stacking combined with more maneuverable units. Many of these exclusive rules, if not all, will be present in the first full game of the series considering 4 Battles from Lacedaemonian (Spartan) history.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Violent Schoolmaster Tactical Series (VSTS) is (again) inspired by the late John Young and his PRESTAGS series for SPI. VSTS will cover all eras of warfare from the beginning of history until the 17th century. This series is possible because warfare changed relatively little between this period until the wars of the 17th century developed Pike &amp; Shot tactics and the era of combined arms started to develop.&#10;&#10;The first full game in the VSTS set of games focuses on Lacedamemon, otherwise known to us in the modern era as Sparta. Lacedemonia was the dominant land power in the ancient Greek world, establishing its hegemony over the Peloponnese peninsula sometime after the collapse of the Bronze Age. After years of internal struggle and intrigue, Sparta emerged from it&rsquo;s borders putting down tyrants creating allies across the region forming what today is called the Peloponnese league&#10;&#10;4 critical battles in Sparta&rsquo;s history are presented in a clean, accurate, and playable format which promises not to get bogged down in minutia.  A simple command system sees leaders able to allow units to their move and grant benefits to units in combat, or units suffering from adverse results in combat, though this can sometimes result in the worsening quality of the leader. Each hex in VSTS represents about 100  meters from hexside to hexside. Each single hex-sized unit represents a company/squadron of 100-150 mean and/or horses. Each turn represents 5 minutes of real time. Units from Thebes, Corinth, Athens, Macedonia, and several others localities are represented in game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

At the start of each round, each player lays out three cards face up in front of him to create his row; places a face-up stack of seven cards, seeing only the top card, next to his row to create his Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty his Ligretto stack. If he has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, he plays it to the center of the table. If he has a 2 of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, he can place the 2 on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be following the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, he can reveal cards from the stack in his hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. He can play this top card onto a central pile as long as he meets the above rules for doing so.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties his Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of his cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in his Ligretto stack. The player with the most points wins. Players can alternatively choose to play a certain number of rounds and the player with most points in the end wins.&#10;&#10;In the rare case that neither player can play any cards, the round is scored based on the cards played so far.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The shining needle-like gleaming metal fuselage and pressure-suit clad crew evoke spaceships more than aircraft. Lockheed&rsquo;s legendary designer Kelly Johnson interviewed fighter crews during the Korean War and created a simple fighter that maximized performance. His team conceived of the smallest aircraft they could wrap around a powerful engine. The Starfighter served with many air forces around the globe, in roles from interceptor to nuclear bomber.&#10;&#10;But reality was harsher than space age dreams. The F-104 gained its Missile With A Man In It nickname in an era when many spacecraft exploded in the first moments of flight. The Starfighter&rsquo;s cutting-edge design and all-for-performance approach led to a career marred by far too many losses of aircraft and life.&#10;&#10;Missile With A Man In It contains every F-104 Starfighter combat variant, plus the proposed CL-1200 Lancer. The included opponents promise a wealth of Zipper-centric mayhem. Scenarios includes every known historic F-104 encounter, struggling over Hainan Island during the Vietnam War, battling between the two Chinas across the Formosa Strait, or soaring against the backdrop of the Himalayas in the Indo-Pakistani Wars.&#10;&#10;Learn to fight the Starfighter from Killjoy, teaching players to employ the aircraft&rsquo;s unique &ldquo;double-attack&rdquo; fighting style. Explore the Starfighter&rsquo;s achievements in the USAF&rsquo;s Operation Feather Duster evaluations, and about the Starfighter&rsquo;s infamous safety record, digging into the history, causes and myths.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Their footsteps have shaken the earth for millions of years. Large, heavy and armored, but also small, agile and deadly, dinosaurs shaped their time from the top of the food chain. Today, another species dominates, it moves on two legs, builds huge colonies and shapes the landscape like no other species before. Evolutionary, however, every challenge is also an opportunity. Find your niches, face the new situation and become Darwin's Choice.&#10;&#10;Darwin&rsquo;s Choice - Before and After is the expansion to Darwin&rsquo;s Choice and requires the base game. The expansion brings over 240 new Animal Cards into play, with a focus on dinosaurs and prehistoric species. In addition, human-made events and territories set the focus of this expansion on the consequences towards nature and evolution created by humanity. The expansion fits seamlessly into the theme of the base game and creates a reference to today&lsquo;s environmental challenges. All artworks are again beautifully hand-drawn by the French artist Rozenn Grosjean, giving the game its very own style.&#10;&#10;Since the team behind Darwin's Choice cares for the environment, the expansion will once again be solely made out of sustainable wood and contain as little plastic as possible. In addition, both the base game and the expansion will be 100% carbon neutral.&#10;&#10;Darwin's Choice is a competitive card game in which players create their own animal species from more than 230 animal cards. These animal species will be placed in biomes that differ strongly in their requirements and food availability. The highest possible adaptation of animal species to their biomes not only ensures their survival but is also rewarded with the coveted Darwin points. In addition to a high adaptation the species with the highest competitive strength are also awarded across all zones.&#10;&#10;Between the 3-4 eras played, conditions can change completely due to biome changes and event card effects. The task is now to adapt the successful animal species of the past eras to the conditions of the present, either through sophisticated mutations or smart migration to other biomes. However, you must always keep an eye on the animal species of the other players in order to anticipate their actions, because anyone who acts too quickly or imprudently might be unable to react at the decisive moment.&#10;&#10;Darwin's Choice is a strategic allocation game in which you must think carefully about how to use your cards. The large number of own possibilities and the ones of your opponent lead to a high variability, which makes thinking through each action and thinking ahead indispensable. The randomness caused by drawing cards (animal cards, biomes, event cards) requires flexibility and fast rescheduling. This results in each played game being completely different and thus guarantees a high replayability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
