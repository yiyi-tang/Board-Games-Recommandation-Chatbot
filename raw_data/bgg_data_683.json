    "Description": "Crossroads is a Biblically-based, tile-laying, cooperative game where 1-4 players encounter challenges, trying to gain enough resources to be triumphant in a story. The overture box comes with four stories, one each based on the Biblical stories Deborah and Barak, David and Goliath, the Seven Seals, and Joseph and his dream coat. An expansion available from BoardGameGeek in July 2011 has the story of resettling Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. 100 stories are planned in total.&#10;&#10;A game turn in Crossroads starts with rolling dice to determine how many tiles you'll have available to lay on the grid board during your turn, and how many spaces (tiles and challenge cards being the spaces) you can move your traveler disk. When you end your movement on a challenge card, the card may have something it does in the game right away. Either way, you'll want to &quot;face&quot; the challenge. This can include needing have have stats at a certain level (others on the same space can add their stats to yours), giving up a resource you've gained during the game, rolling dice and adding to them based on various criteria, and more. Each player also has a number prayer cards which will help in facing challenges. Players can use some prayers only on themselves, while others may be used on any traveler.&#10;&#10;Each story is a little different in the way it plays. What you need to do to gather resources and what you need to do with them once you do can be different, as well as what it is that's pushing you along.&#10;&#10;Since this is a cooperative game, the players are facing the board rather than each other. The thing that there are facing in each game is represented by a lion playing piece that travels the board effecting players in one way or another. How the lion moves about and what it does to a traveler when it finds one is different (and themed appropriately) in each story.&#10;&#10;The game's re-playability comes in the random, face-down layout of challenge cards, that you only put out 7 of the 9 challenge cards a story has when you play (leaving a mystery two out of each session), and that you can pick which prayer cards you will have with you before each session.&#10;&#10;The publishers were involved in Anachronism, so the cards have excellent, historically-accurate artwork, and the game is very true to the Bible, while being nondenominational and not preachy. The game is more about the setting and the stories, which is interesting as a gamer, and/or useful as a Christian. The components are like those you're used to getting in a quality Euro-style game. The cards are not shuffled, so the publisher has made them thick and sturdy. The tiles are a standard thickness and have a good coating. And again, the art is fantastic.&#10;&#10;",

But suddenly something breaks the silence. The noise comes from old Mrs. Olsen&rsquo;s - it sounds as if a whole car park was just started up. What is going on?&#10;&#10;The situation is actually pretty simple: Old Mrs. Olsen is a lawn mower enthusiast and she is just tired of looking at her neighbors&rsquo; beautiful lawns and trimmed hedges while her own garden has been overgrown for years. Now she wants to relive the time when she could race her lawn mowers around the garden. To accomplish this she has hired some of the supposedly nice kids from the neighborhood. The youngsters don&rsquo;t really all want to help, but she offers them money for the grass and weeds they can mow, and she finds a mower in her collection that matches each of them.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game:&#10;The players play one of the kids and compete with each other to mow the most grass and weeds while avoiding the flowers. At the same time they try not to run down the old woman, her cat or the other kids. The player who earns the most money (victory points) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game was a promotion prize by the Landliebe dairy, makers of pudding, milk, ice-cream in Germany.&#10;&#10;It consists of a (flimsy) card board board, made out of 2 pieces that will form a bigger board, 3 cardboard playing pieces per player (2 player), 1 scoring marker of cardboard, gemstones, 4 special chits for the board and 33 small cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to Keltis but simplified of course: From a starting point three paths can be reached. On these paths 9 chits (5 gemstones, 4 other chits) are openly laid. Each player gets 6 cards, the remaining 21 are put in a central card pile. Players lay one card on a private pile of a certain colour. The piles can be ascending or descending, but this choice can only made once. Once a card is legally added to a pile the player can choose to advance one of his playing pieces on one of the paths on the board. If one playing piece reaches a chit the chit is removed and gives points or if its a gemstone can be taken by the player. When the public card pile is exhausted the game is over. Players get points according to the advancement of their playing pieces (-2 to +10 points are possible on each path) and for each gemstone they collected (0 gemstones = -3, 1 gemstone = -1, 2 gemstones = 2, 3 gemstones = 3 4 gemstones = 6, all 5 gemstones = 10 points). The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Check the game number you are about to play, then check the back of the card and deal it to the player indicated. Do this with all 52 cards and everyone should have a hand of 13 cards. Bidding then takes place and the hand played out.&#10;At the end of the hand, you can check analysis book to see how 'experts' bid and played the hand. Points are scored during each hand. First each pair might score points for bidding correctly. Then points can be won for making the correct lead to trick one. And finally you can score points for making the final contract. Interestingly, whatever the bidding, the hand must be played in the contract that the 'experts' suggest You can even complain to John Waddington (the publisher) if you feel your opposition bid in such a way, you did not have a fair chance of reaching your correct contract.&#10;&#10;",

Bayard, a game easily learned, is an exciting and challenging way of increasing your reasoning.&#10;&#10;The game plays very similar to checkers but with some twists.&#10;&#10;Object of game - capture all opponent's soldiers and Bayards.&#10;&#10;The board is 10 rows of 5 circles with lines connecting them.&#10;The players set up their 20 soldiers (glass beads) on opposite sides of the playing mat. Like checkers, each soldier can only move forward one space. Unlike checkers, each soldier can capture a piece by jumping forward or backward. If a soldier reaches the opposite side, it becomes a Bayard, and a different colored bead is used to represent it.&#10;&#10;The Bayard moves and jumps like a King in checkers. However, unlike checkers a Bayard piece can move several spaces at a time. Also, can capture pieces by jumping even if there are several spaces between the opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 2021. Environmental upheavals, accelerated resource depletion, and escalating warfare have destabilized world politics past the point of no return. Political alliances have long since dissolved as each power block struggles for survival. In this declining world, technological advancement has ground to a halt, while the world&rsquo;s armed forces make do with the weapons available from bygone decades.  You enter this desperate struggle for survival as the leader of one of the six remaining factions.&#10;&#10;Game Design&#10;&#10;Global Domination uses the &quot;deck Building&quot; game mechanic used by some popular recent games like Dominion.&#10;&#10;Deck building is very cool. It takes all the good and none of the bad from collectible card games. In a deck building game, you lay out the different types of cards on the table, and everyone starts with the same handful of cards. As the game plays, you get to select which cards on the table you wish to add to your individual deck, thus creating your own means of winning the game.   To add an additional decision point, deck building games might come with 20 card types in the box, but you randomly select 12 for any given game. Figuring out the best strategy based on the cards in play, and what your opponents are doing is the challenge.&#10;&#10;Global Domination has an Axis and Allies level of difficulty, so it is easily playable by new people or experienced gamers. Each game lasts about 1 to 2 hours and supports 2 to 6 players.  The game also plays very intensely because a game only lasts 6 turns. This means that everyone knows they have to make each turn count.&#10;&#10;You score points at the end of each of the 6 game turns, so game play is very intense.&#10;&#10;",

If five play. Ten sets only are used. If seven, the dealer has one card short.&#10;The cards (which are termed the &ldquo;Victim&rdquo; &ldquo;Trap&rdquo; &ldquo;Caught&rdquo; &ldquo;Escaped&rdquo;) are dealt round face downwards, and a game may be won by a player or side.&#10;All cards are played face upwards, and laid on the table, but when a set (either of three or four) is made up, it is turned face downwards.&#10;A player having more than one card of a set, may only use one at a time, in his turn. Only the player of a &ldquo;Victim&rdquo; may play the &ldquo;Escaped&rdquo; (Except in Rule 5), and he is allowed only one chance to claim a set with it (Rule 4). If he claim a wrong set, he cannot try with the same card again.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Victorian game. The sets in the game are made up of two cards, one with the first word of a proverb, the other completing the proverb.&#10;&#10;Players are given 24 counters, six of which are placed in the Pool.&#10;&#10;In your turn you may ask any one player for the other half of a Proverb. If you fail, you may then ask any other player for the same card but if this is also a failure, you add a counter to the Pool and your turn ends. When a completed Proverb is collected, you lay it in front of you and you receive one counter from the Pool. When all the Proverbs are collected, the player with the most claims all the counters left in the Pool. The player with the most counters, wins.&#10;&#10;When asking for a Proverb card, you should ask for it by naming the part you need. It is suggested that if children are playing, they can ask for a number (the card pairs all have a number on them).&#10;&#10;The game is for 5 or more players but there are special rules if under 5 are playing.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Whirred PLAY&trade; - &lsquo;The Holy Grail of Family Board Games&rsquo;&#10;&#10;What is Whirred PLAY&trade;?&#10;&#10;Whirred PLAY&trade; is a unique word game designed so that anyone can win regardless of their vocabulary and designed so that everyone can play together no matter the composition or size of the family or social group.&#10;&#10;Reason Whirred PLAY&trade; was Developed&#10;&#10;Whirred PLAY&trade; was developed because existing board games did not satisfy a need to be able to play a game with the whole family where everyone was challenged and mentally stimulated, but where everyone had an equal chance of winning. Games of chance such as &lsquo;snakes and ladders&rsquo; and &lsquo;ludo&rsquo; can be won by anyone, but they do not offer a lot in the way of mental stimulation for those taking part and soon the thrill of being able to play a board game together as a family diminishes.&#10;More intricate family board games such as &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; do provide the level of mental stimulation required. However, one is much more likely to win these games if one has more life experience (to be able to play strategically) and more education (knowledgeable about a subject). As a consequence younger family members, or those with self perceived lower life skills, shy away from playing these games because they always expect to get beaten.&#10;&#10;In order to encourage these groups of people to join in, adults will often have to play below their best to give them a chance to win and to maintain their interest in playing the game. Whilst this is fun for a while, it soon becomes difficult for the adult to gain enough satisfaction from playing the game from the levels of satisfaction achieved by seeing their offspring&rsquo;s delight at winning.&#10;&#10;How is Whirred PLAY&trade; Unique?&#10;&#10;So Whirred PLAY&trade; enables everyone to play a game at their own level of skill and strategy, but whatever their level this does not determine whether or not they are more or less likely to win. Whirred PLAY&trade; is open for any number of players to join in at the same time, so unlike when playing &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; (maximum four players) or &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; (maximum six players), no member of the family or social group need sit on the sidelines. Everyone can join in the fun.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Whirred PLAY&trade; is designed so that at all times in the game everyone always has a chance of winning, no matter their position on the board, until the eventual winner crosses the finishing line. In games such as &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; there will come a point where it is obvious certain players are not going to win.  Some participants may decide that they will leave the game at this point and that can have a detrimental effect on the pleasure of all parties involved in playing the game. This also may become a hindrance for future participation from those who have departed early. A special feature of Whirred PLAY&trade; is an element of the game called &lsquo;Pare Up&rsquo;, especially designed to provide ample opportunity for players to bring the leader back to the chasing pack.&#10;&#10;Another element of Whirred PLAY&trade; that ensures maximum interest from all parties is that any particular game should last no more than 30 minutes. &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly, in particular, can run on for long periods of time and this can be a barrier for those with shorter attention spans, usually children, to want to take part. And with over 440 cards in Whirred PLAY&trade;, there is very little repetitiveness, as a typical game usually only utilises 30 to 40 cards.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the game play of Whirred PLAY&trade; is designed so that everyone is participating all at the same time. No-one has to wait for any one particular player to finish their turn, which in some other family board games can often be quite a long time.&#10;&#10;Whirred PLAY&trade; is Educational&#10;&#10;As Whirred PLAY&trade; is based on the simple premise of spelling everyday words that just happen to be homophones, a key stage two literacy curriculum topic, it has high appeal amongst both parents and teachers as an excellent fun method of teaching children this difficult subject. Children will want to play Whirred PLAY&trade; because of all of the elements of inclusivity and equality listed above, and parents will be delighted that a game they want to play offers more than just a fun half hour.&#10;&#10;Schools can utilise Whirred PLAY&trade; in formal teaching classes due to its all inclusive nature and the ability for the whole class to participate in it, with an equal chance of winning it, at the same time regardless of its size or composition. The competitive nature of Whirred PLAY&trade; especially appeals to boys, traditionally a more difficult group of students to enthuse about learning how to spell.&#10;&#10;Whirred PLAY&trade; - &lsquo;The Holy Grail of Family Board Games&rsquo;&#10;&#10;So Whirred PLAY&trade; really is a board game like no other. Everyone can take part, everyone has an equal chance of winning, everyone can apply their own level of strategy and utilise their own level of life experience, everyone is involved at all times, everyone can win at all times during the game, no-one gets bored, everyone gets educated and everyone has fun.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Collodian Conspiracy is a strategic game in Galaxy-Foundation Games' strategic Battle for Andromeda: Conflict for a Trillion Suns! series. It uses the series rulebook, Andromeda Foundation Official Battle Manual.&#10;&#10;This particular game pits the Collodian Confederation (colonial outposts of the Xenon Empire) against the Kons Empire (or Dirak of Kons). The game can be combined with The Xenon Empire's Star Wars: Crusade Against the War-Lords in some way which is not entirely clear.&#10;&#10;The game-specific rulebook has a lengthy description of the background (the forces are fighting over deposits of cesium, trillium, and magellinium), discussion of strategy, and the specific rules for this game. In the latter category, there are some special weapons for each side and neutral powers which might join the war.&#10;&#10;According to the rulebook, a kit was available which added extra counters to enable play of &quot;the famed Xenon-Kons Frontier Battles of the First Galactic War.&quot;&#10;&#10;From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):&#10;&#10;&#10;        This connects to the previous Game and the Collodians represent the Colonies of Xenon above. In this game for the first time a Culture meets the KONS forces directly - not merely their Allies. There are many counters in this game as the Collodians must use stealth and trickery to protect themselves. The Kons Main Fleet, as governed by the Regent and Viceroy of Cyon is beyond number in power, yet the Kons can send 5 more fleets LKIE THIS at a snap of the fingers! But the Regency is surrounded by barriers of deadly Nebula of Gasses, Radiation Forces, Clouds of Anti-Matter near the Monopole. If the Collodians can move through the Tunnels of Low Energy and strike the Regency, they can cripple it long enough so new Kons forces will have to fight for a long time to reconquer the Zone. When they do, they will have to move up the narrow corridors (like the famous pass defended by Leonidas and his 300 Spartans against the Persion Host of Darius!), likewise limit the number of Kons Craft that can attack at one time. So a Culture with good fighters though outnumbered, can win. If Xenon (on the other board) wins, help will arrive and the Kons expansion might be halted in this direction permanently. Then this would  bring Xenon a springboard for its own counter-war!&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;        Xenon Export Cruisers and Collodian Fleets containing the fastest ships in the Galaxy, are included with 40 Kons war&mdash;ship counters in Imperial White. A beautiful Mapboard 22x28 inches long, even better unique rules go along with this BFA Game.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Game At A Glance:  Appalachian Rails is based on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad and its march across the coalfields of West Virginia.  The railroad went into receivership after trying to burrow through difficult terrain.  It was up to Colis Huntington, one of the &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; in the transcontinental railroad, wanted to use the C&amp;O as a railroad to link with his West Coast empire.  Additionally, West Virginia and surrounding states in Appalachia had a large reserve of natural resources which would form the revenue stream for the C&amp;O for years to come.&#10;&#10;Your object is to mimic (and beat) the C&amp;O's success.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the player taking a loan for money to pay for track and locomotives to haul goods.  Play consists of rolling dice for each commodity in the board.  Some commodities such as coal are more plentiful than manufactured goods.  After the commodities are placed, track is built, link by link, using the railroad's treasury.  Locomotives may be purchased which have a range of anywhere from 5-10 links.  After this is complete, if a player is able, he may transport cubes to any market expecting them.&#10;&#10;There are also markets in the game which decide the price of a commodity based on how often it is delivered and how often cubes are placed on the board.  These values are staggered for different cities.&#10;&#10;For those who have played a number of train games, this game could be described as a cross between Silverton and Age of Steam with a little bit of Prairie Railroads thrown in for good measure.  The main challenge of this title was to create a compelling solitaire railroading experience.  The game is extremely difficult to beat.  I think it lives up to the challenge.&#10;&#10;",

Players play one to six card melds to attempting to win tricks. All the cards have a primary value but also have secondary purposes. Since a card(s) can only be played on a lower value card(s), winning tricks with high cards and secondary purposes of cards allow players to lead a new trick with their low value cards. A game consists of hands scored on the order in which players empty their hands.  &#10;   &#10;  Players can be dealt in or out as the game or social situation requires.  All players have equal hand sizes to start each hand. Game play changes with the number of players playing the game (even though the rules and scoring are the same) since all the cards are dealt out each hand and depending on the number of players each player will have a different hand size even though they have the same number as all others playing that hand. &#10;   &#10;   A game for a new player would take about 20 minutes from start to finish. Despite the name the game makes more and more sense as you play since many of the secondary purposes of cards are actually very intuitive.  The game consists of 45 cards 4 suits and 2 un-suited cards.&#10;&#10;",

The next player must play the next card in rank for that race if he has it. If he doesn't then he says &quot;I pass&quot;. There will probably come a point when the next highest card is not in play because all players will pass. In this case the player who played the last card, plays to the next round of play.&#10;The Japanese Baby is a special card that allows the player to play it after he has just added a legal card, crying &quot;Spin&quot; as he does so. This means that the card he last played becomes a stop.&#10;The game stops when one player has run out of cards. There are various rewards and forfeits and the player with the most counters wins.&#10;Rules are included for the main game and two variants, Pool Spin and Old Maid (the publisher having added an Old Maid card for this version).&#10;&#10;",

KATATU is a 100% strategy abstract game that uses magnetic bees and grasshoppers as game pieces.  The object of the game is to eliminate your opponents 'bugs' by forming 'three in  a rows' or mills.  By forming a three in a row you can then select an opponents game piece and remove it from the game board.  Once you have gone through the stages of placing, sliding &amp; flying the bugs you win if you have eliminated your opponent down to only two bugs (game pieces) so they cannot for a mill.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Twelve Men's Morris      &#10;&#10;&#10;",

The final score will be determined by the number of turns plus any penalty occurred for mistakes. &#10;   There is a small amount of randomness in the game. There is also some flexibility in how the rail cars are arranged in the yard before the first Train arrives. This randomness and flexibility means that a scenario need not play out the same way the second time through. The game also comes with the guidelines for how to generate your own scenarios.&#10;   Several expansion maps are planned.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling Card Game is a game in which players try to improve their hand of cards by drawing the top card of either the face-down draw pile or the face-up discard pile, and discarding either that card or one of the four cards in their hand.  Except for Flip cards, each card has a point value in the range of 3 to 10, or 0.  If a player discards a Flip card when they do not have the advantage, then they take the advantage from the other player.  Only the player with the advantage is able to call a Showdown, at which time both sides reveal their hands; the player with the highest point total wins the match.&#10;&#10;The four-player game plays much like the two-player game, with the major difference being that the player who calls for a Showdown must beat the hands of both of his opponents.&#10;&#10;",
