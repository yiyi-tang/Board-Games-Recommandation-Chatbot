An affectionate greeting between crippled sailors.&#10;&#10;4. Nonsense, confusion.  Also a stew of vegetables, meat, and broth; hotchpotch.&#10;&#10;5. An awkward, callow youth.&#10;&#10;6. A wooden toy of colonial times; currently still made in remote mountain communities.&#10;&#10;7. A mariner's cry when a whale becomes entangled in a harpoon line.&#10;&#10;8. Trade name for a breakfast cereal made from a species of seaweed.&#10;&#10;Well, which one?&#10;&#10;Hobble-de-hoy! is a published version of an old parlor game, Dictionary.  It consists of a single hardbound book, a little over 9&quot; high (23 cm).  The book contains complete instructions, a word list of 1001 words, and, in the back of the book, definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary for the 1001 words (reprinted with permission).&#10;&#10;The book can be opened from either end - flip it over, and it appears to be right-side up from either side.  One side brings you to the word list, the other to the definition list.  Each word and definition are numbered so you can match them up easily.&#10;&#10;As in the traditional game, players take turn finding an obscure word and announcing it to the group.  Everyone writes down a definition for the word, while the player in charge writes down the official definition.  The player in charge of the word then shuffles the definitions, reads them through once, then reads them again.  Players voting for the correct definition get 2 points, while players whose word was selected as correct by someone else get 1 point for each selection.&#10;&#10;The word list is a very interesting selection of some of the more obscure words in the Oxford English Dictionary.  In the parlor game, a player has to thumb through a dictionary looking for an obscure word.  In this book, you won't recognize at least 98% of the words!  The title of the game is one such word, meaning an awkward, callow youth.  (Did you get that right?)  Some of the lovelier sounding words chosen include quemeful, poculary, bewscher, dedolence, cawquaw, wicopy, timwhisky, etc.  And did you know there's a word that has the definition, &quot;Excessive use of the letter R&quot;?&#10;&#10;",

Being unable to move causes a knockout loss.&#10;&#10;Folko-Boks was included as a free game in issue 4 of the Polish board gaming magazine &#197;&#154;wiat Gier Planszowych (&quot;World of Boardgames&quot;) published December 2007.&#10;&#10;The game acknowledges some inspiration from an earlier game by Sid Sackson, probably Paper Boxing.&#10;There is a somewhat similar game Joust on an 8x8 grid.&#10;&#10;",

On his turn, the player will play one of 5 cards from his hand of cards, each of which have a number and a color on them.  The information on this card indicates a limited set of squares on the board matching the color and number on which a chip can be placed.  There are also 2 special kinds of cards: Wild cards which allow a chip to be placed anywhere, and Gotcha cards which can be used to remove an opponent's chip from the board.&#10;&#10;A round is over once a player has created 2 rows of 5 chips.  Each row of 5 garners 50 points.  Several rounds are played until one player reaches 500 points and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;This game can also be played in 2 or 3 teams of 2 players each.&#10;&#10;",

A player simply answers a question taken from one of the hundreds of question cards corresponding to the color of the space their token is on.  The color of the space indicates the question's category and the number on the space indicates the difficulty level of the question.  If answered correctly, the player rolls the die and moves accordingly.  Should a player be unable to answer a question, the player on their next turn may attempt a lower level of question in the same category.&#10;&#10;This game can be played in teams.  There are also &quot;Advanced Play&quot; rules, in which the die is not used.  In this rule set, once a player answers a question correctly, the token is moved ahead on the board the same number of spaces as the level answered (1, 2, or 3), and the player retains her turn until an incorrect answer is given.&#10;&#10;",

And so on. The player continues placing words, with the goal being to dispose of all 48 letters. (Parallel words are allowed providing all letters form a word. Also, two words should always be separated by a free square.)&#10;&#10;Difficulty Levels&#10;To make the game easier, take out a number of pieces, taking care to remove as many vowels as consonants. To make a harder game: before starting, draw one or several letters and place them anywhere on the grid, blank side up. These will be dead squares, as in a crossword puzzle.

It feeds into a CO2 pipeline delivering it to Chevron in Rangely Field in northwest Colorado, then Anadarko Petroleum at Monell Field and Merit Energy in the Lost Soldier and Wertz Fields (south-central Wyoming), and finally to Anadarko at the Salt Creek Field in east-central Wyoming.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Swimming with Sharks is a strategy game where players are controlling either Swimmer pieces or Shark pieces.  Each player has 5 movement points to spend each turn, divided up among their pieces.  The Swimmer side also has a Boat piece.  Each piece has a movement cost.&#10;&#10;When pieces move, they must go in two directions (like a Knight in Chess).  If a piece can move 4 spaces, it can move 1 in one direction and 3 in another, or 2 and 2.&#10;&#10;The object for the Swimmers is to have at least one Swimmer make it to shore on the opposite side of the board.  The Sharks must prevent all Swimmers from making it.&#10;&#10;The Boat is a protector, and as long as a Swimmer is in an adjacent space, a Shark can not take the piece.&#10;&#10;There are 3 spaces marked with a Star.  When a player moves their piece onto the Star space, they may draw a card.&#10;&#10;Cards typically consist of value amounts you can add to your movement for a turn.  There are a number of special cards that can affect either or both teams.  Players may hold as many cards as they like.  Movement cards have no penalty to play, but special cards require the use of some movement points in order to be played.&#10;&#10;",

This makes the games quite different.&#10;&#10;Drop Xiangqi is a pure abstract game, basically a variant of Xiangqi played with the same equipment as the standard game and easily different enough to be considered a different game. Basically the pieces in Xiangqi just have the name of the piece written on it in Chinese. So there's a definitely up and down to the piece's orientation.&#10;&#10;Ownership of pieces is then marked by whoever has the writing &quot;right-side up&quot; from his point of view. In lieu of moving a piece on the board, a captured piece may be placed on the board instead with the restriction that the piece must have a legal move from its position when placed and that no two pawns owned by the same player can be on the same file.&#10;&#10;How this differs from the parent game:&#10;Both are of the chess family of games an they share the game goal. Like the original, it's a pure abstract where the object is to capture the opponent's jade general. The key difference is that the complexity of the board situation does not get reduced during play. All pieces are always in play throughout the game, and so one will never have an end-game with only a few pieces involved. Exchanges don't remove pieces but rather potentially hand of vital material to one's opponent to use against you. Thus, what will be a good move in xiangqi can often be disastrous in drop-xiangqi and vice-versa. (The inspiration here is drawn from shogi.)&#10;&#10;Capture the leader abstracts typically reduce to a simple end-game with the exception of shogi family of games. This game offers a complex end-game in a situation so that aplayer can't simply force exchanges to make a simple tactical game.&#10;&#10;",

One person takes the role of game leader and runs the game without playing; everyone else splits into two, three or six teams.  Each team gets a farm animal paddle -- this paddle is passed from player to player within the team, and only the player holding the paddle at any given time may answer questions (though the whole team may influence those answers).&#10;&#10;During play, teams take turns answering question cards in six categories: F.Y.I., In the Moos, You Herd It Here, Ouch, Seeing is Believing, and Heads Up.  Cards have a base point value of either 10 or 20 points, and all the 10-point cards are played before the 20-point cards.  All of the category cards feature a question about farm safety, and some also include bonus questions which can be answered for additional points if the first question is answered correctly.  Some cards require the players to look at large 11x14 photos showing farm activities and equipment.  Wild cards with general, non-farm-themed trivia may optionally be mixed in, and Daily Double cards may be added to force players to wager points on certain questions instead of using their face values.&#10;&#10;The game leader decides the exact mix and number of cards, so the game can be weighted to favor particular topics and length of play can be shortened or lengthened as necessary.  Regardless of which cards are used during play, the game must be set up so that all teams get to answer the same number of questions, and the team with the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Another light game from Asko K&uuml;nnap &amp; Priit Isok. The title roughly translates as: &quot;The winner is the one who has the most stuff when he/she dies.&quot; With a subtitle &quot;Another absolutely useless item: a boardgame about owning!&quot; In the game players madly run in a circle - like rats in a wheel - collecting useless luxurious items until the grim reaper stops the race.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game each player has five items (cards). Items come in 6 colors with value from 1-5. A player's turn is a three-step affair:&#10;1) Throw a die and move your pawn forward (clockwise in a circle). When you throw 1, the reaper also moves forward.&#10;2) Do the action indicated by the space where your pawn landed. Most of the spaces are malls where you collect additional items but some spaces, like robber and recycling, take cards away. &#10;3) Gift an item to another player. You can gift only an item that matches the color of an item that an opponent already has and is of higher value.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the reaper makes a full circle of eight steps. All players total the value of their cards and the player with the smallest total wins the game. That is, contrary to what the title claims, the winner is the player who has the least stuff in the end.&#10;&#10;The emphasis of the game is obviously on fun. It is a family/party game which mocks the madness that takes hold of the &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; world just before any big gift-giving holiday. The items are titled such as &quot;all types of USB cables&quot; and &quot;precious jewels for pets&quot;. The game was published just before Christmas and the board design closely resembles the logo of one of the leading chain of malls in Estonia. Unfortunately the game is available only in Estonian. Knowledge of the language is not essential but you will miss the fun titles of the cards.&#10;&#10;",

You and your opponent have been sent to the planet Arual where oil and water are abundant. Arual is inhabited by a superstitious race. The Arualians have agreed to allow you and your opponent to drill a maximum of 61 wells either for oil or water, but only at a strictly controlled rate. The Arualians are somewhat primitive and you have discovered that they revere a series of sacred symbols. When you place your Driller Domes in a pattern that resembles one of these symbols, the Arualians will allow you to drill wells at a faster rate. Your goal is to place more Driller Domes than your opponent and return home with the title of &quot;Deep Space DrillerAce&quot;.&#10;&#10;Deep Space DrillerAce is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. &#10;Players take turns placing glass Driller Domes on a hex board in an attempt to complete patterns that are shown on cards in their hand. When patterns are completed the player is allowed to immediately place more Driller Domes. The winner is the first player to place all 33 of his Driller Domes or the player with the most Domes on the board when it is completely filled.&#10;&#10;The game comes with: 1 game board, 66 glass Driller Domes, 40 pattern cards and 1 rules sheet.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "With so many games available that involve the leaders and royalty of medieval nations either battling each other or in competition with each other economically or socially, it is about time that a game came along that focuses on the real unsung heroes of those nations and kingdoms... the court jesters that entertained and provided much needed levity during those stressful times.&#10;&#10;In Jesters, each player is an up-and-coming jester working on the medieval entertainment scene. To begin with, they are truly indie DIY performers and will be handling their own career and trying to book performances for themselves and win over fans.  As they progress, they may hook up with special persons like publicists and accountants and managers to be part of their entourage and help them achieve more success.  &#10;        &#10;There are several aspects of each jester's career which they will be working to advance over the five week Season of Mirth; Popularity, Wealth, Mojo, Reputation and Satisfaction. Jesters will also need to develop their material and save some of their best stuff for the big Woodshtick Festival at the end of the month, where all jesters are rated against each other and have the potential for a big payoff.&#10;&#10;All of the wealth, fame and reputation in the world won't mean a thing if a jester can't get no satisfaction.  Jesters is ultimately won by the player who generates the most Satisfaction.  There are several ways to gain Satisfaction in the game; through great performances, through the support of people in your Entourage, and by having a lot of fans at the Festival.  Satisfaction Points can also be lost, through bad performances or other circumstances.&#10;&#10;Jesters is played over five turns, each representing one week, with a final Festival performance at the end of the fifth week.  The game combines action drafting, hand management and area majority and plays in about 75-90 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Time Machine has been set in motion before it was sufficiently tested... Its team of developers may end up being stuck in an endless loop cycle between the time it was first activated (4 minutes ago), the time it was first launched (now) and the time it can be relaunched (4 minutes into the future).&#10;&#10;Time and player movement is kept track of on a board depicting one minute intervals between the first activation and the second launch. Gameplay involves players drawing and placing numbered/colored hexes. At the beginning of the game, before the first time machine launch, a line of hexes is laid out to create the sequence of events that led to the time machine being built. Then, after the first launch, each turn uses a new hex sequence where players try to recreate the sequence of events that created the first launch while also &quot;fixing&quot; it just enough to make it work correctly and hopefully break them all out of the loop. One aspect of the gameplay uses actual one minute time measures as part of the process.&#10;&#10;Adding to the challenge, each time a player goes back in time, there is another one of them added to the game (depicting someone from the present traveling back in time and encountering themselves in the past). A light/dark color scheme is used to distinguish the present/past player tokens (dark blue/light blue, dark green/light green, etc.).  Each new version of a player adds abilities and also causes potential problems, and there is a limit to the number of multiples a single player can have before the time line is destroyed beyond repair.&#10;&#10;Play is cooperative, with a special commendation for the team member(s) who had the biggest part in fixing the machine. A game may also include a saboteur who is trying to subtly destroy the machine and prevent any progress in the field of time travel.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player is a particularly slimy snake oil salesman, traveling between different regions, trying to sell their elixirs to eager balding or ailing customers.&#10;&#10;Each area has a different population and gullibility rating, so the potential for success and for higher sales will differ from region to region. Only one player can perform a sales demonstration in a particular area at a given time, though, so before each turn, there is a simultaneous action selection for where each player goes and what they intend to do. If more than one player chooses the same area, then neither of them can demonstrate there, or they may choose to resolve who will get to demonstrate there. A player's success will depend on their ability to sell, the effectiveness and pizzazz of their pitch, and the saleability of their product. Players bid from among different available elixirs and can choose to spend time rehearsing their pitches or watching other players demonstrate in order to improve their ability to sell.&#10;&#10;Once a player has successfully demonstrated in an area, there will then be a limited number of turns before that area will become dangerous for other salesmen... The people of that region will soon realize that the last product they bought was bogus and they will be more skeptical of new salesmen coming to town. Later in the game, salesmen may have no choice but to try to sell to places that are already very skeptical or even downright hostile towards them, and will have to use special abilities gained throughout the game (including disguises, new pitches, flashier gimmicks, etc.) in order to succeed.&#10;&#10;Particularly bitter areas will send out police or mobs after the shysters, and so players must be careful to avoid being jailed or injured, which will set back their efforts. Players may also work together at times in order to protect or vouch for each other, but of course, alliances made among scoundrels aren't likely to last...&#10;&#10;After a certain number of regions in the area have become hostile, all players must make it to a train station within another turn in order to escape.  The player who escapes with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game box contains a play mat/poster and a set of three six sided dice engraved with letters instead of numbers (except for one that also contains numbers and one other with a blank side). Any number of players may play. &#10;The play mat is Irish themed and bears no other impact on the game apart from providing an area where betting chips may be placed.&#10;A banker is elected by throwing the only lettered dice that also contains a number, the highest number gets the bank first. Players place chips (bets) on any combination of the ten spaces provided on the play mat as a first action. Next, the three dice are thrown and the result matched up with three lettered word combinations indicated on the ten spaces of the board. Players with chips placed in the same named board space as the word rolled, receive between two &amp; seven times the amount bet depending on the number rolled on one of the dice combinations. The banker collects all loosing chips and also if a word is rolled that has not been bet upon by any player. The banker looses the bank when one of the dice turns up blank and a new banker is selected amongst the other players as indicated above.&#10;&#10;",
