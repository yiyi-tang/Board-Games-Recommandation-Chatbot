The &quot;Battle&quot; system is for large battles such as Tsushima and ships operate in formations, each of which has a Commander and ships' crew ratings are generated for a formation.&#10;&#10;There are alternative gunnery systems offering simultaneous effects (which can be used with the &quot;Duel&quot; Game) or sequential effects based on initiative, in which shooting follows in order of initiative (highest scores shoot first) and where damage is applied immediately (this can be used in either game system).&#10;&#10;The gunnery rules include the effects of &quot;crossing the T&quot; and other features. It is now possible to achieve significant amounts of damage and multiple special hits.&#10;&#10;There are 10 scenarios and ready calculated ship data is provided so you can sit down and play any of them.&#10;&#10;(Publishers Description)&#10;&#10;",

The pairs are then flipped over and mixed. The example in the rulebook is for instance the pair: tea pot + couch &#10;In the second phase the players take turns flipping two tiles - if one of the pairs were flipped the player keeps it and flips another pair (flip triplets when playing the more difficult variant). The player with most pairs when all tiles are taken wins the game.&#10;&#10;beginner variant 10-12 pairs, normal 20 pairs and expert 30 pairs.&#10;&#10;&#10;From zogaj.se/zogaj-shopen&#10;&#10;The Game that teaches you how to use your hidden memory powers while having fun!

You start with a single god with no worshippers, and during the game, you develop a cult of followers for your god and build a temple to your god.  You&rsquo;ll be in competition with other cults, and you may eventually add other gods and cults to your pantheon.  Your goal in the game is to attract more followers (and stronger followers) to your cult and to build complete temples to your gods.&#10;&#10;You'll also be able to take your pesky competitor cults down a notch or two with special cards such as Heresy, Purge, Iconoclasm, and many others.&#10;&#10;Sometime during the game, there will be a prophecy.  When the prophecy is fulfilled, it's the End of Days, and whoever is ahead wins!&#10;&#10;The game is family friendly and easy to learn.

During the ascent you will be set back by bombs falling from the sky. Therefore, it takes quite some personality to persist the ascent in order to be able to crown oneself as King of the Quackers and flush the opponents straight back to the swampy pond they came from.&#10;&#10;The game is played over multiple hands. Every hand you get dealt some cards. After each hand, you score points according to how quickly you got rid of your cards. Your points accumulate from hand to hand and once someone collects enough points he or she is declared the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

It's a common habit to end a dispute with a game of Double Knot in order to decide who gets to sleep in the best bed. Unfortunately, in case of a tie, play is continued. This explains the amount of pandas.&#10;&#10;The game is named after the two highest cards in the game, the Ace of Knots and the Crown of Knots.&#10;&#10;In Double Knot every player bids a number of tricks. The object of the game is to win exactly the number of tricks bid and at the same time let other people fail to do the same.&#10;&#10;In a hand of Double Knot, each of the Decktet cards is treated as belonging only to the top suit. The bottom suits of the first card played to a trick determines which cards can be used as trumps in that trick.&#10;&#10;The rules of the game can be found at the Decktet wiki.&#10;&#10;",

This concept was originated with the Toyota Production System and aims at increasing the speed of the processes, eliminating waste and reducing costs.&#10;&#10;In the game, the players are presidents of companies which need to produce their products and sell them to the clients.

The secret is to produce faster, better and with a lower cost. The person who achieves the greater total income is the winner.&#10;&#10;Manufactura may be played by all employees who are part of the productive area of a company, or by those who are just curious about its operational system.

    "Description": "This newspaper-themed board game was based on 1931 movie &quot;Five Star Final&quot;. The game includes a large (30&quot; x 17&quot;) and heavy board, five player tokens, 40 Service Tokens, a deck of yellow Assignment Cards, and a deck of white News Cards.&#10;&#10;Players take Assignment Cards from the Editor that show events underway around the board. They then choose how to travel there: by foot, bus, elevated, taxi or subway. By foot is slowest but reaches everywhere; subway is fastest but can mean an additional walk to many locations.&#10;&#10;To complete an assignment, reporters first must arrive on the spot by exact roll of either two dice or one of the two. If they fail to land on the space two turns in a row, they have missed the story and must head back to the office. However, if they stroll back, they get a chance to draw an Assignment card on any other Assignment location on which they land, getting partial or full credit for that story instead.&#10;&#10;Players who do land on their Assignment locations must then try to draw a News Card that matches their assignments, drawing twice a turn until they do. When they do draw the right match, they normally get one Service Token, but none if sent to Rewrite, and two if labelled Front Page. Then they head back to get another assignment. First player to get five Service Tokens wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Japan&rsquo;s imperialistic ambitions to dominate the entire Pacific may seem a mad gamble when viewed from a comfortable 21st Century perspective, but it should be remembered that, in the 1940&rsquo;s, empires still existed. European powers had commanded vast tracts of the Pacific region for centuries, and the British Empire remained the largest in history. On the other side of the world, Germany had dominated almost the whole of continental Europe, so the idea of powerful nations taking territory by force was an attractive idea that, today, might seem repugnant.&#10;&#10;Despite naval actions in oceans over the globe, it was Japan&rsquo;s entry into the war that truly turned hostilities into a World War. By attacking Pearl Harbour, Japan ensured the United States was put into a position whereby it could no longer remain neutral. No longer was the fighting confined to Europe and Africa, with warships trading blows overseas. Now the people of almost every continent were directly affected by war.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Japan failed in its gamble. Before it fell, however, it had dealt the United States a grievous blow, and all but ended the hold European countries had in the region (not least because they had their own problems back in Europe). Once forced on the defensive, Japan proved to be a terrible enemy, its people willing to fight to their last breath, ferociously resisting the advance of the Allies as its forces were gradually pushed back to the Japanese islands.&#10;&#10;The end of the Pacific war marked the end of the Second World War as a whole, an ending that was mushroom-shaped and terrifying., leading on to a new struggle that would hold the world in its grip for the rest of the 20th Century.&#10;&#10;This supplement for Battlefield Evolution: World at War contains army lists and new rules for the following armies, in all periods of the Pacific War.&#10;&#10;British Army and Commonwealth&#10;Chindits&#10;Imperial Japanese Army&#10;Imperial Japanese SNLF&#10;United States Marines Corps&#10;&#10;",

The game is for two players, one representing the recently elected government of the recently independent state (the White player) and the other the perhaps-irresistible forces of proletarian revolution (the Red Player).&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions: &#10;1) a company/battalion scale one which uses a system heavily modified from the designer's previously published games Freikorps, Konarmiya and War Plan Crimson; and &#10;2) a brigade scale one that uses fewer counters and an even more heavily modified system.&#10;&#10;Both versions use the same map (hex grid of southern Finland, at 12 map miles/ 20 km per hex). Special units and chromy bits include: variable-strength Red and White Guard units; Armored Trains; the spring thaw that occurred midway through the war; peace negotiations, German intervention and Russian withdrawal (including the Future Guilt Clause!); General Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim; guerrillas; purges; and the Swedish Talent Agency.&#10;&#10;Was available for free download at designer's personal webpage from end of 2009, but in October 2012 the designer concluded an agreement with Compass Games for them to publish this game in Paper Wars magazine.

Once everyone has their unique squiggly line in front of them, play begins. Players have 60 seconds to transform their wavy and wacky line into a picture. They can be as simple or detailed as they want. When time is up, each player explains their drawing to the other players. This is where you may fall over laughing as you listen to some real nonsense! Once each player has had chance to explain what they drew, voting begins. Each player votes on only one other players drawing using a voting card.&#10;&#10;The voting cards offer either a descriptive praise or a nuance of criticism such as &quot;put that in a doggie bag&quot; or &quot;a monkey can do better&quot;. Each card also has a point value and players give them to each other based on their picture and description.

The core idea of Empire Builder is that players to draw their train routes over a map of the United States. Players start with enough money to build short lengths of track, and by running their trains and delivering loads to various cities acquire more cash to expand their networks.&#10;&#10;Super Sadistic Advanced Empire Builder (SSAEB) is an improved and much more challenging version of the base game. Numerous changes have been made: the payoffs on the contract cards have been lowered, the event cards are changed to be much more challenging, two new train types are added, and upgrade costs are increased.&#10;&#10;By modifying the basic Empire Builder game with this expansion set, players will have a more challenging and longer game, but one that is more satisfying for hard-core gamers. SSAEB is for die-hard Empire Builder fans only!&#10;&#10;",
