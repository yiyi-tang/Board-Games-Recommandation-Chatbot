    "Description": "The legend of the lovers of Teruel has multiple literary and theatrical versions, as well as a reflection in other artistic manifestations. It is a story about an impossible and chaste love with a tragic ending, possibly originating in the 15th century but whose plot is set in the 13th century, starring the lady Isabel de Segura and the gentleman Juan Mart&iacute;nez de Marcilla (better known as Diego from the theatrical performances of the seventeenth century). Today it is an unavoidable part of the culture of Teruel.&#10;&#10;With Isabel y Diego, will you be able to change the legend?&#10;In this game 3 to 7 players are divided into two teams. &#10;The first team will be friends of Isabel and Diego who want to change the disastrous ending of the legend and get the couple to reunite and grow old together. To do this, they will help Diego to achieve the necessary wealth to marry her to Isabel, and will prevent her from giving in to the pressure she receives from her to marry Don Rodrigo de Azagra.&#10;The other team will be enemies of the couple who will try by all means that Diego falls in combat and that Isabel collapses and agrees to marry the Lord of Albarrac&iacute;n.&#10;&#10;Isabel y Diego is a strategy game in which you have to coordinate with your team to achieve your objectives while trying to disrupt those of the opponents. &#10;Play cunning, decide wisely how to use the cards in your hands, and lead your team to victory.&#10;&#10;",

Each player will have four fighters they can use to attack others and lay claim to the enemy's strongholds but it will always be at a cost.&#10;&#10;Players should also be careful of the very planet itself, as Arrakis is a harsh place and to survive it will take its toll. Luckily, if a player owns certain territories they either gain by force or are naturally given it from the start, they can receive riches in the form of the spice melange.&#10;&#10;With the spice, players can bribe and trade with each other and afford to survive in the hostile deserts of Arrakis. But players should be cautious, as deals can be broken and players can lie their way to getting spice. Calling them out on not following through on a deal or catching them in a lie can cause them to lose a turn but a player falsely accusing someone of lying can have harsher consequences.&#10;&#10;The game ends when any of the unique faction specific winning conditions are met.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Agitation and Propaganda (short: agitprop) is a strategic Card game that deals with the history of left-wing groups and movements in Germany.&#10;The game tells the story of the developments and conflicts of the left movement from 1945 until today. The groups and actors are characterized enough to have enough potential for hostility, know-it-all and of course to give divisions.&#10;The aim of the game is to create a network of allied left-wing groups to cope with the social challenges in the course of mercilessly advancing history.&#10;With the successful unlocking of history cards and the achieving of special organizational goals, the players collect revolution points. These are used to get to the top of the Revolution by the end and win the game!&#10;&#10;",

Also thrown in for good measure is the mini-expansion, Wolfgang&rsquo;s Exchange Office.&#10;&#10;In The Quacks of Quedlinburg, players are charlatans &mdash; or quack doctors &mdash; each making their own secret brew by adding ingredients one at a time. Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!&#10;&#10;Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips and add them to their pot. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the swirling pattern, increasing how much your potion is worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot explodes!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients to add to their bags, depending on the strength of the ingredients in their pots. But players with exploded pots must choose points or coins &mdash; not both! The player with the most victory points at the end of nine rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Included in this box are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: the base game&#10;     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Herb Witches: the first expansion, adding Witches that grant powers once per game as well as more ingredient books.&#10;     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: Wolfgang's Exchange Office: a mini-expansion adding new conditions for end-game scoring.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While serving as commerce raiders, the Scharnhorst-class Battleships (or battlecruisers), Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were responsible for sinking over 105,000 tons of allied shipping in a single cruise.&#10;&#10;The two ships operated together for much of the early portion of the war, including sorties into the Atlantic, the sinking of British cruiser HMS Rawalpindi and Operation Weser&uuml;bung, the German invasion of Norway. In these operations off Norway, Gneisenau along with Scharnhorst, engaged and sank the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious, but in turn Gneisenau was damaged in action against HMS Renown and was subsequently struck by torpedoes.&#10;&#10;After further actions in the Atlantic in 1941, the two ships put in at Brest, and were subject to repeated Allied bombing raids. Despite suffering damage, Gneisenau was repaired in good time and in early 1942, the two battle cruisers participated in a daylight dash up the English Channel, sailing for Germany. Gneisenau reached Kiel in early February and went into drydock. On the night of 26 February, the British launched an air attack on the ship, with an explosion in the forward ammunition section causing such heavy damage that it was deemed that the ship's weapons would be refit (as had been originally planned), necessitating a rebuild for her to accommodate larger 38cm guns (her original 28 cm became shore batteries). These plans were abandoned on Hitler's order in 1943. &#10;On 27 March 1945, Gneisenau was sunk as a block-ship in German occupied Poland. Eventually, she was broken up for scrap in 1951.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Though laid down and launched before the start of the war, the Graf Zeppelin was never completed or commissioned, and it never saw action.&#10;&#10;Whilst four aircraft of the class had originally been planned, constant in-fighting between the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe, as well as a priority on the building of U-Boats hampered their construction, with the planned four carriers quickly reduced to two. Construction on the ship that would eventually be christened Graf Zeppelin was eventually halted in 1940.&#10;&#10;However, with the role of the carrier proving itself in the Battle of Taranto, in the sinking of the Bismarck and at Pearl Harbour and Midway prompted construction to briefly continue. The Graf Zeppelin was almost completed in 1943 but Hitler, disappointed with the Kriegsmarine, halted all surface fleet construction. The Carrier was captured by the Soviet Union at the end of the war, and was sunk as a target ship in 1947.&#10;&#10;Though obviously never seeing action in reality, Kriegsmarine players are afforded new tactical options in Victory at Sea with the opportunity to include this carrier in their fleet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The latter tour, in which he piloted the F-86, is where he was officially credited with shooting down nine MiG-15s and one La-9. This earned him the accolade, at the time of the conclusion of his tour, in 1952, of being America's top jet ace.&#10;&#10;During the second tour in F-86s, as part of the 334th Fighter-Interceptor squadron he was officially credited with shooting down nine MiG-15s and one La-9, as well as (unofficially) an additional probable kill, and three more enemy aircraft damaged. At the time of his return to the United States in October 1952, he was America's leading jet ace.&#10;&#10;Contains 1 Resin Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star Aircraft and game cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

During a series of air strikes against the North Korean port of Hoeryong, the four MiGs were intercepted as a result of intelligence provided by the US National Security Agency. Williams lost contact with his wingman and found himself in a 6-on-1 confrontation against the fearsome MiG 15. Nevertheless, he downed four of the enemy jets and upon returning to the USS Oriskany, his Panther was found to have sustained 263 hits from cannon shells and was beyond repair.&#10;&#10;What makes this feat all the more remarkable is that the four MiGs downed were confirmed to have been flown by Soviet Naval Aviation Pilots. This was only confirmed by Russian sources 40 years later - with all Soviet involvement vehemently denied, during and for many years after, the Korean War.&#10;&#10;Contains 1 Resin Grumman F9F Panther and game cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One day, an angel gave you two rings, one silver and one gold. Upon reading the inscription, a horned man in a tailcoat appeared. &quot;I will grant any wish you ask, but will take the soul of the bearer of the silver ring in compensation&quot;&#10;&#10;You cleverly place the silver ring on a stone statue that has a soul that eternally replenishes itself. With this, you can have any wish granted without losing anything! Or so you thought...&#10;&#10;Your goal as a player is to be just a bit greedy, to be happier than everyone else by getting the Devil to fulfill more of your wishes. He will grant any wish you have, and the statue will provide the soul in payment. But sometimes mischievous stuffed animals will steal the soul and the price will not have be paid.&#10;&#10;Initially, the Devil will forgive you with just a warning, but if payments are late too often, horrible things will happen to the last player to make a wish. Sometimes you will need to be bold and other times you will need to be more modest, in order to have the most wishes granted, but not have made the last wish when the Devil's patience runs out.&#10;&#10;Diletto: Secret of Eden is a card game for two to five players, in which you will take turns having a wish granted. The larger the wish, the more of your soul that must be given in compensation. Draw an appropriate number of cards from the ring deck, and if you draw an 'oops', place it in play. Once three 'oops' are accumulated, the wish fails and the players receive a warning. Players accumulate 'sense' during the course of the game, which can be used to reduce the risk of a wish by reducing how many ring cards to draw.&#10;&#10;When the final warning appears, the Devil will take the soul of the next player to fail a wish, causing them to instantly lose and the game ends. The winner is the remaining player with the most wishes granted.&#10;&#10;Diletto shares characters and story with Domina Games' previous game Eresia.&#10;&#10;",

Roger de Camden, otherwise known as &quot;The Gentleman&quot;, provides letters of introduction to mysterious figures shaping the World of Darkness. Call upon their favor to alter your chronicle, twisting bloodlines and banishing troublesome characters to the shadows... or bringing them back.&#10;&#10;This expansion features 28 cards to be added to the chronicle deck after the first chapter and revealed through play. Use the card ID (bottom right corner) to place them in the right order.

Strays include: Mahtiel, Abdalkutba, Pentweret, &amp; Roger De Camden.&#10;&#10;LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION&#10;These 24 cards each conclude a specific mission chain. The player who has claimed the most corresponding missions receives the letter of introduction, which may be discard during any aftermath phase for the indicated effect. In the case of ties, no player receives the letter of introduction.&#10;&#10;Retain - Instead of selecting a retainer from your bloodline, select any vampire of the indicated clan (including from an opponent's bloodline or the character deck).&#10;Banish - Select any vampire of the indicated clan, and place them into this expansion box. They may not be used for the rest of the chronicle.&#10;Readmit - Return any previously banished vampire into play, moving them from this expansion box to the character deck.&#10;&#10;",

(Kami Climb!) is a dexterity game from Japan, exhibited for the first time at Tokyo Game Market Autumn 2019. Before playing, the paper mountain is constructed by hand using the paper materials supplied. Through paper folding, a large column with angular sides is built, standing in a solid base unit. The shape resembles the artificial climbing walls found in modern sports centres.&#10;&#10;Once the piece of paper is transformed into a steep rocky mountain, the players operate their climber with one finger, to aim for the top of the mountain. The player first pushes their climber up with their finger and hooks it on the anchor to proceed. The anchors match the climbers' colours.&#10;&#10;There are two phases, plan and climb. Reach the anchors on the 3D board in turn order. When climbing, if the climber reaches an anchor in their colour, they take another move.&#10;&#10;Players can win by reaching the summit faster than the others. But a player can still win if they take the harder routes. Players must choose between easier, faster routes, and harder, more technical routes. If a player can conquer the hardest route in three turns, they win.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Once in the Wild, players command their cards and animals to battle opponents.&#10;&#10;Animal, Force, and Nature cards with their own unique abilities may seem simple by themselves, but masterfully combining them can lead to some exceptionally thrilling matches.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Animals &ndash; like the Gorilla &ndash; can attack other animals and players in the Wild, and can also be used to defend attacks from opponents.&#10;     Force cards &ndash; such as Patience &ndash; can make opponents reevaluate their strategy by making permanent changes to animals during the game.&#10;     Nature cards &ndash; including Volcano &ndash; change the course of the game by directly impacting players and animals in the Wild.&#10;&#10;&#10;Force of Nature is a special card that can deal a devastating blow to opponents &ndash; it removes all animals for all players in the Wild. Used at just the right moment, this card can dramatically turn the tables on unsuspecting players.&#10;&#10;The last surviving player wins Forces of Nature.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The sounds from the crashing shells concealed the oncoming Chinese, until they burst forward in what was described as &ldquo;a moving carpet of yelling, howling men--whistles and bugles blowing, their officers screaming like women driving their men uphill.&rdquo; In a bunker CP just beneath the crest of the hill Corporal Dale W. Cain heard his radio come alive with reports of &ldquo;enemy in large numbers&rdquo;. Company A reported hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches. The battle was fought in a driving monsoon rain, making evacuation of the wounded difficult, as well as re-supply. As the battle swayed back and forth, the Chinese made repeated pushes to take the hill while both sides unleashed a storm of artillery fire upon the struggling soldiers. During the course of two days, parts of four companies defended Pork Chop. At dawn on July 8th, the rain ended for a time and the initial defenders were withdrawn. The defenders counted nine enemy assaults during the night of July 6-7. By 11 July General Taylor reluctantly decided to abandon Pork Chop Hill. As had been the case on Old Baldy, Taylor could not justify risking more lives for a hill that was of minimal strategic significance. The armistice was finally just around the corner.&#10;&#10;Newly remastered - really NEW as the terrain has changed in some instances, not to mention the retro art and then some &gt; AND THE MAP IS about 120% ENLARGED!

    "Description": "Lockpick is a solo game in which the player attempts to work with randomly-drawn cards to create Rummy-style sets of three in various columns. The theme is one of breaking in to a security system via lockpicking and computer hacking. Designed for the Looney Pyramids family, Lockpick requires a Zark City deck (or other five-suited deck from with values from 1-13), 15 pyramids in five colors, and two dice: a standard D6 and a specialized color die.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the card deck is separated into five piles by color with space left below each pile to form a column. Space for a discard pile goes off to the side. Each turn, the player begins with an empty hand and rolls the two dice. The numeral on the D6 determines how many cards the player must draw, and the color die determines what color pile the player must draw from. With these cards in hand, the player must now distribute them among the columns beneath the color piles, using a mancala-style distribution that wraps around and will cause newer cards to cascade down, partially covering previously-placed cards. Any three-card sets that are created within the columns are now removed along with the colored pyramid that sits above that column.&#10;&#10;Once a color pile is depeleted, subsequent die rolls of that color allow the player to remove a matching color card from one of the columns and reposition it at the bottom of any column desired, thus allowing for the possibility of sets being created through the joining of two previously unconnected groups of cards within a single column, along with the rare opportunity for two sets to be formed at once. Victory is achieved when a player has successfully defeated all 15 security measures (represented by the 15 pyramids). Defeat occurs when all the cards have been depleted while there are pyramids still standing.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players lead groups of kids in building micronations that will fight for economic and territorial supremacy of the neighborhood. The game takes place on a map made of hexagons. During the game players can have their kids build forts or work at headquarters to grow their economy and gain resources. Supply lines must be maintained to transfer this wealth. Each micronation can also print their own currency which they can use for trade or negotiations with other micronations. The value of this currency can be brought up or down for manipulative purposes. Other optional strategies involve combat or social infiltration to convert kids from other micronations. Aside from these challenges kids must avoid parents who randomly wander the map in attempts to make them go home. The player with the most stored resources at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;NOTE: The first edition of Micronations was named Neighborhood Conflict. It was known under that name in years 2011&ndash;2013.&#10;&#10;     Not to be confused with first edition of Tactical Friction, which was also named Neighborhood Conflict, but got renamed to Tactical Friction in 2008.&#10;     Not to be confused with Neighborhood Conflict.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It allows players to fight actions from the whole period and across the whole world, from Japan to Europe and the Americas and from the Italian Wars to the Nine Years War.&#10;&#10;This edition combines the 2002 edition of the rules with all three of the books of Army Lists and includes everything the wargamer needs to refight these battles in one single convenient volume.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the book&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 2088 only monolithic cities of trans-humanistic worship protrude from the crust of the earth. Between these cities lies The Expanse, where all opposed were banished. The first to stabilize an economy was Neo Tokyo. The 3 foundational levels that stabilized the economy are as follows:&#10;&#10;THE UNDERBELLY&#10;The Underbelly is at street level and is home to the augmentation junkies looking to merge with machines as much and as fast as possible. This is a wild jungle with extremes in morals and values. The Underbelly is a powerful economy completely driven by tech advances.&#10;&#10;THE PEN&#10;The Pen, home to the sheeple. The Pen is completely self contained ecosystem above the Underbelly. It is a stable economy but possesses a docile culture which needs protection provided by corporate security called &quot;The Regulators&quot;. Now that The Pen faces a new threat from the villains henchmen, their fear needs to be managed because if the The Pen falls, so does the city.&#10;&#10;THE QUANTUM&#10;Above it all sits The Quantum, the home of the Corporate Elite. Completely sealed off and secured, these are the lever pullers. Their key to success was helping to facilitate a social contract with the citizens and their representatives. This unwritten understanding is what made Neo Tokyo possible and has yet to be displayed, defined or quantified.&#10;&#10;When word got around about the quality of Aug's/Mods and the success rate, many, including Natalia Burtolla (an accomplished hacker known as Liquid Squid) rushed to Neo Tokyo. Born without legs, she came for the best money could buy.  She quickly fell in love with the city and the feeling was mutual. She finally feels at home and will do anything to protect Neo Tokyo.&#10;&#10;With great decadents comes greater corruption and the stench of that sludge attracts the greatest of villains.&#10;&#10;When the villains henchmen hit the streets many were caught off guard. Liquid Squid was well aware and prepared for this threat. To The Underbelly, this was only a matter of time.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;A Super Villain is hell bent on terrorizing Neo Tokyo into his control. If he takes out 3 Landmarks he gains the levers of power over the entire city. When the 3rd Landmark has been targeted for attack the Super Villain himself and his elite army descend to make sure the job gets done right. Try to foil the attacks on Landmarks until you can assemble an army of allies powerful enough to defeat him and end the chaos.&#10;&#10;DEFEND NEO TOKYO&#10;Neo Tokyo is rife with the Villains Henchmen and natural enemy factions that will destroy anyone and anything in their path. You must protect the citizens from these threats. At the same time you must try to foil attacks on Landmarks until you are prepared to face the Super Villain.&#10;&#10;BUILD AN ARMY&#10;Build rep with powerful city influencers by completing missions, assemble your army of allies and temper public fear.&#10;&#10;END THE CHAOS&#10;When the third Landmark is triggered you go toe-to-toe with the Super Villain and his army with only one option for an ending. Explosive.&#10;&#10;THE STREETS&#10;The streets are the underbelly of Neo Tokyo and have 3 stand-alone districts which hold 36 key locations. The Villains henchmen are causing chaos across the city. It has become a monstrous jungle war between the treacherous and the savage. The Villain needs to destroy three landmarks to throw the city into proper chaos and take control of the primary levers.  You must defend the streets while building an ally army and when you&rsquo;re ready, end the chaos.&#10;&#10;PUBLIC FEAR&#10;During play the Villain will trigger events that spook the general public. The higher the Public Fear meter rises the more carnage the Villain will rain down on the city. Gain reputation with influencers and they will use their platforms to try and calm the public.&#10;&#10;MISSIONS&#10;There are 126 missions offering reputation and gadget rewards. When visiting locations around the city you can access Mission Control to see what missions are available and select at least one.&#10;&#10;ENEMY AND ALLY POOLS&#10;The enemy pool builds randomly during play, these forces are inserted into a scenario when they are triggered. A Landmark is triggered when 3 enemies appear on it. You build the ally pool and those are the forces you use when a Landmark is triggered.&#10;&#10;LANDMARKS&#10;There are 12 Landmarks across the city. Each has a unique one-shot combat scenario. When a Landmark is triggered place the scenario on the board, try to defuse the situation and exit with as much loot as possible. If an ally does not reach an exit they are removed from your forces.&#10;&#10;POINTS of INTEREST (POI)&#10;In order to hack from the streets Liquid Squid must enter a POI. POI's can be destroyed as well but do not count as Landmarks. Most missions involve POI locations and NPC's from those locations.&#10;&#10;HACKING&#10;HACK INTO THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENEMIES&#10;Liquid Squid is a balanced dance between physical combat and hacking. If you have an angry mob on the other side of the city, not a problem. Hack in and set-off a Regulator Alarm, that will make &lsquo;em scatter. Facing an overpowered enemy? No problem. Hack into his system, overload it and watch the fire works. The synergy between problem solving, physical combat and hacking is what makes Liquid Squid so enjoyable.&#10;&#10;In order to hack there has to be a Mobile Hub in the district. You will always have a 50% chance that there is a Mobile Hub in the district. But you can gain control of Mobile Hubs and dedicate them to certain districts granting 100% hacking as long as you maintain control of the Mobile Hub.&#10;In order to hack the streets, Liquid Squid must launch the hack from a Point of Interest. In a scenario she must launch a hack from a Hack Entry Point. Hacking consists of O-Hack/D-Hack gadgets, Offensive/Defensive Programs (Oprog/Dprog) and NODES.&#10;&#10;FACTIONS&#10;The Syndicate (Ally)&#10;The Syndicate are a network of gangs in the Tokyo Underbelly lead by Robert Crisp. Attain Ally status with Crisp and they will join you in your fight.&#10;&#10;Regulators (Ally)&#10;The Regulators are corporate security and the law in Neo Tokyo. Attain Ally Status with Chief Yamasaki and they will join you in battle.&#10;&#10;The Coda (Enemy)&#10;The Coda are the Villains henchmen. They are a mixed bag of characters with a wide range of mod limits. They are exceedingly loyal to their boss, relentless terrorists and your sworn enemy.&#10;&#10;Outliers (Enemy)&#10;Outliers are the Villains Praetorian Guard. They have taken exceptionally well to merging with machines and poses a fervor to watch the world burn.&#10;&#10;Mercs (Ally)&#10;Mercs are deadly mercenaries for hire. They have a natural disdain for oppressors and Outliers in particular. Mercs further modify their Mods for optimum carnage. Mercs will join Liquid Squid free of charge.&#10;&#10;Drones (Enemy)&#10;These nasty machines are the Super Villains master assassins. They have destroyed the competition, even Regulator Drones. Now they only exist to hunt you and your ilk.&#10;&#10;Block Rockers (Enemy)&#10;Block Rockers are massive mechs with on board sentient AI. They will cut off passage through the block and are chock full of Gank Rating. Each of the three types of Block Rocker requires a specific gadget to engage them.&#10;&#10;The Chimera (Enemy)&#10;The Chimera are mutants who suffered grotesque side effects from merging with machines. Chimera can be found in the Underbelly and below. Besides general carnage they also maintain coordinated attacks of &quot;The Pen&quot; above.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
