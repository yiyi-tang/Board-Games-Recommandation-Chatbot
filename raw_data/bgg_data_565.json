One player takes the role of the attacking forces and other the defender.  Each takes turns exploring the board and coming into conflict with each other.&#10;&#10;Players have a limited set of moves and military pieces they may use during the game. The attacking player is trying to win via the listed victory conditions before a set number of turns elapses.  The defender is trying to prevent this.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence is broken into three phases (Command, Movement, and Firefight) and each player completes his turn fully before it is passed to the other.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules are provided which gives players access to a set of six fleet cards with unique abilities that will alter their play-style.&#10;&#10;Shoulder of Orion is part of a series of print and play boardgames published through Bell of Lost Souls.  This series is provided as a downloadable pdf which includes everything needed to play except dice.  Players may download, print out the pieces, and start playing.  The game is designed to be enhanced with common playing pieces found in other games for those would prefer to not use counters.&#10;&#10;SHOULDER OF ORION is available FREE at BoLS Board Games: http://www.bolsboardgames.com&#10;&#10;",

German tanks attacked the town, but Polish 155 mm howitzers destroyed several tanks and the attackers fell back. Returning later that day, they managed to destroy 7 Polish tanks with artillery but lost just after five Panzers . After receiving several more direct hits and losing two more large Panzers, the German tank crews simply ran away. Polish 7TP tanks pursued and kept beating the rest of the tanks off. The German soldiers now met the Polish infantry and attacked, but they were repelled by the Polish tanks. &#10;Soon, all the Germans retreated and by the end of September 6, no hostile forces were in Piotrk&oacute;w Trybunalski. On September 7, Marshal Rydz-Smigly orders the Polish forces to withdraw.&#10;&#10;&#10;Wikipedia: Battle of Piotrk&#195;&#179;w Trybunalski&#10;&#10;",

Illustrations and cartoons often accompany the holes on the course.&#10;&#10;Players take turns choosing which club they will use, and rolling 2 normal 6-sided dice. Results of their roll are compared to the game chart- a 7 is an ideal shot. The farther away from the center of the bell curve the die roll indicates, the worse the shank or hook on the ball.&#10;&#10;Once all players are on the fairway, as in normal golf, player order is determined by distance to the green.&#10;&#10;",

Once here, it is the Mercenary's job to rescue a Prisoner and then both Mercenary and Prisoner escape from their captors.&#10;&#10;What makes the game unique is the mechanic that enables the player's pieces (a 'Mercenary' and a 'Prisoner') to move through the dungeons. To pass through passageways players must have a Skeleton Key in their possession that matches the door they are passing. Beware though, because not only must players avoid the ever present dungeon Guards, they must avoid traps that have been set within the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A player's Prisoner begins the game in a locked cell, within the dungeon, that must be opened to free him. It is the Mercenary's job to assist the Prisoner in his escape attempt. The first player&rsquo;s Mercenary and Prisoner to escape from the dungeons wins the game. An escape is made when a player&rsquo;s pieces enter the Guardhouse.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players are playing cards from their hands into a 3x3 grid of 9 cards that act as a common game area for all players. Each card has a microbe type represented in the middle and dots at corners. The dots are red, white, or grey. Players score colored markers by placing cards next to each other on the grid in such a way that one or more of the dots on their card line up with similar dots on other cards. For each dot that matches, that player scores a colored scoring marker for the card that their dots matched (not the card they just played).&#10;&#10;During scoring sessions, scoring markers are converted into point chips depending on the current layout of the 3x3 grid. Once a scorecard is drawn, play immediately pauses and scoring begins. Of the 4 types available, the one that is represented the least among the 9 currently on the 3x3 grid is worth the most. This means that each colored score marker of that type that a player has may be converted into a 2-point chip. The most abundant type represented on the 3x3 grid is worth negative 1 point. All other types are worth 1 point. Players may never have a negative total. If there are 2 or more types that are both the least represented type, they are both worth 2 points, likewise, if there are 2 or more types that are tied for being the most represented type, each of them are then worth negative 1 point.&#10;&#10;After scoring has completed, play resumes where it left off and the game continues until the next scorecard is drawn or the draw deck is exhausted. Once the draw deck is exhausted the third and final scoring round takes place. Players then total all of their scoring chips. The player with the highest value wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Guerilla - Universal Rules for Warfare by Iain Dickie, Rules by Jim Webster&#10;&#10;(Webster seems to have authored the rules for actual combat, while Dickie apparently authored the rules for determining the forces and deployment.)&#10;&#10;Simple miniatures rules for guerrilla warfare in a wide range of eras.  (A list of guerrilla wars going back to Scythians vs Persians in 516 B.C. is included.)&#10;&#10;The forces for each side (State and Guerrilla) are determined randomly.  A d6 and a d100 is rolled for each side.  The d6 determines how many officers(state) or leaders(guerrillas) are present; the d100 result is the number of troops.  The two rolls together determine the force's mission.&#10;&#10;For example, a roll of 3/13 gives the state forces one major, two captains, 3 lieutenants and 13 troops.   Their mission reads, &quot;You have captured one important guerrilla leader and must escort him, alive, from one corner of the table to the opposite for a show trial. Convoy.&quot;  A roll of 6/50 gives the guerrilla forces 6 leaders (and, as a 6 was rolled, one of them must be secretly designated the chief leader of the war) and 50 troops.  Their mission reads, &quot;Funeral of a fighter, now a martyr, being used to whip up support.  The three most senior leaders are at the graveside with both parents of the victim.  Next the enthusiastic fighters form a ring, surrounded by the reliable and unreliable fighters mixed, who are in turn surrounded by the fanatics and remaining leaders. Company.&quot;&#10;&#10;The way in which troops are deployed on the board is determined by cross-indexing the mission type of each side on a table.  In the above example, the state's mission type is &quot;convoy&quot; and the guerrillas' is &quot;company,&quot; which gives &quot;deploy company first then start convoy.&quot;&#10;&#10;A d10 is rolled to determine the location, which can range from &quot;Steep hill country&quot; or &quot;dense woodland&quot; to &quot;city back streets&quot; or &quot;market town, market day, very crowded.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

It really stands out from the other great Shogi variants and deserves its name of &quot;exotic&quot;. The exotic pieces include range jumpers which can jump over any number of pieces in order make a capture, and the Fire Demon which can &quot;burn&quot; all enemy pieces on the squares adjacent to where it lands!&#10;&#10;Unlike in most other Shogi variants, tactics in Tenjiku are critical right from the first move of the game.  Despite the large board, the power of the pieces can mean that careless play is rewarded with a lost game in only a few moves.&#10;&#10;",

The game dates to the 15th century and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the discovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant, if not board game, ever. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves. It was never a popular game; indeed, a single production of half a dozen game sets in the early 17th century was a notable event.&#10;&#10;Like other large-board variants, but unlike standard Shogi, the game is played without drops, and uses a promotion-by-capture rule.&#10;&#10;Tai Shogi is a gargantuan of a game both in terms of strategy and playing time. A serious game of Tai will require several long sessions to complete and may need over 1000 -moves per player. The game is simply too big to be played strategically, and therefore the game typically proceeds as a series of local skirmishes as both players try to develop their pieces and improve their position. Flat out rapid play will typically take at least three days (takes an hour or so to setup!).&#10;&#10;While most of the 101 different pieces in Tai Shogi are also found in other variants, one unique feature of Tai is the presence right from the beginning of the game of the all powerful Emperors.&#10;&#10;Tai Shogi is played on a board of 25 x 25 squares and each player has 177 pieces (including 25 pawns) ! A unique feature of Tai Shogi is the presence right from the start of the game of the all powerful Emperors. The Emperor has the greatest power of any piece in any of the Shogi variants as it may move in one turn to almost any square on the board, jumping over any number of pieces of either side in the process.&#10;&#10;While you might think that the power of the Emperors would have a great impact on the course of the game, their powers tend to offset each other. It should be noted that any otherwise unprotected piece is always protected by its own Emperor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game, from the famous shop  'Hamleys Of London'  was produced around Christmas time in 1910 and is about Ernest Shackleton's near miss attempt to reach the South Pole during that year. (He eventually succeeds in 1914-1916). I know little about the game except that I did see an artist's rendition of the game being played in the book &quot;SAFE RETURN DOUBTFUL - The Heroic Age of Polar Exploration&quot; written by John Maxtone-Graham. The game is about racing sleighs to the south pole and uses pencils to map out the route. From page 259 of the book. &quot;The game was played on a large circular papier-mache board, painted white and grooved with concentric ridges of miniature sastrugi   (SASTRUGI = Wind eroded snow, which often looks rough, like frozen waves. Usually found on windward slopes). Each player assumed the identity of a famous explorer and, equipped with special magnetic pencils, coaxed miniature sledges through the maze of tracks toward the central pole, False leads led to dead ends, and any player thus stymied could extricate his sled only by using a magnet of reversed polarity marked &quot;Dr. Cook&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;",

If it's safe, he may rest easy - if it 'snaps' he loses a finger card.  But he does get to re-set the 'Knipper' secretly so that no one else knows which side it will 'snap'.  That's where the memory comes in.  Players successfully reaching their own corner get a finger card back each time.&#10;&#10;This fast and furious game of tension is for 2 to 4 players, the winner being the player who is the last with a finger or fingers intact.&#10;&#10;",

One player assumes the role of the sheep and one person assumes the role of the person trying to kill the sheep for various reasons. To start the game, a sheep is drawn on the page, preferably in the middle, then one person decides to go first and draw something on the page. Remember, the sheep is trying to escape the traps of the killer while the killer is trying to kill the sheep. The game eventually reaches a point when one person or the other is trapped, and has died. This can be over in a few minutes or drag on into a philosophical debate.

    "Description": "Warband is a skirmish game based on the Hundred Kingdoms Mass Combat System.  Using similar rules to the mass combat system, Warband allows new players to get a taste of the system without committing to purchasing an army.&#10;&#10;The objective in Warband is to maintain control of a strategic point on the battlefield for a set number of turns (usually 5) or destroy all of your enemies.&#10;&#10;In Warband, each individual miniature is a unit, each unit may receive only one command each turn, unless modified by a spell or special ability.  Possible commands are&#10;&#10;1. Non-combat Movement&#10;2. Charge into Melee Combat&#10;3. Melee Combat&#10;4. Missile Combat&#10;5. Rally&#10;6. Disengage&#10;7. Sorcery&#10;&#10;In addition to these commands, you may have to deal with the mandatory command Retreat.  Each player in turn issues all commands to his forces, resolves all effects, then play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Warbands are built using a point based system, before play begins players choose their Kingdom, and may only marshal forces from that Kingdom.  Full rules, army lists, and point costs are downloadable for free at the company website. While Black Orc would of course prefer you bought your minis from them, the game can be tried out with the miniatures you have on hand, and the downloaded information.&#10;&#10;Boxed sets contained everything to get started, including&#10;&#10;The rule book&#10;Testors acrylic paints and paint brush&#10;Miniatures painting guide&#10;Flexible ruler&#10;Two 20 sided dice&#10;&#10;A Bushido Clan Strike Force consisting of&#10;a.

    "Description": "The Dogfight Battles of July and August 1942&#10; Rommel's success was inspiring, even to his sworn enemies. Time after time, his panzers swept across the desert like hot sirocco winds in their unrelenting blitzkrieg fashion. The British were nearing their end, so it seemed. Whatever defenses they created did little to halt Rommel. The Germans were also nearing their end logistically speaking as El Alamein was far, far away from their main supply depots. Rommel's own panzers were wearing out from all of the fast advances that had totally kept the British off balance.&#10;The first of the grueling dogfight battles occurred from July 1-4. Hitler was pressing Rommel to go for the kill and reach the Nile. Rommel, himself, felt certain the British were at their end after the unraveling of their defenses in June and their chaotic retreat. But his DAK divisions had suffered and most were really just regimental size. Panzer divisions had a mere 30 tanks. Still, he went forth confident. In this battle, fuel was not an issue, but Rommel attacked without much intelligence as to where the enemy really was. For the British, it was their last stand. They could not afford another Gazala or Tobruk because it would mean Egypt was German.&#10;The second dogfight battle in the same area began August 30th. Rommel would once again try his sweep around the end tactic and block all retreat routes. The battle is also known as Alam Halfa. Rommel had replenished his panzer divisions this time but fuel was a keen issue, as his plan called for them to advance deep into the rear of the British and cut them off. The problem was that his panzers would then have little fuel. By now, Rommel was more hesitant in this offensive and secured guarantees from Hitler that more fuel would arrive. Hitler promised. Reluctant, the order was again given in what was his last attempt to reach the Nile. The British were well prepared this time around and more or less knew of the plan. Their minefields were widened, units were instructed to let the German's come to them, their bombers readied. Dogfight 2 ended on Sept. 3, and the British lost a precious chance to encircle the DAK.&#10;&#10;There are two games distinct from one another. Each uses different rules, counters and maps. They are at different scales with dogfight 2 being more tactical and dogfight 1, operational.&#10;Each day turn in dogfight 1 is 8 hrs, 1 mile hexes. In dogfight 2, it is 4 hrs, and most units are company size. AFVs have armor ratings using a new system. Each game has 11x17&quot; map and has 280 counters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An enjoyable card-board game created after the eponymous novel of a young Czech writer. The game system is based on the adventures during movement in a diversified terrain of old England. In the role of Knights the players have to search for the imprisoned Queen of England and return her to her beloved husband, the grieving King. An original game after an original novel.&#10;&#10;In this game the game board is constructed from tiles (initially put face-down) and is revealed throughout the game as Knights move on the tiles. Each tile is divided into 9 segments which are used for the movement and there are 3 Terrain types to be found - Roads, Forests, and Mountains. Each Terrain allows for a different Movement speed.&#10;&#10;The Goal of the Knights is to uncover and get to six Castles and find out on which of them the Queen is held (by secretly checking upon a castle card when they enter a Castle, eventually coming to the last card under a small stone, that shows the correct Castle). During their journeys they can use various helpers, for instance Horses, Boats, Eagles or their special versions (awarded from the King for capturing Traitors, that can be found in Taverns).&#10;&#10;All-in-all the concept and production quality of the game is fresh and outstanding and is well worth the moderate-to-low price.&#10;&#10;The game is language independent, only the manual would have to be translated (currently in Czech only, as of February 2009).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Maka daidai sh&#197;&#141;gi ('ultra-huge chess') is a large board variant of shogi (Japanese chess). The game dates back to the 15th century and is based on dai dai shogi and the earlier dai shogi. The three Edo-era sources are not congruent in their descriptions of the pieces not found in smaller games. Apart from its size and number of pieces, the major difference from these smaller games is the &ldquo;promotion by capture&rdquo; rule.&#10;&#10;Maka Dai Dai Shogi is played on a board of 19&times;19 spaces and each player has 96 pieces (including 19 pawns). The fabulous &quot;hook moving&quot; pieces of Dai Dai Shogi are also present in Maka Dai Dai Shogi, but together with many of the other powerful pieces, they start directly behind the Pawns making for a more dynamic opening game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Polish Tank Battle is a modern chess-like game played on an 11x11 diagonally symmetrical grid. Two players each command an army of 13 tanks plus one general who has the exclusive ability to enter and pass through the purple contaminated area in the middle. All pieces move and capture as queens from Western Chess. At the start the tanks are located on the 14 dark green and orange spaces, respective to the green and orange tanks. There are also 20 tree spaces on the board that tanks may not enter or pass through.&#10;&#10;The objective is to enter the opponent's base with as many tanks as possible, scoring two points per tank. Any other surviving tanks not in the far base also score one point for the player. If your general stands in the corner where the enemy general started you score an additional point (3 for that tank). The game immediately ends when one side has moved his final remaining tank into the enemy base.&#10;&#10;",

A balanced mix of strategy, chance and several unique game mechanics (e.g. throwing &bdquo;bullets&ldquo; at a special target) makes this game the most true western of all times.&#10;&#10;With your band of Bandits you try to rob one of the Objects in the city. You can gain up to 3 additional Bandits (releasing them from Prison) and gradually build their abilities up to the final Central Bank Robbery. In between you will be robbing Coaches or Trains for Money and shooting other players' Bandits to get to your Objectives.&#10;&#10;A fun and entertaining game for 2-5 people Nowheresville brings the Western times to your gaming table!&#10;&#10;",

If the Knight and Dragon of the led suit are played to the same trick, the Knight wins.&#10;&#10;- There also two special cards: The Supreme and The Void Card.  They cannot be led but can be played to any trick.  The Void Card voids out its trick, so no one wins it, though the player who played it still leads the next trick.  The Supreme wins any trick it is played in unless that is not Voided.&#10;&#10;- Of the 62 cards in the deck, 14 are dealt to each of the 4 players, and the remaining 6 are laid aside unseen, so people are not sure what is missing.  Players pass 3 cards, similar to Hearts (left / right / across / no pass).&#10;&#10;- Each player bids once on the number of tricks they'll take (minimum 4).  The winner names trump, and gets one point per trick if he makes his bid, otherwise he subtracts his bid.  Others must take 3 tricks each for 3 points or lose 3 points if they don't; unless they bid &quot;Low&quot;, and if they take no tricks they get 6 points, or lose 6 if they fail.&#10;&#10;- Winner is the first to 23 points.&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes the big die counts as tens and the little die counts as ones, sometimes the basic numbers on both dice are added together to achieve a total.  All of the dice charts have to do with offensive play calls.&#10;&#10;",

Both players look to expand their holdings, spread their culture, and strengthen their military forces.&#10;&#10;Meld is an abstract game that mixes in an economic/resource managment element.
