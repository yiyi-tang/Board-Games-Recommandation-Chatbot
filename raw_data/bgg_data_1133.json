    "Description": "Panakizhi started life as a design challenge to see if we could design 3 fun games using a common set of pieces and game board.  Over time we experimented with, and discarded, a number of different ideas - streamlining game play to keep the games as simple yet challenging as possible.  With game times lasting 5-10 minutes each we feel that the 3 games presented in this set enable strategy players to always have access to a quick, tight, and challenging game wherever they are thanks to the compact and light design.&#10;&#10;The three games are:&#10;&#10;Vancanna&#10;&#10;With only 12 pieces on the board the simplicity of its looks belies the strategy involved in winning.  Players are attempting to move 3 of their coloured pieces off the opposite side of the board, the catch being that if they can jump their opponent's piece then they must make that move - and doing so will cause the piece jumped to be flipped to their colour.  It may sound counter-intuitive, but the strategic use of forcing your opponent to jump your piece, and thereby losing it, can actually be advantageous as it could trigger a series of moves that see your pieces advancing across the board.&#10;&#10;Talluka&#10;&#10;This game is deceptively simple yet players can quickly find themselves with a limited number of optimal moves.  Pieces are slid across the board one space per turn, the catch being that they can only move if they are on the outside of a line and are adjacent to another piece in the direction they are moving so that they can push that piece as well.  Align 4 of your pieces adjacent to each other and in a vertical or horizontal line and you win.&#10;&#10;Gopurrum&#10;&#10;Gopurrum involves moving and jumping your pieces around the board as you attempt to make a stack of pieces 4-high.  Each time you jump a piece, or a stack of pieces, the top piece on that stack is flipped so that it changes sides.  Only your pieces, or stacks where your colour is showing on top, can be moved on your turn - and no move can end with more than 4 pieces being on a stack.  Players can shed the top piece of a stack to an adjacent empty space if the top piece is theirs, but be careful as you may also be helping your opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Usually, the different alien races in the galaxy don't get along too well. They might not engage in outright war, but they don't invite each other over for dinner, either. However, when a menace threatens everyone equally, they'll quickly band together to fight it. The Xenos on PK-L7 certainly count as one of those menaces.&#10;&#10;The Survivors of the Galaxy box set for Zombicide: Invader introduces four new Survivors that players can choose for their games. Each one comes with its own dashboard and unique set of abilities to help them in the dark corridors and bombed-out buildings on the planet. They'll need all those skills, too, as the strangely-named Babyface Abomination also lurks those corridors, looking to eviscerate anyone that gets in its way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game is devised by Franky as a way to weed out rats, but he was unaware that Timeowthy was Billy's best friend.&#10;&#10;Billy and Franky are each given 10 cards, and the game lasts up to 5 rounds.  In each round, the Billy and Franky players will simultaneously play 2 cards face down to the table.  The Timeowthy player will inspect the cards and determine which players' cards have the larger sum.  Timeowthy will then reveal one of the two cards player by the winner.  Once during the game Timeowthy can lie and reveal a card player by the loser instead.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either Billy or Franky has won 3 rounds.  If Franky wins 3 rounds, then Franky wins.  If Billy wins 3 rounds, then Franky chooses 1 round in which he accuses Timeowthy of lying about the result. If Franky is correct, that player wins.  If Franky is incorrect, Billy and Timeowthy both win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We were sick of playing the same boring, lackluster, and uninspiring drinking games.&#10;&#10;We set out on a quest to revolutionize the drinking game industry by creating a game with real substance and the highest quality of materials.&#10;&#10;The basics:&#10;The rules of Dicey are simple! Roll our signature 12-sided die and draw the color card that corresponds with your roll. Read the card out loud to the group and follow the directions to the mini-game that is on the card. Winners and losers are determined on a per card basis (each card is its own drinking mini-game). If you can successfully collect 5 cards you are the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;More details: &#10;Dicey is a collection of 83 mini-games split into four different color categories:&#10;&#10;Group Play cards are the color green and are mini-games that the whole group will play together.&#10;&#10;Face Off cards are the color orange and are mini-games that are a one-on-one competition between players. If you draw this card you are responsible for picking your opponent from the group to compete against.&#10;&#10;Rule cards or &quot;Rules&quot; are the color yellow and are fun variations to the game that last a full turn (one complete lap around the circle) or until someone else draws a rule card.  Only 1 rule card can be active at a time!&#10;&#10;Wildcards are the color purple and are the most ridiculous of the Dicey mini-games! Get ready for belly-aching laughs as these cards are an assortment of Dicey's most wild creations.&#10;&#10;We worked for over 3 years on creating Dicey.  We made hundreds of mini-games, played with thousands of people, and ultimately narrowed the cards down to what people truly had fun playing.&#10;&#10;We want you to share in the crazy shenanigans, lifelong friendships, and timeless memories Dicey has given to us.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chaos and Order clash, and the fate of the world of Run hangs in the balance. Choose sides and fulfill your destiny!&#10;&#10;The Chronicles of Run is a two-player game based in a fantasy world, based in abstract strategy and tile placement.&#10;&#10;At the begining of the game players take their cards, tokens and screens. They create the world of Run by placing the hexagonal land tiles. Lands are divided in two zones, one for attackers and a second for defenders, and they have a different importance in the game that is represented by its points of power.&#10;&#10;In each turn players choose and place one rune token (that represents a hero with a different value of fate) on a land tile free. After both sides have played, tokens are revealed, their cards placed aside and their skills applied.&#10;&#10;Runes represent very powerful skills that can modify the position of characters, boost them or win a challenge against an specific opponent. This allows a great variety of tactics and tricks to overcome your opponent's minions.&#10;&#10;This process is repeated until all the lands have a hero of each side (Order or Chaos). Then challenges are resolved in each land around the world. The hero with more fate wins the challenge, and its controlling player gets the points of power from that land.&#10;&#10;After all challenges are done the game ends, and the player that achieves more points of power wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sandstorm is a 2-player, card driven, hex and counter format game on the North African campaign. The map covers the area from approximately el Algheila in the west to just east of el Alamein in the east, aka 'the Western Desert'. The time period allows a start when the Italians invade Egypt in September, 1940, and ends December, 1942, when the Axis were driven out of Cyrenaica. The game has 2 months turns and use larger counters, 5/8th of inch, a full campaign should take between 10 to 14 hours.&#10;&#10;Sandstorm is a 2-player game on the North African campaign with the recommendation to begin play when the German intervened in March 1941. However, one may start as early as September, 1940; albeit subject to Mussolini&rsquo;s directive to invade Egypt, amongst other starting dates. The campaign game ends when the Axis were driven out of the &lsquo;western desert,&rsquo; Cyrenaica and Egypt, December, 1942; other ending date may be selected. Players assume the role of the ground commanders trying to outperform their historical counterparts with the focus on the operational aspects. You plan and execute the sweeping maneuverers or head-first assaults. You have to make some of the same choices, do you press ahead in the hopes of a quick victory or pause to establish your line of supply? &#10;You will be bedeviled by the same problems, supply, the need to rest and refit, terrain, and, sometimes, your own superiors. Victory is achieved by eliminating the other player&rsquo;s units from the region, delaying the opponent&rsquo;s advance, or inflicting more casualties and taking few casualties than historically occurred.&#10;&#10;A design aspect is toward playability in a reasonable table space within a manageable time commitment. The game map is 22&rdquo; by 48,&rdquo; at a scale of 12.5 miles or 20 kilometers per hex and encompasses the territory from the border between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, Libya, in the west to just east of el Algheila, near the outskirts of Alexandria. Each game turn represents 2 months of calendar time. Unit sizes are generally regiments for the Axis and brigades for the Allies. An 11 turn campaign, from Mar/Apr 41 to Dec 41, game takes between 8 to 12 hours.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Heroes of Tersia is a lightweight game in a fantasy setting that can be played either cooperatively (1-5 players) or competitively leave (2-5 players).  It uses cards, dice, and damage counters with no game board.  Some RPG elements are involved - equipping items for upgrades, dice-based combat, actions, etc.&#10;&#10;To win, players must either defeat the boss Shayd or equip the 3 pieces of the Dragon Armor.  Shayd can be engaged at any time, but players need some great equipment to stand a chance.  And the pieces of the Dragon Armor can be found in the Treasure players loot from Monsters.&#10;&#10;Players take turns and on each player's turn, they can Equip new treasure and Recharge their Action cards.  They then can move to a new area or remain where they are, and finally they will attack a Monster.  If the Monster is still alive, it will retaliate against the player.&#10;&#10;Combat is decided with simple dice rolls with Attack and Defense augmented by equipment or actions.  When a Monster is defeated, players who are in combat with the Monster roll dice (augmented with the Loot stat) to see how much Treasure they receive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Too many winters have come and gone and the scent of wolf on the air is undeniable. The clearing ahead could provide much-needed food, but it's best not to linger. As his path leads closer to the edge of the forest, a pair of unseen eyes shine in the moonlight following each step, aware of the large antlers. She&rsquo;s low and down wind, invisible to the lumbering elk. The rest of the pack draws near waiting for her lead. There&rsquo;s danger in such a large prize but hunger drives every decision. Now is the moment. Another howl rises.&#10;&#10;The Wild North is a two-player asymmetric game simulating the everyday struggle between predator and prey in the northern Rocky Mountain ranges. Whether you&rsquo;re a herd of elk searching for greener pastures or the wolf pack after the scent of a straggler, each player will feel the tense conflict that arises when these species clash. Survival is at stake.&#10;&#10;A game is played over three rounds called years and each year is made up of four phases called seasons. Within each season prey and predators will play cards and work towards survival by increasing their range. At the end of each year range is determined and whichever species has the largest range after the third year wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Coldest Winter is a card-driven block wargame about the military conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland between November 1939 and March 1940. The conflict is better known as the Winter War as it happened during an extraordinarily cold winter.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes military operations on a strategic level using block game pieces to obscure the information on the block labels to simulate the fog of war.&#10;&#10;The game also has a political layer to reproduce the international atmosphere as the eyes of the world were fixed on the war. Both nations must keep an eye on their Morale status as if it falters, it may hinder their number of actions per turn.&#10;&#10;In addition, Finland has to manage its dwindling resources as it was not prepared for a full scale Soviet offensive after just a few decades after the nation gained its independence and fought a civil war. The Soviet military on the other hand was not prepared to encounter such fierce resistance and to fight in such harsh weather and terrain. The Soviet Union has to reform its military to readjust to these matters.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around two unique 45 card command decks, one for each player. Each command card has an event and command point value to activate units and perform strategic actions. Both players also have two special unique decks of 5 cards to represent the international support for Finland and the reformed military approach for the Soviet Union. Both special decks contain what-if scenarios in addition to historical course of events.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The players can also use penguin (hindrance) tokens to make other prey cards sink more easily so that the one they want does not sink.&#10;&#10;After the 4th hunting is over, each player gets VPs equal to the value on the remaining two prey cards multiplied by the number of their polar bear tokens on them.

Players will earn points based upon how well balanced their orchestra is between &quot;L&quot; (left) and &quot;R&quot; (right); private goals (such as having at least 2 French Horns to the right of the Conductor); and instrument specific goals (such as 4 points for each Bass card, but 0 points if a player has the most Bass cards).&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The first is the player phase in which players launch and manoeuvre their rockets as well as conducting an action at their base. Once all players have had their turns the second phase is to move the planets and the landed/orbiting rockets.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player with the most points. These can be earned by completing achievements, where the number of points corresponds to the advancement of a player's space agency, or through completion of specific missions which can be collected throughout the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Only players with scoring markers on each board will gain its payout, but that won't stop the other players from using cards that alter it!&#10;&#10;Euclio is played over three game rounds that involve drafting cards, playing them to manipulate the boards and claim scoring opportunities, and finally scoring the boards themselves. Players can enter into pseudo alliances with players who share their scoring boards, while other players may play (or withhold) cards that hamper your plans.&#10;&#10;By only using a subset of the scoring boards, every game will be different as the boards determine what suit cards are in play with varying effects. Even among the same boards, their arrangement changes scoring timings for even more strategic variety!&#10;&#10;Simple rules make game-play itself very straightforward: on your turn either play a card face up for its effect, or face down to lay claim with a scoring marker. It's important to set your scoring markers on the most lucrative spaces before they run out of room, but doing so reduces your control, as without unused scoring markers, you must play cards face up for their effects, even if they help your opponents, and the earlier you commit your scoring markers, the less certain you can be about the final state of each scoring board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Backstory&#10;&#10;In the beginning there was darkness, all-encompassing, complete darkness. A black hole that hungered to consume everything. This darkness is called Demogargano. But there was also light, glimmering and blinding, known to man as God. Existing separate from each other until by chance, or fate, they collided stealing energy from each other creating a new existence. Life blossomed, evolved, and thrived. Like two sides of a coin the light and dark coexisted and influenced man. As time went by the light created Hell as a means to quarantine evil caused by the darkness. Lucifer&rsquo;s fight with God and his ultimate exile resulted in his right to rule Hell.&#10;&#10;Lucifer enjoyed his rule for a millennia until he started to sense the rise in darkness and the existence of Demogargano. After having visons of Demogargano he experienced fear for the first time and left the Golden Bastille in Hell to go into hiding. With his absences many saw the opportunity to seize the power of Hell and three factions were formed. The order of the Devil lead by Belial, seeks to preserve Lucifer&rsquo;s rule for his eventual return, maintaining the power structures as they are. The Council of Hate consists of the armies and legions of hell, military class demons, ruled by Beelzebub. The Council of Hate seeks to bring order to the chaos of Hell no matter the cost, but they also want to destroy Lucifer&rsquo;s legacy and shift the balance of power. The Horde are the embodiment of chaos and pandemonium. They are ruthless, mindless demons who want to overrun Hell and destroy everything in their path. Astaroth is the only one that can control them and keep their bedlam at bay.  Baal, a powerful sorcerer, and second in command of the Horde, turns on Astaroth and casts a spell banishing him to another dimension.&#10;&#10;Lilith, the queen of Hell and estranged wife of Lucifer, senses that Astaroth has vanished and she fears the Horde will over run Hell with Baal at the helm. She finds Baal and challenges him to a battle to the death and wins. By doing so she left the Horde with no leaders, in turn granting them greater power and increasing Demogargano&rsquo;s grip on the world. Lilith could travel through dimensions but she could not sense or locate Astaroth from Baal's spell.  In that moment, Demogargano&rsquo;s presence strengthened and Lilith is seized by the same visions that Lucifer suffered. In effort to preserve Hell and stop Demogargano from destroying everything, she forms the HellBringers. They are a rag tag group of demons, men, creatures, mercenaries, wizards, cyborgs, and the most bad ass pug ever. They are tasked with stopping Demogargano and raising a little hell along the way.  (The story continues in HelllBringers #0, which can be found in the Art of Mark May Volume 1)&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;HellBringers is a card game stemming from the HellBringers first appearance in comics back in 2015 which can be found in the &quot;The Art of Mark May Volume 1&quot;.  Since then the universe has grown to not only include a wide range of intriguing and powerful characters. The villains are what make HellBringers unique.  Set in deep culture and a plethora of mythologies from around the world, HellBringers brings characters from all walks of existence.&#10;&#10;The full 52 card deck comes with 42 characters to introduce you to the HellBringers universe and 10 special weapons cards for multipliers to help you with those BOSS battles! There are 3 ways to play #HellBringers!  Gauntlet Mode, Survivor Series Mode, (Both due in August) and the Game Board mode coming in October!&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;You need two dice, a paper pad, and something to write with to keep track of hit points.  To enhance the hellish experience, 2 skull dice are included with the full game with mat if you buy that reward option. The cards themselves have SILVER FOIL on the front to make everything shiny! Oh....shiny!  Fun to look at. Cards have 6 stat categories that make up a character&rsquo;s total hit points.  The game is played by rolling the dice and using total rolls to take off hit points as an attack. There are weapons cards that act as multipliers and every time you roll doubles it means something different.  Can you get through the first battle of gauntlet or map mode?  Are you ready to bring hell upon your enemies?&#10;&#10;Here are the rules for the game!&#10;&#10;There are three ways to play HellBringers. Survivor Series (Card deck needed only), Board Game mode, or Gauntlet mode (Card deck needed only)&#10;&#10;First take out any card with a 666 or 000 attached to it and put it in separate pile for later. Here are the rules for doubles and the categories for stats.&#10;&#10;Rolling Doubles:&#10;&#10;     1&rsquo;s Into the Snakes Eyes : Instant kill&#10;     2&rsquo;s Double Deuces: Restart battle (All HP reset)&#10;     3&rsquo;s The Tribus &ndash; Attack is 3 times what you roll for the next attack roll. &#10;     4&rsquo;s The Four Highwaymen Cometh &ndash; Choose a card from the deck to help you attack for the rest of the battle. This card cannot be attacked by opponent and will be put back in deck after battle. Do not get to keep for future battles. &#10;     5&rsquo;s The Five have Risen &ndash; Gain back ALL HP&#10;     6&rsquo;s One More to Summon Him &ndash; Roll again , If you can roll a 6 on either dice than you summon Demogargano to fight for you for the rest of the battle. &#10;&#10;&#10;Stat Categories:&#10;&#10;     Evil Within&#10;     Magic&#10;     Durability&#10;     Strength&#10;     Fighting Ability&#10;     Intelligence&#10;&#10;&#10;All categories are added up for total HP of any character.&#10;&#10;Survivor Series mode:&#10;&#10;2 players draw 6 cards a piece. One each until 6 are laid out. They then use 2 dice to roll and determine how much an attack has taken of their opponents HP (Health Points). Overall HP is determined by the combined total of the stat categories on the back of the card. The attack is subtracted from that total number until it reaches zero in which case the opponent is defeated. A notepad is suggested to keep up with HP and attack subtractions. In Survivor Series mode you face off 6 vs. 6 and you can choose to attack anyone in the deck for your turn. Once the card for the opponent is eliminated he goes into a defeated card pile. This continues until the player has defeated all of his opponents cards. The player then gets to revive any fallen cards he may have endured as well as the opponents cards and choose any 6 out of them to proceed forward to fight Demogargano. However, before you do that you must first draw a weapon card from the deck of the weapons cards. Weapons cards act as multipliers for attacks which you will need against Demogargano who will vastly out number you in HP. You also now get your 7th member of your team to help you defeat Demogargano. This is where you will roll one dice. If you get a 1 you get the &ldquo;Bum Jesus&rdquo; card, if you get a 2 you get the Norgren card, if you get a 3 or 4 you get Attila, and finally, if you get a 5 or 6 you get Astaroth. These cards feature different results. Norgren, Attila, and Astaroth all have 666 in one stat category making their total HP brought to the group a welcome asset and required in order to defeat Demogargano as he has 3 over 666 categories. Bum Jesus who you will receive if you roll a one has a 000 stat category making him able to sacrifice himself in order to defeat Demogargano without even rolling the dice. Meaning if you roll a 1 with the dice you win the game instantly.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two people or by yourself battling yourself to see who goes to fight Demogargano.&#10;&#10;Gauntlet Mode:&#10;&#10;In Run the Gauntlet mode the game play of HellBringers is the same except that when you and your opponent draw your first cards you instantly battle them. When the opponent&rsquo;s card is defeated you will then put that card in a separate pile for later. The player then keeps the card with the battle damage of HP that was suffered from the battle. The opponent then draws another card and the battle damaged card from before fights that card. Both players get 6 cards in total and they battle this way until no cards are left for the opponent. The player then chooses 6 cards from his pile and the defeated pile to fight Demogargano and the rules are the same as Survivor Series for the final battle. See above.&#10;&#10;Board Game Version:&#10;&#10;Players rolls one dice.  Player moves spaces until reaching weapons card pick up slots, team builder slots, and also battle zones. Players have the option of killing player and gaining double attack or having player join their team in the battle zones. Weaker players would be a reason you would kill of a player in order to double your attack. At this point you are choosing the bolster your attack rather gain HP of total team. Weapons cards act as modifiers. Team building is the goal of the board along with minor battles before you make it to the end of the game where you fight Demogargano.  Unlike the card deck game version, you do not have the option of rolling for a special character at the end.  You must make up your team as you go and if you are defeated in battle you have to start over.  Game is 1-3 players and you can play by yourself as you just need to roll for the opponent as well during battles.  During battles doubles mean the same as in regular card deck versions of the game.&#10;&#10;Amazing Contributing Artist&#10;&#10;Incredible art from the likes of Mark May, Marat Mychaels, Bob Camp, Chris Giarrusso, Ed Smith, Sean Forney, Steven Pulawa, Ryan Kincaid, Phil Spaulding, Cara Nicole, Brady Overstreet, Rick Lozano, Russ Casseday, and Sara Frazetta (Her first published work, granddaughter of the GOAT Frank Frazetta)!

Osa travels for the village, acquires various resources, and develops new technologies.&#10;&#10;First, decide the destination. As Osa can only walk towards the destination, he needs to think and decide enough. &#10;Next step will of course walk. In the middle of the market, we will acquire various resources and pay new resources. &#10;Once you get to the destination, it's a score. Depending on the distance from your village, the higher you get the better score. After that, we return to the village, decide a new destination, and the next journey begins.&#10;&#10;The map is made by combining nine boards. This combination requires a different strategy each time. In addition, because the action that can be done varies depending on the location of the village, you have to think of the strategy under the conditions different from other players. This asymmetry is also one of the features.&#10;&#10;",
