In the first one, player A is the &quot;builder&quot;, player B the &quot;killjoy&quot;, in the second round they change roles.&#10;The &quot;builder&quot; begins drawing one die at random and throwing it. His task is it now, to stack the dice on the four squares, building towers as high as possible. There is only one rule for building: the letters of the next die on the stack must be further in the alphabet. The killjoy at his turn draws another die at random and throws it, but is trying to keep the towers low. It is free to both, on which of the four fields they put the die.&#10;If it is impossible to put a die, the player can take the upper die of one tower away and lay it beside, so he can put the drawn one on the top. Therefore he should remember the letter on the die under the topmost.&#10;&#10;The game ends after thirteen draws and the towers are counted: each tower counts the square of the number of dice it consists of: 25 for a tower 5 dice high, 16 for 4 ...&#10;After two rounds the player with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;The Name &quot;Jenaer Turm&quot; is derived from a real tower in Jena, Germany, which is 26 stories high.

    "Description": "Up to four players start from one corner of a square board to bring six figures into the middle of the board. There is the den of the &quot;Robber Hotzenplotz&quot;, a figure well known in Germany from a bestselling children`s book. Every player has his own way from &quot;home&quot; to the &quot;den&quot;, equally laid out, and at first sight without any interaction or connection.&#10;&#10;But:&#10;&#10;Instead of dice there is a turning plate UNDER the board. On your way some of the points you walk on are holes in the upper board. So, if you step onto one of those, your figure stands on the plate underneath. Now is the time to turn the plate and watch: Is your figure falling into the trap (the box), because the plate has a hole at the same place, or does it keep standing?&#10;Through the same turning mechanism numbers change in small window-like holes, telling each player how far he is allowed to go.&#10;One more point: Figures you jump over just don`t count. So, if you jump, you go one step further.&#10;&#10;The first figure reaching the den gains six points, the second five, the third and fourth four and so on. The winner is the player with the most points in the end.&#10;&#10;Looks like a pure game of luck, but the step on a hole also changes the numbers for the other players. There are more twists you have to think of (e.g. a shortcut through the dark wood etc.), so for young children this can be the gate to &quot;tactics&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot;: Is  my advantage worth the risk? And in which order shall I draw my figures? Because of the &quot;jumped over doesn`t count&quot;-rule, there are smart and dumb actions! And the winner is winning because of scoring points, not only, because he was the first!&#10;&#10;Absolutely rare game and predecessor of euro-game-mechanics for young kids from the late sixties.&#10;&#10;",

This entry in the BGG database serves for the myriad versions and themes used in E-Sugoroku, which include religion, travel, theater and more.&#10;The earliest mentions of E-Sugoroku are of Pure Land Sugoroku, where the objective of the game is to reach the Pure Land, the Buddhist Western paradise. In the 17th Century, E-Sugoroku became popular with beautiful art on boards depicting the journey from Kyoto to Edo, or scenes of famous Kabuki actors. A second wave of popularity occurred in the 19th Century, after the Meiji Restoration, at which time it also became more of a children's game. Today, E-Sugoroku sets feature contemporary themes and can be found in toy-stores and 100-yen shops. &#10;A feature of E-Sugoroku is that dice rolls do not always translate into the same number of steps. Instead, progress from one step to the next could be made only by rolling specific numbers, or different numbers could indicate different paths to be taken.&#10;E-Sugoroku should be distinguished from Ban-Sugoroku (BGG entry at Sugoroku), a game with an earlier origin and which is more akin to Backgammon. The generic term Sugoroku literally means 'double six' and is applied to board games that use dice.&#10;&#10;Reference: Masukawa Koichi, Scenic Views: E-Sugoroku. In: Asian Games: The Art of Contest.

    "Description": "&quot;Rrrum um's Eck!&quot; or &quot;Rrround the Corner!&quot;&#10;&#10;Over the years Spielbox magazine has published some great games in its magazine. Usually they are originals by well-known authors that have appeared nowhere else, and at times they were so good that they were later appeared in full-on productions. Sometimes they were welcome reprints of highly regarded and hard to get games (3m's Jati). Exactly what prompted the republication of this old German children's game is better left the mystery it is, as there is very little remarkable about it. Maybe it was a great game by 1931's standards, but the German market by 1986 should have left a game like this in a corner best forgotten.&#10;&#10;It is what can be typified as a Snake-and-Ladders game without the ladders, or 1-pawn Ludo with traps in which the prettiest girl may start. Players make their way with a single pawn from start to finish along a track of 6 rows, each 7 spaces long. The last square (on each row end before turning the corner) is a trap. When a player's pawn lands in one of those traps it will be sent back to square one, but not before a 6 is rolled to release the pawn from the trap. The only quicker way to start all over again is when another player lands in the same trap, because any player ending a move on another pawn's square sends that pawn back to the very beginning. Can it get worse? Yes, by landing in the last trap, because you get an immediate &quot;mercy&quot; die roll. A 6 means instant victory, any other number rolled will mean permanent removal from the game.&#10;&#10;Maybe it was a reminder how far German game design had progressed in the 55 years since 1931. Saying that, it probably takes some considerable skill to make a game that is worse than Snakes-and-Ladders into a classic that warrants a reprint in one of Germany's most respected game magazines. What were they thinking.&#10;&#10;Publishing history: this classic German family game can be traced back all the way to 1931 and appears to have been in print for a while. Much later it was reprinted by Spielbox magazine (4/1986 Aug-Sep) as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. It was presented with the original artwork and with an exact replica of the original rules.&#10;&#10;",

There are two types of roles for the players, either Chemical Companies or Merchant Bankers (with about one third of the players being Merchant Bankers). All players rolls two six sided dice and move their marker along the track that many steps, paying rent to the owner or buying the property if it is not owned.&#10;&#10;The Merchant Bankers usually acts as bankers and loan money to the Chemicals Companies, at terms that are up to the players to negotiate, but can own some properties (Pipelines and Transport Companies). The Chemical Companies can own Chemical Plants, of which there are six types, including the special &quot;Steam Crackers&quot; that enhance the other plants, but not Transport Companies and Pipelines.&#10;&#10;Any player can take loans from the game's bank, the International Bank, when buying properties or developing a property but only up to 50 % of the needed amount and always at 20 % interest. If any player needs more money or there is a need for money when the player have to pay for the rent of a property, a board meeting requires money or the taxes are due, then that player may negotiate a loan with any of the Merchant Bankers (up to 80 % of the required sum, but at any interest rate and terms the players agree upon).&#10;&#10;Apart from properties the game board consists of Board Meetings (when the player might gain or loose money), taxation and income.&#10;&#10;When a player cannot pay, not even by selling property to some other player or by taking a loan, then that player becomes bankrupt and a special meeting is held among the creditors. The purpose of this meeting is to strike a deal where each creditor gains as much as possible and at the same time the bankruptcy is prevented. If such an agreement cannot be reached, the player is bankrupt and is eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;",

If basic navigation wasn't tricky enough, approaching any bit of rock that sticks out of the water somewhere, inevitably means being lured towards your death by the mesmerizing singing of a local hair-combing siren. Loreley, sitting on her rock, surrounded by the Rhine, is one of the more famous ones, and the German mythology is brought to life in this simple family game. Getting your boatmen from the boats surrounding the rock to the safety of the Loreley rock and reaching the fair maiden itself is what this game is all about.&#10;&#10;Loreley sits on top of her rock in the center of the board, dutifully combing her hair. The Loreley rock is surrounded by 32 boats, and each boat has room for two to four boatmen. Players will first have to get all their 12 boatmen onto these boats, before the race to the top of the rock starts in earnest, by moving boatmen from the boats onto the rock itself. There are four tracks on the rock, one for each player's color, and all are exactly 11 spaces long. When a player places the 12th boatman on the rock Loreley is reached and that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players start with 2 of their boatmen already placed on seats in the boats. By rolling the dice, these boatmen are moved from boat to boat. When a boatmen lands on a boat that already contains sailors, that player can place as many new sailors onto empty seats on the board as there are present in that boat before landing on it. You can't land (or place) in boats that are fully occupied. When all of a player's sailors are in boats already, instead of bringing a certain amount of new boatmen into play, that player can start to remove that same amount of sailors onto the rock and when someone's last sailor is moved from the boats to the rock, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game needs 3 or 4 players to work, and is mainly aimed at families with children around 7-9 years old.&#10;&#10;Publication history: this game first appeared in a full production with Pelikan in 1973. &quot;Altmeister&quot; Rudi Hoffman's return to the game industry after a long illness was celebrated by the republication of his family classic by Spielbox magazine (5/1986 oct-nov), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. The graphics of both publications are showing their age.&#10;&#10;",

The players try to catch him and the pieces first.&#10;There are four figures walking along square fields, in which the board (looking like a landscape)is divided. The Hotzenplotz-figure is independent from a single player. It walks after all four players rolled their dice and walks along a spiral way from the outside to his hiding place, crossing the squares. He always walks to and fro, stealing another piece of cake and gets it to his hiding place.&#10;If he comes to a square with one of the four figures on it, he captures it. But if the players manage to place two figures on the square with the robber (otherwise it is forbidden to place two figures on one place!), then he is captured in prison and the piece of cake saved. Of course, the robber starts from the prison right away again to steal more ...&#10;There are different variants, making it easier or more difficult for the players to reach the goal of saving four pieces and winning the game together.&#10;Nice co-operative game for the youngest gamers, starting discussions after every dice-roll where the figures should walk.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An abstract game for 2 or 4 players, played on a 7x7 grid, where players try to move their own playing pieces onto the start positions of the opposing player. First player to do so wins. A game can end prematurely when a player manages to capture all stones from the other player(s), or when all other players had to resign from the game because there was no legal move available in their turn.&#10;&#10;There are 16 stones in play. Each player owns 4 stones, and the remainder are neutral. In a 4 player game there is an added twist as each player shares 2 of the 4 stones with other players. One with the player on the left, the other with the one on the right.&#10;&#10;In the starting positions, all stones are isolated. Each turn a player can move a friendly or neutral stone the same way as the knight jumps in chess (two straight and one sideways in all directions). Initially, for as long as there are isolated pieces on the board, each piece has to jump to a space neighboring at least one other (a diagonal connection doesn't count). This way smaller and bigger groups will form, and this has to continue until all pieces form one single chained group. Once a group has been established, it is not allowed to break it up again, so after each jump there has to be a single chain present. It is also forbidden to move a neutral stone immediately after it has just been moved.&#10;&#10;As soon as there are no isolated stones or groups left, &quot;owned&quot; pieces can be captured by landing on them. Neutral pieces can never be taken. A player wins when all his remaining pieces have reached their target, so losing a stone or two might not be a bad tactic.&#10;&#10;A clever use of the knight's move, and the ability to capture pieces, coupled with the restriction to maintain a single group makes this far more than yet another Halma-variation.&#10;&#10;Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (1/1986 Feb-Mar) as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. It later showed up again on the 2002 G&ouml;ttingen Spieleautorentreff, where game designers meet to showcase their self-published inventions, in a wooden version with colored film-spool-lids as playing pieces. As far as I can tell S&ouml;ncke's Iuvo has only ever been published in Spielbox magazine and it also remains his only published game to date (2006).&#10;&#10;",

Each player gets 6 little balls (called Clickets) with magnets inside them. four of the balls are bi-colored, so you can tell which end is which.

There's a nifty wooden board with a grid of 3X4 shallow depressions. The game is simplicity itself - take turns placing a Clicket. If you cause two or more Clickets to click, you have to take them back.

    "Description": "From the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;An introduction to an ageless game with a 20th century pace. The game of chess is simple. It is difficult only if you make it so. And Crescendo Chess is as simple as regular chess. It is played by the same rules. The chess men move the same. A full set of rules and instructions that completely cover Crescendo Chess are included. After several moves, you then enter into the exciting world of mobility, power, and cunning. Compounding the power and mobility of the chess pieces accelerates the game and sharpens one's perception of the effects of combining different pieces. Thus one gains a broader insight and a better appreciation of this game. Because of this, Crescendo Chess enhances regular chess.&#10;&#10;&quot;Crescendo Chess is a new experience for any chess player. By following the rather simple rules, one can soon learn to think in terms of stacking, capturing and position playing. One important feature in Crescendo Chess is that the chess men have a hole on top and one on the bottom that permits pegging one piece atop another. When this is done, it is called &quot;stacking.&quot; A stack of chess men can then move across the board together. One soon learns not to exhaust the stack ineffectively. Experience teaches how to take advantage of the best stacking arrangements for certain types of attack and defense.&quot;&#10;&#10;In one turn the stack moves first as the bottom piece normally would move as in regular chess, then continues as the next piece up would move, etc. It costs one turn to place a piece on a stack. On the next turn, the stack can make its move (see rule8). To give an example, a Knight can be placed atop a Bishop in one turn. Then, on a later turn, the two together would move the permissible diagonal move of the Bishop and the two together could continue, one - one, two, as the Knight would move.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is important that in stacking, the pieces are moved into the stack using their regular move, - that is, a Bishop diagonally, a Rook forward or sideways, etc. Each piece must be free to make its move as in regular chess rules.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Crescendo Chess is so called because it starts as regular chess and then increases in intensity. As stated, the first two moves by each player are made on a regular basis. After that, the next four moves by each player may be made where one piece is stacked on top of another to a two level height.Max. (L2). NOTE: See Glossary &amp; Game Notations at end of rules. It is not necessary to stack the pieces if the player does not wish to do so.&#10;&#10;Upon completion of a total of six moves by each player, the pieces may be stacked to a three level height. Max. (L3). This is the stacking limit for the rest of the game. The three can move first as the bottom piece, which then remains, then as the other two would move as a two piece stack.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Balls in the living room, trains in the kitchen, bears in the bedroom. Look, I found the blocks! Can you be the first to collect all of the toys you need for your toy box? So many toys to find. Good thing it was so easy to find this great game!&quot;&#10;&#10;As usual - great quality components from Ravensburger. The box itself becomes the gameboard, as the floor and wall components insert nicely into the base. Wonderful colors will keep kids interested in this fun little memory/set collecting game. Roll the die...move from room to room...turn over a tile...only keep that toy if you do not already have that toy. The first player to have a complete set of all 6 distinct toys wins!&#10;&#10;Sweet and simple. Just as we've come to expect from Ravensburgers' wonderful line of kid's games.&#10;&#10;Designed for ages 3-6.&#10;&#10;",

These are placed face up (easy) or face down (hard) in the play area.&#10;&#10;Two dice, one with 1/2/3 dots and the other with square/triangle/circle on the faces, are rolled.  The players must find the tiles that match the objects on their card corresponding to the intersection shown on the dice. Once found they put them on the card to complete the picture.&#10;&#10;Older children might enjoy having the tiles face down to add some memory challenge.&#10;&#10;",

Cartel is extremely similar to Monopoly in that you spin a spinner to move one to six spaces, visiting different countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, U.S.A.) on the board.  You may purchase properties in the different countries.  If you land on a country with an opponent's properties, you must pay rent to that player.  Some facets of Cartel that contrast it from Monopoly are as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each player may have houses in no more than five countries.&#10;     There are no blocks of properties:  Each country has one space on the board.&#10;     Once you land on a country space, you spin a spinner to determine whether you may build a house, may not build a house, or may build a house for free.&#10;     If you land on Try Your Luck, you spin the Lucky Spin spinner, and win money from the bank or lose money to the pool.  If your spin showed LUCKY POOL, you get the money in the pool.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Critter-Tek is a tongue-in-cheek stuffed animal parody of Battletech that was fully approved and licensed by FASA.  Instead of gigantic high tech robot mechs players construct mechanical TEKs that are powered by animals on treadmills with hamster powered gyros and paper mache armor.  Weapons include spit-wad blowguns, slingshots and left over fireworks.  In fact Critter-Tek uses all the standard Battletech rules and merely renames all the terminology to a furrier anthropomorphic animal genre.&#10;&#10;This game includes the RPG TEK-Warrior.&#10;&#10;USER NOTE:New elements, not include in standard Battlemech, such as subterranean movement for burrowing animals adds an new and interesting twist to a classic game.  This Beer &amp; Pretzel approach to Battletech was a great way to introduce game mechanics to fairly young gamers.  My sons played allot of Critter-Tek while in grade school.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "DIX PETITS INDIENS is a French game based on the murder mystery novel by Agatha Christie in which ten people on an island get murdered by 10 different methods.&#10;&#10;The game board represents the island with the locations of where the 10 bodies can be found.  The 10 characters are represented on 10 red cards and the 10 methods of death by&#10;10 blue cards. These are shuffled and placed face down on the 10 red and blue spaces on the outside of the board.&#10;&#10;When it is his turn a player can (and must) carry out one of the following three actions:&#10;&#10;1.    Simultaneously turn over one red and one blue card.  Look at their contents (in secret) and then return them face down to the spaces from which they came.&#10;&#10;2.    Move his playing piece along one yellow line to a neighboring black or red space.&#10;&#10;3.    Write down on a record sheet any information concerning the cards turned over in previous rounds.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is for players to work out where the matching red and blue cads are located and then move their playing piece to the appropriate location on the board to 'discover the body' (by turning over the two matching cards).  Successfully doing this earns the player one of 10 &quot;little Indians&quot;.  Making a mistake means the player loses his next two turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all 10 bodies have been discovered, with the winner being the player that discovered the majority of them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A baseball simulation game (not using actual players) with a 100-card deck for randomization. Defensive player positions players on the field and declares pitch to throw; offensive player turns over top card on deck; players match the batters hitting ability (lefty-righty; .100, .200, or .300 hitter) with pitch. Can be strike, ball, or ball hit into play to a particular square on the gameboard. The amount of squares closest to a positioned fielder and the type of hit determine the result of that batted ball, according to a Results Chart. Result changes on the back of the next card can change the first result (and provide unusual results). Pitch choices include fast, curve, knuckle, screw, off speed, splitter, and slider. Players can decide how many of each type of hitter they want, and can designate a starter, 3 relievers, and a closer to have certain pitcher advantages.&#10;&#10;Players can also elect to steal, try a pickoff, hit-and-run, or take an extra base on a hit. Certain pitchers can have a ball-strike advantage, and in two-strike situations, batters can try to outguess the pitcher by taking a pitch. Using a wind direction factor also is optional. When all 100 cards are played, players reshuffle the deck and start over.&#10;&#10;Game comes with 4-color game board, 100 result cards, Results Chart, Guidelines, one Hit Ball marker, four pitch-count markers, 14 wooden player pieces for each team including 5 pieces with colored tops representing pinch-hitters, and scoresheets.&#10;&#10;",

A-class ships move faster and carry more cargo, but cannot navigate the Suez or Panama Canals. The home port is important, because it counts as a permanent trade contract and many of the game functions can only be carried out there.&#10;&#10;During the game, players draw destination cards and cargoes, which can then be bought from the bank. Cargoes can only be sold in one of the destinations - each card has 3 to choose from. Players can also buy trade contracts for the ports, which brings in more profit when selling cargo there and forces other players to pay fees when visiting those ports. At the start of the game there's a basic profit for selling cargo; stock market fluctuations (event cards) may later change this.&#10;&#10;Movement at sea is by die rolling. A 1 or a 6 result in drawing an event card, which may be positive or negative and may affect other players also. &#10;Events include icebergs, hurricanes, carrying Royal Mail, competing for the Blue Ribbon prize, accidents, smuggling etc.&#10;&#10;A player that loses her ship or goes bankrupt must turn to piracy, at least temporarily. Piracy may be profitable, but also carries a score penalty at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players can also buy insurance to protect against losses, or convert cash into gold bullion which is safer from market fluctuations and other hazards.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as any player decides to end it by calling out &quot;Stand By&quot;. All players now make their way back to their home ports, where all their assets are converted back to cash; winner is the player who has amassed the biggest fortune by any means available in the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the first expansion for Descent.  It includes new monsters (with figures), heroes, treasures, effects, scenarios, props, and more!  It also features options for the Overlord player to customize his deck for each scenario.&#10;&#10;Deep in the bowels of the world, there lies a chasm that was sealed over a millennium ago. Within it lies a force of evil so great that, were it to be unleashed, it would plunge the world into a thousand years of darkness.&#10;&#10;Before you can face that challenge, however, you'll battle your way through dank tunnels, trapped temples, and even volcanoes to prove your worth. You'll face a host of new tricks, traps, and other lethal obstacles over the course of your quest, including scything blades, rolling boulders, and boiling hot lava.&#10;&#10;Descent: the Well of Darkness features six new heroes, tricky kobolds, bloodsucking ferrox, and unstoppable golems. Heroes will find more skill and treasures at their disposal, including six new relics and a new type of potion. The Overlord, on the other hand, gains the ability to customize his deck before every game, putting in devastating new trap, event, and spawn cards.&#10;&#10;",
