Its six recoilless guns fire in sequence, aimed at the same point thanks to a very advanced targeting system. The Marines&rsquo; Light Barking Dog is similar to the prototype tested by the Army, but has an open-topped turret for better vision and cross-country performance.

    "Description": "Thunder Upon the Water details the battle of Albemarle Sound fought on May 5th, 1864. Via the sound&rsquo;s numerous ports Confederate blockade runners brought badly needed supplies for the rebel nation. In April a Confederate army supported by the new ironclad CSS Albemarle, captured the Union held port of Plymouth. Encouraged by this success, Confederate General Robert Hoke planned an offensive to recapture the city of Bern, held by Union forces for nearly two years.&#10;&#10;Captain of the CSS Albemarle, James W. Cooke, steamed out to battle in afternoon of May 5th supported by two gunboats, the recently captured Union gunboat CSS Bombshell and the CSS Cotton Plant. The Confederate &ldquo;Mosquito Fleet&rdquo; ran into a Union squadron of eight gunboats, five of them new &ldquo;double ender&rdquo; side wheel steamers designed as rams to attack Confederate ironclads. The resulting battle was a classic of strength vs. numbers. The Union ships held off the Confederates, but both sides were severely bloodied. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?&#10;&#10;Each copy of Thunder Upon the Water is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    One 11 by 17 inch hex map sheet.&#10;&bull;    One sheet of 142 single-sided, un-mounted counters&#10;&bull;    One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet&#10;&bull;    One set of rules&#10;&#10;Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and resolve some game events. Players also use six and ten sided dice (one of each). Each turn represents 15 minutes of time. Each hex is a little more than 200 yards across. Each unit represents 1 warship. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Bruce Yearian.&#10;&#10;A supplemental card set for the game is also available. It replaces the standard deck of playing cards called for in the rules, feature graphics that compliment the game&rsquo;s, and has rules reminders on pertinent cards.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

There are different Lines of Formation on the pitch in which they can be situated (Goal, Defense, Middle-field, Attack) and begin play already on either the pitch&rsquo;s play zones or the Bench (not the player&rsquo;s hand). Cards engaged in the current action move into the Defense of the Attack Zones.&#10;All Play, Strategy and Foul Cards have an Energy cost to be paid with the use of Energy Cards, which are then Exhausted until the following turn. All resolved Play, Strategy and Foul Cards, as well as expelled Player Cards, are all sent to the Showers. Players from the Bench can be brought into play through the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo; Strategy Card or if a player&rsquo;s Player is Injured by one of the other player&rsquo;s Foul Cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is carried out in turns and each turn consists of five phases: 1) Energy, 2) Tactical Advise, 3) Attack or 4) Defense and 5) Taking a Shot.&#10;&#10;During these phases the players may sequentially:&#10;&#10;     either spend or regroup Energy or Player cards;&#10;     use their Strategy Cards;&#10;     select some Players and attack; or &#10;     use Strategy and Foul Cards to defend; and&#10;     Take a Shot for the goal, comparing Player defense and attack stats modified through dice roll to determine the success of the shot- if successful, they score a goal.&#10;&#10;&#10;- Penalties can happen on Phase 4) by annulling a Foul card with the Strategy Card &ldquo;Penalty&rdquo; or as a tie-breaker at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;As soon as one of the player&rsquo;s decks runs out the game is over and the player whose team converted the most goals is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Expand your territory by building forts in uncontested lands or by capturing enemy forts. Develop your economy by exploiting natural resources and trading with minor nation ports. Invest in technology for long-term strategic advantages. Recruit an army and build a fleet to protect your empire&rsquo;s interests and conquer what is rightfully yours!&#10;&#10;Begin the game by building a map out of the 20 unique land and 24 sea tiles which snap together for fast, stable assembly. Tiles feature 7 rare resources, which each provide a special bonus that will influence your strategy. This hex-based map will become the battlefield where you must position your armies tactically to threaten enemy forts while still defending your own. Battles involve revealing your army cards against your opponent&rsquo;s cards, and are resolved based entirely on the regiment composition and technological advantages &ndash; there are no dice or random draws, just imperfect information. Naval fleets provide strategic support to your armies, allowing you to quickly transport troops or even blockade your enemy&rsquo;s capital to try to starve their economy. Players are eliminated once their capital fort is conquered.&#10;&#10;While Sovereignty is primarily a competitive strategy game, it also features a more story-driven campaign mode for solo/cooperative play. Become Napoleon in his campaign to conquer Europe (and with enough skill, the world). Engage in historic battles against an automated opponent, driven by behavior cards that react to your decisions. Each province you capture on the world map provides benefits for future battles, so you gain strength between each game you play.&#10;&#10;Sovereignty was designed to be relative quick to learn, but difficult to master. The modular map, rare resources, and technology systems all result in a large diversity of strategies, so every game is unique. The artwork and thematic elements are all designed to provide an immersive experience, so you really can feel like you are building and growing an empire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

During the game players choose missions with low, medium or high risk/reward, and move on a network of roads using dice. Players can buy helpful items such as a punch card for access to a safer and shorter route, nitro for additional speed, and a trailer for moving more cargo pr. run. Speed is key to outrun the police, and to reclaim stolen cargo/money from hijackers. There's also items for bribing both police and customs personnel, a possibility otherwise determined by dice. The more beaten up a car is the more it increases the chance of getting noticed at the border, so outer damage should be fixed when possible at a repair shop. Damage to the vehicle or cargo, finding extra money, and many other good or bad situations are determined by dice, as well as cards with thematic and often comical descriptions. After 4 rounds consisting of 30 turns each, the smuggler with the largest fortune on a secret bank account is the winner!&#10;&#10;The game's retro-style isn't only due to its late 80's setting, but also because both game-play and components (one-colored cards and tokens) are in line with a release from a simpler era in board games. Such homages are often seen in electronic games, so instead - here's one in board games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Gamers fly historical Allied and Axis warplanes in fast and furious dogfights, fighting for control of the sky on a Dogfight Display, using aircraft counters that are maneuvered into position by playing cards.&#10;&#10;The key to winning is having positional Advantage over your opponent during play. Each plane is authentically rated in a two-player version with six short campaign game scenarios. The extended Example of Play will have you flying in no time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each card has two sides, and every card will be used twice per round (one on each side) before moving to the zombie phase - and the order in which the cards get used will determine how the zombies react and interact on the map.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;This 9-card game published by Button Shy pits you and one or two other players in an area control game against each other... and zombies.

A Unit in the game does not necessarily equal a particular organizational unit, formation in the field, or a specific number of soldiers. Each base is a representation of force, and as such issues such as the size of one battalion, regiment, brigade, or squadron should be set aside. The player should concern himself with tactics such as troop placement, command access, gun placement and terrain features. The goal is to recreate the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the period, not necessarily every detail of it.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is a social deduction game where there's more to do than just figure out who is on the other team, you also need to strategize to stop them!&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game will have the players collectively trying to start or prevent a ritual from taking place. The leader of the ritual will determine which one to attempt This is done by contributing different components to the ritual that will either aid or hinder its attempted effect. Be careful though! Too many failed ritual attempts can have another bad effect.&#10;&#10;Each ritual slightly alters the fabric of reality, and can change how the game itself plays. Some rituals will make future rituals easier to pass, while others will give certain players new abilities and things that they can do. Between this and different Great Old Ones, no two play-throughs will be the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Collect cargo, load it onto your train, then send off the train to score points based on the market values of the cargo at the time. Lower the values of your opponent's cargo while keeping what is on your own train high, upgrade your locomotive to pull longer trains, steal and sabotage, and choose a route to send your train along to score bonus points.&#10;&#10;Trains &amp; Cargo is a strategic, casual board game for 2-4 or 6 players, individually or in teams. There are two types of locomotives, eight types of cargo (coal, timber, corn, cars, steel, food, cattle and passengers) and three Route Boards that you can claim to score bonus points.&#10;&#10;Each turn you may choose to either play cards from your hand, upgrade your locomotive, or to send off your train to score points for the cargo it holds. There are three types of cards and you may play up to one of each type on any given turn: Cargo Cards to collect cargo from a central bank, Market Cards to increase or decrease the values of specified cargo, and Effect Cards with various text-based abilities.&#10;&#10;Things to consider when playing Trains &amp; Cargo include what cards to combine for maximum effect, how long to wait until you send off your train, if you should wait for a specific route to become available or choose a different path, and more. The game is entirely free of play money which means that getting a head start early on does not mean a certain win - you are limited by the cards in your hand, not the money in your bank.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Here the railways came late (in 1900) so that explains the name of the game. You can call it 18Born if you don't like the pun.&#10;&#10;Two, three, or four players represent investors in railroad companies, spending their initial capital to purchase shares in railway companies. The companies, each controlled by the largest shareholder, build track and run trains to earn revenue. These can be paid out as dividends to shareholders to retained to fund further track and trains. A key feature of 1899+1, as with all other games in the series, is that the interest of the President and the interest of the shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful with their investments. Being a President is not without its difficulties, either; bailing out an insolvent company is the sole responsibility of its President.&#10;&#10;1899+1, while short by standards of other members of the series, is a fairly long game. Experienced players can expect to take up to three hours to complete a game.&#10;&#10;",

At level two, some resources are scarcer and some players have a smaller supply, so one-to-one trades may not be sufficient to complete cards.  At level three, there are not enough resources for all players to complete their cards, so competition for some resources may be fierce!&#10;&#10;",

With her father being one of the rare pilots in her home country, Sarnai learned to fly at an early age. A natural talent, she started flying between her hometown and Irkutsk, carrying love letters, precious merchandises and shady characters. When her country officially joined the war effort against Axis powers, she then joined the newly formed Mongolian Arat Squadron, in 1943. Her impressive skills soon proved to be invaluable and she was transferred to the 46th &ldquo;Taman&rdquo; Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment (the &ldquo;Night Witches&rdquo;). Accumulating an impressive score of victories, she was tasked to form the 179th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment that she now commands. It was the first unit to receive the &ldquo;Grom&rdquo; (thunder in Russian)in the Red Air Force. The Mil Mi-47Z &ldquo;Grom&rdquo; Tesla Assault Helicopter is the latest addition to the already impressive arsenal of the VVS. Quickly catching up with their German counterparts, the Soviet engineers have miniaturized their VK generator enough so they can fit inside the tight fuselage of an attack helicopter. This gives the aircraft a tremendous firepower, almost without equal on the planet. It takes incredible piloting skills to hit anything with Tesla guns from the air, but the results are devastating: the whole enemy aircraft shuts down, its controls (or pilot...) fried.&#10;&#10;This reference comes with three Dust 1947 unit cards.

    "Description": "Mystery Detective is a mystery solving party game that you can start playing almost as soon as you open the box.&#10;&#10;One player, the Chief, takes one of the 100 illustrated cards and reads it to himself. The front of the card has the mystery, the back the solution. Then he reads the front of the card to the players and shows them the illustration. The other players are the detectives. Singly and together, they try to solve the mystery by asking the Chief questions. But he can only answer Yes, No, Close, or Not Relevant.&#10;&#10;Here is a mystery:&#10;Title: Nasty Finish&#10;Excessive hurry led a man to a stinky situation.&#10;The picture on the card shows a man about to step into it.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s going on?&#10;&#10;The detectives discuss and try to form theories that can be proved or disproved by their questions:&#10;Is the man afraid? - no&#10;Did the man die? - yes&#10;Was he murdered?- no&#10;&#10;So it must have been an accident&hellip;&#10;&#10;Now we're getting somewhere&hellip;&#10;&#10;Bit by bit the detectives try to piece together the mystery. Often a question from one detective will give another an idea for a whole new line of questioning. There is no winner or loser but when you finally solve the mystery, you feel brilliant!&#10;&#10;The mysteries, while not all crimes, are morbid and twisted and often very funny. You need to discuss, question and think outside of the box in order to solve them. Great fun, you can play almost anywhere, anytime. In the car, at the dinner table or at a gathering, all are perfect for this co-cop mystery solving game.&#10;&#10;This volume contains 100 cases. &#10;For Black Stories fans, this second volume includes never before published in English, translations of Black Stories Funny Death and Black Stories Shit Happens.&#10;&#10;- description by the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It also has an array of radios to relay orders around the battlefield. Although part of a Command Squad, these men are very capable of taking the fight to the enemy. These are seasoned soldiers before anything else! With them come the formidable warrior that is Lieutenant Lara Walter. One of the deadliest Hero in the World of Dust, she greatly boosts the offensive capabilities of any Heavy Grenadier Squad.&#10;&#10;This reference comes with two Dust 1947 unit cards, for the Axis Bloc. Like all regular Dust 1947 miniatures, it comes already assembled and primed. It's ready for the battlefield, or for painting, as you wish! You can directly paint over on it, since the priming serves as an undercoat and is compatible with any type of paint.&#10;&#10;",
