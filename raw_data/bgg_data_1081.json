Over 120 infantry divisions alone were given Guards status during the war.&#10;Guards units were given better and more weapons, ammunition and vehicles than regular divisions. Guards divisions were sometimes reformed for various reasons. Some Guards units knew multiple formations during the war. These promotion rules replace the Soviet Union&rsquo;s Guards Infantry rules on the Soviet Union&rsquo;s National Reference Sheet in the Global War 1936 rules.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you&rsquo;ve played our Global War series, Axis &amp; Allies or similar games, this game will seem quite familiar to you as basic mechanics and turn structure of the game are similar.   However, there are many changes and new features that make this game unique to the era.&#10;&#10;For starters, The Great War is a strategic global (not a euro-centric) examination of the war.  The strategic concerns of many competing powers across the globe have been factored in to create a game that can have long-lasting ramifications.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The player with the highest valued hand collects the chips.&#10;&#10;Players start with 5 cards and use &quot;uno&quot; like rules to connect the cards into a party. Each card has a banner at its center that asks a requirement to be met before it adds value to your party.&#10;&#10;There are 2 different types of value that your party accrues. Levels which are the main tier of value, and Power which are secondary but still important.&#10;&#10;EX: The Warrior 4 card asks that you have 2 matching color cards in your party. If you meet the requirement the card grants 4 Power to your party&rsquo;s total value.&#10;&#10;A traditional round goes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     All players Ante or big/small blinds (Preference)&#10;     All players dealt 5 cards&#10;     Initial round of betting occurs.&#10;     Discard phase.&#10;     Final round of betting occurs.&#10;     Call.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

(Konnna Black na Maou Sama wa Iya Da!!) is a Japanese deck-building game. In English, the title translates as &quot;I Can't Stand Such Evil Satan!!&quot;. But the publisher offers &quot;Scout Monsters&quot; instead (although this is not on the published edition). The game can be played as a solitaire as well as a 2-4 player game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Scout Monsters is a deck-building card game whereby each player chooses their heroes and spells and fight to defeat monsters or have them join your team before they reach the final showdown against Satan.&#10;&#10;Unlike many deck-building games, the cards are not divided into &quot;treasure&quot; and &quot;point&quot; cards, making it more beginner-friendly. On the other hand, Satan's Attack card, designed to damage all the players' decks, promotes competition with skills and tactics between skilled players.&#10;&#10;In the 2- to 4-player games, the players race to defeat Satan. In the solo game, the player fights directly against Satan.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#139;&#177;&#233;&#155;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#145;&#170;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#191;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#230;&#167;&#139;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#232;&#136;&#172;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#230;&#167;&#139;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#139;&quot;&quot;&#233;&#135;&#145;&quot;&quot;&#227;&#129;&#168;&quot;&quot;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&quot;&quot;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#133;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#138;&#128;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#190;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#156;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#230;&#142;&#165;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

All players must move around the circle, following the direction given by Pooh. When the music stop, all players stop and listen to Pooh. Pooh will then name characters, equal to the number of players minus one. So if there are 3 players, Pooh will name off two characters. Players run to try and stand on one of the character circles named by Pooh. The player who is not standing on one of the characters named is eliminated.&#10;&#10;Remaining players continue playing another round. This time Pooh will name one less character.

It is an intellectually complex task for a child to count, not recite 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This game allows you to play with the colors, then gently bring the child to count the candles on the cards to learn how to count while having fun. Then the first tactics with the first special card: the Joker card.&#10;&#10;Forestia is an evolving game with the addition of special cards as the child evolves. At 6 or 7 years old, the child can play with all the cards.&#10;&#10;Note: it is possible to play up to 12 players with 2 boxes of Forestia.&#10;&#10;The ergonomics of the cards have been studied to allow to play with right-handers as left-handed. In addition each color is associated with only 1 symbol, which makes it easy to play with people with visual impairment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a victory condition, which are printed on certain cards. This means you must cast a spell that has a victory condition and then use your other spells to help you achieve that condition, while preventing your opponent from achieving theirs first.&#10;&#10;You get three willpower on your turn, which can be spent like action points to do things like draw and play cards. Spells are played face down, and remain that way until you manifest them. This gives you plenty of opportunities to bluff and outwit your opponent.&#10;&#10;Every card in your deck is unique and every card can be played as either a spell or as energy. The choices you make about which cards to play as energy and which ones to play as spells can have a massive impact on the outcome of the game.&#10;&#10;The core set comes with 150 cards, divided into 5 preconstructed decks. You can play with any of these decks, or build your own deck by combining any 30 Rezonite cards. There are no restrictions on which cards can go together, but think carefully about which energy types and victory conditions to include in your Rezonite deck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the Listening Booth, players will discard a magazine card with one matching icon to flip the 45 to its &quot;B-side&quot; giving the player more points and the opportunity to use the 45 to acquire LPs with similar attributes in future rounds. BI leverages the same collection rewards system (Pure, Mixed, Double Mixed) that comes in the base game and can be further integrated with Top Shelf, Publisher Expansion, Clearance Bin, or even the memorabilia from Masters of Metal!&#10;&#10;For 6 the new bands (Half &amp; Half, Lead Balloon, Scarabs, The What, Rolling Bones, Pink Fluid), the following is included in this expansion:&#10;&#10;     66 Magazine Cards&#10;     72 LP Album Cards&#10;     24 45s Cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The team consists of 4 Bloaters, 2 Pestigor and 6 Rotters.&#10;&#10;There are a host of extras in the kit &ndash; 2 turn markers, 2 double-sided score coins in the shape of Nurgle&rsquo;s icon and 4 balls &ndash; 2 of these are being chomped upon by a cheeky Nurgling, and 2 have&hellip; something&hellip; emerging from them, all gribbly teeth and eldritch horror. Supplied with 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases, a 1,000,000 GP roster and a Nurgle transfer sheet.&#10;&#10;description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

A two-player deduction game where each player takes turn making a limited number of guesses, using logic to deduce what word the opponent has hidden.&#10;&#10;One player secretly puts a five-letter word in the spaces behind a screen at once end of the game board. The other player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses. After each guess, the code maker uses pins to tell the code breaker if their guessed letters are the right letter in the right place (using a white pin), are the right letter but the wrong place (using a black pin), or are the wrong letter entirely (no pin is used). The code breaker makes another guess in the next row, building upon information from previous guesses, trying to match the letters (and word) the code maker hid at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;La Clave was inspired from Mastermind.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to win the race with your drone collecting as many Acceleration cards you can.&#10;&#10;In this period the military technologies become common and spread among civil people. Children and adults from every class of the society begin to build their own fighting drones in order to run in clandestine and official races. To achieve victory they are ready to do everything legal and illegal: there was no chance for pity or alliances, but only for the dangerous gadgets that drones equip.&#10;&#10;Speedrone: Fly or Die! it's a modular game: with a box you can play up to 5 players, with two boxes up to 10 and with 3 boxes up to 15 and so on. It's very simple and you do not need any extra components: the manual included in Speedrone - fly or die! - already contains everything you need to know.&#10;&#10;The game-play is very simple: every player acts in a specific order that changes during the game, draws cards and plays every cards he/she wants. Acceleration cards drive you to the victory, other cards like Shellfire force you to lose positions; many cards protect drones from the deadly gadgets of the game and other cards called Event tell you in which situation you are in that round. There are a lot of cards and a high combination of strategies in Speedrone.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players can pick from three healer classes with unique skills to keep their allies alive against tough boss battles.&#10;&#10;Turns have two phases: the boss phase and the healer phase. In the boss phase, players draw an action card from the boss's card deck. These cards can be attacks, summoned minions, or events of your party doing something stupid. These will cause your party to lose health.&#10;&#10;During the healer phase, you respond with the healing spell cards in your hand. From your standard Heal over Time spells and direct healing spells, to shields and resurrection spells, each of the three healer classes has plenty of tools to help restore your allies. Once spells are played, they go on a cooldown where you cannot use them for some time. An important facet of the strategy is thinking ahead to have the right spell ready at the right time.&#10;&#10;Keep your allies from dying (to the boss or to their own stupidity) and victory will be yours!&#10;&#10;Good luck.
