Each space the players move through has a small illustration and a short verse, describing what happens.&#10;&#10;The game is published to benefit &quot;Svenska typograff&ouml;rbundets invalid- och tuberkulosfonder&quot;, the Swedish typographer union's invalid and tuberculosis funds.&#10;&#10;",

The pyramid is then rotated a quarter turn so that each player faces a different side of the pyramid. On a player's turn, you use a magnetic wand on the surface to move a steel ball up through the maze on the back, toward the top of the pyramid. If the ball encounters a baffle, it's separated from the wand and drops to the bottom of the base. If a player is unsuccessful, the turn passes until on a subsequent turn someone successfully navigates to the top.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pop-A-Word is a word-forming dice game, self-contained in the familiar Kohner Pop-O-Matic mechanism.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, the tray containing nine letter cubes is popped and jiggled until lying flat in the center. The player then makes the highest-scoring word possible from the letters showing face-up, the score being the total of the point values on the letters used in the word. Letters cannot be used multiple times unless showing on multiple faces, and a blank can be used for any letter, though that letter scores 0. Bonuses of an extra turn and extra points are earned for words of 6 to 9 letters. The game continues until a player reaches 200 points or some other agreed-upon total.&#10;&#10;There is an alternate game where all players form his or her own word simultaneously from the same pop.&#10;&#10;",

This is a table-top implementation of Jellyvision's (now known as Jackbox Games) irreverent CD-ROM/online trivia game.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hosted&quot; by wisecracking &quot;Nate Shapiro&quot; (game creator Harry Gottlieb), the game serves as a scorekeeper of dollar values won or lost answering sublimely-worded trivia questions. The game's hard-coded database tracks questions by code, dollar value, and correct answer. A question's code is entered, the question is read aloud by a player, and a sliding door reveals four multiple-choice answers. Players race to buzz in, either to answer or to &quot;screw&quot; an opponent by forcing the opponent to answer. The game reveals whether or not players answer correctly and adjusts scores accordingly. High score after ten questions wins.&#10;&#10;Includes 125 question cards with 500 total general knowledge questions. At least two expansions were released--a TV Pack and a Movies Pack--each adding 113 cards with 450 (TV) or 452 (Movies) additional questions in the set's given subject. (More expansion sets may have been planned, but were not released.)&#10;&#10;",

(The board could easily be drawn with hexagons instead of circles and lines.)  The game is meant for three players but can be played by two.  Its pieces (ten per player) begin in one corner and move to an opponent's starting corner to be crowned, then must move to one of three central circles in order to win the game.  The first player to get one king to the central circles wins.  Pieces, be they ordinary un-promoted pieces or Kings, may move in any direction and capture opposing pieces by jumping.  Kings have no advantage other than that they are required to win the game.&#10;&#10;According to The International Society for Board Game Studies, Shan Tu dates back at least to an 1895 advertisement describing it as &quot;A worthy successor to Gobang, Reversi, Halma and other favourites.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each playing piece has it's own special rules (all contained in the Song of Blades and Heroes rulebook, no other expansion is necessary).&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to take out your opponent's King by killing him or making him flee the board. Although chess pieces and board are used, this is not a chess variant - it is Song of Blades and Heroes to use with your chess set. The pieces retain the character of their equivalent pieces in chess, within the SBH setting.&#10;&#10;The idea of Song of Rooks and Pawns is to offer a gateway introduction to the Song of Blades and Heroes system.&#10;&#10;",

Das Basisspiel&#10;&#10;KAMPF UM DIE STERNE ist ein Spiel f&uuml;r maximal sieben Personen ab 12 Jahren.

Ihr Kampf ist &quot;Gegen jede Chance&quot;.&#10;&#10;2052 - 2082&#10;Ein &quot;Schrei nach Freiheit&quot; breitet sich &uuml;ber die Welten des Sektors aus.

Die Allierten starten eine letzte Gro&szlig;offensive um endlich den Sieg zu erringen. Es wird ein &quot;Abstieg zur H&ouml;lle&quot;.&#10;&#10;2200&#10;Die Terranische Flotte startet einen letzten verzweifelten Angriff auf das Heimatsystem Konquerein. Die gesamten Streitkr&auml;fte der Allianz unternehmen mit allen Einheiten Ablenkungsangriffe entlang der ganzen Front.

    "Description": "Quatrix is a two-player game with old world qualities. If you like Backgammon, this game is for you. You must use your best strategies along with the luck of the dice in order to win!&#10;&#10;Rings and discs are used in Quatrix. When a disc and a ring are combined, they form a PiP (piece inside piece). Squeezing the ring with the disc inside allows the player to move both pieces together. There are two sets of PiPs in each color, seven pips in each set, and two sets of dice.&#10;&#10;All the playing pieces are set up as PiPs on the starting tracks. Players will separate their PiPs as the game progresses. The first player to get his or her pieces reassembled as PiPs across the finish line of the same color wins the game.&#10;&#10;Rings, discs, and PiPs can move horizontally and vertically backwards and forwards, but never diagonally. Pieces can jump rings and discs, but you may not jump over a PiP of the opposing color. The board is 7 squares wide by 11 squares long, and has a starting track on each end, and a finish line on the opposite side of the board six tracks away.&#10;&#10;(From the instructions)&#10;&#10;",
