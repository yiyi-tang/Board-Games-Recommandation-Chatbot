One player (or team) controls the Massive side, a single nigh unstoppable unit. The other controls the Masses, a large army of varied units trying to bring the Massive side down. Each game in The Massive Vs. The Masses line features a sensible pairing of forces in a totally self-contained game, but they can all be combined for team games, or just for when you want to pit a giant atomic monster against an army of mole men for a change of pace.&#10;&#10;The bulk of the gameplay consists of moving units around a hex-grid board, attacking other units, or notable features of the terrain itself, but each turn, players play cards to enable special one-time attacks, create new units, give bonuses to units, activate set-specific weak points, and other various effects.&#10;&#10;",

There are four single colored, six bi-colored, and two quad-colored checkers for each team.&#10;&#10;The 24 pieces are set up just as in regular Checkers. The object of the game is also the same: to eliminate your opponent's men by jumping over them. To do so, your checker must have the same color on it as the one you are jumping. When you reach the opposite side of the board, you turn your checker over to the solid side - black or white. Then, like regular checkers, you can move backwards or forwards. It can now jump or be jumped by any of your opponent's checkers. In case of a stalemate, the last player to move wins.&#10;&#10;A second way to play is more advanced. You simply jump over your own man in order to jump your opponent's man as long as all have a like color.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is played on a grid of 9 x 9 squares, each with one of 4 signs (cross, circle, square, triangle) in one of four colours (purple, green, yellow, blue) on it. The 8 pieces are called &quot;totems&quot;: statues consisting of four stacked cubes, each separately pivotable, and a sculptured head on top of them. On the four cubes you find the same symbols and colours as on the field.&#10;Each totem can move on the field with the same sign AND colour like the corresponding cube of his pole (the side facing the player!) as follows: If you want to move one space, your lowest cube must correspond to the space one step away, etc., the topmost to the space four steps away. At every turn each player may either move one of his totems as many spaces as the correct cube corresponds to the target field (he can change directions during his move as often as he wishes) or turn one of the cubes of one of his totems and thus prepare for future moves. There is no capturing.&#10;The aim of the game is to move first one of your totems from your starting row to the marked &quot;totem space&quot; on the opposite side (2-player version) or on one of three totem spaces on the sides not being your starting row. In the 2-player game, each player owns 4 Totems, in the 4-player variant 2 of them.&#10;To foresee their opponents` next moves, players have to remember the possibilities of the other totems - more easily done, because before the first move, each player puts the cubes of the opposing Totem into the positions he wants to.&#10;There is a bluff element, too, as only the player moving knows, whether his move is correct or not. If another player doubts the correctness, he may call &quot;Totem!&quot; and the move is checked. If it was not correct, the challenging player can put all the totems of the disproved player on adjacent spaces of his choice. If the move was correct, the same happens the other way round.&#10;&#10;The game is part of the Series: Cirkle, consisting of corresponding games, all with the same symbols and colours.&#10;&#10;",

The attacking player now throws his 4 dice three times and gets all the matching cards and the points on them. The cards still on the table go to the &ldquo;defending&rdquo; player. After 6 times, the cards are used up, and both players count their score.&#10;The second round players change roles.&#10;After this, the player with the higher score decides, which player gets which role in the third round. Who wins this third round, wins the whole game. In a variant, players play only two rounds and the higher total score determines the winner.&#10;&#10;There are more rules available, one kind of &ldquo;Yahtzee&rdquo;, and one tactical &ldquo;memory&rdquo;-variant, using only the dice or the cards.&#10;&#10;",

The dice are rolled to randomly determine their values.&#10;&#10;A player starts off their turn by rolling a separate white die. If they have a die on the board matching the result, they must move one such die that many spaces; otherwise they must move their pawn one space. Dice can knock each other back to their starting positions by landing on them, or they can take a player out of the game by landing on their pawn. When a die has moved, it is changed to another random value.&#10;&#10;The goal is to send your dice into enemy territory and be lucky enough to strike at a Diceman before its owner is lucky enough to knock your die back home using any defending dice. Such raids can be facilitated by special spaces that allow a piece to teleport across the board or to be safe from attack. With more than two players, the game is a free-for-all and ends when only one Diceman remains.&#10;&#10;A variant rule suggests that the game should be played for a set period of time (20-60 minutes) after which the player wins whose dice are showing the greatest total. Since dice are never removed from the game and their values are continuously re-randomized in a way that is largely beyond player influence, this effectively means the winner of the game is chosen at random among the remaining players.&#10;&#10;",

The army was divided in two main columns and four minor ones, keeping the decided paths in secret.&#10;&#10;On January 18, 1817, a main column parted with the artillery to Chile through Uspallata, under command of General Las Heras, reaching Las Cuevas on February 1, 1817. The second main column led by San Mart&iacute;n, left on January 19 through Los Patos pass, and reached San Andr&eacute;s de T&aacute;rtaro on February 8, where he was later joined by Las Heras, concluding the first part of the crossing.&#10;&#10;The crossing of the Andes took twenty-one days. It was an extremely difficult enterprise, with temperatures ranging from 30&deg; Celsius during the day to -10&deg; Celsius at night, altitudes averaging 3000 meters above sea level, and paths that were far from being roads appropriate for an army: they consisted of a 50 cm wide paths mainly used by locals for traveling on mules, with several passages which had to be crossed literally in single file. Besides all those hardships, San Mart&iacute;n was far from healthy and was carried on a stretcher during most of the trip. By the end of crossing, around 300 men &mdash; 5.5% of the total at the beginning &mdash; had lost their lives, mostly due to the harsh conditions of the trip.&#10;&#10;In 1817, he crossed the Andes from Mendoza to Chile, and prevailed over the Spanish forces after the Battle of Chacabuco and Battle of Maip&uacute; (1818), liberating Chile together with Chilean Bernardo O'Higgins.&#10;&#10;The game recreat the cross of the Andes by San Martin&acute;s army. In this game the patriot player wins by controlling chile&acute;s cities in less than 20 turns, and the royalist player wins preventing the patriot&acute;s objetive. There are special rules about movement in high altitude and patriot&acute;s surprise factor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rommel's Obsession is a block game that covers the 1941 battle for Tobruk and the British counterattack known as &quot;Operation Crusader&quot;.  The Axis had besieged Tobruk and were holding the Halfaya Pass into Egypt.  The Allies launched a wide sweeping offensive through the open desert with the goal of relieving Tobruk.  This is a battle with no clearly defined front line.  Historically, British and Axis formations criss-crossed each other in bewildering patterns.&#10;&#10;Blocks in this game are mostly regiments and brigades and each turn represents two days time.  Great effort has been made to duplicate the feel and decisions the commanders faced in the battle.  Smart aggressiveness is rewarded.  The Germans have the superior units, but the Commonwealth can more readily replace losses.  Victory is determined not only by possession of territory, but by those casualties.&#10;&#10;Why call it Rommel&rsquo;s Obsession?&#10;Tobruk became the focal point of Rommel&rsquo;s attention, both during the time span of this game and the following year.  As historian W.G.F. Jackson describes Rommel&rsquo;s mindset before this battle,&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Contemporary evidence suggests that Rommel became more and more obsessed with the problems of attacking Tobruk and refused to accept the possibility of the British forestalling him.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Before the battle began, Italian proclamations that the British were about to attack were dismissed as &ldquo;excessive Latin nervousness.&rdquo;  Indeed, even after the battle began, Rommel refused to believe that it was anything more than a reconnaissance in force.  He only changed his mind when he heard an announcement of the offensive on a British radio broadcast out of Cairo!  It was this mindset that led to some of the unique circumstances of this battle.&#10;&#10;",

Then simultaneously one player chooses a row and the other a column for that payoff matrix to earn points, i.e. directly playing a classical game theoretic game, until one side reaches 25 points.&#10;&#10;The multi-player variant in fact gives no upper bound on the number of players, but the example uses 4 players.&#10;&#10;",

Equipment includes the game board, two dice, 2 searchlight beams and 8 bombers.&#10;&#10;Players place the searchlight on the board with the small end on the X about the searchlight crew and the large end pointing to the 1.  Play is alternately done and is based on the roll of a die.  The roll can be used to either move a plane or the searchlight.  A roll of 6 means the player loses his turn.  Planes may be moved in any direction but must be moved the full distance of the die roll in that same direction.  The searchlight can be moved in one direction, up or down, based on the die roll.  A plane is shot down when either it is on the same line as an enemy airplane at the end of the enemy's turn or it crosses the searchlight beam.  A score is obtained if the plane can cross over the targets in enemy territory.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the highest bombing total after all planes have been brought down.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the &quot;Pledge&quot; link on the Decision Games Website:&#10;&#10;This mid-sized-monster game can be played as a two-player or three-player contest. It has three large-hex maps, with 560 half-inch counters, covering the ETO from D-Day to V-E Day at 20 miles per hex. The main fronts are covered, excluding only Scandinavia and Greece. Each game turn equals a third of a month. Units are divisions for the Western Allies and Germans, corps for the Soviets (but with a complete divisional artillery order of battle), and armies for the Yugoslav's and the various minor powers.&#10;&#10;The system is an operational (rather than strategic) derivation of the one used in &quot;Beyond the Urals&quot; and &quot;Operation Kremlin.&quot; No unit will have more than one step. All entry data, notes about reinforcement or special status, etc., can be printed on their reverse sides. Stacking is eight units per hex, with both sides having the move/fight or fight/move sequence option, along with the possibility for limited use of fight/fight.&#10;&#10;The system will be simple, making for a game players can finish in one long weekend, but there will also be plenty of historic chrome, such as: V-weapons, the Warsaw Rebellion, liberation of the death camps, F&uuml;hrer-Mandated Offensives, FLAK divisions, the Upper Silesian industrial region, German economic collapse, National Socialist ardor, proletarian heroism, heavy bombers, naval gun support, fortified lines, etc.&#10;&#10;Play begins with the Western Allied player (or the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; player in a two-player match) launching the D-Day landing. He'll be free to choose just about any coastal hex from northern Germany to the Spanish border as his landing site. Or he might choose to come ashore that first time on the Mediterranean coast of France, the far north of Italy, or even somewhere along the Yugoslavian coast. He'll also have a second invasion available for use later that summer.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined using a point system, primarily based on the German retention of cities according to a schedule derived from the historic Allied advance. There will be periodic victory checks to prevent the German player from adopting any kind of unhistorical strategy based on retreating into the Reich's heartland at the very start of play to try to form some kind of super defensive hedgehog. That ploy would have been impossible for the Germans to support economically in the real-world, and having to maintain a certain level of victory points in order to survive the period victory checks will work to the same effect in the game.&#10;&#10;The combat results table will be of the unit-elimination type, with results of &quot;D-elim,&quot; &quot;D-back-2,&quot; &quot;Exchange,&quot; etc. Thus replacements will be plentiful and the action along the fronts fast and furious. Typical German infantry division will have attack and defense factors of 1-1, 1-2 or 2-3, while panzer divisions will weigh in as 3-2s and 4-3s. In comparison, US infantry divisions will be 3-4s, while that nation's armor divisions will be 4-3s and 5-3s.&#10;&#10;A boxed game to be designed by Ty Bomba. Est. Retail: $60 (Est.

Designed for rapid action and big decisions rather than micro management. And no casualty removal so all those lovely 28mm figures that you painted stay on display!&#10;&#10;",

They form a plan; each musketeer will search a different set of particular halls and chambers, and then attempt to escape from the castle while defeating as many guards as possible. Hopefully the musketeer with the evidence will reach the King. The task ahead won&rsquo;t be easy, but there is hope, and the musketeers have knowledge of a secret network of underground passages beneath the castle that the guards are unaware of.&#10;&#10;In Cardinal&rsquo;s Guards, the player moves the musketeers around the castle, defeating or luring guards, while searching various chambers, before trying to escape.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The musketeers are represented by the four pawns.&#10;     The coins represent the guards.&#10;     The tiles represent castle chambers.&#10;     The dice are used to keep track of the chambers searched.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player&rsquo;s score at the end of the game is based upon the number of chambers searched, the number of guards defeated, and the number of musketeers who escape.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Changing Landscapes game for the piecepack.&#10;&#10;In the far future, ordinary racing has become obsolete. The fans have grown bored with driving around in loops at high speeds. So, a new genre of racing is born&mdash;the Chaos Cruiser. These unique hover-vehicles are designed for pure speed and maneuverability. And they&rsquo;ll need every bit of it because the racetrack is not what it seems. The track is made up of individual modules that shuffle about, ratcheting up the difficulty. Also, each driver has radio-controlled drones that can be placed as obstacles in their opponents&rsquo; paths. In the midst of all this chaos, one wily cruiser will prove to be the fastest, most agile, and most crafty of them all. Who will earn the Chaos Cup?&#10;&#10;The piecepack tiles are laid out, so as to create a racetrack. Each player controls one cruiser, represented by a piecepack die. The number that is face-up on the die designates the speed of that cruiser. The coins have two uses. The null and ace coins are placed on the track as impassible obstacles. The 2, 3, 4, and 5 coins are used as nitro-boosts or shock-breaks, which greatly increase or decrease your speed. The pawns stand for the gates along the course. When a cruiser enters the tile containing a gate, he checks that gate off on the race progress chart. When all the cruisers have reached a certain gate, a chaos round is initiated, in which each player can move the two obstacles of his color. Also, the player in last place can move 3 tiles of the racetrack to entirely new locations. The first player to complete the race by passing through each of the four gates twice in the correct sequence is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the &ldquo;Year of Unification&rdquo; 01 in the star system Solaria, and aliens from all planets celebrate the beginning of a new era of peace and prosperity!&#10;&#10;From the neophyte interplanetary capital on Luna, moon of Prime, to the local governments on the five planets, the newly united races of the Solaria system seek to spread their influence and control the fragile system-wide bureaucracy.  As the leader of your race, can you build support on the planets, wisely assign your Councilors, and seize power as the Emperor of Solaria?&#10;&#10;Solaria features area control, limited actions and resource management. The main action plays out on the five planets that rotate around the sun in different orbits.  The ever changing rotation of the planets can dramatically affect game play, as planet position determines travel costs (the greater the distance between planets, the more fuel it takes to get there), scoring (elections only take place when a planet is in the same sector as the capital), and deep space exploration.&#10;&#10;By winning elections, players appoint their Councilors to positions in the Solarian government that can best serve their own race (different assignments reap game-altering benefits). Competition for privileges is fierce. Choosing where to increase your power base on the planets, where to move your Planetary Base, whether to mine asteroids or the best method to explore deep space (and other options) is a careful balance of managing money, Councilors, and your rivals&rsquo; best-laid plans.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, all planets hold their final elections. The player who exerts the most influence in the government becomes the Emperor of Solaria and wins the game!&#10;&#10;Actual playing time is 90-150 minutes.&#10;&#10;Note: The game was selected for participation in the 2008 Hippodice international game design competition. It is currently unpublished.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players are hunting the evil robot Gobbot (played by another player) with four mini submarines within the human body. Goal is to catch the robot while spending as little energy as possible. Rules suggest that each players gets to play as the robot once, and then the scores are added.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players first choose an action card. There are cards which cost a different amount of energy (victory points); they cause the evil player to give more or less precise information about his current hiding place. Another type of card leads to some dexterity/sports contest between the evil and one of the good players; if good wins, they can make a guess where the robot is now.&#10;&#10;After this, the players move their submarines; but they are restricted in the paths they may use.&#10;Then the robot moves; he may use all paths, but can never return to a place he was before, which limits his moves as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;Game ends with a victory of good when the players reach the robot, when the robot has no legal move left, or when the players guess right after winning a dexterity challenge. The robot player wins if he survives until the action card deck is exhausted after 16 turns.&#10;&#10;",

On the boardgame you have tropical islands, reefs and treasure islands.&#10;&#10;Filibuster is a loosely pirate-themed game where players take turns to move black and white plastic ships across a 13x13 square tile board. Apart from sea tiles there are skerry tiles (that cannot be entered), island tiles (which offer protection) and two treasure island tiles (which are the objectives of the game).&#10;&#10;Each player has ten corvettes and three galleons at their disposal. Corvettes can land on islands but cannot sink other ships. Galleons, conversely, cannot land on islands but can sink an enemy ship by entering its tile at the end of a full 5-step move. The game ends when one player lands a corvette on the other player's treasure island.&#10;&#10;Although there's no explicit art credit, the board bears the legend &quot;Tegnestuen Den gyldne n&oslash;gle&quot;, Danish for &quot;Studio The Golden Key&quot;, the firm name used by the Pagermans (professional artists both). The cover painting, however, showing generic pirate ships closing for battle, has a clipped, unreadable signature that doesn't seem to match either of their names.&#10;&#10;",
