    "Description": "The Martians have invaded for a second time and the world is at war!&#10;&#10;All Quiet on the Martian Front is a game with WWI-like weapons and Martian Advanced Technology, that breathes new life into the Classic Earth Invasion.&#10;&#10;Set in the beginning of the second decade of the Twentieth Century. All Quiet on the Martian Front starts in an exciting time that&rsquo;s filled with the smoke of countless factories creating the first tanks, automobiles, aeroplanes, lightning guns and more. Larger than life historical figures like Teddy Roosevelt, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and many others lead the fight against the soulless Martian invaders.&#10;&#10;North America is the setting for Part One, and features the forces of the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, holding the Martian invasion on the Mississippi River.&#10;&#10;In All Quiet on the Martian Front Mankind is fighting for survival: upon the steppes of Russia, across the sands of Egypt, amongst the foothills of the Himalayas, but nowhere more fiercely than in the United States of America. Our game puts you in command of the embattled armies of humanity or their implacable adversaries the Martian invaders. These opposing forces are represented by models of alien Tripod war machines armed with heat rays, black dust, and green mist, and Martian Made Human Zombie Slaves on one side versus all the tanks, infantry, artillery and other weaponry that humanity can muster on the other. Your model armies clash over a tabletop turned into a battlefield by the addition of model terrain, fortifications, and alien constructions from mysterious Cylinders to towering fortifications.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;&#10;Truly innovative game system developed by some of the world&rsquo;s best game designers such as Rick Priestley, Alessio Cavatore, and Ernie Baker.&#10;Initiative based system that determines who goes first that turn.&#10;Scalable game system allow players to start out with a few tripods and tanks with the ability to progress to play truly massive conflicts.&#10;This is a unit based game of massive conflict rather than a skirmish game.&#10;Rules designed for massive battles made possible through the use of 15mm (18mm) (HO) scale miniatures.&#10;The rules system is highly flexible and allows for hidden movement and ambushing.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The ice floes are melting &ndash; it is time to load your longships &ndash; but where will you sail to in search of glory and treasure? Other Viking lords summon their warriors also, and only the strongest will win in those distant lands that tremble when they hear the words &ldquo;the Northmen are coming&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;S&aelig;r is a concealed bidding game lasting 20-30 minutes, playable by 2-4 players. Players initially commit concealed bids for mastery of the lands raided by the Vikings. These bids may be added to, but only at the cost of revealing what has already been committed to be bid. There is thus a trade-off between the power of each bid, and its secrecy. A completely secret bid risks being outbid by one where the opponent is more open about their intentions. Resources are scarce - so players must also balance the gains (and special powers) which they can gain in the early rounds with the need to conserve a fleet large enough to compete in the final &quot;Ragnarok&quot; round - where even the Norse Gods become involved.&#10;&#10;S&aelig;r is a game fully in keeping with the La Mame tradition of producing games that are Interactive, Strategic and Short!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The rules are simple: each player has four towers, three pieces high, that can &quot;boom&quot; (fire) or &quot;zoom&quot; (move) a number of spaces equal to the tower's height. But with those deceptively simple ingredients, veteran designer Ty Bomba has created his masterpiece, the game that he himself acknowledges as his own best design. The trick is that the game ends when only one player's pieces remain on the board, and the player who managed to exit the most pieces off of the opponent's side of the map wins. Because of this, players can't concentrate on just blocking/attacking or just advancing, but must strike a difficult and subtle balance between the two.&#10;&#10;The first edition of Mr. Bomba's game was significantly altered by its publisher. Here, all unnecessary ornamentation has been stripped away, presenting the designer's original vision as he had always intended, in a handsome format utilizing chunky 40mm x 40mm x 16mm wooden blocks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rommel at Bay is an operational level simulation of the World War II Allied offensive in southern Tunisia which took place in mid-March 1943. Located here were the main Axis fortifications defending Tunisia, fortifications nearly as formidable as those at Alamein. Had the German-Italian army succeeded in defending, the war in North Africa would have been lengthened and perhaps Allied command would have changed again. The playing pieces represent the actual units which participated in the campaign and the map represents the actual terrain over which those units fought. Rommel at Bay is basically a two player game in which one player controls the Axis forces while his opponent controls the Allied forces.&#10;&#10;The two players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. Victory occurs and the game ends immediately when one player has achieved the conditions given in the scenario being played. The other player wins the game by preventing his opponent from achieving his victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The game has two scenarios. The first (Medenine) is a smaller scenario of the battle that was fought March 6th to 8th 1943. The second scenario is the main Mareth Campaign March 20th to 28th.&#10;&#10;",

Will you capture the best photos of mythical creatures to complete the most daring class assignments, or will you be laughed off the trip?&#10;&#10;Each round, you&rsquo;ll draft and play Cryptid cards with unnatural powers to warp the game and bring you closer to victory. Collect matching cards to complete assignments and earn points towards your ultimate goal &ndash; becoming a full-fledged supernatural photographer!&#10;&#10;Each round has the following steps:&#10;1. Choose Assignments&#10;Deal each player 2 Assignments facedown. Each player looks at their Assignments, then chooses 1 to place faceup in front of themselves as their Private Assignment and 1 to place faceup in the Public Assignments area in the center of the play area.&#10;&#10;2. Draft Cryptids&#10;Deal each player 8 Cryptid cards facedown. Each player looks at their hand, chooses 1 card, and places it in a facedown stack in front of themselves.&#10;&#10;Each player then passes their remaining 7 cards to the player on their left. Each player again chooses 1 card and adds it to their facedown stack, then passes their remaining hand to the left. Players continue picking and passing until each player has a stack of 8 cards in front of themselves. (Note that each player must add the last card that is passed to them to their stack.)&#10;&#10;3. Player Turns&#10;Once the draft is complete, each player takes all cards in their facedown stack into their hand. Players then take turns revealing and activating cards, starting with the player who has the Bus standee and going clockwise around the table.&#10;&#10;On your turn, take the following steps in order:&#10;3.1. Reveal Card: Choose 1 card from your hand and place it faceup in front of yourself.&#10;3.2. Activate Abilities : You may use abilities on your faceup&#10;Cryptid cards. To use each ability, you must activate the card (turn it sideways) along with the required number of cards of the same type (see &ldquo;Activating Cryptid Cards,&rdquo; next page).&#10;3.3. Complete Assignments: If your faceup cards meet the requirements to complete a Public Assignment, claim the card from the center of the play area, place it in front of yourself, and turn it sideways to show it&rsquo;s completed. If you complete your Private Assignment, simply turn it sideways to show it&rsquo;s completed.&#10;&#10;4. End of Round&#10;The round ends once no one has any cards left in their hand.&#10;Gather all Cryptid cards in front of all players (both activated and unactivated) and place them in a discard pile next to the deck. (If a player completed an Assignment that lets them keep a card, they may keep it instead of discarding it.)&#10;&#10;Each player keeps their completed Assignments, as well as their Private Assignment if it wasn&rsquo;t completed. All uncompleted Public Assignments are left in the center of the table for players to complete the following round.&#10;&#10;Pass the Bus to the player with the fewest points from completed Assignments (not counting hidden Reward tokens), or the fewest Reward tokens in the case of a tie.&#10;Begin the next round by dealing each player 2 new Assignments from the deck.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;The game ends after 3 rounds.&#10;Players reveal their Reward tokens and total up the points on their Rewards and completed Assignments. (Incomplete Assignments are worth no points.)&#10;The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Race to the Sea 1914&quot; is the feature magazine wargame included in Yaah! #8 by Flying Pig Games.&#10;&#10;After the Battle of the Marne was won by the Allied armies in early September 1914, the Germans withdrew  to a formidable position north of the Aisne River and entrenched themselves on the high ground. Numerous French efforts to dislodge them failed and the two great hosts stared at each other from their respective trenches. German General Erich von Falkenhayn and French Marshal Joseph Joffre realized that there was much open, exploitable territory to the north of these solidified lines and each prepared to maneuver around the flanks of his opponent. These mutual and simultaneous flanking moves resulted in a series of headlong battles that gradually shifted the forces north toward the French Channel coast. These maneuverings yielded a series of encounter battles at Picardy, Albert, Artois, La Bassee and along the Yser River. But these engagements were ultimately indecisive and the campaign&rsquo;s final stage was set for the dramatic clash at the end of the &ldquo;race&rdquo;, at the ancient textile city of Ypres. &#10;The &ldquo;Race to the Sea&rdquo; campaign was the last mobile campaign on the western front of the First World War &ndash; a last chance for victory. It was a final push to get &ldquo;home before the leaves fall&rdquo;. But the resulting murderous battles &ndash; culminating in the infamous &ldquo;Kindermord von Ypern&rdquo; (the Massacre of the Innocents at Ypres) &ndash; were so bloody and indecisive that their effects instead directly lead to the creation of the Western Front trench lines and to a continuation of a  war that seemed would never end.&#10;&#10;The game system is based on the same system used in the game Dead Reckoning by Tiny Battle Publishing. There are no dice, no CRT's, no lists of modifiers and no combat factors. A card-based combat resolution and initiative bidding system drives the action, along with a random event table that provides variety, WWI theme and campaign-specific events.&#10;&#10;The game includes:&#10;&#10;One 12&quot; x 18&quot; map&#10;88 counters&#10;36 cards (12 Initiative and 24 Combat Results)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the author's homepage:&#10;&#10;Double Agents is published as an insert in the french boardgame magazine &quot;Des Jeux sur un Plateau&quot;, in the October 2005 issue (#20). In this card game, each player is trying to manipulate five double agents with ambiguous loyalty, and to guess which ones are working for him and which one for his opponent. Hidden information, face down cards... it's a two player game, but it's also a classical Ludo or Bruno game, where you don't know what is sophisticated bluffing and what it just global chaos.&#10;&#10;From an earlier description on Bruno Faidutti's website:&#10;Double Agent is based on a simple idea : each player knows each agent's loyalty to him, but doesn't know his loyalty to his opponent. In such an ambiguous situation, it's hard to decide who you can trust with your precious top-secret documents, which must not end in enemy hands. Each player plays cards face down on his side of the gameboard. It is therefore a bluffing game, but it is also, as one can expect from a collaboration between Ludovic and me, a deliberately chaotic and often uncontrollable game&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Avec Infini Regret III - French Wars of Religion, 1562 - 1598&#10;The battle of Moncontour, 1569&#10;&#10;The Peace of Longjumeau, signed on 23 March 1568, ended the second Wars of Religion but was fragile. The royal power no longer trusted the prince of Cond&eacute;, leader of the Protestant party.  A few months after the signing, the Catholics attempted to capture the prince of Cond&eacute; and Admiral Coligny by surprise. The plot failed and the Protestant commanders reassembled with their armies and took refuge at La Rochelle.&#10;Thus began the campaign constituting the third War of Religion at the end of the summer of 1568. The objective of the Royal Army, commanded by the Duc of Anjou, future king Henry III, was to seize the Protestant towns between Charente and Dordogne. After a winter campaign marked by desertions on both sides, the Duc of Anjou claimed victory on 13 March 1569 at Jarnac when the prince of Cond&eacute; was cut down in cold blood while surrendering to a Catholic nobleman. Coligny succeeded him as commander of the Huguenot army. Despite this victory, Anjou was unsuccessful in capturing the city of Cognac. Furthermore, he didn&rsquo;t have enough troops to supply a garrison in the cities seized from the Protestants.&#10;On 25 June 1569, Admiral de Coligny took his revenge and defeated the Catholics at La Roche-L&rsquo;Abeille where Strozzi, colonel general of the royal infantry, was taken prisoner. He then lay siege to Poitiers but was forced to abandon it after several weeks in order to confront the Catholic troops preparing to him from his rear bases.&#10;&#10;On 3 October 1569, the two armies faced off near Moncontour.Gaspard de Coligny did not want to engage in battle, knowing he was outnumbered. However, German mercenaries among his troops were unhappy at not being paid and precipitated the movement. The Catholic troops were better prepared, greater in number and more heavily armed and easily pushed back the assault of the Protestants who were forced into a disorderly retreat.&#10;Although it barely lasted two hours, this battle resulted in between 6000 and 10.000 men dead or taken prisoner on the side of the Protestants compared to 1000 for the Catholics. The Swiss soldiers of the Royal Army spared no lansquenet in retaliation for La Roche-L&rsquo;Abeille&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&bull; Two 59 x 41 cm maps  (one printed front and back)&#10;&bull; 216 die-cut counters and markers&#10;&bull; 1 rule book including scenarios&#10;&bull; 1 color player aid&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

They'll also use presents from the neighboring cities. The possibilities for each player, however, very much depends on the influence used by the other princess.&#10;&#10;Receiving the most goodwill from the Pharaoh will require perfect utilization of the influence cards and the gathering of valuables for the grave chamber.&#10;&#10;&#10;For the fulfilment of the Red Pyramid, Pharaoh Snofru orders the construction of an avenue and the filling of the grave chambers. In this complex strategy game, the players - acting as princes - use their limited influence to become the grand vizier. By clever usage of action cards and commodities, the players buy gems on the market, use them in the construction of the avenue, achieve beneficial positions for the filling of the grave chambers and use the tributes of the neighbouring settlements &ndash; all possibilities to score directly or at the end of the game. However, these tasks, asked by the pharaoh, cannot be solved alone! The dilemma: The player&rsquo;s action potential depends on the cards chosen by the other players, which are pursuing their own goals...&#10;&#10;To score at the end of the game, the players not only have to place their offerings in the procession, but will have to collect gold and silver as well in order to fill the grave chambers &ndash; preferably by hindering the other players from doing so. The player having collected the most recognition points will receive the title of the grand vizier in the end.&#10;&#10;Special feature of the game: The game box is designed as a pyramid, revealing the burial chamber when opened.&#10;&#10;",

Dig in the snow to find the items to build your very own snowman.&#10;&#10;Based on the Roll-and-Write, Paleontologists, with a Winter theme.&#10;&#10;Items needed: 2 six-sided dice&#10;&#10;The game is played over 20 rounds, with players playing simultaneously, trying to earn the most points by digging up items in the snow. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, using the dice however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each Round you will roll 2 dice and then use those dice to draw a shape with a certain dig type on the snow map. You dig up an item when it is completely surrounded (orthogonally) by shapes you have drawn.&#10;&#10;- Roll 2 dice - Roll the 2 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference. Of the two dice rolled, one will be used to determine which shape and the other die will be used to determine the type of dig.&#10;&#10;- Use dice to choose a shape and a dig type&#10;&#10;Choosing the shape: Using one of the dice, choose one of the pentomino shapes coordinated with that number. There are twelve shapes, with a choice of two shapes with each die-face number.&#10;&#10;Choosing the dig type: Using the other die, determine the dig type. There are three dig types.&#10;&#10;Example: You roll a 2 and a 5. You can choose one shape, and can choose from four shapes; the two shapes next to the 2 and the two shapes next to the 5. You also have a choice between two dig types; the V from the 2 that was rolled or the diagonal lines from the 5 that was rolled. You decide the best play for your current dig site is to choose the L shape with the 5 die and then use the V dig type with the 2 die.&#10;&#10;- Draw shape and fill that shape in with the Dig type&#10;Shapes can be mirrored, turned, and flipped, as long as they are still the same shape.&#10;Shapes can only be placed in open, non-item spaces. You can place shapes over the bonus snowflake. If you do, choose and circle one of the bonuses to gain (you can use bonuses in future rounds).&#10;&#10;- Check to see if you dig up an Item(s) - Once n item is completely surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right. Not diagonally) then you score that item! Circle the number in a lower scoring area that corresponds to the item you dug up. If you use all of the same dig type for an item, you earn bonus points.&#10;&#10;Repeat these steps each round (rolling 2 dice and placing a shape with a dig type) until 20 rounds have been completed.&#10;&#10;- Earning Bonus points for using the same Dig Type - if you were able to use the same dig type for an item, you also gain the scoring bonus. Circle the extra smaller circle with the +number. If there is more than one dig type used for an item, you cannot gain the bonus.&#10;&#10;- Bonus Snowflakes - when you place a shape over a bonus snowflake, you gain a bonus! Choose one of the four bonuses at the top-left of the page. The four types of bonuses are One Square Anywhere, Switch Shape, Switch Dig Type, and +1 Point. Each bonus can be gained up to four times in one game.&#10;&#10;One Square Anywhere - At any time, place a 1x1 square on any empty square that does not contain a bonus snowflake. Fill in the square (as the dig type). You cannot get the dig type bonus score when a filled-in square is used to dig up that item.&#10;&#10;Switch Shape - Choose any shape for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)&#10;&#10;Switch Dig Type - Choose any dig type for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)&#10;&#10;+  1 Point - Worth one point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;End of Game: After you have completed the 20th roll/round, total your points earned from each item dug up, adding in bonuses from items dug up with the same dig type, and finally adding points if circled from bonus snowflakes. The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;Build your Snowman: Take the items you dug up and place them however you would like on the blank snowman. Name your snowman and have a happy holiday!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;A tactical game of fighter combat in space&quot; beginning in the &quot;near future&quot;.  Scenarios range from the first U.S.-Soviet Space War, to Asteroid Pirates (the title of a later Yaquinto game), to Alien Invaders.  Inertial, vector-based movement provides some realism (there are even some three-dimensional optional rules).  Detailed energy management between fifteen ship functions (including cloaks, shields, scanners and so on) and a myriad of weapons provide even more playing pleasure.  Eight ship designs are included, with more easily designed.  This is almost a miniatures game, as some weapons come with effect templates.  Pieces are provided for larger ships, a space station and asteroids.  Hidden movement is possible using the advanced optional rules.  Turns are simultaneous, with the players using the familiar Yaquinto shields to adjust their ship displays hidden from view.&#10;&#10;(In this game's credits, we learn that Michael S. Matheny is Michael Scott Matheny)&#10;&#10;Asteroid Pirates: A Game of Ship to Ship Combat in the Asteroid Belts is a simplified version of this game.&#10;&#10;",

If those other witches won't leave, they are going to get witch slapped!&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a witch and is given nine lives. Next they are dealt five spell cards for their hand and one spell card face down. The dealer is the witch with the lowest life. Once the dealer says go the round begins!&#10;&#10;The round is played over three phases. 1) Super Fast Set Collection - the witches are trying to collect a set of matching spell cards via Super Fast card drafting (not kidding about the Super Fast, if you aren't fast you might as well witch slap yourself....) 2) Slapping - once the witch has collected a set of cards they &quot;Slap&quot; the card in the middle of the table that matches the number they have collected (first witch to slap must have 4 or 5 collected). 3) Spell Casting- this is done simultaneously. The witches reveal the spell they are attempting to cast based on the collected spell cards and card they slapped. If the numbers match it successes, if it doesn't, the spell backfired just witch slapped themselves!&#10;&#10;Most spells take life away from other witches, but some protect the witch. Once you lose your life you are eliminated from the forest and shamed by the other witches! The winner is the witch that is the last witch standing!&#10;&#10;",

The Gods, who were once, long ago working in unity to bring the world together, are now competing and fighting with each other for world control.

Complete and utter supremacy.&#10;&#10;Core Gameplay&#10;&#10;War of Supremacy is a free-for-all, king-of-the-hill style, fantasy card game in which all players are fighting over a centralized Territory: a battleground in which all players want to take control of and ultimately win in order to claim it as their own. If a player gains control over a number of territories they will control enough of the world to win the game. With all players fighting for themselves, the battlefield becomes an all-in brawl with only one winner.&#10;&#10;Players take turns, using creatures from their hand to attack the opponent&rsquo;s creatures currently defending the Territory. If a player manages to defeat the defending creatures, they take control of the Territory, placing all their creatures used in the attack into defense. That player will then become the defender in which all other players are trying to defeat.&#10;&#10;If a player manages to defend against all opponents, then they win the Territory and take it as a victory point. Players can also win a Territory by building up enough score in their attack or defense to win the Territory outright before others get a chance. Players can combine creatures with spell cards that offer a wide range of game changing effects.&#10;&#10;Master your tactics, form alliances and make enemies, and have a little bit of luck to win.&#10;&#10;",

La R&eacute;sistance gives players a chance to lead a band of resistance fighters, working to keep their men and women alive as they also strive to become the most famous resistance leader.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player will roll six dice, placing the dice on mission cards common to all players, he or she attempts to defeat the mission card by matching dice on the card, spending recruits, and using their resistance leader&rsquo;s special abilities. To win, a player must amass 12 Glory Points or break--by stealing or otherwise removing all rival resistance group members&mdash;the other resistance bands. La R&eacute;sistance mixes elements of popular dice games, such as Yahtzee and King of Tokyo, with &ldquo;take that&rdquo; card mechanics and player interaction, giving the game a familiar feel.&#10;&#10;The game is historically themed, and a great way to introduce gamers to strategy games. Three to five people may play, so La R&eacute;sistance is great for game nights and family get-togethers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Every animal you enclose is worth points, and double points if you FENCE in only one type of animal in the pen. You can also throw other animals into your opponents&rsquo; perfect fields to keep them from the bonus. Careful, you can only afford to maintain a limited number of fields. The game ends after the last tile is placed.  The farmer with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Represented by a pile of scattered, mostly facedown cards, each rubble card represents a powerful item. Notable relics include Doc Ock&rsquo;s severed tentacles, damaged Ultron Drones, Terrigen Crystals, and more!&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll use your deck of Damage Control employees to demolish, uncover, and collect the Rubble Cards in search of valuable items, which you will then add to your deck. You can use the items&rsquo; powerful abilities to make your deck stronger and more effective or send them to your vault to keep them safe and earn victory points. Be careful, though! Only the items stored in your vault will score points in the end, so don&rsquo;t hold on to them for too long!&#10;&#10;As members of the organization in charge of processing the zone of destruction, you&rsquo;ll also have to deal with various claimants&mdash;people showing up after the battle to complain about traffic or do their own scavenging. Some rubber-necking citizens are just hoping to catch a glimpse of one of the heroes or villains involved!&#10;&#10;Heroes such as Captain America, Shang-Chi, Black Widow and more will appear in the form of the Character Deck. These heroes provide effects and victory points to the Damage Control teams that manage to enlist their help. The game also features four modules: Mighty Asgard, Mystical Manipulation, Pym Tech, and Vibranium Synthesis. For each game, you&rsquo;ll pick two modules to mix into the standard Rubble and Character decks, creating a variety of stories, strategies, and gameplay options!&#10;&#10;As the Marvel Universe&rsquo;s leaders in cleanup and reconstruction, your team is sure to wreck the competition!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Occasionally a minion or item will replace an action card.&#10;&#10;The map is built of 6 cards as well, with the cards randomly placed in a set pattern.&#10;&#10;Players take turns maneuvering their characters around the dynamic, and often dangerous map while unleashing powerful attacks. As action cards are used they open up new possibilities and empower the character&rsquo;s battlecrests. Build up to decisive strikes or refocus to get powers back. Every character has a unique set of actions and preferred tactics, so no two battles play the same.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Metronn Base Game includes two heroes, Kaladeos and Exa (and her minion, Sparkles), and the Metronn map.

    "Description": "The world of Ophidian 2350 is centered around gladiatorial combat.  These gladiators are aliens, bio-enhanced humans, mystics, and all sorts of otherworldly beings.  &#10;Theme aside, this CCG, originally released at Gen Con 2003, has some unusual new mechanics that separate it from the pack.&#10;&#10;First, Players use &quot;credits&quot; to supply their gladiators with equipment and minions (support characters).  Ophidian 2350 has a mechanic called &quot;The Flow&quot;.  Each card has a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; on it.  Play a positively charged card, and you can keep playing cards.  Play a negatively charged card and your turn ends and your opponent can start playing their cards.  Basically, it helps provide a little &quot;momentum&quot; incentive, and adds strategy.&#10;&#10;Creating combos that allow you to keep The Flow while you prepare for a killer blow, while making sure that the crowd is entertained... that's the key to victory!  If you don't entertain the crowd, your opponent can use their own popularity with the crowd to turn The Flow against you... so show off and impress that crowd!&#10;&#10;",

With a modular two-sided board, each game is a new challenge. Build your deck wisely to outsmart the others!&#10;&#10;You can follow the game here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smartflamingo/oh-crab &#10;The campaign on KS starts on 20th June 2024, 5:30 PM CET - Warsaw time&#10;&#10;&#10;In the game 'Oh, Crab!', players take on the role of crabs that have escaped from the fry-house and run away along the beach to hide in the safe waves of the sea. On their way they will face various obstacles like sandcastles, rubbish, voracious gulls and other crabs clumsily making their way towards the water.&#10;&#10;Players move their crabs across a modular board by playing one card from their hand face down each round, and then performing actions and moves from it on their turn. Cards played on following rounds can be chained by matching the halves of the icons on the sides, allowing for even more moves or gaining shells that can be spent on special actions.&#10;&#10;When crabs move or are pushed into the obstacles on the board, players will need to discard the cards from their hands, forcing them to spend a turn to rest. When resting, players retrieve all their cards back, and gain one new card, with additional special actions and more options for chaining.&#10;&#10;The first crab to get into safe waters of the sea wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When gods fight, human blood flows. Theomachy lets you take the place of a high god &ndash; lord of a group of devoted followers. Now is your opportunity to face off Poseidon against Ishtar! Thor against Cthulhu! Morrigan against Yog-Sothoth! You have one goal and one goal only: annihilate your foes' believers and seize absolute power.&#10;&#10;Achieve this task by staking the souls of your followers, using the same bluff, psychology, and tactics that have made Texas Hold 'em Poker the world's premier card game. Once you seize victory, you can rest, and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of the gods. You have won Theomachy.&#10;&#10;The game is quick to play &ndash; typically less than 45 minutes. First, choose your god. Then, drafting cards into your personal deck lets you slowly build your might. Ante up your followers, and stake them against your foes' minions. You can call, raise, or fold, in similar fashion to high-stakes Poker games (and what stake is higher than your own worshipers' souls?)&#10;&#10;Your spells are powered by a Constellation, which is laid down in the middle of the table as a Texas Hold'em Poker style flop, river, and turn. Just as in Hold 'em, some Constellation configurations provide you with great combinations for your secret hand of cards, some are disastrous, while most are middling to fair.&#10;&#10;Using miracles, spells, and powerful artifacts, powered by the Constellation, send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every hand: do you put your power on the line to help your believers, or do you turn your back to cut your losses, abandoning them to certain death? If neither you nor your opponents yield, the showdown takes place - hurricanes are opposed by deathly plagues, tempests extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful shrink every second.&#10;&#10;Use your god&rsquo;s power to create miracles and activate myth cards for your heroes, temples, and godly artifacts. For example, the Norse pantheon has access to the Fenris wolf, Thor's hammer, and more. Babylon has Lilith, Ur, the tower of Babel, and more. Even the Lovecraft pantheons have myth cards and their own dark miracles. Place Wilbur Whateley in the forefront of your fight, or wield the Pallid Mask!&#10;&#10;Theomachy: The Ancients includes four pantheons: Greek, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Lovecraft's Outer Gods.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Noble in the King&rsquo;s Court, you try to gain His Royal favour, but he&rsquo;s constantly changing his mind about what he wants. Still, you gather as much of the items he desires (for the moment) to advance your status over the other nobles.&#10;&#10;Expand the land, capture treasure, trade at the marketplace and get ready to make your offer to the King. Your position in Court depends on how you use your resources, the actions you select and presenting your offering at the exact right time.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;&#10;1. Taking Actions&#10;Starting with the first player and moving clockwise, each player can perform up to 3 actions on their turn among all their workers (4 actions if you have 3 workers) before moving on to the next player's turn, as follows:&#10;&#10;Explore by selecting and placing a tile adjacent to one of your workers (YOU MUST INDICATE WHICH OF YOUR WORKERS IS EXPLORING, but you can place this anywhere adjacent to this worker as long as there is an open space and it can be placed adjacent to two or more existing tiles). Note that movement to this tile is not included in this action. Whenever a new tile is added to the board, add one cube for each matching resource icon on this tile.&#10;&#10;Move to an adjacent tile or between any two market tiles (even if they are not adjacent)&#10;&#10;Collect all resources of ONE type from a tile your worker is currently on&#10;&#10;Trade items at a market (you may trade as many as you want for one action, but you must trade two of one type to receive one of another type and must have a worker on a market tile to do so). There are a total of 6 markets including the starting market tile in the deck of tiles.&#10;&#10;Make an offering to the King by placing any number of resources you have of the type(s) on the current demand card onto your offering card.&#10;&#10;Hire a worker - Note that this requires all 3 actions on your turn to complete. The new worker may be placed on the tile of one of your existing workers, or any market tile, including the starting market tile. You may have a maximum of 3 workers.&#10;&#10;How to Win:&#10;&#10;After the fifth and final goal has been scored, players add 1 point for each 5 total resources they had at the end of the game (they don't have to be the same type, but don't return them to the stockpile just yet!). The player with the most points is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;If there is a tie, it is broken by the player with most total resources remaining. If still tied, the tie is broken by the player with the most wheat remaining. If still tied, the victory is shared.&#10;&#10;",

The blocks come in three heights, and which blocks and which colors you have to use are shown on a action card the player takes at the beginning of his turn.&#10;&#10;If one or more of the towers fall because of that player's action, he receives a negative point. After removing fallen blocks, the next player takes her turn. Receive three negative points, and you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lemuria is an ancient city running on the now-forgotten time-control technology. Using the force from the stars, channeled through the star altar, the residents could control time and transform the versatile resource &quot;materia&quot; into anything they wished. You are one of the city builders of Lemuria, and you must fight for control of the altar, sometimes cooperating with others and using your resources to further develop the ancient city &mdash; and you have only one year in which to do it.&#10;&#10;Lemuria &mdash; originally released as &#230;&#152;&#159;&#229;&#136;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;, or &quot;The Star Kingdom Lemuria&quot; &mdash; is at its heart a worker placement, resource management, and area control game. Players try to get points chiefly by converting two types of workers into resources, then using those resources to buy buildings. Points can also be gained by using special cards and by combining them with buildings.&#10;&#10;The game simulates one full year in Lemuria's lifespan, with each of the twelve rounds representing one month, and with harvests on rounds 4, 8, and 12. On their turn, a player must either (1) place workers to &quot;seed&quot; their materia, or (2) harvest resources as a result of prior placements. Players may also choose to use accumulated resources to buy buildings, use accumulated food to &quot;employ citizens&quot; (use special cards), or spend gold to perform extra actions. Citizens can reside in buildings, which gives extra points during the harvests.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Odd Shop, the auction house for all your oddities! Spend store credits to win the odd objects. But be aware, not all objects are authentic. Hire the inhouse experts to get more information on the objects before you make your bid.&#10;&#10;Every round, five objects will be auctioned off. All objects are visible for all the players to see. The auction will start with the object furthest on the left, continuing to the object on the right. For each object, a round of bidding will occur.&#10;&#10;All objects have two values in gold. One value for an authentic object and one value for a replica. You will only find out if the objects are authentic or not after you&rsquo;ve bought the item. But before the bidding starts, you can hire the help of an expert to check if the object(s) is authentic or a replica. Bidding will happen simultaneously in the first round. After the first round, the player with the most credits left, will become the profiteer. When there is a profiteer, bidding will occur in clockwise order, with the profiteer bidding last. Bids will be placed face down, but players can see how many cards are used in the bid.&#10;&#10;The objects are divided into four categories: potions, familiars, gear and magic items. When you win more objects of the same category, you gain bonus points (depending on the duration of the game). Gear objects belong to sets of two or three. When you&rsquo;ve collected a complete set, the total value of that set will be doubled. Therefore, it is encouraged to try and win as many of the same category objects as you can, but your opponents will of course know that you want certain objects. That&rsquo;s why it is allowed to trade with the other players. You can trade objects, or you can buy objects from other players by paying credits. This means that you will play the rest of the game with less credits to spend and your opponent with more than everyone else. But getting to complete a collection can win you the game!&#10;&#10;You may notice that the objects are not named. You may use your expertise to identify the objects and give them names. And how on earth could some be replicas?!&#10;&#10;Have fun in the world of Odd Shop!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The nine pins stood on a table and players took turns swinging a ball on the end of a chain so that it swung away from the playing field and then knocked down the pins on its return.&#10;&#10;Since this version could be played indoors and yet saved on pub space, it has been known as Bar Skittles.  When in 1783, dragoons put down a riot (caused by a dramatic play insulting to tailors), newspapers described the dragoons as a ball going through skittles, causing the game to become known as 'Devil Amongst the Tailors'.&#10;&#10;Revived as a family board game in 20th century United States, children were thought to get the hang of table-top skittles quickly and end up better than adults.  All-time PBA Bowling champion  Dick Weber endorsed the game as &quot;the next best thing to having a bowling alley in your living room&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Momentum is a dynamic abstract strategy board game in which the lead swings back and forth like the steel spheres of Newton&rsquo;s cradle. Grabbing the lead and holding onto it is the challenge.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game simulate the game of marbles. Players take turns dropping one of their eight marbles (glass stones) onto a square 7 x 7 game board. On the second player&rsquo;s first turn only, the second player may either&#10;drop a counter or replace the first player&rsquo;s dropped counter with one of his&#10;or her own (Pie Rule). The momentum of the dropped marble is transferred in up to eight (orthogonal and diagonal) directions through adjacent contiguous lines of marbles. The last marble at the end of each of these lines is pushed away one cell from the dropped marble. Some fall off the board and are returned to the owning players.&#10;&#10;When a player has only one marble left in hand, he or she is required to announce the last marble. At which point, his opponent is forced to knock at least one of his other seven marbles off the board, otherwise the opponent would lose the game.&#10;&#10;The first player to have all eight of his or her marbles on the board at the end of his or her turn wins the game.&#10;&#10;For beginners and perpetual games the following rule applies to the standard 7 x 7 game.&#10; 30-Rounds Rule (Optional, recommended for beginners): If a game lasts for 30 rounds (60 player turns), play stops and the outcome is determined. If either player has a majority of marbles on the board that player wins, if not, the game ends in a draw. Players can use a spare token to keep track of rounds by using the outside edge of the board. Once around is 28 steps. Two more rounds and the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Toscana has simple rules.  Both players have 16 tiles (which are divided into 8 squares in a 2x4 grid).  The squares show either red roofs or gray plazas.  One set, used by the 'roof' player, has roofs on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  The other set, used by the 'plaza' player, has plazas on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  Each player shuffles their stack of tiles and places them FACE UP before them.  (Thus you can see what your opponent's next tile will be.)  The tiles will be placed onto a 17x17 board.&#10;&#10;Players alternate placing tiles onto the board with a few placement restrictions:&#10;&#10;1) The first tile must cover the center square of the board.&#10;&#10;2) Later tiles must be placed so that at least one square of the player's color touches a square of the player's color on a previously placed tile.&#10;&#10;The object is to form as large area of connected roofs or plazas as possible by the end of the game.  Each tile you have in this connection scores one point.  There are little 'tiddly wink' markers to aid in this counting process.  Each player tallies the tiles in their largest connected group, and the player with the greatest total wins.  The rules call for two games, with players alternating sides in the two games.&#10;&#10;The only other feature of the game is the veto.  Each player has the opportunity to 'veto' an opponent's tile ONCE per game.  A chip is simply placed atop the tile atop your opponent's stack to indicate that you are 'vetoing' that tile. The tile is placed on the bottom of his stack and will likely never rise to the top during the game.&#10;&#10;The game is VERY easy to learn and plays quickly... 20 to 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Banque Fatale, players bid with colorful chips for cards (called Card Fatales) which show an Ace or Aces in the 5 colors. The value of the colors start at 6 million and rise and fall according to the total chips played. The most dominant color bid rises by 2 million (as long as there were at least 2 chips of that color submitted). But if only one chip of a certain color was bid, that color falls by 1 million. If no chips of a color were bid, that color tanks in value all the way to the bottom of the chart (only worth 2 million now). If a color reaches 11 or 12, there is a pay-out for each Ace of that color owned by all the players (5 or 6 million), and that color's value is reset to 6 million.&#10;&#10;Then the bid chips are drafted back, one by one, starting with the player to the left of the auction winner. So if you didn't bid at all, you'll be taking chips from high bidders.&#10;&#10;Finally, then the starting player can sell a Card Fatale to the bank at its current value or values (cannot sell the card just won in the auction). The player clockwise to the starting player is now the starting player. When the deck of 16 cards runs out, cards held are cashed out, chips still held are worth 1 million each (variant suggests they are worth nil), and the most cash wins.&#10;&#10;It isn't clear if players should hide the cards they own, or if it should be an open knowledge game, which would greatly affect the dynamic. An amusing mechanism that draws you to brinkmanship.&#10;&#10;Simple and smart, you'd reckon this was a Knizia game, but it's not!&#10;&#10;",

Instead of dice you play with playingcards.&#10;The first round everyone gets 5 playing cards. The second and third rounds everyone gets 4 cards. At the end of the third round all the cards are shuffled and then the second three rounds begin, until one pair has won the game.&#10;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t have a King or Ace in your hand, the very first round, you must put your 5 cards aside and take 5 new ones. Repeat this until you have at least one of those cards.&#10;&#10;When it&rsquo;s your turn you play a card in the middle and do what you have to do.&#10;To set a pawn on the starting position (the colored point in the color of your pawns) you have to put down a King or Ace.&#10;If you can play a card you have to do so, even if it&rsquo;s bad for you or your partner.&#10;If you can&rsquo;t play a card anymore you put down all your remaining cards in the middle. Your turns are over in this round.&#10;&#10;If everyone has put down all of their cards, this round is over and another round can begin.&#10;&#10;These are the actions:&#10;&#10;Ace: put a pawn (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) on your starting space or a pawn 1 place ahead.&#10;King: put a pawn (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) on your (or your partner&rsquo;s) starting space.&#10;Queen: move a pawn (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) 12 spaces forward.&#10;Jack: swap a pawn (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) with one of the other players&rsquo; pawn.&#10;Seven: move 1 or 2 pawns (yours or your partner&rsquo;s) a total of seven spaces forward.&#10;Four: a pawn has to move 4 spaces backwards.&#10;&#10;When a pawn is standing on its own colored space, this pawn may not be beaten, nor swapped with a Jack, nor be overtaken.&#10;&#10;With any other card you have to go forward spaces as shown on the card. During the whole game you can beat other pawns if you land on them. The beaten pawn has to go back to its place at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;With 4 players you play with 1 deck of cards. With 6 players you play with 1.5 decks of cards.&#10;&#10;_&#10;Shares many similarities with DOG and Partners.&#10;&#10;",

As one of the Faction Leaders, you'll guide your people to colonize Earth-017. Manage your resources, employ your workers, exploit what the planet has to offer to the fullest in this hexagon game of sci-fi civilization. But remember: the planet is far from deserted!&#10;&#10;Terra-017 is a strategic game of hexagon placement, that will let you build colonies on a planet while repelling the alien resistance. Since the first moments you'll realize that the game recalls classics like StarCraft and that it will let you see your colonies grow and develop before your eyes, all illustrated by the excellent art of Valeria Rossi. It's a game in which the ability to plan long term and to react to unexpected player moves or events have equal weight. The hexes represent various buildings you can build and there is a limited number of them, so you'll have to choose an effective strategy to take hold of them and at the same time work towards the objectives that will net you points at the end of each of the three in-game years. Some hexes will give you resources to build, while others will have special abilities, usually activated with your workers. There is going to be a constant struggle with the other players to build the best colony, but pay attention to the annual alien attack, that could do some serious damage to your colonies if you don't prepare in time!&#10;Each year is also divided in the four seasons, each with its own deck of events that will influence the game, forcing you to adapt. Knowing when to build, recruiting new workers or activating special abilities is the key to success.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Our beloved Martians from Gardens of Mars have travelled to Jupiter&rsquo;s moon Io. They&rsquo;ve also improved their gardening techniques to avoid stepping on the flowers as they move around the garden. Now they toss rapid-growth seeds from the outside of the garden instead.&#10;&#10;Help your little Martian gardener plant flowers to create the grandest, most beautiful garden on Io. The Martian with the greenest thumb wins! (Just the thumb: Martians are not green.)&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;- A board representing a garden on Io (81 circles) and a perimetral score track; both checkered for clarity.&#10;- 60 flowers in 6 different colours (10 each)&#10;- A carrying case.&#10;- 6 black Martians in 3 types (2 each)&#10;- 4 white Martians in 2 types (2 each)&#10;- 3 trees (black cones)&#10;- 5 black counters&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Players take turns in clockwise order planting flowers on the garden by tossing seeds diagonally or orthogonally from the perimetral scoring track. Then they move their martian a number of empty spaces forward on the score track equal to the number same-colour contiguous flowers that are connected to the one they've just planted forming a group, including that flower.&#10;&#10;They can also perform one of the 5 special actions before planting a flower, but only once per game. They also get an already planted flower from the board back each time their martian crosses the finish line.&#10;&#10;When one of the players runs out of flowers, the martian furthest along the scoring track wins the game (laps count!) .&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vendel to Viking is a standalone prequel to Pax Viking for 1 to 6 players. While inspired by the clever mechanisms of Pax Viking, Vendel to Viking includes some significant differences in the game system as well as taking players back to the centuries prior to the Viking era. In Vendel to Viking, you are immersed in Nordic culture between 550 to 800 CE as you build your family&rsquo;s legacy with every turn.&#10;&#10;You represent a family in one of the Nordic cultures that evolves into one of the prominent families of the Viking era. Each turn represents a generation and you seek to include the best formidable persons in your family as you evolve from generation to generation. You place family members on the map and use them for accessing different effects in various locations, such as worker actions or for even elevating them into a formidable person. When elevated to status, the family member is linked to a character card taken from a market and moved to an achievement tree. The Character goes to your family board and both their presence in the achievement tree and on the family board affects your family&rsquo;s opportunities for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;You must plan well before the centuries run out! The first to hold two Future-level achievements in the achievement tree wins. If no player manages to do so before a set number of turns, the one with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In addition to having a robust Solo Mode, the end state of Vendel to Viking will interface with the starting state of a game of Pax Viking making it possible to play the two games as a Campaign.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Archie's War: The Battle for Guadalcanal is a 1 to 2 player wargame on the climactic battle in the Pacific in 1942 between the US Marines and Japanese military that can be played in 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;In the solitaire game you are Alexander &quot;Archie&quot; Vandegrift, commander of the 1st Marine division tasked with holding Guadalcanal against the Japanese.  Your Marines are tough but isolated as the Japanese build up around you.  Your biggest asset is Henderson Field, a small airstrip that gives you control of the sea lanes during the day; at night, the Japanese sneak in boats with men and supplies, and sometimes bombard the field directly.  You must weigh the various threats against you and defend the island until relief comes.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game you take the role of the Japanese commanders, trying to take back Guadalcanal or of Vandegrift, the American commander, trying to hold on to Henderson Field.  The status of Henderson Field depends primarily on the state of the runway, which the Americans are constantly trying to improve while the Japanese bombard it by air, land, and sea.  As the Japanese player your troops slowly arrive, and it is difficult to build enough force to gain a clear advantage.  Also, the Marine artillery and light tanks with Vandegrift are a decisive factor when they are able to engage in battle.  You must always use the jungle and fog of war to hide your troops as they maneuver for attack against the Marine perimeter around Henderson Field.  Also, you have one advantage, your navy, which can bombard the Marine positions.  As Vandegrift, you must protect the airfield from Japanese attack and bombardment.  If they are able to close in and bring their artillery into range of the airfield all is lost.&#10;&#10;",

Players are building their game zone using Workers and Guardians. The game zone is a place where the Workers are gaining gold. Units in the player's game zone may be destroyed by other players. Guardians are used to protect Workers and allow them to collect more gold. Rogues are used to destroy other players units, steal their gold and their cards. A Merchant allows to trade gold for cards or action points. Traps are used to counter other players cards.&#10;&#10;A player's turn has two phases: generation phase and action phase. During the generation phase a player receives 1 action point, 1 card and a certain amount of gold determined by his game zone units. During the action phase players are simply playing their cards. To play a card, players need to spend their action points. There are three types of card costs: two action points cost, one action points cost and free action points cards.&#10;&#10;There is a board with numbers representing gold amount from 0 to 50 Each player puts his token on the board and changes its position when his gold amount is growing or decreasing.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player hits 50 (or more) gold on the board.&#10;&#10;",
