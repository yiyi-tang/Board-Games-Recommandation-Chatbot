To attract others to your cause you&rsquo;ll need to give them a reason to do it. As one of dozens of unique leaders, you&rsquo;ll need to amass unique assets such as The Hydroponic Farm, The Gunsmith&rsquo;s Shop, and The Abandoned Surgeon&rsquo;s Office and others. Every asset has unique abilities which will enable you to attract other survivors to your cause.&#10;&#10;Survivors will rally to your cause once they have someone who can lead them and provide food and shelter. They&rsquo;ll fight and die for you and others in the camp. However, they aren&rsquo;t simple pawns in a game of survival, each one of these people have unique skills and abilities which can change outcomes of battles and effects of disasters. You&rsquo;ll team up with dozens of unique survivors, such as The Young Patriots, Kim the Farmer and or Jose The Welder or several others. Each survivor has unique sets of skills you can combine in order to help you prosper and stay alive.&#10;&#10;Once you have assets and people, you&rsquo;ll need to equip them properly. Barter with other players or use the Trade Post and equip your followers with everything from a Shank and Molotov Cocktails to Drones and Gatling Guns or one of dozens of other unique pieces of gear. Each equipment has special abilities and effects that can turn the tides of war with a roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;Once you have something worth taking, others will come for it. Those who believe in taking other than earning their keep will be even more brutal and hungry after the collapse of society. You&rsquo;ll need to defend your survivor compound against attackers of all kinds, everyone from Biker Gangs and Hungry Mobs to Your Crazy Neighbor and an Angry Drunken Dwarf and a lot more.&#10;&#10;The local government will notice your growing power and they will exercise their right to take control of everything you&rsquo;ve built. They&rsquo;ll send everything from The Marines and The National Guard to The Diplomat and The Property Tax Collector. Will you let them take what they want, fight them off or try to join them?&#10;&#10;In the midst of it all, keep your guard up against other Leaders who will try to expand their influence by taking you out of the game. Use whatever destiny sends your way in the form of Chance Cards such as The Voodoo Doll, Lightning Bolt and a Runaway Goat to try stay on top and win the game.&#10;&#10;Nature, accidents and the unexpected will also try to wipe you out. Pandemics, Heart Attacks, Ebola, Earthquakes and Nuclear Attacks are just a few of the catastrophes only the prepared will survive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Castles, Wizards, Archers and Knights are also part of the game; use them with a good strategy and remember that there can only be one King, so....&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Each player controls a capital and starts the game with 2 infantry units, 1 archer, 1 garrison counter and 1 armoury.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a maximum of 24 turns.&#10;&#10;In his turn, each player can do the following actions in any order he wants:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Collect production from all their territories&#10;     Acquire constructions&#10;     Purchase units&#10;     Move your units around the board&#10;&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved using custom six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;To win you have to conquer a number of capitals or territories depending on the number of players. If all 24 turns are exhausted and no player has won, then the winner will be the player with the most territories and capitals.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "UFM: Football Highlights is the first game of the series of board games about the football (soccer) club management.&#10;&#10;It's about the best moments of football matches.&#10;&#10;You are the manager of one of the two underdog (mediocre) clubs which eager to be real glory hunters.&#10;&#10;In the game, you have to determine the formation of footballers on the field, give instructions to players, strengthen the team by newcomers, learn and use new formations. There are referees, red cards, injuries, penalties, substitutions and everything is like in real football.&#10;&#10;You have to rise from mediocre team to the winner of the first UFM trophy - Underdogs Cup.&#10;&#10;Game components are divided into 5 envelopes. In each of those is the card of the referee appointed for the upcoming match, new or additional components, as well as brief rules on how to use them. The scenario and rules will become more complicated with the growth of your experience. In the final you have to fight for the Underdogs Cup.&#10;&#10;In first envelope you get team with 15 players and the most popular formation 4-4-2. Each player has attack and defend skills. There are also cards &quot;match events&quot; and referee card. Every referee has own preferences. First one is loyal. There are in the game different referees: strict, very strict, unfair, undecided, etc.&#10;&#10;You don't need to play full match. Instead of it you have to play 3 attacks, named &quot;highlights&quot;, in every time of match. &quot;Highlight&quot; is finished when goal scored or team lost the ball. All footballers lay face down in starting formation and attacking manager choose one of them and open his card. Defending manager choose one of his players and open his card in front of attacking player. Then they roll dices (d10) and add result to attack and defend accordingly to their players. After each &quot;highlight&quot; you have to open &quot;match event&quot; card. And make all actions from it. Every effect of &quot;match events&quot; depends on the referee of the match.&#10;&#10;In the next envelopes you get &quot;team instructions&quot; cards which helps to affect actions at the field and to decrease random.&#10;&#10;After completing the scenario with Underdogs Cup, you will get more freedom to act. You can open the last envelope with additional formations, referees, and game currency. For this money you can buy your own players. There will be also stickers to improve skills of your players and tournament cards for playing your own tournaments.&#10;&#10;Underdog - the weakest of two or more rivals. Literally meaning is &quot;lower dog&quot;. The term arose by the end of the XIX century in the US during the dog fights. Often losing dog usually lies next to the paws of the winner or literally under it. The more surprising thing was its unexpected victory over a strong opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Primeval continues the theme of 'honour' as a fundamental element of tribal life and combat - which determines who actually 'wins' a game, through the actions of the protagonists in battle.&#10;&#10;Primeval goes back to the ere of the Dawn of Man, when humanity was first establishing itself across the harsh landscapes of a prehistoric world. Humanity's fight for survival and ultimately supremacy provides a world of interesting gaming opportunities! The constantly emerging finds in the field, which challenges us all to reassess who we are, and where we come from, inspired us to research and game in the era of Primeval man.&#10;&#10;In Primeval there are: new skills (including rules for dog companions); 4 new prehistoric factions (Neanderthal, Cro-Magnon, Hominids and Denisovans); 4 new scenarios; a mini-campaign called 'The Hunt'; and rules for playing animals in scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Then all players race to find the disc with the correspondent lower case letter, or picture/word stating with the sound of that letter.  The first person to find it gets to keep that disc and the person with the most discs at the end wins.&#10;&#10;To enhance the game play there are starfish, crabs and the shark.  If you find a disc that uncovers a starfish you must give one of your discs to another player.  If you find a crab you get to take one from someone else, and if you flip over a shark card you must feed a disk to the hungry shark.  (There are four shark cards in the deck.)   The shark is a 3D plastic toy with a lever on the back that allows the shark to actually eat the disks.&#10;&#10;The instructions come in English, French, Spanish and German and you could play level one in any of those languages, but to play level 2 you have to play in English.&#10;&#10;",

In this performance, acrobats climb over each other to form columns with up to 10 artists &quot;performers&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players can built simultaneously up to five of these human columns. Although the columns are built together, teams compete with each other for the public recognition that comes in the form of applause.&#10;&#10;An act (one game round) ends when at least two columns are completed. At this point the audience applauds enthusiastically.&#10;Obviously these applauses are directed to the teams whose acrobats have participated the most on the completed columns. Then these artists leave the scene to get some rest.&#10;&#10;Acrobats that participate in the incomplete columns remain on the scene and also receive applause for their teams; after all supporting artists also have their importance in the show.&#10;The whole show lasts for three acts. In the end of the third act the &quot;grand finale&quot; takes place. Each player scores its last applause points and some bonus points are awarded too.&#10;&#10;The player, whose team has most impressed the audience during tonight&rsquo;s presentation (gathered the most applause points) will be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Getting the necessary signatures to build the elevated train took both cash and guile.&quot; -- Charles Yerkes, Chicago, 1894&#10;&#10;It is the 1880&rsquo;s, and Chicago rises like a phoenix from the ashes of the Great Fire. Rail is king in this city on the grow. As a power broker, your pockets are lined by train companies competing to build the new elevated rail system, &ldquo;The Loop.&rdquo; In this game, players work together to build the loop while hiding which line they work for, because everyone is scheming for a big piece of this corruption pie.&#10; In the Loop is a 2-4 player game of puzzle building, tactical planning, and secret motives.&#10;&#10;Objective: Line your pockets by connecting lines and working to make your line the best. You earn money in two ways: during gameplay, you earn money by connecting lines to route cards. After the game has finished, you earn additional money from the syndicate you secretly work for. Don&rsquo;t let other players deduce who you&rsquo;re working for or they will try to block you. The game ends shortly after the Loop has been completed.&#10; Quick gameplay summary: On your turn, you will place two line cards and one route card. You can also spend your money to make bribes to buy cards or remove previously played cards. Keep in mind that the winner is the player with the most money in the end, so spend wisely! Each turn, you will earn money for each line that connects to the route card you played, and at the end of the game, you will earn money for each time your line appears and each time it connects to a station. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;As God may help, it appears to me that all the flower and honor of chivalry is there, most wisely and expertly drawn up.&quot; -- John Chandos, before the Battle of Auray (29 September 1364)&#10;&#10;The Hundred Years War (1337 to 1453) was a dynastic struggle between the English house of Plantagenet and the French house of Valois for control of the French throne. Armies from across Europe would ally with these families, spreading combat as far from Gascony as Scotland and Portugal. Chivalry rose and fell on the backs of personalities like the Black Prince, Charles the Bad, and Pedro the Cruel, fought over battlefields at Cre&ccedil;y, Poitiers, and Agincourt. By the end of this period, the military code of chivalry would be in ashes and from those would be born the nations of England and France.&#10;&#10;Chivalry At Bay is a low to medium complexity game depicting many of the individual battles that made up the Hundred Years War. Players control armies involved in each conflict that attempt to drive their opponent from the field of battle. Each battle can be completed in roughly two hours, allowing several battles to be played in a single sitting. The game takes several novel approaches toward simulating these eighteen individual battles:&#10;&#10;LA CAPELLE (HYPOTHETICAL) - 23 October 1339&#10;SAINT-OMER - 26 July 1340&#10;MORLAIX - 30 September 1342&#10;AUBEROCHE - 21 October 1345&#10;BLANCHETAQUE - 24 August 1346&#10;CRE&Ccedil;Y - 26 August 1346&#10;NEVILLE&rsquo;S CROSS - 17 October 1346&#10;CASSEL - 8 June 1347&#10;B&Eacute;THUNE - 13 June 1347&#10;POITIERS - 19 September 1356&#10;COCHEREL - 16 May 1364&#10;AURAY - 29 September 1364&#10;NAJERA - 3 April 1367&#10;PONTVALLAIN - 4 December 1370&#10;ROOSEBEKE - 27 November 1382&#10;ALJUBARROTA - 14 August 1385&#10;HUMBLETON HILL - 14 September 1402&#10;AGINCOURT - 25 October 1415&#10;&#10;Rather than the typical hex-based movement system, Chivalry At Bay uses a map that is broken up into three individual columns (or &quot;battles&quot; to use the historical term), each of which is made up of five &quot;ranks&quot; ranging from a friendly rear area, to and advance area, central area, through the enemy advance and rear areas. Units move backwards and forwards through these areas to more accurately simulate the type of movement that took place historically as waves of knights and men-at-arms advanced and were thrown back by enemy defenders (such as the feared English bowmen). Special terrain tiles may be placed in specific areas to more accurately simulate the ground over which the armies fought.&#10;&#10;Combat is a simple process involving a &quot;buckets-of-dice&quot; system where &quot;hits&quot; on enemy units are based upon a unit's ability rating. Units range from lowly levies to the cream of chivalry, the French knight. Also represented are long bowmen, crossbowmen, men-at-arms, bill and pikemen, and light cavalry. Units that take hits may withdraw towards their friendly areas or hold their position and be ground down by the enemy onslaught. Units that have sustained enough damage may rout from the field!&#10;&#10;&#10;The core of the game system is a deck of action cards. Each card provides a random number of command points that army leaders use to activate units on the battlefield to advance into engagement or withdraw before they're destroyed. The number of cards a player has available is based upon the quality of the army leadership. Several of these cards also allow the opportunity for players to &quot;purchase&quot; temporary army enhancements such as increased unit ratings or combat bonuses or even events that can shift the momentum of a battle.&#10;&#10;In addition to the eighteen historical battles depicted, Chivalry At Bay provides players the ability to quickly and easily create their own custom armies to experiment with tactics and fight out battles on their own terms.&#10;&#10;From La Capelle to Agincourt, relive the blood and glory of the Hundred Years War with Chivalry At Bay!&#10;&#10;SUN OF YORK OWNERS! Use the fully mounted map board and game pieces of Chivalry at Bay to bring your Sun of York game alive!

The Russian player must deal with low morale at the front and at home to win the war to keep Chechnya within the Russian Federation. The Chechen player is outgunned and outnumbered, but can wage an effective guerrilla campaign to bog down the entire Russian effort and thereby achieve independence. There is a total of nine game turns covering two years of conflict, from December 1994 to December 1996. The game map encompasses Chechnya and surrounding territories (Georgia, Ingushetia, Dagestan). Included on the counter sheet are Bonus counters for Modern War #1 (Red Dragon/Green Crescent), Modern War #18 (Green Beret), Modern War #21 (Kandahar) and errata counters for Modern War #17 (Dien Bien Phu).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sixth Fleet is a two-player, strategic-level wargame of the struggle for the Mediterranean set during a hypothetical Warsaw Pact versus NATO war during the 1970s and 1980s. It is primarily a naval-air conflict, with some elements of power projection using ground forces. The game map represents various sea zones (or zones) within the Mediterranean, as well as adjoining land areas. Critical bases for both sides, including neutral nations are also depicted.&#10;&#10;Aircraft units represent one to six squadrons, with the counter displaying the primary type of aircraft. Ship units represent one fleet aircraft carrier or battleship and &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; of four cruisers or nuclear-powered submarines with destroyers being represented in squadrons of six to eight destroyers or non-nuclear subs. Other ship types are represented at the division level and represent various numbers of ship types. On the map, each inch equals 20 miles. Each turn represents from one day to one week of activity, depending on the level of activity. Sixth Fleet is based on Red Dragon Rising. Changes have been made based on the situation in the Mediterranean during the Cold War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Dragon that Engulfed the Sun is a two-player operational-strategic-level wargame simulating a hypothetical Chinese invasion of Japan. The premise of this game is a sudden war has erupted on the Korean peninsula, compelling China to intervene in the conflict&mdash;this time well before the United States could reinforce South Korea sufficiently to prevent it from being overrun. The Chinese realize there may never be another opportunity to completely extirpate the US from the Asian mainland, they have irrevocably committed themselves to this path, and thus it is their resolute intention to finally settle old scores with the Empire of the Sun. The map covers the militarily significant terrain of Japan and surrounding areas. Each hex on the map equals ~36 miles (58 kilometers) from side to side. Each game turn represents about a week. Playing pieces represent divisions and brigades, as well as occasional regiments and even battalions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;The Central Pacific Campaign&quot; is a solitaire, strategic-level wargame of the struggle for control of the Central Pacific during World War II. The solitaire player is commanding the US forces and the system controls the Japanese forces. The player wins by accomplishing historic campaign milestones ahead of what was done historically, thereby opening the way for an earlier invasion of Okinawa or Formosa. Most ground units represent divisions, brigades or regiments. Aircraft units represent two groups or regiments (six to eight squadrons), and are each identified by the primary type of aircraft in those units. Ship units represent one fleet aircraft carrier, divisions of two light or escort carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, squadrons of six to eight destroyers and one light cruiser. The map is drawn to emphasize the strategically critical zones and islands in the Central Pacific. Each grid box on the map is 300 miles from side to side. Each turn represents one month.&#10;&#10;",

This battle primarily involved the Australian 9th Infantry Division, as well as British artillery batteries that were tasked to prevent the capture of Tobruk harbor by the German 5th Light Division. Each game turn represents approximately six hours. Game turns are not divided into separate friendly and enemy turns, but rather they are comprised of numerous individual headquarters activations. The map represents the western half of the Tobruk fortifications in 1941.

    "Description": "Operation Typhoon is a solitaire operational-strategic simulation that covers the final advance toward Moscow of Germany&rsquo;s Army Group Center late in 1941. The player actively commands the German forces, while the rules system directs you in the handling of Soviet forces. The system allows the player to plan and execute his advance towards Moscow with the Soviet defending forces being randomly created in each hex dependent on the terrain. You win or lose, ultimately, based on the timely seizure of key areas on the map. Each game turn equals one or two weeks. Each hexagon represents 7.5 miles (12 km) from side to opposite side.&#10;&#10;Though designed for solitaire play, Operation Typhoon is easily adaptable to cooperative team play. One person can administratively handle the Soviets while the other actively commands the German force. Alternatively, one player can command the three northern German armies and panzer groups while the other commands the three southern formations. The game map represents the terrain in the operational area of Moscow, with each unit representing the historical German divisions and generic randomly generated Soviet defending forces.&#10;&#10;Uses the Panzers East solitaire system.&#10;&#10;World at War #65, April-May 2019&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The third battle was originally intended by the Japanese to gain control of the city and prevent Chinese forces from reinforcing the British forces engaged in the defense of Hong Kong. When Hong Kong fell on 25 December, the Japanese decided to continue the offensive to gain control of Changsha thereby dealing a major blow to the Chines war effort.

Players control either the Persian empire and its generals, Xerxes, Artabazus, Artayntes, Artemisia and Mardonius or the Greek city-states and their generals, the Athenians Xanthippus, Miltiades and Themistocles and Spartans, Leonidas and Pausanias. The game is divided in two periods of 7 rounds each. During the first period, from 494 to 480 BC, the Persians are on the offensive, unleashing their invasion in Asia Minor, Thrace and the rest of the Greek peninsula, with their goal to conquer citites from their secret Objective card, while the Greeks try to prevent them from doing so. Once the first period is over, the Persian side announces the number of cities conquered from its objective. Moving to the second period, from 480 o 466 BC, the Greeks mount a counterattack, in an attempt to liberate as many cities as they can from their secret Objective card. In a similar fashion, the Persians try to prevent the Greeks from achieving their goal. With the second period over, the Greek side announces the number of cities liberated from its objective. The number of cities conquered/liberated are compared and the side with the most cities conquered/liberated wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
