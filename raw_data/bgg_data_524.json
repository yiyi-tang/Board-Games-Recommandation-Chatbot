    "Description": "A deck of cards that adds missions to Risk 2210 (similar in some ways to the way the Mission Deck does in regular Risk).  Cards are color coded (in red, amber, and green) for difficulty and the deck can be altered accordingly.  Included are rules for various ways of incorporating the 20 card deck into the base game.&#10;&#10;Here at last we have something that has been sorely lacking from the new game since its initial release. One of the main difficulties that has arisen in the game is the fact that a single game can go on for a very long time, and even with the introduction of the 5 turn limit a single game can still go on for a number of hours. With this brand new pack of twenty mission cards players are once again put back in charge of the game.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Gradings:&#10;&#10;     Each mission card has been given a difficulty grade as is highlighted in the top right hand corner on the flip side of each card. The cards are graded green - easy, amber - moderate and red - difficult. What this grading means is that players have more control over the length of time that they&rsquo;ll likely spend playing each game. For example, removing all of the red graded (difficult) mission cards, players can hopefully limit the length of game play. On the other hand, by removing the green graded (easy) mission cards this could theoretically greatly extend the length of play. With the time constraints, it&rsquo;s up to you to choose which cards to keep and which to leave.&#10;&#10;&#10;When:&#10;&#10;     When should the mission cards be chosen? Depending upon the mission itself some could offer an unfair advantage if they were chosen prior to all initial reinforcements (those placed before bidding for turn order) having been placed on the board. To therefore avoid this, the mission cards should be chosen at random after all initial reinforcements have been placed, but before the first turn order bidding process has taken place. One thing to bare in mind prior to mission selection is to remove any irrelevant destroy &lsquo;x&rsquo; cards if not playing with five players.&#10;&#10;&#10;A Matter of Points:&#10;&#10;     Although there are no set rules as to how players should play with this set of missions cards, here are a few suggestions as to how they can be used to enhance game play. &#10;&#10;&#10;* Players can choose to work on the basis of a one mission win i.e. as soon as one mission is completed then the player completing that mission has won.&#10;    * Alternatively, a game could be played on a points basis with each grade of mission being awarded points i.e red = 3, amber = 2 and green = 1, and each game having a pre-agreed points target. Once that target has been reached through the completion of missions then you have a winner.&#10;&#10;Players are actively encouraged to play around with the mission rules as best fits their own situations.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Risk 2210 A.D.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introduces a new Aerial Commander to Risk 2210 along with a corresponding deck of Command cards.  According to Insurgency Gaming,&#10;&#10;&quot;Each of these new commanders, once brought into play, allows the player who owns them to fly a Sortie at the beginning of each of their turns prior to making a standard attack.  &#10;FLYING A SORTIE &#10;Each sortie flight takes part in three of distinct stages:&#10;1. Outbound Flight&#10;2. Bombing&#10;3. Return Flight &quot;&#10;&#10;Purchase price includes two Aerial commanders and the 20 card deck.&#10;&#10;Card distribution:&#10;&#10;3 x Propaganda&#10;&#10;3 x Resurrection &#10;3 x phoenix &#10;3 x Storm Troopers&#10;&#10;2 x Kamikaze  &#10;2 x Aerial Assault &#10;2 x Air Raid &#10;1 x Dark Angel&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;&#10;Aerial Command Token:&#10;&#10;     The major change brought with the Aerial Assault command deck is the introduction of the new Aerial Commander. Unlike previous expansion decks, the Aerial Assault deck comes with two neutral colored commanders in order to slot directly into game play as and when required. Each of these new commanders, once brought into play, allows the player who owns then to fly a Sortie at the beginning of each of their turns prior to making a standard attack. At any point where the Aerial commander is not flying a sortie it may be moved like any other commander and also receives the standard d8 defensive dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;Flying A Sortie:&#10;Each sortie flight takes part in three distinct stages:&#10;&#10;1. Outbound Flight - player rolls a d6 dice to establish the maximum amount of territories the Aerial Commander may fly and moves the commander accordingly. The Commander can move between neighboring territories up to the value on the dice - movement may include both land and water territories even if they are controlled by another player. Once the commander has come to the end of its outbound flight the controlling player may choose to commence bombing, this need not be the case if the commander comes to rest in a territory they control.&#10;    * In such a case the controlling player may simply choose to finish the sortie here leaving the commander in place within that territory.&#10;&#10;2. Bombing - once the Aerial commander has come to rest above an enemy territory the controlling player should roll a d6 dice and follow the appropriate action dependent upon the number rolled...&#10;    * 1 &amp; 2 Plane is hit by flak. STOP ATTACK. Aerial commander receives half d6 roll on return flight.&#10;    * 3 MISS. Commander may continue bombing.&#10;    * 4, 5 &amp; 6 HIT. Destroy one army in the territory being bombed. Bombing may continue. A maximum of threee armies may be destroyed in this fashion before making the return flight.&#10;&#10;3. Return Flight - player rolls a d6 dice to establish the maximum amount of territories the Aerial Commander can move baring in mind any reductions in movement caused by flak damage in the Bombing phase. If the Aerial commander cannot return to a land territory owned by the same player or if it ends its flight above a water territory then it crashes and is destroyed. Once the sortie has ended then that player may continue with the normal run of play.&#10;&#10;Additional Aerial Commanders:&#10;&#10;     Although only two Aerial Commanders are supplied with the Aerial Assault deck, additional commanders can be obtained from Insurgency Gaming. These additional commanders may be bought by any player during the normal purchase phase of play for the standard price paid for commanders and then placed accordingly. &#10;&#10;&#10;What if There&rsquo;s More Than Two Players:&#10;&#10;      Due to the fact that the Aerial Assault deck is originally only provided with two Aerial commanders instead of the five that would ultimately be needed for all players to use them, this is where the two Aerial Assault cards included within the deck come into play, and where their inclusion or exclusion from the deck become of paramount importance. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In the case where only two Aerial commander tokens are available, by playing with standard rules, this would mean that the first two players to obtain the commanders would then have sole use of the Aerial command deck and this have a hugely unfair advantage over the other players. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In order to rectify this, if only two Aerial commander tokens are available, then the Aerial command deck becomes open to all players from the beginning of the game regardless of whether or not a player controls an Aerial commander.

You have 4 different terrain types, Countryside, road, river and railway. Traveling by night you pick a relevant card which has a distance and time these are moved along a track. The longer you are out the more tired you become, but you must find somewhere to rest before daylight comes. some cards are German soldiers but these may be avoided if the conditions are right, if you are challenged I hope your language skills are up to scratch and that the 6 days in the outdoors isn't going to give you away.&#10;&#10;Tactical decisions include how long into the morning are you prepared to travel before you find somewhere to rest for the day, balance this with how good will you be if you were challenged by a German soldier. How far you have to travel before your safe compared to the fact the more days your out the more disheveled you look and therefor more suspicious.&#10;&#10;Other things included are crossing rivers, swimming, boat, or bridge, weather which may change half way through the night. The heavier the rain the less likely you will be challenged but the less rest you will get. Going into a town to seek resistance members but beware the Gestapo and German sympathizers. Stamina, food, blending in, stealing a German soldiers push-bike all take a role.&#10;&#10;",

The only way back is through a small village, but this contains elements of enemy infantry.&#10;&#10;It is a card driven game, and there are two types of card. Terrain cards, which is the pack you are trying to go through as quickly as possible, where the last card is always the Bridge card. There are also Event cards which mainly contain enemy soldiers. Each card has an activation number, the activation level is decided by shuffling activation cards into the Terrain deck. So the further into the village you go the more likely you are to meet enemy opposition.&#10;&#10;You give orders to your crew, spending order points. Example: prepare main tank gun, load main tank gun, move turret, observe etc. Your tank creates noise which attracts enemy soldiers and the terrain you move over may also have a bearing on this as well.&#10;&#10;Combat is a series of dice rolls, not everyone's favourite part of the game but most wargamers will be okay with this. Also included are the use of Sch&uuml;rzen (side skirts), Zimmerit paste, PIAT attacks, a Sherman, and tank traps.&#10;&#10;",

However there came the day when they had counted everything that could be counted in the land of numbers, and they became very sad.&#10;&#10;That's when the little grasshopper remembered an arithmetic game his grandfather used to play with him. He invited the inhabitants in the land of numbers to play with him. So they competed with the little grasshopper, counting and jumping.&#10;Up until today this is the favorite game of all the inhabitants in the land of numbers.&#10;&#10;Dear Parents and Educators:&#10;The game Grasshopper in the land of numbers combines, in a playful way, the physical activity with the learning of numbers. The games stimulate motor skills and acquaint the children, depending on their age and the variation chosen, with the numbers 1 to 10. For children a little older they offer a first approach to adding and subtracting. For the games, it is not always important that there is a winner. Children often have fun resolving a task together.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Pharaoh is dying, and, in a break from tradition, has decided that he will name an heir who will best serve Egypt's interests rather than hand the nation over to his handsome but rather dim-witted first-born son. Each player is the leader of a powerful Egyptian Noble Family with the ambition to rise to the level of Pharaoh. Rival Families will provide stiff competition, and all will have to contend with the force of nature that dictates the pattern of Egyptian life -- the River Nile. In flood the Nile can provide increased harvests but may also damage structures, whereas severe drought will cause starvation and suffering.&#10;&#10;Pharaoh has issued several decrees. He demands a great harvest, sufficient people to build yet another mighty monument to himself upon his death (most likely a pyramid, although occasionally the Pharaohs preferred big cat-like things), as well as in increase in the worship of (read: sacrifice to) his favorite gods. In return for excelling in these areas of ancient Egyptian life, Pharaoh is willing to make you his heir. Oh, yes, one last thing -- Pharaoh also rewards the Families that develop the most valuable buildings and the most desirable land districts...&#10;&#10;Rules can be found on the Piecepack Wiki.&#10;&#10;Game System&#10;&#10;    Piecepack Game System&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A fantasy themed multi-player Mastermind style deduction game.&#10;&#10;&quot;A (not really) fantasy game of deduction for 3-5 players. Five spirits are captured in five amulets. The wizards try to find out their correct placements on the altar to cast the freeing spell. Succeeding means honour, failure means&#10;eternal doom.&quot;&#10;&#10;Designer's note: &quot;This game, years old and deriving from boring school times, is nothing else but a master mind clone, but a funky multi-player one.  Experienced players should not need more than 5-6 questions. This is not really a party game, since all players stare at their notes and beg each active player for a thinking break :) - give it a try.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
