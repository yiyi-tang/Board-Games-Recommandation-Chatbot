Game marker placement is shown on the game board. Command orders and cards are used to shorten the rules. Developed for solitaire play, this game requires you to make great decisions based on good strategy, keeping your wits about you when orders do not turn out well, and pressing on to victory.&#10;&#10;Game play is centered around using Field Commands to issue orders by the Turks or Knights of Maltese commanders to defeat each other. Either side can be defeated by their morale falling too low. The game allows you to play either side against a solitaire opponent that has 3 levels of difficulty.&#10;&#10;Pick the side you want to be, Turks or Knights of Maltese, and then shuffle the solitaire card deck for your opponent. The card mix used by the solitaire opponent differs from game to game so no two games play alike.&#10;&#10;Each commander (solitaire or player) can issue one order per game turn from their Commands available.  Your order is carried out based on your strategy and current situation faced.  Your choice can cause multiple actions and reactions with results that cause troop eliminations, morale reductions, and events to occur.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN THE GAME&#10;&#10;Any time one side's morale reaches zero during a turn, the other side wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players now assign the dice to the pawns and try to determine the highest score possible. The player announcing the highest number before the timer runs out performs his move. &#10;Each pawn moves, in clockwise order, the number of spaces shown on it assigned die and scores 1 point for each pawn on the space it ends its move. If the player managed to meet or exceed his/her predicted number, the player receives a chip from every other player; if not, the player gives a chip to each player and sits out the next round.&#10;The game ends after a player ends up without chips, with twice the original number of chips, or after a predefined number of turns or a set amount of time.&#10;Corona was published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.&#10;The introductionary (and a few other) variation(s) from Corona were republished as 'Moonstar' in 1981 (by Avalon Hill).&#10;Moonstar was rethemed as 'Harun' in 1984 (by Edition Perlhuhn).&#10;In 1993 Corona was republished and got a new variant included  as 'Orbit' (by Franckh-Kosmos).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trike is a combinatorial abstract strategy game for two players. The game revolves around setting traps, dismantling opponent traps, and maneuvering a shared piece into your own trap to win.&#10;&#10;Trike has high clarity due to the simple movement protocol, singular win condition, low branching factor, and easy-to-read board state. However, Trike is dramatic because it offers players many chances to make fatal errors.&#10;&#10;Rules: Play on an equilateral triangular hexagon-tessellated grid. Use a neutral pawn and black/white checkers. Players take turns moving a neutral pawn around on the board (passing is not allowed). The neutral pawn can move any number of empty points, in any direction in a straight line, but cannot move onto, or jump over occupied points. When a player moves the pawn, first they place a checker of their own color, onto the destination point. Then they move the pawn on top of it. When the pawn is trapped, the game is over. At the end of the game, each player gets a point for each checker of their own color adjacent to, or underneath, the pawn. The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Implement pie rule. This means, at the beginning of the game, the first player chooses a color and puts a checker on any point of the board, with the pawn on top of it. At this time only, the second player has a one-time chance to swap sides instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;Trike is partisan, draw-less, finite, cycle-free, always decisive, scalable with board size, and balanced with the pie rule.&#10;&#10;One note on gameplay: the score will always include one point for the last move, and one point for the second-to-last move. Therefore, who plays last has no bearing on who wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game can be played on boards with side length 7 up to 19. However, the smaller sizes (7-10) are meant for those just learning, while sizes 13-15 are standard for serious competitive play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The sheep player must save as many sheep as possible, while the wolf must feast on those sheep.

Count each uncovered sheep; these sheep are safe, and the total number of safe sheep is the sheep player's score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mount Tai is a mountain of historical and cultural significance located in Shandong province, China. Mount Tai is of key importance in Chinese religion, being the eastern one of the five Sacred Mountains of China. According to historical records, Mount Tai became a sacred place visited by emperors to offer sacrifices and meditate in the Zhou Dynasty before 1,000 BC. A total of 72 emperors were recorded as visiting it. Writers also came to acquire inspiration, to compose poems, write essays, paint and take pictures. Hence, a great many cultural relics were left on the mountain. During the reign of Liu Che, Emperor Wu of Han, the Emperor has visited Mount Tai 8 times, praising the deities associated to this mountain. In 90 BC, the elderly aged Emperor spent most of the national strength on military operations, and his crown prince died because of his paranoia, leaving the court and the royal family in a mess. Liu Guang, the King Lu&rsquo;an and nephew of the Emperor, was incurably sick. He decided to allocate the administration of Mount Tai to his sons, hoping to train their abilities of governing.

    "Description": "From the back of the box...&#10;&#10;Early in 1862, a little known General named U.S. Grant overran West Tennessee, taking two river forts and the largest bag of prisoners captured up to that time by an American army.  But as the Union troops advanced on Corinth, the Confederates hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.&#10;GRANT MOVES SOUTH puts you in command of the Tennessee campaign.  As General Grant, you must combine river and overland movement to strike deep into rebel territory against the important points of Nashville, Corinth, Memphis, and Columbus.  As the Confederate General, A.S. Johnston, you must use careful maneuver and counterattacks to prevent the ever-growing torrent of Bluecoats from conquering Tennessee.&#10;&#10;GRANT MOVES SOUTH shows the critical importance of the road net, water movement and the abilities of individual division commanders.  The fog of war is thick as you know where the enemy is, but not how strong he is.  Gunboats attack river forts, and steamers whisk troops deep into enemy territory.&#10;&#10;",

All the creatures in this game have a cost, life, movement and basic strike, and some have additional abilities written on the card.

You can move and act with your creatures in any sequence.&#10;&#10;Berserk: Knights and Villains includes both quick play and full rules inside the box.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the battle nest! You have been dropped as an egg in an unfamiliar nest by your cuckoo mother. When you hatch, you notice that your egg was different than the other eggs. But this is your nest, right? So, you want to throw them out. Looking around, you notice another cuckoo. Your competitor! Will you manage to get rid of all other eggs or lure your competitor into a trap? Start the battle.&#10;&#10;You take alternating turns, with the starting player going first. Your turn consists of moving one game piece on the board, your turn ends after the movement. There are three different game pieces, each with their own rules for movement.&#10;&#10;Game pieces can only move to a space on the board that is empty or occupied by an opponent. Game pieces cannot jump over other game pieces. When you move a game piece to an occupied space, you capture your opponent on this space. Your opponents&rsquo; game piece is then removed from the board and your game piece takes its place. There are two basic rules to keep in mind; 1) if you can capture an opponent, you are obliged to. 2) You can only move your game pieces in a forward direction, except when you can capture an opponent behind you.&#10;&#10;Your movement options lead to two potential situations; 1) you can capture an opponent, or 2) you cannot capture an opponent.&#10;&#10;There are four winning conditions in this battle. 1) All game pieces of your own color are captured, except your own cuckoo. 2) You capture your opponents&rsquo; cuckoo. 3) You enter one of the homebases of your opponent with your own cuckoo, thereby taking over their nest. 4) Your opponent enters one of your homebases with any game piece other than their cuckoo, this game piece is now safe from being captured.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Even if it means doubling their efforts with the help of their companions.&#10;&#10;In this climbing game, players need to play a card equal to or higher than the value of the last card played on the table. However, there are two ways to double the value: play two identical cards or play a card of the same value as the one already on the table. Whether doubling or not, if you can't play a higher value, too bad! All the cards on the table go to your scoring pile. At the end of the round, the more cards in your pile, the fewer points you gain!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The first consonant may not be used by the players in their word but the other consonants may be used and are assigned values of one, two or three. The topic is read aloud and the players must think up a word that fits the topic and uses any or all of the permissible consonants but not the forbidden consonant. The first to think up a word announces it and totals its value. The other players then secretly decide whether anyone else can come up with a higher scoring word. Once the players have voted anyone who thinks a higher scoring can been generated has an additional twenty seconds (a sand timer is included) to announce that word. Points are scored based on who came up with the round's winning word and who voted correctly.&#10;&#10;The final round of the game has the players deciding which of two teams to join secretly. The player who comes up with the highest scoring word on each team scores the most points.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The bigger the city, the more prestige points it can provide.&#10;Players have two optional actions in a turn: to buy resources on the market and to expand Monopolis by adding a new building tile. They can do both in any order, or the same action twice. There are specific resource requirements for inserting a new building tile. These are shown on collectible demand tokens of various colors, placed randomly to the edges of the tiles already on the board. Players can build a desired building by spending the necessary resources and placing their house on the new tile. The houses are stored on their personal board, and when removed, immediate bonuses become available.&#10;There are 5 types of building tiles, some cheaper, others more expensive to build, and the benefits and victory points they provide differ accordingly. Residential areas and parks are the easiest to implement, while business districts will have a positive impact on the value of adjacent areas and vice versa. Public functions require higher investment but they give bonuses and other benefits, and some institutions provide more prestige points.&#10;The city of Monopolis spans an area of up to 7x7 tiles. The game ends with the round when one of the players runs out of houses. The end-game scores are based on the values of the tiles built and the sets of icons collected, but additional points can be earned in a number of ways.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;K&ouml;nnyed, csal&aacute;di j&aacute;t&eacute;k, amelyben 2-4 j&aacute;t&eacute;kos egyetlen k&ouml;z&ouml;s v&aacute;rost &eacute;p&iacute;t  &ndash; preszt&iacute;zspontok&eacute;rt versenyezve.

One round is composed of the two actions of placing one of the twelve polycubes and a balance stone within the confines of the 8 square-gridded base. The cubes of the positioned polycubes dictate the points awarded.&#10;&#10;If a player's tower topples, they lose the game. The game ends when a player's tower topples over or if all the available polycubes have been placed. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;This game is a development of the designer's earlier game Ancient Construct. Since the raw materials were no longer available to make Ancient Construct, the designer revised the game, introducing a strategic element and expanding play to six players.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#133;&#153;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;1&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#143;2&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#167;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#128;&#148;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Tiles can be anything from dirt to hard stone, monsters or treasures. The game ends when both hot spring tiles are found. If the same player found both, he wins automatically; if not, the player with the most points earned from various tiles wins.&#10;&#10;Takara Island features the same gameplay as The Edict of King Budeaunia, but with a different setting and modified artwork.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A member of the Checkers Family very popular in Brasil.&#10;&#10;Brazilian Checkers or Draughts is played under the same basic rules that apply to International Checkers except that it is played on a smaller 8 x 8, or 64-square board with each player playing 12 pieces.&#10;&#10;This variant is started by the player who either wins a random toss of a coin or the player who plays the light colored pieces. Then the players alternately make their moves thereafter.&#10;&#10;Rules of the Game: This checkers variation is played using an 8 x 8, or 64 squares checker board of light and dark squares and each player has 12 pieces of contrasting colors, usually red and white. The board is placed between the two players in such a way that the double corner is on the right side and a dark colored square is on the left side of each player. The player places his pieces on the first three rows on his side of the board&#10;&#10;The Moves of the Men: Checker players can only move their pieces forward one at a time on each empty square to the left or to the right. If a player successfully moves his pieces to the last, or &quot;king row,&quot; then that piece must be crowned &quot;king&quot; by the opponent by placing a second checker on top of the crowned piece.&#10;&#10;The Moves of the King: King pieces are &quot;flying kings,&quot; which means that they can move over many empty squares on the diagonal lines that pass over the square on which they are located.&#10;&#10;Captures: In Brazilian Checkers captures are mandatory. And, maximum captures are compulsory as well, which means that if a player has more than one way to capture the opposing pieces then he must choose that way that will result in the capture of the most number of pieces. If a checker piece reaches the king row while in a capture sequence, it must keep on capturing pieces backward for as long as there still pieces to capture. That capturing piece cannot be crowned king unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.&#10;&#10;Captures by the Men: Men can capture by jumping forward or backward over a single piece that is located next to it only if the square located next to the captured piece is unoccupied. If the man can jump again from its landing square to make another capture, then it must do so because all captures are mandatory.&#10;&#10;Captures by a King: A crowned piece can capture an opponent's piece forward and backward diagonally if it is on the same path where it is located and if the squares between them are unoccupied and that if the square immediately after the piece that will be captured is also unoccupied. The crowned piece can land on any empty square within the same path and if a continuous capture is possible, then the player must keep on capturing even if this move will not redound to the best interest of the player making the capture.&#10;&#10;The Winning Player: A player wins the game if he has captured all of his opponent's pieces or successfully blocked his opponent's pieces such that the opponent is unable to move any of his pieces.&#10;&#10;Conditions for a Draw: The players can mutually agree to a draw. A draw may also happen if the same position has occurred three times during the game, or if there are three crowned pieces playing against one and that both players have made 16 moves without attaining any promotion or making a capture.&#10;&#10;Information from checkershistory.com&#10;&#10;",

The special actions consist of jokers and enchantments, and two of these cards are placed face-up; a joker can replace any ingredient, while an enchantment allows you to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Select one ingredient of your choice &#10;     Switch up to five ingredients of the same color with an opponent&#10;     Steal one ingredient from the cauldron &#10;     Discard up to five ingredients&#10;&#10;&#10;During your turn, you take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Add ingredients: Place one ingredient in each cauldron, after which if each cauldron has two ingredients of the same color or value, you can take one ingredient from any cauldron.&#10;     Taste a potion: Take all the ingredients of the same color or value from one cauldron.&#10;     Cast a spell: Discard the proper mix of ingredients in order to cast a spell. The big Megalos, for example, is composed of nine ingredients of a single color and is so rare that casting it allows you to win the game instantly. The Pentos requires five different ingredients of the same value, and casting it ends the current round. The Mikkros, composed of three ingredients of the same value or three of the same ingredient in consecutive values, allows you to take two special action cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player casts a Pentos or the ingredient deck runs out, the round ends, although players with ingredients in hand can still play card suits of the same color. Each ingredient in a suit earns you 1 Ko&acirc;, while an isolated ingredient is worth its value in Ko&acirc;s.&#10;&#10;After three rounds or a Megalos spell, the game ends. In the latter case, the Megalos-casting player wins; in the latter, the player with the most Ko&acirc;s is immediately turned into a toad.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You've ventured in an unknown mysterious Egyptian pyramid. As you discover the ancient relics of Tutankhanine, you trigger a trap! Your only chance is the stone hallway that disappears in the darkness, but angry mummies are waking up to punish those who entered their tomb. Your objective is clear: Prevent mummies from touching the relics and open a new exit to escape and lift the curse. You have only five torches left. Run! Run! RUN!&#10;&#10;In Run Run Run!, players co-operate to escape from the pyramid. First, they move the mummies using the mummy dice, then they must decide between three actions: explore (place a new card to extend the hallway and find the mechanisms to open the door); fight (roll dice to fend off the mummies and block them from getting the relic); or co-operate (regroup all willing players at the same spot and act stronger together).&#10;&#10;The players win if they exit the pyramid while beating all the mummies, including the boss. The players lose if they run out of room cards or if a mummy reaches the relics.&#10;&#10;",

Players utilize workers to gather resources, build amenities, add activities, recruit donors, obtain donor gifts, hire more workers, staff usable cards, and earn money/victory points.&#10;&#10;Usable amenities and activities are the driving forces for generating money and victory points. Some, however, are not usable every month of the year. Players must create a strategy for sustainable growth over the course of the entire year. Workers must be paid for their efforts each month. Additionally, negative cards, called Misfortunes, must be drawn as your camp grows which may affect your plan for the next round.&#10;&#10;End game bonuses provide additional victory points based on what you have accumulated throughout the game. Bivouac also comes with an expansion that includes activity upgrades and staff member cards that assist in a player's quest to become the best. The player with the most victory points at the end of 13 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Draw too many coins and you might end up helping your opponent!&#10;&#10;As 45s are acquired, they need to be arranged in a 3x3 grid inside your jukebox. When a row or column is completed, their arrangement will affect which public scoring bonuses you can earn and determine if you have completed your private goals. As you fill your jukebox with records, you&rsquo;ll be pulled back and forth between the competing needs of the various scoring objectives. Which ones do you go for? Did your strategy work?

From left to right, the pieces are one through five stars (first rank), moons (second rank) and suns (third rank).&#10;&#10;The pieces move one square diagonally in any direction to a vacant square, or must leap over one opposing piece (only opposing pieces, but without capture - there are no captures in Salta) if the square immediately beyond is vacant. Only one jump is made (no chain jumping), and missed opportunities to jump may be forced by the opponent, although a player is free to choose among several available jumps. Blockading all of the opposing pieces is not allowed, although some may be temporarily blocked as long as the opponent still has a legal move.&#10;&#10;The goal is to be the first player to move all of his pieces seven rows ahead - i.e. into the starting places of the opposing piece. However, the order from left to right and front to back should be kept. Thus, reading from left to right, the goal position is one through five suns (tenth rank), one through five moons (ninth rank) and one through five stars (eighth rank). The player first achieving this position wins by as many points as the number of moves opponent would need to achieve his goal position.&#10;&#10;If neither player reaches the goal position by the time 120 moves have been made by each player, the score is calculated as the difference between the number of moves each player would need to reach the goal position, as if the board were clear of opposing pieces.&#10;&#10;",

With these actions, players can place cards on the table, move cards to heaven, earth and hell, and summon the powers of the virtues and sins on their table and in their hand.&#10;&#10;The goal of Psychomachia is to be the first person to place all seven virtues in heaven or all seven sins in hell, using any permitted combination of the four types of cards found in the game: Sin\\Virtue cards, Heavenly Virtue cards, Deadly Sin cards, and Fate wildcards. Along the way, you can use the special powers of the virtues and sins in your possession to complete your collection first, or prevent other players from completing theirs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a simulation of battleship combat, which abstracts each ship to four numeric attributes: attack, defense, speed and range.&#10;What you get is one 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet, big enough to fight large encounters like the fleet action at Jutland. 400 &frac12;&quot; die cut counters, a 12-page rule-book and two dice. The counters represent WW1 battleships, cruisers and destroyers of various nationalities, plus markers to show ship speed and direction, targets, and damage inflicted.&#10;&#10;[From the back of the box]&#10;&#10;Salvo II is a fast-paced, exciting simulation of surface battleship actions of the First World War.&#10;&#10;Salvo II is the continuation of the popular Salvo! system. Every class of battleship that fought in the English and German fleets is represented, such as Queen Elizabeth, Lutzow, Konig and Lion. Cruisers and destroyers are represented as screening units.&#10;&#10;Play is by scenario with nine historical and hypothetical scenarios presented including Falkland Islands, Dogger Bank, the Battlecruiser and Fleet action of Jutland and Second Heligoland Bight. Hypothetical scenarios explore such things as what if the British and German fleets had clashed on December 16, 1914, one of the most remarkable days of the war in which both fleets narrowly escaped disaster.&#10;&#10;All the essentials of naval warfare are recreated, including gunnery, torpedoes, damage control and fleet formations. Also included are special rules depicting ammunition quality, mines and the environmental aspects of naval combat, such as the position of the sun, wind and stack smoke. The map is big enough to fight large encounters like the fleet action at Jutland. Each hex equals 2000 yards and each game turn represents 10 minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Gunship: First Strike! is Escape Pod Games' core release in a planned series of tactical space combat games. Players fight to win battles in a futuristic civil war with a variety of ship types. From the agile and speedy Fighters, to lethal Gunships and intimidating Capital Ships, every battle is a well-balanced slugfest that comes right down to the wire. Our new Trinity Mechanic uses boards, cards and dice together in an extremely innovative and easy-to-learn system that lets new players jump right in.&#10;&#10;What makes the Gunship series unique are the numerous combinations of ships that the players &quot;build&quot; at the start of each battle. By choosing from an ever-growing selection (through expansions) of available Weapons and Upgrades, players are able to create a custom Gunship that is suited to their particular style of play or battle situation. Some guys are &quot;defensive&quot; minded; they'll choose Heavy Armor, +1 Shield Generators and 4 Blaster Cannons to fend off the enemy Gunship. But another player might prefer to build a &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; complete with wings full of Bombs and an Autoblaster Cannon to shred his way through the enemy Fighter Squadron. While most of the Upgrade cards are geared toward the Gunships (the true star of the show) you can also do some great things to your Fighters and Capital Ships. New kinds of ships will come with every expansion to further add to the possibilities. No two battles are ever the same!&#10;&#10;In Gunship: First Strike!, the civil war has just started. Your orders are simple: Command a task force of one Assault Carrier and its Gunship and Fighters on a mission to destroy the enemy's Carrier. Guess what? He has the very same orders! Dogfights will ensue, Torpedoes will strike home and Thruster Bombs are going to pound the Capital Ships mercilessly. If your Gunship takes too much damage for comfort, or if the battle situation changes and you want a different weapon load, land inside your Carrier for a quick &quot;pit stop&quot;. Make sure that you defend it with all your might because once your Carrier is gone, the only option left to you is to flee the battlespace and hope to take revenge another day.&#10;&#10;As the Gunship universe grows, players will be able to fight bigger and bigger battles. Soon the objectives will include breaking through the enemy picket line to drop troops on the planet below. The Gunships will be called upon to not only assault other ships, but also to go dirtside and give air support to the land battle raging below  A free Campaign System is planned where players can keep track of a fleet of ships and territories. Lose your Carrier in today's battle and you might lose a critical Outpost next week. Don't let the enemy find the Shipyard where your damaged Destroyers limped home last time &ndash; if he does, they're toast!&#10;&#10;",

After the votes are counted, players not only distribute substantial subsidies based on the elected candidates' political platform but also reveal the &quot;support cards&quot; they chose before the game started, showcasing their close relationship with the elected candidate and earning a significant amount of reputation!&#10;&#10;After two elections, the player with the most reputation and treats will be the most skilled manipulator! However, players must be cautious while they strive for influence and snatch treats, at the end of the game, the player with the lowest reputation will face more difficulty before winning!&#10;&#10;How will you incite others and secure your own interests? Pawlitics, the cunning and strategic animal election game. Challenges await you.&#10;&#10;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#228;&#187;&#189;&#231;&#189;&#144;&#231;&#189;&#144;&#229;&#144;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#230;&#177;&#170;&#232;&#136;&#135;&#229;&#150;&#181;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#231;&#136;&#173;&#233;&#162;&#168;&#229;&#165;&#170;&#231;&#189;&#144;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#172;&#190;&#231;&#178;&#190;&#229;&#183;&#167;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#231;&#174;&#161;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#232;&#136;&#135;&#232;&#171;&#135;&#229;&#136;&#164;&#229;&#141;&#154;&#229;&#165;&#149;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#229;&#191;&#171;&#230;&#168;&#130;&#229;&#175;&#181;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#229;&#141;&#179;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#232;&#136;&#137;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#133;&#169;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#232;&#136;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#145;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#229;&#184;&#182;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#233;&#162;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#147;&#141;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#229;&#170;&#146;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#232;&#174;&#147;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#230;&#150;&#188;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#183;&#177;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#128;&#153;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#149;&#182;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#230;&#139;&#137;&#230;&#148;&#143;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#230;&#140;&#145;&#230;&#146;&#165;&#229;&#133;&#182;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#175;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#144;&#231;&#189;&#144;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#233;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#133;&#141;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#183;&#177;&#232;&#186;&#171;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#232;&#163;&#130;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#165;&#189;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#231;&#130;&#186;&#229;&#175;&#181;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#233;&#155;&#153;&#230;&#148;&#182;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#185;&#149;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#230;&#147;&#141;&#231;&#155;&#164;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#175;&#143;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#150;&#181;&#230;&#180;&#190;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#177;&#170;&#230;&#180;&#190;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#170;&#146;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#231;&#173;&#137;3&#229;&#128;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#229;&#160;&#134;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#230;&#149;&#136;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#229;&#140;&#133;&#229;&#144;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#230;&#147;&#141;&#231;&#184;&#177;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#233;&#162;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#139;&#191;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#229;&#186;&#171;&#230;&#136;&#150;&#229;&#176;&#141;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#189;&#144;&#231;&#189;&#144;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#141;&#154;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#232;&#173;&#189;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#228;&#185;&#159;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#232;&#178;&#170;&#230;&#177;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#139;&#130;&#231;&#134;&#177;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#141;&#144;&#231;&#141;&#187;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#229;&#133;&#177;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#154;&#168;&#232;&#145;&#151;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#230;&#150;&#183;&#231;&#136;&#134;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#232;&#136;&#137;&#228;&#185;&#159;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#232;&#191;&#171;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#231;&#156;&#137;&#231;&#157;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#232;&#128;&#140;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#230;&#148;&#191;&#229;&#174;&#162;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#233;&#187;&#168;&#228;&#186;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#170;&#146;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#228;&#185;&#159;&#230;&#156;&#131;&#231;&#130;&#186;&#230;&#148;&#191;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#229;&#162;&#158;&#230;&#183;&#187;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#186;&#155;&#233;&#169;&#154;&#229;&#150;&#156;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#230;&#136;&#150;&#233;&#169;&#154;&#229;&#154;&#135;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#228;&#189;&#160;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#230;&#149;&#136;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#182;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#1

    "Description": "Be a market vendor in Bansan, a lively game inspired by the  multisensory experience of a bustling wet market in Penang. You'll need to &quot;bao ka liao&quot;&mdash;deal with fellow vendors, wholesalers, and customers; buy and sell ingredients; cook and serve hawker stall fare; keep the waste bins from overflowing; and navigate a myriad of events that changes up every game you play.&#10;&#10;Each player is a vendor renting market stalls while running a hawker food business in a bansan. On your turn, you will stock produce from the wholesale supply into market stalls, then take 2 actions from 3 options:&#10;&#10;&#10;     BUY produce from other vendors or your wholesaler&#10;     SELL produce to online customers&#10;     EMPTY a waste bin &#10;&#10;&#10;Just like in local Asian markets, bargain at anytime to negotiate the best deals from other vendors. Then complete shopping lists of ingredients to make a variety of hawker food for your customers. The vendor who has earned the most money at game end wins!&#10;&#10;There's also the Sendiri Mode - a solo way to play Bansan, and the Kenduri Mode - when the market gets a big order to host a feast!&#10;&#10;Juggle the multiple roles of a vendor to win the title of &quot;Bos Bansan!&quot; Even if you get out-vended, you are guaranteed a taste of the chaos and excitement of local market culture in Malaysia!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A massive MoonQuake grants you sudden freedom from your captivity, but there's only one way to Escape--the last rescue rocket, and you need to reach it before the other players.  Use the rotating and revolving 3D moon to gather charges and decide which actions will best meet your goal: finding and stopping others players, readying or stealing key equipment, or finding better ways to hide.  Along the treacherous journey, watch out for shifting and dangerous terrain, out of control defenses, and a relentless prison guard that are out to end your sentence--for life!&#10;&#10;Finding and stopping the other players is your best plan, but each is hiding amongst decoys and traps.  Player interaction focuses on a risk fraught variation of the classic 3-card Monte combined with a thematic &quot;Bluffing&quot; component that completely reverses the &quot;Take That&quot; mechanic.  Can you use protective shields to lure opponents into picking the wrong hiding spot and keep your own plan from backfiring?  Reach the rocket and prepare for a climactic battle--will you be prepared to capitalize on unexpected turn of events? Be the first to launch during the MoonQuake and you've Escaped the competition!&#10;&#10;",

Everybody gives you a crappy &quot;gift&quot; from their hand.&#10;2) You shuffle the cards, turn them over one by one, and pick the gift you dislike the most.&#10;3) The player who gave you that gift gets a point.&#10;4) Draw back up to 5 Gift Cards.

The goal of Crappy Birthday is to get people talking, laughing, and having a good time as quickly as possible. Don't be surprised if some people dislike the same gift that other people at the table love, because the gifts were designed to start fun and interesting conversations.  Crappy Birthday is simple enough that a group of non-gamers can read the rules and start playing within a few minutes.  Or if people do not want to play at the party, they can have fun by simply looking at the cards and laughing at the pictures and funny concepts.&#10;&#10;So the next time you are going to a party with non-gamers, consider bringing Crappy Birthday as a gift.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game takes place at a playground where the players, while controlling groups of kids try to collect as many &quot;happines&#226;&#128;&#139;s points&quot; as they can in 9 rounds by building sandcastles or taking nice pictures of the flowers and insects with their mobile phones. But the cat prowling around the ground can spoil their plans. The players have to take into consideration their opponents' moves to compete with them or even to avoid conflicts. They have to accomplish the special missions too, better than their opponents.&#10;&#10;In Grund, each player controls a bunch of kids at the playground. At the beginning of each round the cat has to be moved to another tile on the board by randomly drawing a movement card (it will affect the tile where it stays). After that, the players have to move all their kids to an adjacent tile (or even further if consuming energy points), one after another in turn. There are special tiles where only a limited number of kids can stay at the same time.&#10;&#10;Once all the kids have been moved, it comes to &quot;conflict&quot; on the tiles with kids belonging to different players to decide who rules the tile. The competing players have to bid energy cards, the one who offers the most will rule the tile (the bidden energy cards have to be exchanged). The winner performs the tile action. The actions can be as follows: get an additional sandcastle part, get a photo of a flower/insect, get an energy card, draw a chance card, call an additional kid onto the ground for 10 energy points, get &quot;happiness points&quot;, etc.&#10;&#10;At the end of the ninth round it comes to the evaluation. The players get &quot;happiness points&quot; for their sandcastles, photo collections, energy points and accomplished missions.&#10;&#10;Grund is a smart combination of a worker placement and an area influence game where your situation awareness, tactical, strategic and trouble solving skills are challenged.&#10;&#10;",

Impeding the motion of the marbles are several plastic gates.  The gates catch the first marble that hits their top (subsequent marbles roll off) and swing back and forth when a marble hits their base.  Using logic, players deduce which way the gates will move when they drop their marble, and try to make a move that results in the most marbles making it to the bottom of the game (or that blocks a potentially good move by their opponent).&#10;&#10;",
