    "Description": "This game is different from the card game Fan Tan.&#10;For the Piecepack Games version, see Piecepack Fan Tan.&#10;&#10;Stewart Culin describes it in his book &quot;The Gambling Games of the Chinese in America&quot; as:&#10;&#10;&quot;a game usually played upon a mat-covered table, with a  quantity of Chinese coins or other small objects which are covered with a cup.  The players guess what remainder will be left when the pile is divided by four, and bet upon the result.  The name means &quot;repeatedly spreading out,&quot; and refers to the manner in which the coins or other objects are spread out upon the table.&quot;&#10;&#10;The equipment needed to play includes:&#10;&#10;The playing mat (called the t'an ching)&#10;Coins, buttons, or something that is numerous and can be spread out&#10;A cup or cover for the coins (called a t'an kun)&#10;A rod used to separate the coins (called a t'an pong)&#10;&#10;It takes two people to run the game, One is called the &quot;t'an kun&quot; (ruler of the spreading out) and the other one is called the &quot;ho kun&quot; who acts as a cashier.&#10;&#10;Culin writes that the game is believed to have been invented by Kwan Chung, a renowned statesmen of antiquity who died in 645BC. Culin also mentions the likelihood that the game was invented for soldiers as a way for them to pass the time in camp.&#10;&#10;This game is identical to the Phillipine game Capona.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description: The First Italy Campaign (1796-1797) was actually the most brilliant military expedition of the French Revolutionary Wars.The Lodi manoeuver was also, strategically thinking, a large flanking operation against Beaulieu&rsquo;s army.&#10;&ldquo;Au pont de Lodi&rdquo; is a simulation of the May 10, 1796 battle, which opened the way to general Bonaparte&rsquo;s triumph over the Austrian Lombardische Arm&eacute;e, leading his Italy&rsquo;s army towards the seize of Milan. The Battle of Lodi was not a decisive engagement, since the Austrian army had successfully escaped. But it became a central element in the Napoleonic myth and, according to Napoleon himself, contributed to convincing him that he was superior to other generals, and that his destiny would lead him to achieve great things.&#10;&#10;The game uses the 'La Bataille series' rules from Clash of Arms. The Rulebook is intended to be a rough guide to tactical warfare in the last Eighteenth Century and in the beginning of the &ldquo;age of Napoleon&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Note: The series rules are not included in the game. Rules from any La Bataille game can be used or they must be downloaded. Both the full rules and the simple Marie Louise rules can be used.&#10;&#10;",

Well... Your wishes have come true.  With The Wild Wigout Comix Gameboards!&#10;&#10;Land o' Sugar was one of seven crazy art boardgames produced by Scairy Hairy Toys, San Fransisco in the early to mid-1990s.  Each was created by a local underground artist and each was handmade, silk-screened and extremely limited.&#10;&#10;Land o' Sugar takes the player into the wonderful world of sugar.  The game requires one pound of hard round candies to play.  It came with a brightly colored silk-screened boardgame with a pinwheel pixie spinner and three mutant sugar eating game pieces. The object of the game was to get to the end without passing out from an over-indulgence of sugar or throwing up.  The game was created by illustrator David Fremont best known for his strange comics and silk-screened concert posters.&#10;&#10;",

The structure of the game allows you to filter through what you've gotten, and you won't be playing most of what you draft. All but the lowest-valued cards have a cost, requiring you to spend cards you've already played. You must either &quot;scrap&quot; a certain value's worth of robots, sending them out of the game, or &quot;upgrade&quot; them, saving those points for later. Balancing the risky but high-valued scrapping bots and the safer but less rewarding upgrading bots, keeping in mind the values and types in your deck's makeup, is central to the game. The game can be played cutthroat with 2 to 4 players or as a partners game of 2 on 2.&#10;&#10;",

The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;Monopoly variant based on Quebec City.&#10;&#10;",

The players roll a die to move and then they must answer a question from the category they land on.

It covers the period of January to August 1944 (&quot;Late War&quot; in the game's parlance), and details the forces available to the major combatants engaged along the European Eastern and Western Fronts (namely, the Germans, British, Americans, and Soviets).&#10;&#10;Fortress Europe is described by the publisher as updating (rather than outright replacing) the previously published intelligence handbook Flames of War: Festung Europa (Late War 1944).  Festung Europa covered the exact same period and (essentially) the same forces.  Accordingly, there is a significant amount of overlap between the two books.  There are, however, notable changes; some point values have been adjusted and some units and special rules have been added, for example.&#10;&#10;Released on November 15, 2008, Fortress Europe is a softcover book containing 160 full-color pages.  At its release, it retailed (in the United States) for $40.&#10;&#10;Product Spotlight&#10;&#10;",

Lost cities, underwater adventure, and maybe even a hard-boiled detective or two.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s about heroes moving from scene to scene at breakneck speed. Hot on the trail or maybe a step in front of the bad guys.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s clever cliffhangers that leave you wanting more.&#10;&#10;But mostly it&rsquo;s all about the story.&#10;&#10;And that&rsquo;s what drives Larger Than Life. In LTL you step into the story and become a Larger Than Life Hero. LTL moves you from scene to scene each with a different challenge. Complete your challenge and move to the next scene. Fail and you&rsquo;re whisked down another road that leads to who knows where. But if you stick to it and if you&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ll complete all the challenges and that will get you what you wanted from the beginning, a shot at the &ldquo;Big Bad&rdquo;. The Big Bad, the Evil Genius, or the Villain&hellip;we prefer to call him the Yin to your Yang because without the &ldquo;Big Bad&rdquo; there&rsquo;s no story. And it&rsquo;s all about the story.

The Velocita (Sprint) race was run like a tournament with different legs and cyclists competing head to head. The 2nd race, called Mezzo Fondo a Motoro, runs over 4 or 8 laps, any number of teams can participate in that race and the cyclists have to follow a derny&lt;sic&gt; there.&#10;&#10;",

As long as you carefully follow the rules for the movement of the pieces, you will be O.K., but the geometry of a concave surface can make things confusing.&#10;&#10;Two lines can intersect in more than one point.  That means that a queen has two different ways to get from point A to point B.  A bishop can change colors and you can even end up with two bishops on the same color.  A rook in the center of the board controls two adjacent rows.  If a knight is near the center, it can land on the same color as the square it left.&#10;&#10;You can win by either checkmating an opponent or by taking enough pieces of value from your opponents before being checkmated.  Thus, aggressive play is often rewarded.  There is a small score board with wooden discs to keep track of points earned (better pieces are worth more points).&#10;&#10;",

Ties are paid by both players into a common pot in the center.&#10;&#10;Dealer's Dice = Players take turns being the &quot;dealer&quot;.  The other players put a number of fingers on the table to guess what the dealer will roll.

A double-six loses all your points you've accumulated for the entire game.  First player to 75 points wins.&#10;&#10;12 Down = Players write down the numbers 1 through 12 on paper and then take turns rolling to cover up as many numbers as possible.  The numbers you can cover are ones that add up to the same total as your die roll.  The player with the most numbers covered wins.&#10;&#10;",
