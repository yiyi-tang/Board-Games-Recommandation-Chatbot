    "Description": "The expansion includes rules for playing Armageddon War solitaire, six solitaire scenarios in a loose campaign, counters and cards.&#10;&#10;Each hex of enemy units in a solitaire scenario will have a &ldquo;stance&rdquo; counter, &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo;, &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; or &ldquo;defensive&rdquo;. When an enemy formation activates, each hex of units will draw a card and act according to the keywords on the card. These are shorthand and more fully delineated in the solitaire rules, but you can get a feel for them from the card. For instance, &ldquo;Close(2)&rdquo; means close 2 hexes with the nearest appropriate enemy unit (if &ldquo;close&rdquo; is in gold you close with armor, red is infantry). &ldquo;Cover&rdquo; would mean movement that utilizes available cover instead of open terrain, and the way you would decide is covered in the rules. Fire would be at the appropriate armor or infantry target, and so on.&#10;&#10;On the player turn, the player draws a card each time a unit declares a movement, to see if an AI unit declares opportunity fire, and when that opportunity fire happens. For instance, &ldquo;Strongest(1)&rdquo; would mean that of all the AI units which can see your unit after it moves 1 hex, the strongest one able to opportunity fire does so. Tie-breaker situations are covered in the rules to determine who does it. For instance &ldquo;Strongest(1)&rdquo; would have a tie-breaker of &quot;Color-Closest&quot;, so if two possible Opfire units had the same firepower, you would check to see if one had the same color firepower as the defense type (armor vs. armor, infantry vs. infantry), and if still tied, then the closer of the two would make the attack.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If you roll the face with the special symbol, you remove 1 action step from the attacker after combat. This means the attacker would not have an action step after firing, or would take 1 less damage from any counterfire. However, this is at the cost of doing 1 less strike to the target you were shooting at.&#10;     Black die (suppression die) - Takes the best attacker faces (star-star and star-shield) and replaces it with star-symbol and shield-symbol. If you roll the face with the special symbol, it does 1 strike to a different unit in the same hex as the original target.&#10;     Green die (shoot &amp; scoot die) - Replaces the star faces (there are two) with a symbol and makes two faces with 1 shield instead of 1 face with 2 shields. If you roll the face with the symbol, you may retreat 1 hex away from the defender after the attack resolves, and this does not count as an extra action step.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quantum Quest is a standalone card game that challenges two or more players to put together teams of stalwart adventurers to outlast their opponents in a living dungeon.  Electrifying spells, sinister traps and treacherous monsters stand in the way of survival, but things only grow more difficult when the heroes start acquiring chambers in the dungeon. Escape is futile; survive while you can!&#10;&#10;In Quantum Quest, each player takes control of a party of five adventurers, and goes through a dungeon of at least twenty chambers, with more added for every additional player over two. This dungeon crawl is always different, thanks to the assortment of cards.  Almost all of these chambers exist for only one purpose: to put the hurting on the adventurers.&#10;&#10;Player's spend mana to control these chambers, which serves two purposes: first, they can no longer harm their owners; second, the owner decides how their enemies take damage when landing on these rooms. It's a fun, spiteful way to come out on top!&#10;&#10;Quantum Quest also benefits from an interesting end-game phase. If all your adventurers perish in the dungeon, you're not kicked out of the game. All the rooms you owned before your untimely demise remain yours, and get a boost since they're haunted. You can choose to deal double damage to your surviving foes when they land in these chambers!&#10;&#10;",

Unlike in the base game, the heroes no longer begin each level with a pre-determined number of Items, nor do they start with any Triforce Shards.  Instead, they must work for every advantage they can get before proceeding into the various dungeons by exploring the land of Hyrule and encountering its many denizens.  Shops will allow you to spend your hard-earned rupees to buy Items; challenges may allow the hero to upgrade his Skill cards to higher levels; and Lore, Quest and Forage encounters may endow the hero with a variety of benefits.&#10;&#10;The concept of the Cogs introduced in the base game is continued above ground, with the landscape of Hyrule shifting and changing between turns.  Many paths exist to allow the hero move from one location to another, but they won't always connect on the ways the hero might want them to.  Players can play their Skill cards to move around Hyrule, as well as allowing them to shift the Location tiles around, permitting them to reach previously unattainable locations.  The treasures that the heroes have gained may also provide shortcuts or otherwise give the players an advantage during encounters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

And the ultimate challenge just got harder with the addition of Ganon himself as the final boss the heroes must face in order to win the campaign!&#10;&#10;Players still use all the resources they have gathered throughout the rest of their adventures - Skills, Items and Treasures - but this time they will have to put them to use manipulating the Boss Action cards that determine how the heroes and boss attack each other.  Boss Action cards come in three types: Strike, Evade and Expose, and it is only by selecting the correct cards each round - maximising the damage to the boss and minimising the damage to the heroes - that will allow the heroes to be triumphant.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

(Boys and girls involved in Lewd Enterprises) Henchmen are stealing every romantic and symbolic landmark, building, and natural resource they can grab. The only way to stop Sancarlos and his crew is to get the Chef and the ACNE detectives on the case to cook up a plan to catch them. Join the ACNE detectives and start returning the stolen loot by catching Sancarlos and his Henchmen. To win, be the detective to retrieve the most valuable stolen treasures! This game is not related to any other thieves who travel the world and is designed as a parody.&#10;&#10;One player serves as the game's moderator, called The Chef, unless only two people are playing. Players choose one of six ACNE Detective profiles. Players create eight columns of cards by placing one of the eight B.I.L.E. Henchmen at the top of the grid, with four Stolen Location cards under him or her. Extra Location Cards are set aside and not used. After The Chef reads the character background aloud for each of the Henchmen, the Detectives, in turn, pick an Evidence card, which will ask for one of the following: Location, Connection to Jefferson Sancarlos, which B.I.L.E Henchman stole a particular location, and whose ACNE Detective Territory the Location is in. That player then selects one of the Location cards on the bottom row of the grid, and attempts to identify the Evidence point requested for that Location. Each Location card has a number of prison years on the back. If a player guesses the correct answer, he/she keeps the card and notes the prison years collected. Detectives want the highest number of prison years possible, to put Sancarlos' Henchmen away for that many years.&#10;&#10;When all four Location cards under a Henchman have been collected, the player taking the last location captures that Henchmen. The game ends when the first player captures his/her third B.I.L.E. Henchman or when all Henchmen have been captured. Each player adds up his/her prison years. For each Henchman captured, the player earns a bonus of 50 prison years. The ACNE Detective with the most total points (prison years) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Created by ASA qualified swimming instructors, it&rsquo;s an exciting, fast-paced tabletop game that gets children learning more about swimming as they play.&#10;&#10;The board is the pool, the counters are swimmers. Players throw the dice and race each other up and down the lanes. Land on a SWIM QUIZ space and answer a question card; land on DO IT to complete a challenge. Try to avoid getting CRAMP or a STITCH and you might just be the one to lift the trophy!&#10;&#10;Swimzania has been carefully researched and developed by ASA qualified swimming instructors, taking inspiration from the lessons taught in the pool. It embraces competitive and cooperative play, and is a brilliant way to reinforce kids&rsquo; (and adults&rsquo;!) knowledge of swimming and water safety awareness.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;We wanted to develop a board game that would appeal to both children and their parents. So Swimzania is not only fun to play, it also has important educational benefits,&rdquo; says Vladimir Scepunov of Swimzania. &ldquo;We have developed three levels of difficulty so that gamers of all ages can play and enjoy it, and we&rsquo;ve combined question cards with interactive challenges to get the players having fun and feeling good.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;We firmly believe in the power of learning through action,&rdquo; says Vladimir. &ldquo;Swimzania supports everything our students are taught in the pool, so it&rsquo;s a brilliant way to reinforce and strengthen their understanding of swimming. And they have so much fun while they&rsquo;re playing!&rdquo; &#10; Swimming and water safety are now included in the National Curriculum, so there is no better time to get kids playing a game that boosts their weekly lessons. A recent survey by Swim England reported that an overwhelming 94% of parents believe it is important for their child to be able to swim competently by the end of primary school. Playing Swimzania will help them to reach that goal even faster!&#10; &mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mythica: Fate of Heroes  is a hybrid adventure game incorporating elements of economic, tactical, RPG, and cooperative games.  Players take control of a single character (many drawn from the Mythica movie series from Utah-based Arrowstorm Entertainment) and endeavor to acquire Legacy points while building up their personal strength for the inevitable showdown with the big baddie of whatever plot you choose to play (the core game includes three plots). Players must work together to defeat the Nemesis in order to have an opportunity to tally individual Legacy and declare a winner.&#10;&#10;The focus of this game's development was to provide an experience familiar to tabletop RPG players yet accessible to conventional board gamers. The world and plots draw heavily from the Mythica movie universe, but familiarity with that universe is not required to enjoy or master the game. A time-keeping mechanic makes the game progressively more difficult and rewards or punishes characters for how aggressively they choose to manage world events rather than build their personal strength. Ultimately the game is a balancing act between selfless v. selfish choices and cooperative v. competitive strategies.&#10;&#10;There are optional advanced rules for more challenging and sophisticated game behaviors and rules for single or double play as well. At least two expansion packs are planned for more plot lines and additions to all play decks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The colours of the objects and the background colours also help in the differentiation.&#10;- You have to put down the cards in an area of 4x6 units. A card has 2x2 units, so there are 4 objects on a card.&#10;- You can only choose from the top of a deck!&#10;- The top card of any deck may be used but the taken card must be put down. If you cannot put the taken card down, you have to discard cards that had been put down earlier, until you are able to put the taken card down.&#10;- It is not obligatory to use the top card of your own deck, it can also be discarded.

Their mission? Rescue the scientists and safely escort them back to the space shuttle.&#10;&#10;The game uses a modular board and a random spawn system for the aliens so that no two games are the same. The dice based combat system utilizing rating and strength will force the player to make tactical and strategic decisions throughout the game. An experience system is used so that as the battle rages on, soldiers will learn and be able to modify results later in the game.&#10;&#10;To win the game, successfully escort at least one of the scientists back to the space shuttle. If at any point all of the scientists or all of the soldiers are killed, then the game is over.&#10;&#10;Pod People from Another Planet!&#10;&#10;The human race realized long ago that in order to survive, it must leave its planet and populate the galaxy. The humans of the time understood that Earth wouldn&rsquo;t be around forever, and it would become uninhabitable long before it ceases to exist.&#10;&#10;It had been nearly 800 years since the first branches of humanity reached for the stars. In that time, the human race had become fragmented as colonies were established along the way. One such fragment was scouting a new planet that long range scanners indicated would be suitable for colonization. Protocol dictates that identified planets must be scouted by research teams before any attempt at colonizing is initiated.&#10;&#10;Research teams consist of various scientists who determine whether or not a planet is suitable for long term colonization and soldiers who protect the scientists from unknown danger. The soldiers have an important job, because scientists are valuable. Without the scientists, the expeditions to colonize new worlds would be halted, and training new scientists is a difficult task.&#10;&#10;Research of this particular planet, coded P-37 while still being scouted, was promising. P-37 appeared to meet all the requirements to initiate the terraforming stage of colonization. One of these requirements being that the planet could not be already inhabited by conscious life.&#10;&#10;While nearing the completion of the research stage of colonization, something went wrong &ndash; terribly wrong. Reports of ambush started to arrive from research teams around the planet. One by one, the teams were being wiped out.&#10;&#10;Scientists began to identify the attacks as psionic in nature, having encountered other alien life forms over the past 800 years with similar abilities. Utilizing this knowledge, some scientists were able to barricade themselves behind a psionic force field while the brave soldiers guarding them sacrificed their lives to buy the scientists the time to complete the fortification.&#10;&#10;The scientists knew the force field would only last a week &ndash; maybe two. They also knew their own value. Rescue teams would be coming for them, and when they were rescued, they planned to bring with them valuable information. They focused their research on the unknown aliens.&#10;&#10;What they discovered was both fascinating and horrifying. The aliens, whom the scientists started to refer to as Pod People due to the pods they emerged from, were not themselves conscious beings. There was indeed a consciousness on P-37, but the scientists failed to identify it in their previous research. The consciousness was the planet itself. The Pod People were being spawned by the planet as an extension of its own consciousness in order to protect itself.&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Your team of elite soldiers and others like it have been ordered to carry out rescue missions to bring these scientists home. You have been briefed on the knowledge related by the scientists on the surface and fitted with gear to help you fight the Pod People. You will land your space shuttle near the location of one of the barricades, locate the scientists, and escort them safely back to the shuttle in order to bring them home.&#10;&#10;",

Business is booming, and you need to get rid of the inconvenient competition.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Debris is a fast-paced, crafting &amp; brawling card game for 2 players.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a companion and a handful of debris cards. Each turn, players use debris for building,trading, and assigning tasks to their roster of bots.&#10;&#10;Through the Maintenance &amp; Business phases of a turn, players use cards from their hand to acquire packaged bots from the Market, build them, deceive their opponent, and stay alive. Once built, bots are used to draw more cards and get an edge on the competition. They have perks and defects that will affect their efficiency, as well as how they interact with the other components in play.&#10;&#10;Each model of bot comes in different versions, ranging from questionably operational to unexpectedly potent. Packaged bots are only revealed once built, so it&rsquo;s up to players to make the best from their luck and memory.&#10;&#10;The goal of each player is to seize all of his opponent&rsquo;s cards, emptying his hand. A player wins the game when his opponent doesn&rsquo;t have any cards in his hand at the end of a turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
