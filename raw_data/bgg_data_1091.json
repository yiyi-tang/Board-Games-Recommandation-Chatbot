    "Description": "Speak Out Showdown is the electronic 'head to head' mouthpiece challenge game with ridiculous rambling and random interruptions. Players simultaneously try to get their teammates to correctly guess more correct phrases than their opponents, but the electronic interrupter unit's hand randomly determines when it's your turn to speak out and when it's not! One player from each team sits in front of the unit and tries to say different phrases while wearing a speech-inhibiting mouthpiece that keeps their lips open. Their teammates try to guess what they&rsquo;ve said when the hand is flipped down in front of them, indicating that it&rsquo;s their turn to talk. The phrases on the cards utilize specific letter combinations that are hard to say without the ability to close their mouth. Cards are collected for correctly guessed phrases. The two players switch so that their partner gets turns saying phrases. After two rounds, the team at the end with the most cards, wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Individual game Volumes (also called Modules, but each is, in fact, a complete standalone game) may add rules for use in that module, and individual scenarios may introduce rules that apply only to that scenario. But the Core Rules remain the same. When in doubt, Module Rules override the Core Series rules and Scenario Rules (SRs) override both the Core Series and Module Rules.&#10;&#10;",

This game is designed to foster creativity through an old-school tabletop game that&rsquo;s simple, fun and expands your mind. While the decline in childhood creativity was the impetus for designing the game, it is extremely fun with or without kids and promotes creativity in all. To spice things up a bit for adult game nights, there is also an optional Adults Only Expansion pack.&#10;&#10;Each round of Starting Lines provides a creative prompt (a category) and a constraint (the starting line). What happens next is creativity. Everyone gets the same simple Starting Line, but inevitably takes it in a completely different directions. You will be surprised by what kids see in a Starting Line and be brought to tears laughing at what your weird friends find. A judge reviews all players drawings and select the one they like the most. That player collects the category card from that round. Play continues until you decide to stop. The player with the most category cards at the end is declared the winner, and of course deemed the most creative.&#10;&#10;The game play can be as quick as 15 minutes or can go on for hours. The game is great for large parties. While the game includes enough markers for 6 players, with more markers you can play with as many friends as you can find.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The zombies are coming! Run for your life ..&#10;The fast running game with the ultimate adrenaline rush! By rolling the dice successfully, you&lsquo;ll proceed steadily on the placed course. &#10;If you are afraid and often save your path, you&lsquo;ll risk that the others reach the safe hut in front of you .. Who can do it first?&#10;&#10;A entertaining quick game with coasters. Fun for everyone!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;The start field will be laid open first. Then all running fields are placed one after the other in any order (from the start field) as a continuous course, always edge to edge. Finally, the target field is placed to the last running field. The number tokens are mixed loosely and placed open on the running fields as desired (with the yellow side open), so that exactly 1 number token is left each running field.&#10;&#10;The player rolls the dice and can move his figure forward (towards the target) as the shown number of the next coaster is rolled. &#10;After a player has reached a new coaster, he always has the choice to continue (again up to 2 rolls to get to the next coaster) or secure himself on the current coaster. Then the number token will be turned to the red backside and the player must finish his turn immediately. A secured number token is saved forever and applies in the rest of the game for all participating players!&#10;&#10;Object of the game: To reach the target field in front of all other players. If there are several players (at the end of a complete round), there are also several winners!&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Die Zombies kommen!

Bist Du &auml;ngstlich und sicherst Dich oft ab, riskierst Du, dass die anderen vor Dir die sichere H&uuml;tte erreichen .. Wer schafft es zuerst?&#10;&#10;Ein kurzweiliges schnelles Spiel mit Bierdeckeln. Spa&szlig; f&uuml;r jedermann!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (German)&#10;&#10;Spielablauf: &#10;Das Startfeld wird als erstes offen ausgelegt. Dann werden alle Lauffelder nacheinander in beliebiger Reihenfolge (vom Startfeld aus) als fortlaufender Parcour angelegt, immer Kante an Kante. &#10;Abschlie&szlig;end wird das Zielfeld an das letzte Lauffeld angelegt.&#10;Die Zahlenmarker werden lose gemischt und beliebig jeweils offen (mit der gelben Seite oben) auf den Lauffeldern ausgelegt, so dass dann pro Lauffeld genau 1 Zahlenmarker ausliegt.&#10;&#10;Der Spieler w&uuml;rfelt und kann mit seiner Spielfigur einen Deckel vorr&uuml;cken (Richtung Zielfeld), wenn die ausliegende Zahl des n&auml;chsten Deckels erw&uuml;rfelt wird. Nachdem ein Spieler einen neuen Deckel erreicht hat, hat er immer die Wahl fortzufahren (wieder bis zu 2 W&uuml;rfe, um auf den n&auml;chsten Deckel zu kommen) oder sich auf dem jetzigen Deckel abzusichern. Der Zahlenmarker wird dann auf die rote R&uuml;ckseite gedreht und der Spieler muss sofort seinen Zug beenden.&#10;Ein gesicherter Zahlenmarker bleibt dann f&uuml;r immer gesichert und gilt im weiteren Spielverlauf f&uuml;r alle teilnehmenden Spieler!&#10;&#10;Spielziel: Vor allen anderen Spielern das Zielfeld erreichen. Stehen dort (am Ende einer kompletten Runde) mehrere Spieler, gibt es auch mehrere Gewinner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game about around-the-world flight using a map showing the North Pole in the middle. Nominally there's an actual race, although this isn't really consistent with the leisurely sightseeing described in many events and use of contemporary passenger airliners. With its flavour texts and other enclosed information, the game is clearly meant to promote geographical knowledge as well as interest in commercial aviation.&#10;&#10;Starting from Stockholm, each player colour has its own path connecting to the main circuit around the world. The spaces on the individual and common paths all have flavour texts, game instructions and/or point gains or losses associated with them. This information is found in player folders and the rules booklet, respectively.&#10;&#10;Although most of the time players have no say in what happens, some spaces allow choices such as whether to gain a few points or move a step forward, and in a few spots, players are given small tasks such as drawing a llama, using an enclosed nomogram to calculate travel time, or explaining the significance of the International Date Line, which may gain or lose points as arbitrarily judged by an impartial scorekeeper (termed Traffic Controller) and/or the other players.&#10;&#10;In addition to points gained from passing by or stopping in various locations, players also gain points based on the order in which they return to Stockholm. The player with the most total points is the winner. A variant to play the game purely as a race with no scorekeeping is also suggested.&#10;&#10;Although only six players can fly planes, the rules include the role of scorekeeper in the player count.&#10;&#10;ABA stands for AB Aerotransport, a Swedish airline which was folded into SAS just a few years after the publication of the game. Copies exist with just an ABA sticker on the cover or with ABA and SAS stickers; the contents otherwise seem identical.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher game submitter&#10;&#10;",

So you have set off for the ruins of the once-great city of Framsburg, where it is said Wormsbane, the legendary sword of Fram son of Frumgar, lies entombed with its master. You hope that this enchanted blade will be enough to conquer Dagnir and leave Wilderland at peace.&#10;&#10;But Framsburg has been abandoned for millennia and a feeling of dread consumes you as soon as you set foot in cursed city.

An innovative terrain card system allows players to create unique battlefields, while also incorporating elements of scouting, flank marches, or possible ambushes. This pre-game action resolves quickly, allowing you to get to the battle, where you command vast armies of 50,000 men or more.&#10;&#10;For players who would rather replay a famous historical battle, many scenarios are already researched and available, as well as a full campaign system for map-based play. Age of Hannibal also includes a chapter on conducting siege battles, allowing you to design your own citadel, or recreate historical epics like Carthage or Syracuse!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players can accept the challenge solo, or share control of the empire with a partner, one in the East, and the other in the West. Together or alone, you control the mechanics of a failing empire, choosing five distinct &ldquo;starting points&rdquo; (286 CE, 363 CE, 425 CE, 497 CE and 565 CE) and run scenarios lasting 10-50 turns, depending on your corporate acumen and endurance.

Players have to complete the scenario objectives: to repair the power station that is a key location to protect the entire human civilization. People are aided by the Bobot&mdash;electric transformer boxes, where the energy of the Universe lives. They are confronted by the space aliens of the unknown race, Trashmen, who are trying to stop human technological advancements and Energy growth in the Universe. Their dangerous plan will take effect during the super strong solar storm, so the team will have to work within a very limited time frame, before the storm starts. If they manage to repair the Power Station, the Bobot will have enough time to turn on our planet&rsquo;s protective field that will save the Earth&rsquo;s energy system and electronics.&#10;&#10;Mechanics&#10;&#10;In this cooperative game, players should joint efforts to repair the power station. Players can choose among 8 different scenarios that affect the game duration and the set of resources needed to fix the error. Players can also select the difficulty of the scenario, which will influence the starting setup and the number of hours, needed to complete the game. Heroes will have to move around the game board entering different locations, to address situations with the aid of tests and to use their skills in turn. Different dice in the game represents skills. For example, when you test the character Vlad&rsquo;s Force skill, you use an eight-sided die, and if you are playing for the Bobot, you throw a twelve-sided die. At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn, Trashmen are making a move. They either try to attack Power Station or come closer to it. More over, any effects, influencing all players, can be triggered during this phase.&#10;&#10;",

Aside from being a smart-ass and always being right, they care about having magic artifacts and spellbooks &mdash; but these items aren't easy to get, so sometimes magicians just decide to meet and compete against one another in a refined bidding ritual to take items from others. Whoever first claims two spellbooks wins!&#10;&#10;Each player starts Zockende Zauberer with three vials (life points) and three gems: two bearing a pearl and one bearing an imp. Players also receive two spells at random from a shuffled decks of magic cards.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of four phases: lay down, call, confirm, and score. First, everyone lays a gem face down, starting with the first player and with this happening up to three times. The active player can call out how many pearls or imps they intend to reveal from among the played gems, and the next wizard can increase this call with a higher number. Once everyone passes on going higher, the player who made the call starts revealing played gems, although they can't reveal two gems from the same pile.&#10;&#10;If the call was correct, the active player claims a spellbook; if not, they lose one of their vials. Collect two spellbooks or be the last wizard standing, and you win!&#10;&#10;",

Though mending this wound in the world is of the utmost importance, a monumental edict from Hantei XXXVIII will once again shift the course of history, and it will fall to the children of the empire to find a peaceful way forward for the Emerald Empire.&#10;&#10;Children of the Empire is a premium expansion for Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game, with this being a new level of product that features 234 cards (three copies each of 76 cards and one copy each of six cards), a number comparable to the Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game Core Set. Unlike previous expansions, premium expansions are not tied to a specific clan, nor do they form part of a cycle; instead, these expansions focus on developing specific themes and mechanisms, rewarding every clan with a wealth of new cards in a single expansion!&#10;&#10;In Children of the Empire, you'll find a celebration of the tranquility brought to Rokugan by the Hantei Dynasty. Every Great Clan gets new tools, with themes of dueling and honor persistent throughout the expansion. Children of the Empire also provides a snapshot of characters and events in the Legend of the Five Rings story as they stand today. Look for cards that represent some of the biggest moments from Legend of the Five Rings fiction, and an updated version of an iconic character whose role in the celestial order has shifted!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Those who own the original games will recognize some of the counters in this package as those from the Maintenance, Logistics, and Air Enhancements. They have been bundled together similar to the ones from the IISS PzK Enhancement package.&#10;&#10;Each game now includes the Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements which mean you don&rsquo;t need to buy this package in order to have detailed command and fire support operations if you want them.&#10;&#10;The specific elements for Maintenance include the chart and track which determine at what level and how long it takes to repair a vehicular unit, and vehicle recovery units which are used to drag the wrecks back to where they need to be in order to have maintenance performed.&#10;As for Logistics there are supply convoys and supply points.  This enhancement is only necessary for those wanting a more detailed picture of how long an organization can last without proper supply.  If you&rsquo;re not playing a game that lasts more than 3 battle days it is not going to manifest its importance.&#10;And lastly the Air enhancement that is likely the most enjoyable aspect of the package.  It allows you to explore the air campaign in a completely different light. If you have a team you can make an air commander and that job alone will be lots of fun.&#10;&#10;XLVIII Enhancement comes with (in Full Color):&#10;&#10;        Air Operations Charts&#10;        Logistics Charts&#10;        Maintenance Charts&#10;        600 Unit Counters and Markers&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Like a thunderstorm from out of the Alpine foothills, Marshal Wurmser's Austrian army jolted the French advanced guard of General Massena from their entrenched heights on Monte Baldo. Bonaparte summarized the bleak situation: &quot;The enemy have broken through our line in three places; they are masters of La Corona and Rivoli. Massena has been compelled to yield to superior forces; Sauret has begun his retreat to Desenzano, and the enemy has captured Brescia and the bridge of Ponte San Marco. You see that our communications with Milian are cut off.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ordering Augereau to join him at Roverbella, Bonaparte directed Serurier to raise the siege of Mantova and fall back, to cover the alternate line of communication via Cremona. Although this meant abandoning the precious siege guns, it gave the French the freedom to unite their forces and engage on their own terms, massing against each Austrian wing in turn.&#10;&#10;Staking everything on success, Bonaparte set his forces in motion toward Brescia, leaving a small brigade of 1,500 men at Castiglione to delay three corps of Marshal Wurmser. There was no room for retreat - any reverse would mean utter catastrophe. Bonaparte rode five horses to death, covering 122 kilometers in 42 hours; but the French commander regained the initiative. He routed the Austrians at Lonato, while Wurmser approached Castiglione, a mere five miles away.&#10;&#10;Though he succeeded in turning about and driving Wurmser back into the hills, the contest for Italy was far from over; the Austrian Army would return to hurl themselves against the understrength French forces covering the quadrilateral of fortresses - Verona, Legnano, Peschiera, and the ultimate prize - Mantova.&#10;&#10;Rules: Napoleon at Bay System (48 pages incl. notes)&#10;Quick Set-up Tables: six 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Sheets &amp; Displays&#10;Scenarios: Four (July, September, November 1796 and January 1797&#10;Map: One 22 x 34&quot; section by Joe Youst&#10;Counters: 280 (300 including blanks) two-sided pieces by Masahiro Yamazaki&#10;Game Design: Kevin Zucker&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM: CAMPAIGNS System - Series 1X = 3,200m/hex, 1,000 men/SP, 2 days/turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

According to villagers, these are guarded by a creature of the night, a big werewolf. You should look for coins and be alert for threats, get objects to advance in the search and hopefully catch the werewolf ... If he does not catch you first.&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;It is a card game in the style of &quot;Memory Game&quot; for 1 to 4 players.&#10;The main objective is to find the 6 Gold coins that will be hidden among the game's deck.&#10;Along the same we will be stalked by the Werewolf, the protector of the coins that will try to eliminate you, to avoid it we must find 4 objects: Wolf Trap, Rope, Shotgun and Cartridges.&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;Four cards are placed in a row and face down, one after another in 3 columns, thus completing some 12 cards (4x3). For each turn, the player must turn (reveal) 2 cards from among these 12. If the 2 cards we reveal are not from the same object, we place these cards face down in the same place. Otherwise, if these 2 cards are of the same object, we can obtain one of those cards and the other is placed in the discard deck; that is, we now have that object in our inventory to use. Once this situation has happened, we must replace the two cards that we took from the playing field (the 12 cards) with another 2 cards that we are going to draw from the game deck; there always have to be 12 cards on the table. Once the turn is over, we repeat revealing another 2 cards and so on until we get all the coins or be eliminated by the wolves. When we reveal 1 coin, it becomes part of our inventory and we start a new shift, that is, it is not necessary to reveal 2 coins to obtain it. In the same way we must replace 1 card to take its place in the field of play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The merfolk have always lived a quiet agrarian life below the waves, but times are changing and the way forward is building up.&#10;&#10;Seascrapers is a solitaire roll-and-write city-building game in which players attempt to develop an underwater metropolis. By rolling dice, players can build facilities to house builders(which allow for the rolling of additional dice), priests (which allow re-rolls of dice), and scholars (which allow for the creation of more advanced buildings). Players can also construct more specialized facilities, which can modify the effects of adjacent buildings or award points. The most lucrative points, however, come from buildings that scrape the very surface of the sea and emerge into the alien world above -- but these first require the development of vast infrastructure below.&#10;&#10;Each turn, after dice are rolled and buildings are built, a space on the time track is crossed off. The end of this track represents the conclusion of the merfolk's efforts, and the city's score is tallied up for evaluation.&#10;&#10;Can you balance the various classes of merfolk society to build towering seascrapers, or will your city end in a heap on the ocean floor?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the June 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

Each full turn of play represents one-third of a month of &lsquo;real time.&rsquo; Units of maneuver are corps and armies or their ad hoc emergency unit equivalents.&#10;&#10;Command Magazine Japan #143 in October 2018.&#10;&#10;",
