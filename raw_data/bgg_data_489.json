    "Description": "Kate Smith, the famous singer and radio star from the 1940's (she also sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; at Philadelphia Flyer Hockey Games during the 1970's), is on the cover of this war-time game that reeks of patriotism. It was produced by Toy Creations Inc. of New York, and a signed dedication inside the box lid promised to donate all royalties to charity.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 144 thick cardboard tiles: 48 states divided into four color-coded regions; 48 state capitols; 30 primary industries; 10 &quot;favorite sons&quot;; and 8 American flags (wild cards). There are four cardboard racks for holding each player's tiles (neatly designed to create red-and-white stripes when laid sideways in the box next to the blue-starred covered rules).&#10;&#10;The tiles are shuffled face down on the table between the players. Each player draws a hand of 12 tiles to start. Each in turn then draws a tile and then discards a tile (the same or another). As in mah-jong, the player must announce the discard. The next player may pick up either the discard or a blind tile, but any player may claim the discard if it completes a partial set. He must reveal enough tiles to prove the set (e.g. two other states of the same color), thus revealing part of his strategy, but play then passes to the seizing player's left, with any in between missing their turns.&#10;&#10;There are eight potential scoring combinations. The easiest, scoring 5, is a hand with three states in each of the four regions. The most difficult, scoring 30, requires three states each with their capitols, one of their industries and a favorite son. (Since some industries have only a single tile, and only 10 states have favorite sons, this can be very difficult indeed.) However, the 8 American flag tiles can be used as wild cards.&#10;&#10;If a player needs information (such as a state's favorite son or industry), he may ask questions out loud, and pays 5 into a bonus pot for each question. As soon as a player completes a winning hand, he calls &quot;America&quot; and collects the value of the hand from each player as well as anything in the bonus pot. Cardboard discs in four colors are supplied, with their values to be assigned by the players.&#10;&#10;",

The most famous and sought after are the mercenary pilots.&#10;&#10;The leader of a Mercenary Air Squadron has many responsibilities. The fortunes of his or her firm depend on taking the right jobs for his pilots, outfitting with the right equipment, and keeping those birds flying. One month a mercenary squadron could be flying combat operations over the Pacific Ocean for Japan, and turn around and join the highest bidder against their former employer. Nothing is personal, except for rivalries amongst mercenary squadrons, which tend to lead to heated exchanges beyond that specified in a contract. Your prestige and fortune are at stake.

The palm tree leaves (fronds?) have various colored circles on them in rows from closest to the trunk to farthest away from the trunk.  The tree leaves have some degree of movement, and if too much weight is placed on them, they will dip or bend down.  Players take turn rolling a dice with various colored sides, and then placing a ladybug piece on a matching colored circle on a leaf.  The goal of the game is to get rid of all your ladybugs, but if your placement causes ladybugs to fall, those pieces become yours.  The game continues until one player is out of ladybugs. The leaves have different lengths and there are three sizes of ladybugs (small, medium and large), so there is some definite strategy about which ladybug gets placed where.  The tree, leaves, and ladybugs are all nicely formed and painted wooden pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of this card game is to collect as many pairs as possible. The game, first published in 1916, has cards with objects on them, a gavel, and some coins. At the start of the game the cards are dealt and the coins distributed evenly. One player takes the first turn at being auctioneer. He takes up the gavel and declares an item for sale from his cards. The trick is the auctioneer can only describe the item by it's number of legs. Many different items have the same number of legs, so players have to bid on the chance that they are getting the item they need, without really knowing it. The purchaser of the card becomes the new auctioneer. As players earn pairs they set them aside and are assigned a value. When all cards are exhausted the winner is the one with the most value in pairs and in coins.&#10;&#10;",

In this context, who would like to hazard his fortune on a throw of dice? Even in cases where chance is permitted, workaday personal and occupational practices persist - the neighbor is shunted aside or his property gloatingly purchased at auction...&#10;&#10;All of this was not evident at the beginning of our rushing century. All one wanted to do at the end of the day was to relax. Television, radio, record player and cinema were unknown. The first motorists purchased their fuel at the apothecary and the operator of a magic-lantern illuminated his coloured glass slides with a kerosene lamp. The village squares were still the site of public wells, although some well-to-do people already had gaslight. Geese were allowed to graze the entire summer. Skiing was just beginning to be recognized as a sport. A race track for horses in the city was a novelty. And a locomotive engineer was admired by all the boys: 'What a man!'&#10;&#10;Games of old reflect this world of the small adventures, where it was an event if a train derailed or even when a fowl flew its coop. Then in those days games were modern and exciting.

However, charging bull moose, ferocious Grizzly bear, raging rivers, ice flows and frost bite (sic) await all those who quest for gold. Only the most experienced gold-panners emerged from the wilderness unscathed with gold in their pockets. These SOURDOUGHS were the toughest of the tough, and would literally risk an entire year's earnings on the flip of a card in a poker hand.&#10;&#10;Would you be willing to bet everything you have on a bluff, or will you play it safe. This is a game of strategy, luck and skill, where the game dramatically changes with the personality of the players.&#10;&#10;The easy to play game includes:&#10;&#10;1 Board of Alaska (the game track is superimposed on a satellite picture)&#10;1 Deck of standard playing cards&#10;100 Silver and Gold coins (Poker Chips)&#10;100 $1 Dollar Bills&#10;6 Playing pieces&#10;1 Die (d6)&#10;27 Adventure cards (15 gold, 12 silver)&#10;6 I.O.U. Cards (4 gold, 2 silver)&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;The game begins as a simple roll-and-move mechanic with various spaces giving rewards or penalties. There are also spaces that can trigger a round of poker between the players - winner take all monies bet. The players must accumulate wealth enough to buy transportation to the gold fields and then find the motherlode (Big Vein). Once there, a final hand of poker is played and the person at the mine must have $500,000 remaining after the hand.&#10;&#10;The components are of high quality and it presents an interesting twist on a mundane night of poker.&#10;&#10;",

For example, children must remain next to a piece which still has the green sustenance layer, or the child starves. Children can be created if the spare pieces exist, but only by one male and one female, both with the blue 'reproduction' layer. And attacks can only be carried out by pieces with the red destruction layer. RGB bears a few similarities to Chess, but not as many as you might think.&#10;&#10;",

Ratings are based on actual performance from these respective seasons.&#10;&#10;To play, roll a d20 and cross-reference the result with the Batting Rating on Player's Batting listing with that of the Pitcher's Chart, where the following results are found: blank (an out), W (a possible walk), or H (a hit). Each of these results requires an additional 2-4 rolls of two d10 dice to resolve a given play.&#10;&#10;Pitchers are rated for Start/Relief effectiveness, walks, strike outs, home runs yielded, ground balls, fly balls, stamina, hold ability, and fielding.&#10;&#10;Batters are rated in the following categories: Batting, HR, 1B, 2B, 3B, W, K, Fielding, Range/Arm, SAC, BS (base stealing) and BR (base running).&#10;&#10;",

It might be Cthulhu, or Shub-Niggurath, but most players won't know the identity of the hidden card until the endgame. This is important because each of the six tomes is best against a specific demon lord, middling against most of the others, and worthless against another specific one.  Players are different teams of adventurers in the 1920s, finding tomes like the Necronomicon, fighting monsters like the Mi-Go, and solving world-spanning Events, mysteries of Lovecraftian weirdness.  Events give victory points to whoever finally solves them, but the great demon will arise if there are 100 points worth of these Events in the unsolved stack--if he arises, there is the endgame of final apocalyptic battle. So players are constantly balancing co-operation with competition--under certain circumstances, a player can discover the great demon ahead of the endgame, and even decide to join the demon!&#10;&#10;",
