    "Description": "The 2nd edition of the classic adventure game Drakborgen (DungeonQuest) from 1985. The players enter the unexplored Dragon's Keep in search for treasure. The Keep is home to a dragon, and it is up to the players, with luck and timing, to overcome the dangers, collect some treasure and escape from the Keep before the sun sets and the vampires go hunting.&#10;&#10;This edition features streamlined rules, for example pre-placed one-use event tiles (placed onto the room tiles) instead of the players drawing room cards each time they enter a room. Door cards, trap cards, search cards, corpse cards and chest cards have been rationalized; all is now contained on the room tiles. Undefeated monsters and certain traps now stay on the board, and the game features a slightly more complex and tactical fighting system. The game allows for co-operative play, and even the dragon herself can be killed.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    DungeonQuest&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fabula (previously known as Grimm) is a story-telling game where players must fill in parts of a story. One of them is the teller, who read (or imagine) the beginning of a short tale &mdash; his/her current draft. Each other player incarnates a tentative hero (a gnome, a princess, a little boy, etc.) who tries to be the main character of the teller's tale. 3 times during the game, the teller asks the other players how they think things happened at that time of the story. They must choose an item depicted on one of the cards laying at the center of the table and use it to continue the story. Depending on how convincing they are to the teller, and how well they integrated their character and the item to the current twist, they get points in the shape of &quot;quill&quot; markers. Each item can only be used once by any player, who keeps it afterwards, and who puts his/her markers on top of the card.&#10;&#10;At the end of the three turns, the two players with the most quill markers are selected to compete in the epilogue. The teller reads (or makes up) an idea of an ending to the story. Now, each finalist in turn has 30 seconds to present a relevant proposal for including his character and both items figured on the two remaining cards on the table into the ending. (A sand timer is included.) Both players have to use the same two objects, but the second one speaking cannot use them in the same way than the first (more or less compensating the fact he had more time to prepare his part).&#10;&#10;Eventually, the teller decides which of the two finalists wins, depending on the relevance of their proposals.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two proposed variants :&#10;- &quot;Experienced players&quot; : all the players tell the same tale, each one adding an element to the same storyline and bound to continue using the plot of the former speakers.&#10;- &quot;Collective&quot; : there are no quill markers and appraisal given by the teller. Every player takes part in the epilogue, and there's no winner.&#10;&#10;",

Pee Wee mode (15 min): simple, accessible for all, perfect to discover the game, it will easily attract beginners as well as young players. Expert mode (60 min): strategically rich and with great replay value, it will satisfy experienced players.&#10;&#10;The aim is to play a football match and to win the game, by scoring at least one more goal than your opponent. Each player builds its own team during the transfer window using a drafting mechanism.&#10;During the pre-game, each player chooses the lineup of its team (the team's layout on the field) and makes, at the same time, tactical choices to decide how the team will play. In order to do so, each player builds a deck with 14 cards selected among the 42 cards available (such as, for example, 4 tackles, 2 counter-attacks, etc.).&#10;The match is divided into two halves. A half consists of 5 rounds. Each round takes several steps: &#10;- draw, &#10;- substitutions, &#10;- ball possession (each team plays cards alternatively to recover the ball),&#10;- offensive (the team that possesses the ball tries to score a goal), &#10;The first half ends when the players can no longer draw cards. Each player then builds a new 14-card deck to start the second half.&#10;The game ends when the second half is over. The team that scored the most goals wins. A match can also ends up in a draw, a tie between the two players. In such a case and in order to determinate a winner, the players can agree to continue the game by going into extra time and, if necessary, a penalty shoot-out.&#10;Prior to starting the match, the players can decide to have a two-leg home and away confrontation.&#10;&#10;Major part of the game is deckbuilding and playing cards.&#10;&#10;This game includes the following components: 50 team cards; 84 match cards; 2 Kop cards; 8 help cards; 24 score cards; 70 tokens; 1 Pee Wee rulebook; 1 Expert rulebook; 2 six-sided dice; 1 multi colored dice; Dimensions of the box 9.1 x 6.6 x 1.2 inches (230x168x35mm); Dimensions of the cards 3.1 x 2.4 inches (88x63mm).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description&#10;ILLEGAL is a crazy, offbeat party game for 5 to 9 players where participants each take on the role of an illegal dealer. The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills. Each game lasts about half an hour, and is packed with intense exchanges, interactions and a lot of humour.&#10;&#10;Launch into this risqu&eacute; adventure! Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;ILLEGAL is played in two phases:&#10;&#10;During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player's deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.&#10;&#10;The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.&#10;&#10;At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fjordar is an epic, tactical strategy game for 1 to 4 players, set during the Norwegian Civil War. The game begins in the year 1130, when the old king Sigurd Jorsalfar dies. Each player begins the game as one of Sigurd's heirs or one of the other influential people in Norway at the time, who is vying for power in the vacuum left by the old king's death.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses through the 110 years of the conflict, players will use their heirs that are spread around the board to either strengthen their influence through marriage, or to continue the fight for control over Norway. By gaining glory in combat you can also attract famous warriors to your cause.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a modular, semi-abstract, three dimensional board with a typical Norwegian coastal landscape, with mountains, fjords and islands, without being a map of Norway. Since the board is modular, players can set up the board in a new way each time they play, giving them the possibility for endless variety.&#10;&#10;A player's turn in Fjordar typically goes like this:  You play a card with movement points and various abilities, and use the movement points to move your units and establish supplylines. If you have moved one or more of your units into an area with enemy soldiers, you and the other player resolve combat by each choosing a combat card in secret and reveal them simultaneously, with the combat cards adding extra strength to your units' base strength. What combat card is the most effective is highly dependent on each situation. &#10;You may then use your units to perform various actions at the different locations on the board. In forests you can build new ships, churches and villages. In villages you can muster troops and collect taxes, while in the castles you can marry away your heirs or bring them home to your own castle along your supplylines.&#10;&#10;Some of the effects on previously played movement cards and combat cards also carry over to your later turns, which means that through proper planning, and adding the right persons to your cause, you can build up to some very effective turns later in the game.&#10;&#10;Points are scored for building new stave churches, burning stave churches, founding new villages, igniting beacons and moving your heirs between castles. The game is over when a player has reached a certain number of points, whereupon there is a final score count where you may score extra points depending on how much glory you have gained in battle and what families you have connected to through marriage.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players can play higher or lower cards than are currently on the table, and play them to that end of the column. Players must play at least the same number of cards as what is present at that end, but could play more. If one end of the column has more cards than the other, that end is &quot;locked&quot; and cards cannot be removed or added. As an alternate to playing, players can remove the last cards from either end of the column.&#10;&#10;Each turn players get to take one of these actions (or pass) with both of their hands.&#10;&#10;The first player to play all of their cards wins the round and is granted points; the other players lose points depending upon the sets left in their hands.&#10;&#10;The person with the most points after a number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An abstract race game set on the Mississippi river. Each person has a boat (actually a hexagonal piece with the numbers 1-6 written on each of the 6 sides of the piece). The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).&#10;&#10;Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.&#10;&#10;If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 &quot;log&quot; per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.&#10;&#10;The first boat to the finish wins.&#10;&#10;",

Spent gold is then used to summon all variety of mythological &quot;allies&quot; (beasts, gods, etc.), or &quot;totems&quot; (support items that remain on the table, enhancing your combat or gold producing abilities). Gold can also be kept in the reserve pile to be used to power &quot;talismans&quot; (think instants and interrupts), or to utilize special abilities that your &quot;allies&quot; have. Combat is resolved by comparing the &quot;power&quot; value on each card, if the attacker is higher, the difference is discarded from your opponent&rsquo;s deck. The first person to completely deplete their opponent's deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Naples, 1932. One person was killed, and each of you is one of the 6 suspects. The case was entrusted to Commissioner Luigi Alfredo Ricciardi of the Royal Police Headquarters of Naples, supported as usual by the faithful sergeant Raffaele Maione. The murderer may be hiding among you, and it is up to you to help the Commissioner find out who is. Will you be able to do this before the time is over?&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player will be assigned, through a Character card, the role of one of the suspects that they will have to play. All the Clues are contained in cards that will be revealed to you at three different moments in the game and each of you will have access to only some of these: some cards in the center of the table will be available to everyone, while others will be in hand and visible only by those who hold them.&#10;&#10;Players will have to reflect, collaborate, share the information in their possession without compromising themselves too much, and try to understand what, beyond appearances, really happened.&#10;&#10;When all the clues will be revealed the players together have to give the solution. Unfortunately among them, there could be also the murderer who will do anything to divert the investigation and get away clean. &#10;Will they be able to discover the real culprit or will the murder remain unsolved? Or worse still, will they let an innocent be wrongfully accused? &#10;Murder party pocket is a game of crime investigation, mixing a card game, a role-playing game, and an app that guides in the game and dictates the timing and methods of the investigation.&#10;&#10;All the investigative cases are written by well-known crime writers. The first series of cases is the work of the famous Italian writer Maurizio De Giovanni, creator of the novels of Commissioner Ricciardi as well as I Bastardi di Pizzofalcone, translated into many languages and also became television series.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

This exciting, easy-to-learn game derives its content from all six Star Wars movies, making it possible for fans of all generations to enjoy battling for control of the galaxy!&quot;&#10;&#10;The pieces of the model are punched out from pre-painted plastic cards, and snapped together with interlocking tabs.  Stats for each model are summarized on the base.  Each pack came with a set of cards that were used to enhance the models.  Each pack also came with a play mat that summarized the rules and provided the play area.&#10;&#10;To play the full game, each player needed a thirty card deck, and thirty build stars worth of models.  Each model has one, two or three (or more) small stars on the rear of the base.  This is the cost of the model.  The more rare the model, or how large it is, the more build stars it costs.&#10;&#10;Related to:&#10;&#10;    Pirates of the Caribbean PocketModel Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

People were dancing, reading, playing. Suddenly the weather changed. No one was ready&hellip; Except for you, a clever merchant. Sell umbrellas when it rains, ice cream when it&rsquo;s hot, tea and coffee when it&rsquo;s cold, kites when it's windy, and lanterns when it's foggy. Park Life has 5 weather-based suits.&#10;&#10;But customers are savvy, so only the merchant with the last lowest price will make the sale. The lowest value card on suit wins the trick, but it is also is worth fewer points in the end. Additionally, every sale drains your supplies, so you discard extra cards face down when you win a trick.&#10;&#10;You can quickly make many small sales, but you&rsquo;ll go home before others, giving them the opportunity to make dramatic comebacks! But wait too long and others will make some solid sales, ensuring their lead. Park Life: People includes set collecting and wild cards to add new strategies that benefit from going deep into one suit or wide into many small valued cards. The merchant who has made the most money at the end of three rounds wins!&#10;&#10;For solo and co-op, there are set point goals needed to win, or play against the automa with rules in the deluxe rule book (you can download the deluxe rules for free below).&#10;&#10;As a may-follow trick taking game, you have agency to choose what strategy you want based on the cards dealt to you and the choices of others. This well-balanced hand management and action economy game avoids perfect information and fills Park Life with rich choices.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Although very similar to Park Life: Hedgehog, this design isn't just different in aesthetics but also by its deck composition (5 suits numbered 1-7 and the inclusion of wild cards and set collecting cards), by its scoring (done only after 3 rounds), by the lack of card reset after a round and by its winning condition (most points after the third round wins). It is considered a bit less family-friendly and more oriented towards &quot;gamers&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

When all the ingredients cards are ready, it will be order ready and will earn the team victory points!&#10;&#10;&laquo;Kitchen Crazy&raquo; is a real-time card game and a team of chefs can cook several orders at the same time.

It basically comes down to wandering about the board, revealing villain tiles and battling them with the Powerpuff Girls with the goal of being the first player to capture 4 villains.&#10;&#10;The villains are captured by way of die rolls.  Each girl has an identical die, so the more of the girls you have present to combat a villain, the better your odds of capture.  ...of course, the better your odds of getting some of them knocked out for the rest of the turn.  Since everyone shares the girls, having the earliest time card, and getting the girls knocked out will impact everyone.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Combined Arms, modern miniature wargaming&#10;&#10;Modern combat is fast, furious, and deadly. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact emphasize the value of mobility and firepower, and this doctrine is expressed in a vast and technologically sophisticated array of weapons. Laser range-finders, thermal sights, radar-seeking missiles, and counter battery radar all add to the accelerated pace which is the trademark of modern combat. Combined Arms has been designed to portray the machines, the speed, and the confusion of the modern battlefield within a playable miniatures rules system.&#10;&#10;Based on the popular Command Decision rules for World War II miniatures wargaming, Combined Arms balances realism and accuracy with playability to produce a game that not only plays quickly, but also is fun to play. Combined Arms is designed for play at the operational level of combat and is played in real time. A premium is placed on command, and the game is designed to reflect the need for command control over a battlefield which is rapidly changing. Decisions need to be made quickly and accurately, or you can lose control of the battle.&#10;&#10;Combined Arms is a complete rules set to get you started in modern miniatures wargaming. It is designed to be played with either 1:285 micro-armor or larger (up to HO) scale miniatures. The basic rules present a comprehensive framework for ground combat in the modern era. Advanced rules allow players to add details that make modern combat unique. Rules for air power, chemical warfare, electronic warfare, and combat engineering are included&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Musical Chairs is a whimsical card game that simulates a game of musical chairs but with cards instead of music.&#10;&#10;Each round, players start with a hand of eight cards to play. The starting player must play their lowest card to begin the round. Cards are played in ascending order until the current player does not have a legal move or chooses to not play one of the optional actions. In either case, the music now stops, and everyone has to take a seat.&#10;&#10;After every played card, players move their pawn around a circular board. Choosing where to stop is critical because the color of the chair you end up on determines which cards you score &mdash; both from your hand and from the cards already played.&#10;&#10;If two or more players end the round on the same chair, a &quot;butt battle&quot; must take place, with players having the option to play cards from their hands in order to claim the chair.&#10;  &#10;Players can also claim special cards and special power tokens during the game.&#10;&#10;",

The First Battle of Bull Run puts the green Union army on the road south to what everyone expects to be the only battle in a short war. But Major General Irwin McDowell's larger force meets the rebel army under General Pierre Beauregard, while General Joe Johnson's more seasoned rebels troops are also about to enter the fray. The Second Bull Run has the Union army commanded by General John Pope attempting to split Lee's Army and crush Stonewall Jackson's forces before Longstreet's wing can bail him out.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player reveals a seek card so that all players can see it, then everyone races to slap the correct slapping card. If you do so first, you claim the hiding card of that animal, moving it next to your dung heap. (If you own that hiding card already, you just keep it.) Slap the wrong slapping card, and you must move one hiding card to the barn, putting that animal in a new home.&#10;&#10;If a poop card is revealed, then you're trying to find the animal revealed on the previous turn, which might now be at a new location. The player with the most hiding cards by his dung heap when the seek deck runs out wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in a series of rounds until someone wins.&#10;&#10;In each round, players are dealt 6 &quot;ship&quot; cards (which are 1 of 4 colors, or suits, numbered from 1-4).

(1) When placing a ship card, players score a movement point if the ship card color matches the icon on top of their movement card (which is used to keep track of the movement points, so this icon color keeps changing).&#10;&#10;(2) By having the best 2-card hand at a planet. Using typical poker-like ranks, players compare hands and the best hand earns 2 movement points.&#10;&#10;(3) Each card, in addition to having a suit and a number, has an arrow that can be oriented to point left or right (by rotating the card).  The player earns a bonus movement if the arrow color matches the color of cards played in the adjacent column.&#10;&#10;The game is very portable, consisting of only 25 cards.&#10;&#10;For 1-player, there is a mechanism for competing against a dummy player.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It represents waving one&rsquo;s hands over the altar with occult flair. Improvised incantations are encouraged.&#10;&#10;1.

These BS tiles may be pushed in any arrangement as long as they move in the same direction from the same side.&#10;&#10;2. Replace&#10;After tiles are pushed off of the Altar, the active player fills the empty spaces on the Altar with new tiles from their hand. They may place their tiles freely in the empty spaces.&#10;&#10;3. Palm&#10;All the tiles that the active player Pushed off of the Altar enter their hand for the next turn.&#10;&#10;SCRYING&#10;This phase combines scoring and upkeep. There may be up to 4 steps depending on the game state. They are performed in the order below.&#10;&#10;1. Check for New Portents&#10;The active player checks the Altar for any new Portents. If any are present on the Altar proceed to step 2. If not, skip to step 4.&#10;&#10;2. Collect Omens&#10;If any of the new Portents on the Altar are in a line with an Omen Token, the player immediately collects the Omen(s).&#10;&#10;3. Ignite New Burnt Offerings&#10;For each new Portent on the Altar, the player chooses a tile to turn into a Burnt Offering and flips it over to its lit side. Every new Portent requires a new Burnt Offering of its own.&#10;&#10;4. Snuff Old Burnt Offerings&#10;If any Burnt Offerings were on the Altar during the Sleight of Hand phase, check if they are still a part of a Portent. If they are no longer a part of any Portent, flipping the Burnt Offering tile to its unlit side. If flipping a Burnt Offering over would create a new Portent, it stays lit.&#10;&#10;",

The pieces are similar to chess in that the Brain is like a king in chess, Ninnies are like pawns, and Numskulls are like rooks or bishops.  This is a fun game that is much simpler than chess at first glance. However, the game will vary in difficulty depending on the skill of the opponent.  The goal is to capture your opponent's Brain.  The fact that both players can &quot;see&quot; all possible moves to and from a square can make the game harder than you'd think!

Watch as your ball comes perilously close to each hazard. Did you plan the shot well enough to keep your ball on course?&#10;&#10;Each hole is created using a series of modular game cards. Hazards and features can be set up at random or arranged to resemble any hole from any golf course in the world.&#10;&#10;Once the hole is assembled, players must choose the right club, aim carefully (taking wind into account) and hit the ball with the right swing tempo. Too fast and you'll lose control of the ball. Too slow and your ball won't go far enough.&#10;&#10;The core of the game uses a clever movement mechanic that combines loss of control with distance. You use a number of dice to represent swing tempo (one two or three for slow, moderate and fast). Doubles and triples represent the effects of wind and slope, causing your ball to make semi-random deviations from a straight shot. Roll more dice and you're more likely to lose control and have your ball drift off course!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was self-produced by the designer Horst Rokitte.&#10;The game is about rebuilding the city of Attendorn (first named Attandarra in 1072 AD). Every player has got a personal board where he builds some of the known buildings of Attendorn (like Hospital, Church, Castle, Abbey, Townhall,... 18 in total). On the central board you'll find a resource-market where the resources wood, clay, stone and glass can be bought (in order to build the 18 buildings) as well as a point-counter and a 'coordination-field'. &#10;On this field citizen- and/or money-tokens can be bought in order to put them on buildings that were built on the personal board. A building with a token on it, gets more value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Further details, pictures and the rules (in German) could be found on the publisher's homepage www.spiele-idee.de (now turned off).&#10;&#10;",

Without looking at the cards, they lay out nine cards in a 3x3 grid, then place the remaining six in a personal stack. On a turn, draw a card from the deck or the discard pile, then exchange it with a card in your grid, discarding that card face up; alternatively, you can discard the drawn card to reveal a face-down card in your grid. With the right card in hand, you can even steal a card from another player's grid.&#10;&#10;As soon as you have three cards of the same color or number in a row, whether vertically, horizontally or diagonally, you discard those cards, then replace them with face-down cards from your personal stack. If any one player has discarded all 15 of their cards or has all cards in their grid face up, the game end is triggered. Every player takes one more turn and then players tally their remaining cards. Whoever has the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For years, the Han Empire and its authority has been weakening. Most of the governing warlords would rather increase their own personal military strength rather than restore power to the Han. The Yellow Turban Rebellion has long since passed, yet whispers of rebellion have grown louder and louder over time. The land is at the brink of war.&#10;&#10;Death of Heaven is a negotiation &amp; area control game for 4 to 6 players. Players are warlords at the end of the Han Dynasty competing to become Emperor. Players spread their influence across the land. They can choose to defend their own cities, ally with NPC forces, or support the Han emperor; each giving their own rewards and bonuses. When a battle does occur between two players, the other players must choose to either support the attacking or defending side of the battle.&#10;&#10;Outmaneuver your opponents, cut off their support lines, and squeeze. Loosen your silver tongue and negotiate your way out of defeat, turning the tables against your foe at the perfect time. Many paths to victory lay ahead of you. Will you restore power to the Han Empire or sail to victory on the blood of your enemies?&#10;&#10;",

(At least as far as you are concerned!)&#10;&#10;The second half of the game is spent trying to survive. Sure there is some good stuff around, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t plentiful and zombies are out in force, offering big points for those with the weapons to fight through, and dead ends to those who can't. Whoever has the most stuff at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;This game is based on the same prototype as J&#195;&#164;ger und Sammler.&#10;&#10;",

Also, with the Complete Rules you play with Special Cards that always offer different ways of being used.

Snipers will target you as you move street to street. You may not know who you are facing until you directly assault them. They may be Guerrillas, ready to evade you with pre-planned escape routes. They may be Martyrs, who will fight to the death. Or may just be false leads.&#10;&#10;If by the game's end the USMC does not control all the zones on the map, you lose. Otherwise you calculate victory points based on time taken and friendly and insurgent losses to determine if you achieved a major, minor or costly victory.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes and rewards the use of real life urban warfare tactics, including different modes of assaulting a building and positioning of assets to hinder enemy sniper fire or reinforce key positions.&#10;&#10;About the Second Edition&#10;This Second Edition introduces more variability in the strengths of insurgents faced, and a range of new optional rules including insurgent direct fire and RPG attacks, and local population and civilian effects to account for.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Picking refurbished or out-of-date parts to build robots that meet eager buyers' requirements. Sell your completed robots to earn points and achieve certain bonuses to earn even more points &mdash; but hurry because other players may be building a robot to sell to the same buyer first.  Can you outsmart your opponents and assemble a four-wheeler robot with two heads, or a robot with six eyes and four hands before they do?&#10;&#10;In Robots on the Line, robot parts move down two conveyor belts. Players take turns pulling robot parts (heads, bases, arms, hands, batteries, antennas and magnets). Not all robot parts can be taken, however. The line you're pulling from must be switched to ON. Robot parts that aren't taken will be discarded onto the junk pile. Players can pay a dollar to go through the junk pile or they can pay a dollar to turn ON/OFF switches. As players take robot parts, they build robots in front of them. Players can build up to four robots in a game. Trading is always allowed.&#10;&#10;To finish a robot it must have a torso, a head, and a base with all other segments off the torso ended with the other parts. While you're building, you'll want to look to the buyers to meet their requirements. A requirement might be a robot with four eyes, or a robot that has no wheels, or a robot with three hands. If you meet a buyer's requirement, you sell it for money. If you meet the bonuses, like medical, war, or cleaning, you get even more money. The game ends when all tiles are off the line or when a player has built 3 robots. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players play on the side of the board that rotates to meet them each round. At the beginning of the game, client cards are drawn and placed in front of each ticket booth in sets of three. In each round, all players simultaneously choose and play one of their carrossel cards, numbered from 1 to 12, and one of their carrossel tiles that come in twelve tiles of four different colors/types, plus two wild tiles. The carrossel tiles are simultaneously placed on the spaces indicated by the carrossel cards. Players are looking to get three carrossel tiles in a row that match the three corresponding client cards. Whenever they achieve this, they place client stand-ups on each of them to show that those tickets have been sold and give the cards to the respective players who earned them (the owners of the carrossel tiles).&#10;While it is possible to complete a sequence with only your own tiles, most sequences will be completed by using tiles from other players. Making sure you get more points out each sequence than any other player is a strong path to victory. Also there are 4 variable endgame objectives that will score additional points to those who complete them.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either one player cannot perform a legal play or the client deck runs out.

    "Description": "This is an original party game for 4 to 14 players. Players are split into two &quot;football teams&quot; composed of a single &quot;coach&quot; and a number of &quot;players&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each &quot;player&quot; sits opposite a &quot;player&quot; from the opposing team, with all players of a team on one side of the table and their coach standing behind the rival team on the opposite side of the table so they clearly watch him.&#10;&#10;The board is composed by a &quot;football field&quot; gridded board, 2 small dice, 3 normal dice and some &quot;action cards&quot; showing the position that each wooden &quot;soccer player&quot; will have to reach in the field.&#10;In addition each team has 2 team-rose(?) cards and 8 full color wooden soccer figures with a number on the back and front.&#10;&#10;The prototype I tried contained 3 teams: Japan, Greece and Eastern-Europe. The soccer player names are quite hard to say because the author deliberately invented really strange and long names.&#10;&#10;To win you have to put the ball in the net more times than other team.&#10;&#10;The game is noisy and hilarious. Each coach gets an action card. Each player get a &quot;number&quot; that represent the t-shirt number of the figures they will control (more than one there are less than 14 players).&#10;&#10;Only the coach see the action card and have to call BY NAME (of soccer players not of the people playing the game) to indicate where to move to without talking, without indicating the wooden soccer players. The only way to communicate is to give him indications with his hands or miming something as real coach do.&#10;&#10;Every time a wooden soccer player is in the right position the coach scream &quot;PASS IT&quot; and so on the other wooden soccer player until the last is positioned and the coach screams &quot;SHOOOOOT!!!&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;All the players stop play. If the team is positioned exactly as the action card requires, the last player who moved a wooden soccer player for the team throws a die to score a goal.&#10;&#10;Some penalties are given to the coach for performing forbidden actions (like calling wooden soccer players by number or indicating it by pointing) and if the action card is not correctly reproduced.&#10;&#10;RETHEMED : HysteriCoach Hockey&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Explore the rifts of Storm Hollow, build an array of amazing powers, and trigger burst of magical energy to score big in this strategy card game for 2-4 players that plays in 30-45 minutes. In Riftwalker, players use a central grid of elements composed of earth, wind, fire, water, storm, and life to play rift cards from their hand or shift rifts they already have in play.&#10;&#10;Shifting a Rift is a Riftwalker's magical ability to change the nature of a place by calling on and altering the elements. Shifting turns a card sideways and increases its point value. Every time a rift card is played or shifted, it activates a special power that alters a player's cards or the central grid in a useful way. As the game progresses, players will build up a unique set of abilities.&#10;&#10;Earth rifts empower shifted rifts while fire burns them down for points. Water rifts spread more rifts across the land and life rifts grow them to great value. Storm rifts control the element grid and wind rifts play all kinds of tricks. However, a rift can only be shifted twice, so no power lasts forever. Eventually, players must create lines of elements on the grid to score their rifts. Some cards give bonus points for scoring the right kind of rifts. In the end, the player with the greatest rifts and the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "By the winter of 1942, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants had contained the German attacks of the previous summer and fall. Now came the time for a whole series of counter-offensive of its own, designed to cut off and destroy the weakened Nazi armies.&#10;&#10;The northernmost of these would be Operation &quot;Mars&quot;, aimed at the German Ninth Army around the city of Rzhev, west of Moscow in the winter of 1942. The Soviet plan, the work of the brilliant Marshal Georgi Zhukov, called for smashing the already-weakened Germans with a heavy commitment of tanks and fresh troops. When this first objective had been reached, a second operation, code-named Jupiter, would encircle and destroy the German 3rd Panzer Army to the south.&#10;&#10;Despite horrible weather and very rough forested terrain, the initial Soviet attacks went very well. But German resistance stiffened, and as the Red Army failed to make further progress Zhukov reacted by committing more and more men and tanks. Suicidal courage only added to the Soviet casualty lists, and by the time the offensive sputtered to a halt Soviet losses topped 335,000 men and 1,600 tanks.&#10;Little known thanks to Soviet government silence for 50 years, the offensive was designed as a companion to the &quot;Saturn&quot; offensive around Stalingrad. The fact that the offensive was repulsed with heavy losses meant it was not discussed in Soviet accounts of the Great Patriotic War. While the offensive failed to accomplish what the Soviet High Command and General Georgi Zhukov wished, it did provide what the Soviets needed most, a means of keeping German forces of Army Group Center in place while the Saturn offensive in the south ran its course.&#10;&#10;Red God of War covers Operation Mars using the same game system as Alsace 1945 and America Triumphant. Game pieces represent regiments, brigades and divisions. Headquarters are vital to activate units and send them into action; supply is also important to keeping your units at full efficiency and players must choose how to allocate their resources. There will never be enough of them to accomplish everything at once.&#10;&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles (8 kilometers) &#10;Units: Battalion to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;    One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 16-page Red God of War rulebook&#10;    One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Good&#10;Complexity Level: 1,5 out of 5&#10;Players: 2&#10;Playing Time: 60 to 120 minutes&#10;&#10;(Source: Avalanche Press website and game rulebook)&#10;&#10;",
