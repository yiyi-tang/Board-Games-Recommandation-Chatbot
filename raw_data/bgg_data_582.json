When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;Property trading game, &quot;celebrating the people, places and greatness of America&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Drawing new dice is done by activating catalysts in the dice playing area. Dynamo dice can be used to alter the dice-tile faces showing in a players hand and their opponent's hand, resulting in additional strategies and adds a strong adversarial component to game. During the game, groups of micropul of the same color will get formed. These groups can be claimed using dynamo dice and will be worth a lot of points if they are closed at the end of the game; however, the special power of that dynamo in the new dynamo action is sacrificed as a claim is made.&#10;&#10;This game is based upon micropul, but uses dice instead of tiles and has an additional action (making it more adversarial) and adjustments to hand size and core size to take the dynamo effects into account.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle or competitively.&#10;&#10;",

Unit size is described as division level, but it is flexible enough to represent regiments for a set piece battle as well. For example, the battle of Raab (1809) could be done as a 2 player division-level game in about 60-90 minutes, or as a 4-6 player regimental game in about 2 hours.&#10;&#10;",

It is a game of questions and discoveries with no right or wrong answers.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;There are life questions and deeper philosophical questions,&rdquo; says the creator Alan Gratias. &ldquo;The game gives us permission to reveal ourselves by answering questions we have never been asked before.&rdquo;  For example, one card picked at random asks the following: How much is enough? What do you wish your mother understood about you?  Who is riding in your sidecar?  These questions and 426 others make up the inquisitive game of Gravitas.&#10;&#10;The rules are straightforward. The player with the birthday closest to the date of play asks the first question. The opening questioner selects any card and picks one of three questions. Each player answers that question.  Then the questioner decides which player has the best answer and awards that person the card.  The first person to win three cards in a short game, or five in a long game, is the winner or the &lsquo;Gravitarg&rsquo; of the occasion.&#10;&#10;Gravitas is available online at www.gravitasthegame.com and retails for $39.95.&#10;&#10;",

But, their own losses were considerable. The Germans constructed 1,162 U-boats and out of them 784 was lost for different reasons.&#10;&#10;In terms of human lives, the price that both decrees paid was tremendous. More than 40,900 men were recruited by the U-boat weapon during the war, of which 28,000 lost their life and 5,000 were made prisoners. The allies suffered a similar meatgrinder -- more than 30,000 dead only in the English merchant navy and many thousands more from the merchant navies of other countries. More than 70,000 men and women of the Royal Navy died during the war, of which a great proportion were due to the struggle against the U-boats.&#10;&#10;The game has the following components:&#10;&#10;- 215 cards&#10;-   4 game boards&#10;-  30 U-boat Sheets &#10;-   1 Campaign Sheet &#10;-   1 rules booklet&#10;-   3 six-sided dice (white, blue and red)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is another in the &quot;Walt Disney Characters&quot; First Learning Games series of game collections.  This box set contains a variety of educational games all featuring the Disney characters.  As the title indicates, this set focuses on teaching children understanding the differences of shapes and their sizes.  The games feature easier games where children choose the correct shape or the largest, smallest, etc pieces based on card instructions.  Other games feature characters composed of different shapes and clothing decorated in different basic shapes and children must pick out how many of each shape the character has on it, both in clothing and composition.  The shapes are not always the same color, so in a sense this is also teaching color differentiation.&#10;&#10;",

The game features a large approximately 36 inch tall outlaw with a built in timer that covers most of his chest.  The timer features four quadrants numbered 0, 1, 2, 3.  Players use the dart launching &quot;six shooter&quot; to stop the arm on the timer in the lowest scoring quadrant they can, if at all.  Of course if the timer makes it all the way around the outlaw wins!  Points are scored in rounds similar to golf, where the lowest score (fastest times) win.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a Turkish board game that appears rather similar to Ratrace. There are 3 concentric tracks on which players roll dice and move their tokens to take on different professions (e.g. grocer, mechanic) or run different services (e.g. car service, hotel) to earn money. There are also Toto spaces where presumably one can gamble for cash (the centre of the board holds a table showing payoffs for rolls of 2 to 12. Unlike Ratrace, the game does not feature status symbols. Milyarder translates as 'Billionnaire'.&#10;The game is made by different game companies, implying it may be considered a public domain game.&#10;&#10;",
