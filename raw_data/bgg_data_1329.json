Cards in hand are used to complete sets of three (any suit, same number), or a run of three (same suit, consecutively numbered) as in Rummy. Redeeming a set or run moves the player's score token one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Every step of the score track denotes a joke card suit. When scoring, a bonus point maybe awarded if the player can correctly answer the riddle corresponding to the scoring space they just moved to.&#10;&#10;First player to the final space wins.&#10;&#10;",

Because of its control of inter-planetary commerce, CHOAM was the largest single source of wealth in the Imperium. Influence in CHOAM was a major focus of political maneuvering in the Imperium, both to maximize dividends and also to skim profits.  The leaders and bureaucrats of CHOAM were dedicated to controlling vital products that enriched the Great Houses . . . and CHOAM itself.&#10;&#10;House Richese, just like the Ixians, had a well-earned reputation for ingenuity, and created important technological inventions.  But Count Ilban Richese suffered a number of business blunders that threatened to bankrupt their fortunes.  After being ousted from governing Arrakis, they were reduced to selling off important creations simply to raise enough funds to continue their efforts to compete.&#10;&#10;This expansion also introduces Leader Skills, which let you assign a skill like Mentat, Swordmaster of Ginaz, or Prana Bindu Adept to one of your leader discs.  It also included Advanced Stronghold Cards, which give you a &quot;homefield advantage&quot; when battling in a stronghold you control.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

(Hence, &ldquo;3CP&rdquo; in the game&rsquo;s title.) Card management in the form of &ldquo;what poker hand to play now and what to save for later&rdquo; is an important factor toward winning the game.&#10;&#10;Close attention to your (and your opponent's) needs and how the game is evolving are required before placing your Force cards; the decision can be tough. Your goal is to triumph in three of the five theaters of war -- or outpoint your opponent -- and achieve victory.&#10;&#10;FINAL CARDS AND RULES NOW AVAILABLE AT WWW.3CPGAMES.COM!

    "Description": "Catalan point trick-taking card game.&#10;&#10;Botifarra is played by 2 opposing teams of 2 players, using a Spanish 48-card deck.&#10;&#10;Botifarra is a game in which the points in the tricks are most important, rather than the number of tricks, although a trick also has a value by itself. There a total of 72 points in stake for each hand, but only the difference with respect to 36 is scored. These points can be sometimes doubled, quadrupled, etc. according to the initial bid. The game is usually played for 101 points or more, which generally requires several hands.&#10;&#10;The game is closely related to the French card game Manille, from which it takes the mechanics, but its rules induce deduction and minimise the effects of luck.&#10;&#10;When playing Botifarra you must bear in mind that it is forbidden to speak, show your cards or make signs or comments that may reveal your cards or your opinion as to whether game decisions are good or bad. Despite this, it is quite normal to make some comments during the game, which adds to a more entertaining atmosphere.&#10;&#10;",

The Spanish Empire&rsquo;s hold over the Caribbean has been slipping for decades as they compete with rival empires. Now the Spanish Empire looks to reestablish their hold over their colonies to bolster their efforts in Europe. France has marshaled their forces to expand their own presence to ensure their access to the goods and resources of the Americas. But older and stranger forces have also awoken in the murky depths of these ancient waters. Sailors tell tall tales of a haunted ship, the Flying Dutchman, and its ghostly crew. There are also whispered warnings about the mighty Kraken, rising from the depths to hunt those that dare to sail upon the waters.&#10;&#10;The Great Powers are gathering on the seas, seizing control of the ports, and punishing all rivals. Is the Golden Age of Piracy at an end? Or will you make deals, manipulate events to your advantage, and become the greatest pirate of them all? Hold fast, gather your crew, ready your cannons and muskets, and prepare for the Vengeance of the Empires.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1793 a great calamity hit the world. The Rent in the Sky tore apart the heavens, destroying most of Italy and flooding Europe. Only one place survived mysteriously unscathed: Venice. In the years since, the Floating City has become a beacon of hope and trade, even as the Rent gazes balefully down, putting the city into a permanent twilight. The residents have changed and adapted to a new world, a world of magic and monsters.&#10;&#10;Creatures live deep in the canals, brought through the great tear in reality. These Rashaar are masked by the Church of Dagon, an openly benevolent sect whose home is in the flooded district of San Canciano, among the crumbling buildings and dirty canals.&#10;&#10;But there are others in the city that suspect more is afoot. The Guild -- a shadowy organisation of thieves and murderers -- orders the citizens around. The Guild protect them from evils of the city, but the cost is their loyalty and servitude. The King of Thieves has sent a small gang into San Canciano to discover its secrets, but once they do, the Rashaar will try as hard as they can to make sure no one makes it out alive.&#10;&#10;This box contains everything that two players will need to dip their toes into the foetid canals of Carnevale. Get ready to swim, row, climb, and jump your way across the city in a game that places movement at its core. Whether you're skulking the winding streets, assassinating foes from the rooftops, or drowning them under the water, Carnevale offers fully three-dimensional gameplay in a narrative skirmish game.&#10;&#10;Contained within are 2 small gangs -- the Guild and the Rashaar. There is a full 48-page rulebook explaining the lore and rules of the game, as well as a campaign to play through. Everything in this set is designed to get you playing quickly: from the single-piece models, through to the push-together cardboard scenery, fold-out play mat, dice, and even quick reference cards for characters, rules, and two scenarios to help teach the basics of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;     8 Resin Characters: Both the Guild and Rashaar have four characters unique to this box. From the Gondolier with her bladed oar to the tentacled mouth of the Lesser Rhyll, all are covered in beautiful detail, and are all single-piece so you can get gaming quickly.&#10;     Cardboard Scenery: Terrain is important in Carnevale, so we're providing you with loads! 3 buildings, 7 obstacles, a bridge, and even a gondola! There's also a double-sided 2'x2' fold-out paper mat to set up your game easily.&#10;     48-Page Rulebook, Dice, Range Ruler, &amp; Quick Reference Cards: This gorgeously presented book has the full rules for the game, accompanied with stunning artwork and background for all factions.

Each player has a unique time traveler with individual strengths and weaknesses.&#10;&#10;The goal is to change key events throughout history and cause enough changes that the apocalypse doesn't happen. Changing one event can cause others to change, too! With planning and precision, you can change several key events by changing only one event. However, without planning or caution, you may cause the world to tumble into an even darker timeline! Remember, if anything goes wrong: This didn't happen!&#10;&#10;Players travel from event to event, either by waiting for time to move them or by using the Time Machine. Players collect supply cards, which help them during random events or which can be used to change the event their character is on. Changing an event can affect future events, softening them up and making them easier to change, or changing them outright. Changing too many events may cause a change to the End of the Era, resulting in an earlier apocalypse.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You don&rsquo;t need to know a thing about aardvarks to become an apex hunter.&#10;&#10;Unlike some trivia games, this one offers you closed choices (&ldquo;A, B, or C?&rdquo;). So if a question stumps the central organ in your nervous system, you can frequently survive on hunches, or guessing.&#10;&#10;If you think trivia questions are about as friendly as rattlesnakes, then go light on the gnarly questions. Find &ldquo;camouflage and dodge&rdquo; or &ldquo;ink and stink&rdquo; cards to build your defenses. Or land on a human to damage someone else&rsquo;s habitat (or repair your own).&#10;&#10;Triviavore takes two or three minutes to set up and 15-20 minutes to play. It is printed entirely in the USA on sustainably harvested paper certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. It has no plastic parts, and is not even shrink-wrapped. The cards celebrate nature and are colorful and attractive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The turn of the twenty-second century was a time of great progression of the human race, space exploration, scientific and technological advancements. It was also the time of neo-colonialism, and a new order emerging from the pyres of the old world. It was a time of a new breed of war &ndash; the Hardwar.&#10;&#10;Hardwar tries to recreate possible future ground battlefield conditions, providing straightforward rules allowing for a fast-paced tactical experience in a relatively hard science fiction setting. Hardwar takes into account not only classic armoured warfare, enriched with fictional contraptions like mechs, spaceships, or exotic weapons, but also futuristic predictions of combat evolution &ndash; the importance of cybernetic warfare, decline in numbers of human soldiers replaced with AI algorithms, a rise of sentient combat swarms and electronic fog of war, or experimental development of new exotic weapons, to name a few. This approach, combined with simple and flexible rules should provide new and exciting tactical opportunities for tabletop commanders.&#10;&#10;Aside from this rulebook, all that is needed for a game is a couple of miniatures, representing your battle group, a handful of twelve-sided dice and another one of small tokens or coins, measuring tape, a table, a couple of terrain pieces and, most importantly, an opponent.&#10;&#10;Becoming a force commander in Hardwar world is not a difficult task. You can start your own private security company, lease a few war machines and go out there, looking for contracts from the big fish. You can be a corporate commander,  working for one of the major forces of your world, executing the will of shareholders by all means necessary. You can become the charismatic leader of revolutionary forces, fighting against corporate overlords. You can be a small-time dictator in an area of wastelands forgotten by transnationals, or a noble self-appointed marshal, trying to protect helpless civilians from raiders. You can be a pirate, you can be a bounty hunter, you can be a mercenary.  All you need is to get your hands on some equipment, find a few reliable hardware operators and convince someone with money to let you solve their problem. If you are good enough, you can get additional contracts with media, to make a reality holo-show about your group, you can get sponsors from the arms industry, agents and lawyers to negotiate your contracts, and that penthouse mansion in the orbital city you have always dreamt of.&#10;&#10;Your force will face other security consultants, fighting for other employers. Sometimes you will take part in internal power struggles, sometimes you will perform a hostile takeover, sometimes you will sabotage a competitive facility, sometimes you will have to deal with locals unwilling to relocate from your employer&rsquo;s property, sometimes you will go on bandit hunt, you will extinguish, or incite revolution&hellip; it will not always be pretty, but surely will be profitable.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One thing you know for sure, this war of crown will end with you on the throne, blood shed or not.&#10;&#10;Essentially it is a Roundel game where the players move their pawn on the Chang&rsquo;an city in a clockwise manner. The locations let the players (princes) gain gold from the emperor, use the gold to recruit the most basic resources which are the subordinates (followers, military units and spies), then using these &ldquo;resources&rdquo; to creat network with the Character Cards (Ministers, Concubines and Generals), which in turn gives the players Political influences, Military influences and Scheme abilities for which the players will be able to use them to gain Victory Points by completing Emperors Tasks, go on military campaigns and sabotage each other. The player with most VP wins the game.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, players could try to coup the other players. It&rsquo;s a risky move that involves drawing random cubes from your own plot bag (that you try to manage throughout the game).

    "Description": "In Space Lane Trader, you are playing a character in control of a cargo ship, trying to make a fortune in the newly opened up shipping trade. You buy and sell goods transporting them between planets within the Terran Federation, preferably to where demand and prices are high. The main objective of the game is to earn money (credits) faster than your competitors and return to show off your success.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, you can fit your ship with upgrades that will make it go faster, attack harder and defend better &ndash; all with the goal to ensure that you manage to beat your competitors to the goal. You can also buy new ships with better capabilities, that can carry more goods for you, go faster or fit more upgrades.&#10;Your character will develop during the game &ndash; from the inexperienced person starting play at Terra station in the Solar system, to a grizzled space ship captain with much improved skills. You develop your character by spending Experience Points (XP), that are earned by drawing Event cards as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;The most obvious way of earning money is buying goods, transporting it to another planet and selling it there. Another way however, is attacking your competitors and take what should have been yours anyway. Winning combat against another player will allow you to either steal cargo from your opponent or take loot in the form of Debris cards. Debris cards can either give you valuable salvage that can be sold on planets, or the best equipment in the game that will improve your ship beyond the capabilities of your competitors.&#10;&#10;Not all parts of space are safe. Planets away from the most busy parts of space are characterized by a wild west mentality and the Terran Federation security forces don&acute;t have the capacity to uphold law and order everywhere. This is reflected by two different security levels in the game &ndash; green and yellow. Green  security level planets are safer, and although bad things can happen, the negative consequences are not so extensive. On security level yellow planets however, the dangers are higher but also the rewards.&#10;&#10;",

The FT was aptly nicknamed the &quot;Victory Tank&quot; thanks to its essential role during the war effort. The tank was sure to terrify its opponents fighting in the trenches on the Western Front. In Victory Tank, one of these tanks has gone AWOL... Two opposing armies fight on a fog covered battlefield to capture bunkers and retrieve resources while trying to commandeer the tank gone rogue to increase their own military prowess. Which army will be victorious?&#10;&#10;In this quick, light, and tactical game, two commanders will try to lead their armies to victory over a couple of rounds divided into two phases. During the &quot;Fog of War&quot; phase the active player will draw two cards to be added to the ever growing battlefield. Each card depicts goals and bonuses to be placed on the battlefield. The active player gets to keep and place one of these cards while offering the other card to its opponent, providing interesting choices and dilemmas to the players during the game.&#10;&#10;During the second phase, the &quot;Command&quot; phase, players will take up to five actions each to influence their literal and figurative position in battle. Players will move their soldiers, deploy new units to the battlefield and attack their opponent. Each player has a limited amount of command cards that the player can utilize to boost their actions, fighting power, or defense strength during an attack. And don&rsquo;t forget that somewhere hidden in the mist, a tank has been abandoned. Finding, operating and fighting with this tank on your side may just bring you victory&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But beware, because your opponent might completely change what&rsquo;s happening by throwing down a special napkin card at the last moment!&#10;&#10;The Sandwich game is a card game played in multiple phases.  Play starts in the Building Sandwiches phase where players take turns drawing cards and building communal sandwiches.&#10;&#10;Once a sandwich is completed play enters the Bidding phase where players take turns placing bid cards face down in front of any player (including themselves).  Once all players have finished placing bids, the bid score for each player is calculated to determine who eats the sandwich.  Eating the sandwich will reward that player with the point value of the sandwich (determined by the cards that make up the sandwich). Players can interrupt play and sour their opponent's plans by playing Napkin Cards.  These cards have specific effects on game play and scoring.&#10;&#10;The game end is determined by the number of players playing.  For 2 player games, the first player to 25 points wins.  In 3-4 player games the first player to 15 points is victorious.  For a 5 player game the Ultimate Sandwich Champion is the player with the most points after 5 sandwiches have been eaten.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Streets of Newark is a two to five player game and each player will take on the role of one of the five Dons running Newark during prohibition. The board consists of 9 to 23 location tiles, based upon the number of players, and each player has three lieutenants. The lieutenants each have up to four soldiers in their crew, and the lieutenant's crew moves around the various locations of the board as a unit. Soldiers can be improved through equipment cards.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players secretly determine where they will deploy their lieutenant's crews. Then everyone reveals simultaneously and moves their crews to the selected locations. While at the locations, crews complete jobs, actively corrupt policemen and officials, or collect protection money. But If two or more player's move crews to the same location, there can be conflict, and even bloodshed.&#10;&#10;Play continue until one Don achieves one of the five victory conditions. The five different win conditions are (1) becoming the next crime lord through reputation, (2) controlling the city's locations, (3) corrupting the city's officials and police force, (4) conquering the other mob's forces through bloodshed or (5) conspiring with the federal investigators. No player is pigeon-holed into any one victory path, but each Don's lieutenants have unique abilities.&#10;&#10;The Streets of Newark was designed to have great replay value, with tremendous depth and strategy. There are countless combinations of board configurations, decisions, soldiers, upgrades and paths to victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "PMC 2670 is hard sci-fi platoon-sized ruleset intended for 15mm and it's second edition of PMC 2640 released in 2013.&#10;&#10;Introduction&#10;In 2013, we have boldly released PMC 2640, which successfully found its place on crowded 15mm sci-fi wargames market. Now, it's high time to leap forward! In the last 3 years, we have worked hard on PMC 2670, which is much more than just a new edition of the game! As you can probably guess, the action takes place 30 years later in the same dirty, gloomy PMC-verse &ndash; but it's also indirectly connected to Shadows in the Void, which takes place much later in the same timeline. The story was moved forward: humanity developed new technologies and improved older ones, encountered an alien threat (or rather the aliens encountered a human threat...) and made the galaxy an even more turbulent place.&#10;&#10;So, what are the gameplay changes?&#10;There is no revolution in the core mechanics, as better is often the enemy of good... Still, the basic rules were polished and perfected, making the game even faster, more flexible and more uncompromising &ndash; but it's still the old, fine PMC! Special rules were revisited and all known question-causing or unclear elements were re-edited. But the main advantage of the 2670 edition are the added extras! Now you can lead not only merc forces, but also space bugs and rebels, which became fully playable factions. What is more, there is a fourth faction &ndash; the aforementioned aliens! Forces of your PMCs were bolstered with lots of additional unit entries, offering many new tactics and army compositions. We listened to the players and added a lot of elements they asked for (e.g. power armours, medics, drop pods, and many exotic sci-fi troops). Existing units were carefully examined and rebalanced to adjust them to the new lists. But don't worry, if you already have a collection of minis for PMC 2640, it will be fully playable in PMC 2670 &ndash; you'll simply get even more possibilities! We see no point in making existing armies useless or weaker &ndash; we're players ourselves and know how irritating this can be! In addition to new armies and PMC units, we have updated the scenarios based on the experience from previous years &ndash; but no major changes in this chapter.&#10;&#10;Anything else?&#10;Of course! All factions received their own campaign rules, allowing for even more interesting club gaming! Campaign is as important, as it was aspect of the ruleset. Whether you wish to create your own PMC, start a revolt, make bugs the dominant species on the planet or conquer new territories for your Xenotripod tribe, you will have the means to do it. Campaigns became even more challenging thanks to improvements such as quicker progress at the beginning and reduced snowball effect.&#10;&#10;...and?&#10;The whole solitaire/coop section was redone. Thanks to universal scenarios you can use any force against any other force on any tier. Additionally, the Special Commando composition allows you to start playing with just a few finished minis &ndash; perfect for people who like to collect different armies without expanding them too much.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Gallamut Zeers, now filled with industry and frowns, was once a land filled with lush vegetation and wonderful beasts. The Lords of Gallamut Zeers settled on this fertile island long ago, but quickly decided they could not share it with each other, because they were grumpy and itchy. Their moustaches tickled their noses something fierce and their socks were made of wool, which is scratchy, you know! So they quarreled and debated and demanded, as all those who feel entitled do, until they concluded who would own and rule the various parts of the fruitful island. Here, and there, and everywhere they bickered! Silly Lords, there&rsquo;s plenty of space to go around!&#10;&#10;In The Formative Years of Gallamut Zeers, players take on the roles of Lords of Gallamut Zeers struggling to gain dominion over the island. Over three years, players will claim roads, occupy cities, set up encampments, and make diplomacy in an attempt to outwit their opponents. The player who employs the most clever tactics and the most efficient strategy to accumulate the most points will win the game!&#10;&#10;The Formative Years of Gallamut Zeers is a tactical area-control/majority game which is played over 3 rounds. Each round, players will play four of six available action cards to place and manipulate cubes to score points. Between the rounds, players will take part in a simultaneous secret action selection to take a bonus action or block other players from taking an action. At the end of each round, there are eight categories in which players may score points.&#10;&#10;",

Finally the post Kickstarter goals of the project will be to establish a non-profit debt forgiveness program that collects Student loan and medical debts and forgives them unconditionally as a way of giving back to the greater community during these unprecedented times!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the night of the second to the third of May 1921 began the third Silesia uprising.&#10;&#10;Silesia after the end of World War 1 was to be partitioned between Germany and the restored Polish state. The Poles however were not satisfied with the suggested partition, which would result in keeping by the Germans of a huge area which was primarily ethnically Polish.&#10;&#10;The game released by Pospolite Ruszenie Szlachty Ziemi Krakowskiej is primarily an educational tool, designed to commemorate the 100'th anniversary of this successful Polish uprising.&#10;&#10;It is a game for 2 players using two separate decks of cards and a board, depicting the area, where the fighting took place.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll dice and move their cars around the board, then interact with the spaces they land on. Players can accumulate items purchased from shops which allow them to move further on each turn, use boosters, sabotage opponents, take shortcuts, earn extra money, and more. Players interact with other spaces they land on to move further, take a shortcut, earn extra money, or to gain or lose a turn. Players earn more money upon completion of each lap.&#10;&#10;Different items the players purchase offer different strategies. Players can focus on upgrading speed, purchasing items that give options, taking shortcuts, or investing in money gaining items early so they can buy everything and make a blazing comeback. The first player to finish the 10th lap wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

That makes this game fun and challenging for anyone from age 6 to 106.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they will use one hand to add a leaf to the tree while trying not to topple the tree or knock off any leaves.&#10;&#10;If. during your turn. you knock off any leaves then your turn is over and the leaf you are holding and any leaves you knocked off go to your stockpile. The first player to empty their stockpile of leaves is the winner. However, if you knock over the entire tree then you lose the game.&#10;&#10;Great for parties, family nights, desk distractions, and a fantastic gift!

Now, overwhelmed by the last Znorg&rsquo;s invasion, humans are desperately looking for cadets up to the task. That is why you are here: a group of  uncoordinated and undisciplined new recruits, yet committed with a selfless willingness to serve with enthusiasm and loyalty   to &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; left for humanity. Will it be enough?&#10;&#10;A cooperative game from 2 to 4 players in a 30 minutes match on which you should manage &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; spaceship while getting ready for the final battle against the Znorgs. Coordination, organization and teamwork are pivotal in order to survive in the ship. Will you be able to coordinate the numerous logistic tasks? Such as managing inventories, storing and keeping your food or even cleaning the bathrooms. Will you be able to do it while the occasional Znorgs&rsquo; inconvenient shenanigans disrupt the ship?&#10;&#10;The game takes place during 3 stages where players will coordinate, upgrade ship modules and strengthen the team to defeat the Znorg in the Final battle.&#10;&#10;The players will choose their dice simultaneously behind their screen. They will take turns declaring the number of the dice they are going to play, but not its color nor on which mission they will put them on to play. When everyone but the captain have declared their dice, the captain will say Lets, Go, Cadets! at which point everyone will simultaneously place their dice on a mission trying to fulfill the color and sum requirements, while trying not to damage the ship.&#10;&#10;If players make it through the battle against the Znorg without destroying 4 ship modules, congratulations! You have saved humanity.&#10;&#10;This game was the winner in the Party Games category at the recent Game Jam Latam Creativa 2021.&#10;&#10;",

Moving quickly but strategically around the sections, they look for opportunities to turn dogs into dollars and make the most of the seven innings before the concessions begin to close down.&#10;&#10;In every inning of the game, each player has 5 action points to take any combination of the actions listed below to increase their sales.  &#10;With these points, they can:&#10;- Fulfill a hot dog order (1 AP)&#10;- Move to an adjacent (no diagonals) Grandstand section (1 AP)&#10;- Hawk your hot dogs to the crowd, adding another order to the section you are in (1 AP)&#10;- Play a 'Dog Eat Dog' card (1 AP)&#10;- Return to the commissary and restock your supply box (2 AP)&#10;&#10;An event is revealed from the Huge-0-Tron deck at the top of every inning, potentially altering the course of play for the next turn. Players must also be on their toes and watch for opportunities to capture extra points by fulfilling the combination showing on the top card of the Incentive deck.  There is also an optional player interaction deck, the Dog Eat Dog deck, which allows you to get hands on in thwarting the efforts of your fellow vendors while you seize crazy opportunities to better your own position.&#10;&#10;Carefully choose your route through the Grandstands, manage your delicious inventory, and seize the best opportunities to turn dogs into dollars to claim the spot as 'Top Dog' by the time the last 'Out' is called!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "black stories: Ab in die Kiste! begins where most other black stories end: after death. This edition is all about what happens after you kick the bucket. In these 50 pitch-black riddles, bizarre stories are gathered around interesting ways to celebrate your eternal rest. And the most chilling thing about these stories: they really happened that way. Adventurous, funny, sometimes quite illegal - and 100% true! To match this theme, the coffin-shaped cards of the &quot;black stories: Ab in die Kiste!&quot; come in a high-quality box in coffin look, which makes the puzzle stories look even scarier.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;The card set contains 50 tricky, pitch-black puzzle cards for teens and adults to solve by asking clever questions. Cracking black stories together with friends is the most fun. One player, the bidder, takes a card from the deck, reads the short story written on the front of the card. On the back of the card, the master finds the answer, which he of course keeps to himself. Now the guessing people have to &quot;ask&quot; themselves the solution to the story. The questions should be formulated in such a way that the master can answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. A spooky and fun guessing game for small and large groups - can also be played digitally.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is a card board game designed based on the major events of China since 1949, with the image of &quot;long history and tide of times&quot;. Even if you have a deep understanding of history, you need strategic arrangements. You need to make reasonable arrangements to bring the events connected by the year together, converge into the mainstream with tributaries, keep pace with the trend of the times, and learn the history of China subtly in the game.&#10;This version sets advanced rules and competition rules, giving you more experience. &#10;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#229;&#162;&#168;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#230;&#178;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#172;&#190;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#141;&#142;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#229;&#133;&#177;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#232;&#135;&#170;1949&#229;&#185;&#180;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#232;&#174;&#176;&#228;&#184;&#186;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#231;&#186;&#191;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#143;&#150;&ldquo;&#229;&#142;&#134;&#229;&#143;&#178;&#233;&#149;&#191;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#151;&#182;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#189;&#174;&rdquo;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#232;&#177;&#161;&#232;&#174;&#190;&#232;&#174;&#161;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#172;&#190;&#229;&#141;&#161;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#230;&#161;&#140;&#230;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#231;&#174;&#151;&#229;&#175;&#185;&#229;&#142;&#134;&#229;&#143;&#178;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#230;&#183;&#177;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#185;&#159;&#233;&#156;&#128;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#173;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#174;&#137;&#230;&#142;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#189;&#160;&#233;&#156;&#128;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#232;&#191;&#135;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#174;&#137;&#230;&#142;&#146;&#232;&#174;&#169;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#228;&#187;&#189;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#232;&#191;&#158;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#230;&#177;&#135;&#232;&#129;&#154;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#232;&#181;&#183;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#230;&#177;&#135;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#230;&#151;&#182;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#189;&#174;&#229;&#185;&#182;&#232;&#191;&#155;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#230;&#184;&#184;&#230;&#136;&#143;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#230;&#189;&#156;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#233;&#187;&#152;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#229;&#173;&#166;&#228;&#185;&#160;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#229;&#143;&#178;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#173;&#164;&#231;&#137;&#136;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#232;&#174;&#190;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#232;&#191;&#155;&#233;&#152;&#182;&#232;&#167;&#132;&#229;&#136;&#153;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#231;&#171;&#158;&#230;&#138;&#128;&#232;&#167;&#132;&#229;&#136;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#187;&#153;&#228;&#189;&#160;&#230;&#155;&#180;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#230;&#160;&#183;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#170;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",
