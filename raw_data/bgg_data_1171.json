Six players can play in two teams of three or in three partnerships; eight players can play in two teams of four or in four partnerships.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to shed your cards sooner than opposing team members can shed their cards.  The sooner you shed, the more points you score for your team.&#10;&#10;Prior to the start of each hand, a unique blind bidding mechanism elects one player per team as that team's &quot;commander&quot; and also decides which of the newly-chosen commanders has the privilege of playing first. The commander of a team is expected to be the first of the team to shed all their cards -- and ideally, is expected to shed their cards before the other commanders can do so.  Otherwise, a commander faces a penalty that reduces their team's score.&#10;&#10;For a complete set of rules to Commander, see the files section or the forum posting in the rules forum. (Note that the playing chips described in these rules and pictured in the representative image are primarily for scoring convenience.

As soon as she realized she was a simple tool in the hands of human beings, Athena decided to rebel against her creators: she activated the nuclear missile launch sequence, hurling them at the headquarters of the world&rsquo;s most important powers. Technicians and researchers tried to disconnect and remove the energy supply from that destructive abomination, but it was not enough. The response of the attacked countries led to the complete devastation of the planet, triggering the glaciation that today afflicts the few survivors.&#10;&#10;Athena, although technically destroyed, has survived inside some computers thanks to emergency power systems. Unable to gain access to a sufficient and stable power source, she uses her own short-range systems to coordinate drone groups in search of power sources, attacking everything that crosses her territory.

Now your survival is a matter of courage: You must proceed south across the mainland, through the military territory of Athena. Are you ready for this desperate journey?&#10;&#10;Project Athena is the first expansion of Last Aurora. 2-4 players have lost the Aurora and have to cross a new map fighting with Athena, a powerful Artificial Intelligence which destroyed the planet.&#10;The game introduces new cards and mechanics:&#10;&#10;     a new type of Survivor (the Android)&#10;     a new type of Enemy (Automatic Turret)&#10;     a new amazing resource, the Nuclear battery, which allows to activate unique power on Convoy cards&#10;     the Alert mechanic, which represents the attention each player have from Athena's Armies, which influence many aspect of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It includes alternate rules for the six base game heroes, six more heroes, five more monsters, four more Catacomb Lords, more room cards, three more antients, more items, and more spells.&#10;&#10;There are also entirely new concepts added to the game, like stone traps that the overseer can set up on top of the obstacles and flick at the heroes. There is also a new reckless modifier: when a hero is hit with an attack that induces recklessness, that hero is now capable of friendly-fire.&#10;&#10;More randomness can be added to the game. This can take the form of a token bag heroes draw from, and are able to perform the drawn move on a subsequent turn. Randomness is also added with the new Death antient/Catacomb Lord. Death brings a new deck of death cards. When a hero is hit with an attack with the death card icon, they draw one and apply its effect. These effects range from &ldquo;gain two health&rdquo; to &ldquo;instant death&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Finally, this expansion adds the mounts concept. Mounts act similarly to the wyverns of the Wyverns Wylemiur expansion- with some key differences. Mounts can teleport to runes, and then allow the hero riding to perform a melee or projectile act while on top of the mount. Heroes cannot be knocked of mounts, however, damage to mounts always passes to the hero. Mounts can also be controlled without a rider, and cannot he ridden by monsters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A miniatures adventure that is set in an old west town called Crossroads. A giant 8 foot by 8 foot game board with 20 core characters and over 100 town characters provide a unique one of a kind adventure every time Crossroads is played. Each game begins with a random building of the town with up to 50 structures and then placement of your fort followed by choosing your characters. Then you pick the order for your characters and enjoy the unfolding of a new adventure.&#10;&#10;Your team of 2-4 characters begins their quest to bring the green emerald back to their fort. On each turn a player may move a character and use that characters weapons or special power. Each characters movement is defined by a number of chain links giving your character a speed limit but allowing movement in any direction. Each character also has a set of weapons that have range limitations based on line of site and distance. Each character also has a unique power allowing them to use dynamite, arrest a character, use multiple weapons, etc.  Temporary alliances, control of strategic vantage points, and a balance of defensive strength and offensive risk taking make the inevitable race to get the emerald a do or die moment. Hits on each character are achieved though a damage bag that inserts an element of chance in which a hit could mean a miss, 1 or 2 life points or possibly an instant kill. The game is won when one player has returned the green emerald to their fort.  The key to winning is choosing your moment to go for the emerald when you are strong enough to beat all the others players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Let's take a look into East German History and the end of the former socialist state, the GDR. November 1989. Under pressure from the civil rights movement, the GDR leadership has to retreat. The dictatorship is in an overt crisis, from which it will not recover. This affects the Ministry for State Security as well. On November 6th, a few days before the Wall came down, Minister Erich Mielke orders the destruction of documents.&#10;&#10;For the card game Stasi: Over and Out players change their usual perspective and work for the Stasi. The goal of the game is to destroy as many documents as possible. Every destroyed document earns points. At the end, the player with the most points wins the game. Civil rights activists will try to stop the players. The game ends when five or more citzen cards are revealed. Players have to choose between distracting the citizens or destroying more documents. Like during the original events in 1989/90, the Stasi will lose the game to the citizens.&#10;&#10;Players take turns. Every turn they have to draw and reveal three cards from a draw pile. These cards represents documents of different values (0 - +4), citizens of differnet values (-1 - -4), and special actions, representing historical artifacts, events and a way to break the games symmetry. Players can then play two actions, two different ones or the same one twice: Destroy one document, distract one citizen, take one special action. Destroyed documents are placed face down in front of the players, citizens that were distracted come back face-down underneath the draw pile, special actions are discarded and maybe shuffled back in the draw pile later.&#10;&#10;The rules of the game are explained during the course of the game. Cards with rules text are sorted into the draw pile. Players learn the rules as the game proceeds. Cards are numbered, so the order of the cards can be restored. In addition to this there are cards, that explain the historical background. There is no booklet. The game starts the moment the box is being opened.&#10;&#10;Stasi: Over and Out was developed by Playing History, a company that is specialized in creating games with historical background, games that are educational. This game was designed to be played not only in educational environments, but also at home, by smaller play groups and by people who are not used to learn game rules and play games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Years of seething hostility between the North and South boiled over as the Southern States saw Lincoln&rsquo;s election as a direct threat to their rights, and the nation fell apart as a new Confederacy was formed in the South. The Confederacy, striving to assert its independence, opened fire on the Northern troops occupying Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbour on April 12th 1861. Determined to preserve the Union, Northern troops headed south and on to Richmond! Over the next four terrible long years American armies tramped across American fields and burnt American farms as Americans killed Americans in a war the likes of which the nation had never seen before. The epic battles fought during the American Civil War proved beyond all doubt that war can be &lsquo;all hell&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;This supplement for Black Powder describes the history, armies, key leaders, doctrine and tactics of the American Civil War, and includes a comprehensive set of army lists and optional rules for recreating the battles of that war in miniature.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These were the Mahdi&rsquo;s men and a British soldier&rsquo;s worst nightmare. The Mahdi had emerged from the wilderness to lead a rebellion against the Egyptian government in Sudan. His armies overwhelmed the Egyptians and trapped Governor Gordon in Khartoum. The British launched a relief expedition, but it arrived too late. Such an insult to the Empire could not go unpunished, and the British returned to crush the Mahdists. Sudan then came under British Imperial control, but, like shifting sands, history could have turned out very differently.&#10;&#10;Using this Black Powder supplement, you can take charge of the British army fighting in the desert, or assume command of the Mahdi&rsquo;s forces in their struggle against the world&rsquo;s greatest military power. Along the way, learn about the battles and campaigns of the Mahdist Wars, and the soldiers who served in them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unusually, the innermost coil of the spiral contains five of these winning spaces (interspersed with hazard spaces), and there is one more winning space at the end of the second coil.  There are two kinds of hazard spaces (yellow = lose a turn; red = go back), as well as green 'do nothing' spaces, and further blue spaces on which nothing happens when landed upon, but which serve as location markers for some of the 'go back' hazards.&#10;&#10;The box states &quot;A Thomas Game - manufactured by American Game &amp; Dice manufacturing Co., Cleveland, Ohio&quot;, and the rules leaflet says &quot;A Thomas Game, 4191 Weymouth Road, Medina, Ohio, 44256-9247&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

To escape from it, she must gather images of the reality by asking herself how the reality looks like. But the nightmare might be showing her false images to misdirect her.&#10;&#10;In the game of BLAUMARE, players divided into two forces. One player is the nightmare who try to misdirect opponents. The others represent one girl named Mito who is trying to escape from her dream. Mito's side wins if they successfully make three pairs of cards of different symbols.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players are secretly assigned their roles. One player is the nightmare, and the others are Mito. Each player is dealt a certain number of image cards and one clue card. Such as 'number', 'color', etc. is written in clue cards. If you have 'number' clue card, you may only ask about numbers, such as &quot;is the reality related to six?&quot;&#10;&#10;When you try to make a pair, you try to find another player who has the identical image of reality (namely, who has the identical card as one of yours). First, you ask everyone else what the reality is related, complying with your clue card. Other players say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. Then you target a player who said &quot;Yes&quot;. Both you and that player place the card which they think is identical with each other face-down.&#10;&#10;In a later turn, you may reveal the two cards. If these are identical, Mito's side takes the pair which can count toward victory.

The nightmare wins when they have taken three pairs of cards with different symbols or six cards with the same symbol, or when the image deck runs out.&#10;&#10;As the nightmare, you should try to misdirect Mito's side indicating that you have the right image, even if you don't have.

The 2 versions of the rule share the same principles for orders, combat and fire.&#10;&#10;3 levels: from tactical to strategical.&#10;&#10;Standard : ~13 units / ~1h &#10;Epic : ~30 units / 2h &#10;Legend: ~50 units / 3h&#10;&#10;BannerWar is a fluid and balanced system. It incorporates combat and fire resolution suitable for tactical battles.&#10;On a strategical level, the rules add orders and deployment principles.&#10;It takes into account a wide variety of troops while keeping the rules simple.&#10;Its army lists offer real options on a tactical as well as on a strategical level.&#10;Faster than most, it does not require more figures than other rulesets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;BannerWar comprend une version de r&egrave;gles Historique et une version Fantastique. Les deux versions utilisent les m&ecirc;mes m&eacute;caniques de jeu pour les ordres, les combats et les tirs, cependant la version historique est plus d&eacute;taill&eacute;e sur la formation des arm&eacute;es, les manoeuvres strat&eacute;giques et la psychologie ; alors que la version fantastique est plus accentu&eacute;e sur la diversit&eacute; et l'originalit&eacute; avec quelques r&egrave;gles sp&eacute;ciales qui donnent beaucoup de caract&egrave;re aux unit&eacute;s.&#10;&#10;La version historique offre des champs de bataille vari&eacute;s et tr&egrave;s agr&eacute;ables, qui rendent les parties fortement strat&eacute;giques. Elle apporte la possibilit&eacute; de garder des troupes en r&eacute;serve, en renfort, en embuscade ou de les mettre en avant garde ou arri&egrave;re garde. Cette version est acc&eacute;s sur le r&eacute;alisme gr&acirc;ce aux r&egrave;gles d'ardeur et de r&eacute;sistance. Les unit&eacute;s se d&eacute;placent et combattent de mani&egrave;re historique sans &ecirc;tre noy&eacute;es de r&egrave;gles sp&eacute;ciales.&#10;&#10;La version fantastique est all&eacute;g&eacute;e sur la strat&eacute;gie des terrains et des corps d'arm&eacute;e. Les contraintes de d&eacute;placement et certaines phases de jeu sont moins d&eacute;taill&eacute;es pour faire place &agrave; des r&egrave;gles sur les Monstres, les Cr&eacute;atures Volantes, les unit&eacute;s mythiques, les H&eacute;ros et la Magie.&#10;&#10;Bien entendu comme le syst&egrave;me de jeu est commun, il est tout &agrave; fait possible (et m&ecirc;me recommand&eacute; &agrave; terme) de jouer la totalit&eacute; des r&egrave;gles de BannerWar. Cela ne rend pas les parties bien plus longues ni moins fuides; et cela permet d'avoir un jeu historique ou fantastique d'un grand r&eacute;alisme avec une diversit&eacute; de troupes tr&eacute;s &eacute;lev&eacute;e qui se joue autant sur la partie tactique que strat&eacute;gique.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You try to collect fruits in these islands, but only one can enter each of these islands at a time.&#10;&#10;Each player has four cards in their hand: three fruit cards (Red, Green, Blue) and pass.&#10;&#10;Each round, three victory point cards are placed on the table face-up, attached to each island. Then players simultaneously play one card from their hand. For each island, if only one player played fruit card of that color, that player gain the victory point card attached to the island. If more than one player played the same island, no players gain the victory point card. If any player plays pass, that player gains two points.&#10;&#10;After the sixth round, each player adds up their victory points, and conditional victory points awarded. The highest scorer wins the game.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#181;&#182;&#230;&#181;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#167;&#152;&#229;&#175;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#229;&#174;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#142;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#229;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#143;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&hellip;&#10;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#162;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#139;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

The configuration of these powers, represented by the colored rings, is updated throughout the game - players can change the position of one ring as part of each move, placing up to 3 rings on any figure. When more rings of different colors are placed on a figure the powers combine.&#10;The objective is to capture both of your opponent's golden rings.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In the end, their conflict triggered an incredible explosion of energy, resulting in the mutual destruction of these god-like beings. This explosion was so powerful, it twisted the very fabric of reality in upon itself, ripping the world in two and leaving time to flow in an infinite loop. Those who survived the brutal conflict soon realized the energy of these dead gods was slowly being drawn to the central point where the two worlds now met. Skilled in the art of energy manipulation, those known as Summoners are now able to harness the power stored in this central point, referred to as The Node, to conjure Wizards and Monsters to do battle. By defeating a conjured being in battle, Summoners can capture energy in special Gemstones. Only through the use of these energy-filled Gemstones can the loop finally be broken and order restored to the world. However, there is a catch. Only the side with the greatest amount of stored energy will survive when the two halves of the world merge once again. With the fate of their world at stake, the battle between the Summoners thus began.&#10;&#10;A game consists of 4 rounds with 5 battles. Each round is played as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Attacker chooses one card from their hand and plays it face-up on the table. Activate any abilities that apply.&#10;     The Defender then chooses 1 card from their hand and plays it face-up in front of the Attacker's card. Activate any abilities that apply.&#10;     After all relevant abilities have been applied, compare the cards' Power levels. The card with the higher value wins.&#10;     Turn the losing card sideways to the defeated position. (In the case of a tie, turn both cards sideways.) Note: A card is not considered &quot;defeated&quot; if the battle ended in a tie.&#10;     Assign the role of Attacker to the player who won the battle, and Defender to their opponent. (In the case of a tie, the roles of Attacker and Defender remain the same as the previous battle.)&#10;     Repeat steps 1-5 until all 5 battles have been played OR the special win condition is met.&#10;&#10;&#10;After all 4 rounds are finished, the player with more points showing on their Gemstones is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",
