    "Description": "In Alien 51: The Elevator, you will become the coordinators of a team of workers and compete to be the fastest to take them to their jobs. This will not be an easy task since the elevator of these offices does not work too well, which will turn a daily routine into an epic feat.&#10;&#10;Alien 51: The Elevator has 3 different game modes. The Competitive Mode (2 to 4 players) is modulated in difficulty and takes place during the chaotic time of entry to the office. In it, players will compete to be the first to place their workers in their jobs. The Cooperative (2 to 4 players) and Solitaire (1 player) modes pass during the office's closing time and both share a common goal: to remove all workers from the building before the boss meets the strict closing time and leave them trapped inside.&#10;&#10;&#10;En Alien 51: El Ascensor, os convertir&eacute;is en los coordinadores de un equipo de trabajadores y competir&eacute;is para ser el m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido en llevarlos a sus puestos de trabajo.

El Modo Competitivo (2 a 4 jugadores) es modulable en dificultad y transcurre durante la ca&oacute;tica hora de entrada a la oficina. En &eacute;l, los jugadores competir&aacute;n para ser el primero en colocar a sus trabajadores en sus puestos de trabajo. Los Modos Cooperativo (2 a 4 jugadores) y Solitario (1 jugador) transcurren durante la hora de cierre de la oficina y ambos comparten un objetivo com&uacute;n: sacar del edificio a todos los trabajadores antes de que el jefe cumpla con la estricta hora de cierre y los deje atrapados en su interior.&#10;&#10;",

Play your cards wisely to get rid of all the ghosts, undead, vampires, zombies and other spooky creatures haunting your mansion. Block your opponents while they're trying to drive spirits out of their home and into your backyard &ndash; but beware as the scariest ghosts will not be driven away so easily...&#10;&#10;In game terms, your goal in Ghooost! is to get rid of all of your cards in hand and in your mansion by playing a card (or several matching cards) equal to or higher than the one(s) played previously. To set up, each player has four ghost cards in hand and 4-12 cards in his mansion. Ghost cards come in four suits and have values ranging from 1 to 14, with a few cards having special powers; scary (red) ghosts, for example, can be topped only by fearless ghosts, other scary ghosts, or a ghost quartet, while fearless ghosts can be played no matter what's on top of the Cemetery (discard pile).&#10;&#10;A game consists of two stages. In the first stage, players draw or play cards to prepare their hand of cards for the second stage. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play one or more matching cards on the Cemetery equal to or higher than the cards played previously, then refill your hand to four cards by drawing from the Crypt (deck).&#10;    Take all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand; any card can be played on an empty Cemetery.&#10;    Draw one card from the Crypt and try to play it, taking all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand if the play isn't valid.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once the Crypt is empty, the second stage begins and players take turns either playing valid cards into the Cemetery or taking all cards from the Cemetery into their hand. If a player plays two or three matching ghosts, he takes another turn immediately; if he plays four cards that match (or plays cards that complete a quartet), those cards and the Cemetery are removed from play, then he takes another turn. If a player's hand is empty, he draws the top card from his mansion, playing it if valid and taking all the Cemetery cards into his hand if not. If a player empties his hand and mansion, he's out and the others keep playing. Play continues until only one player has cards in hand; this player loses the game and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;Ghooost! includes a scoring system that allows for multiple rounds.&#10;&#10;",

In doing so, the players can decide how much risk they take by choosing how detailed they get in their localization attempt.&#10;The systems works more or less like betting at roulette; the smaller the region you guessed, the higher the return. But if you make a mistake you get nothing at all!  &#10;Europa is to 'Deutschland' what 'Ausgerechnet, Uppsala!' was to 'Ausgerechnet, Buxtehude!'. It just takes the game to another geographical level. &#10;The only major difference is the catch-up mechanism: Instead of allowing trailing players to jump over occupied fields on the point track, the game reuses the 'barriers' from 'Globalissimo'. The leading player has to guess the country of a certain location in order to advance further on the point track. Trailing players can then proceed without such a trial. Additionally, the last player may make a bonus guess by correcting or detailing another player's guess for a bonus point.&#10;&#10;",

Your 8 figures are numbered 1 (Prince), 2 (Samurai) or 3 (Fighter) and may only move their number of spaces. Finishing a move on an opponent's piece is a strike and it is removed from the board. Strike a prince and the player is out of the round, though their pieces remain on the board. Get your Prince to the centre and score 5 bonus points, whilst all remaining pieces score their value. Play a few rounds and most points win.&#10;Interesting abstract game, was very popular in Germany and often reprinted.&#10;&#10;Description for Kaiser, K&ouml;nig, Edelmann (Emperor, King, Nobleman):&#10;Each player tries to be the first to reach the castle with his prince. At the beginning of play the figures are arranged according to a certain starting order. The player, whose turn it is, moves one of his figures as many fields as it is allowed (3,2,1). If the figure moves onto a field with an opposing figure, this one is struck and taken out of the play. If it takes an opposing emperor out of the play in this way, that player is immobilized completely; his figures however remain in the game as handicaps. One may not jump over figures. Likewise it is not allowed to move through the palace or go back to the spot you came from. Additionally the player is obliged to move every turn. The emperor can move only to one crossing, the kings to two crossings and the noble men up to three crossings. The player whose emperor first arrives at the castle wins.&#10;&#10;",

The region's historical trade value of jade also plays a crucial role, as players must also gather this precious material.&#10;&#10;UMATAKA utilizes a worker placement system where players use human and dog pieces as workers, placing between one and four workers in designated spaces. Dogs, which are relatively easier to acquire during the game, must work alongside humans due to several restrictions. After placing workers and taking actions, the number of workers influences the advancement of a piece on the &quot;Exploration Track.&quot; The action located at the space where this explorer piece stops is also executed. This mechanism forces players to think strategically about the number of workers they deploy, and sometimes strategically placing extra workers can provide an advantage in the game.&#10;&#10;",

In Magus, the players embody powerful sorcerers who send heroes under their control to plunder the castle of Ardeth, their mentor, as they crave the treasures and secrets that are hidden there.&#10;In a game the players must fulfill missions and different objectives until obtaining 10 dominion points and thus to proclaim the new lord of the castle. In addition to controlling a hero, the player has spells at his disposal with which he can alter the very structure of the castle.&#10;In a Magus turn, a player can perform up to 2 normal actions (move, attack, play spells, among others) and any number of quick actions (use knowledge, advance missions, use relics, etc.) Each action has a cost that must be paid with energy from one of the two existing wells: Well of power (Green) and Well of control (purple). As the game progresses players will gain energy that they can freely assign to their power or control reserve as needed for one or the other action.&#10;The Magus main play mode is competitive, each player will try to reach before the rest to the 10 dominion points using his hero and his spells to delay the advance of enemies. But there is also the cooperative mode, in which players must defeat the powerful archmage Ardeth. For this they must travel the castle accomplishing different objectives that reduce the dominion of the archmage before he arrives at the castle for the final combat.&#10;In cooperative mode, the Dominion points are the way of measuring Ardeth's strength, which players must reduce as much as possible whilst preparing for his arrival. When the archmage appears in the castle players must face him, and the life of Ardeth will be determined by the dominion gained at the moment of his appearance.&#10;&#10;&#10;Magus: Aura Mortis es una reimplementaci&oacute;n de Magus: &quot;Fortuna et nostis&quot;. En Magus los jugadores encarnan a poderosos hechiceros que env&iacute;an a h&eacute;roes bajo su control a saquear el castillo de Ardeth, su mentor, ya que ans&iacute;an los tesoros y secretos que all&iacute; se esconden.&#10;En una partida los jugadores deber&aacute;n cumplir misiones y distintos objetivos hasta conseguir 10 puntos de dominio y as&iacute; proclamarse el nuevo se&ntilde;or del castillo. Ademas de controlar a un h&eacute;roe, el jugador tiene conjuros a su disposici&oacute;n con los que podr&aacute; alterar la estructura misma del castillo.&#10;En un turno de Magus un jugador puede realizar hasta 2 acciones normales (mover, atacar, jugar conjuros, entre otras) y cualquier cantidad de acciones r&aacute;pidas (usar saberes, avanzar misiones, usar reliquias, entre otras. Cada acci&oacute;n tiene un costo que debe ser pagado siempre fichas de energ&iacute;a de alguno de los dos tipos existentes. Existe la energ&iacute;a de poder (de color verde) y la energ&iacute;a de control (de color violeta. A medida que avanza la partida los jugadores ir&aacute;n ganando energ&iacute;a que podr&aacute;n asignar libremente a su reserva de poder o de control seg&uacute;n la necesitar para una u otra acci&oacute;n. &#10;El modo principal de juego de Magus es competitivo, cada jugador intentar&aacute; llegar antes que el resto a los 10 puntos de dominio vali&eacute;ndose de su h&eacute;roe y sus conjuros para retrasar el avance de sus enemigos. Pero tambi&eacute;n existe el modo cooperativo, aqu&iacute; los jugadores deben derrotar al poderoso archimago Ardeth. Para ello deben recorrer el castillo cumpliendo distintos objetivos que reduzcan el dominio del archimago antes de que este llegue al castillo para el combate final. &#10;En el modo cooperativo los puntos de dominio miden la fuerza de Ardeth, y los jugadores deben reducirlo lo mas posible mientras se preparan para su llegada. Cuando el archimago aparece en el castillo deben enfrentarlo, y la vida de Ardeth estar&aacute; determinada por la dominio acumulado al momento de su aparici&oacute;n.&#10;&#10;",

No one knows how they got there or how they managed to affect reality. Anyway, only rigorous cooperation could grant them enough power.&#10;&#10;The end of the world brought about by these wise guys was not as perfect as they had planned. Soon it turned out that some men left in the ashes of the past world could enter the realm of the Masters of Brilliance. Perhaps the power they cast upon the world to destroy it left a solid print? Or perhaps the transition was not that difficult?&#10;&#10;The first man to discover he possessed this ability was Jonas Arvani. When he found out he was not the only one, he founded a guild. The boarding ability &ndash; that is, the ability to jump into a much higher plane, where the Masters of Brilliance have their twisted utopia &ndash; soon turned into an enormous business. Not everyone managed to follow the guild's strict rules. Therefore competitive undertakings began to appear that were less able and less honest. Now retrievers have been trained by guilds to steal inventions and devices from the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance. Those items become artifacts in the ruined world. The most valuable prizes are schematics that allow mankind to recreate lost devices, so that they can serve people again.&#10;&#10;In the board game Enclave: Zakon Kra&#197;&#132;ca &#197;&#154;wiata, each player starts with a retriever card along with the machine that boosts their boarding ability. During the game, which lasts six turns, players are allowed to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Upgrade their retriever (mental and physical condition)&#10;    Upgrade their jump machine (sarcophagus and sesame)&#10;    Buy items to protect themselves from deadly traps in the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance&#10;    Buy medication needed to heal their mental damage and physical wounds&#10;    Boarding the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance to find valuable prizes and knowledge&#10;    Do the job for the &quot;Shepherd&quot; without any risk, but with fewer profits&#10;    Visit the oracle to peek at the future and gain initiative in the next turn&#10;    Use the character or location card on the path &quot;to the tree&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;This path is the main way to victory, known as becoming &quot;the chosen of the Tree&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;Dwunastu przyw&oacute;dc&oacute;w religijnych zwanych Mistrzami Blasku zyska&#197;&#130;o wielkie wp&#197;&#130;ywy oraz mn&oacute;stwo wyznawc&oacute;w, aby w noc przesilenia niespodziewanie wywo&#197;&#130;a&#196;&#135; koniec &#197;&#155;wiata dok&#197;&#130;adnie wed&#197;&#130;ug przepowiedzianych przez siebie regu&#197;&#130;.&#10;&#10;W&#197;&#130;a&#197;&#155;ciwie sta&#197;&#130;o si&#196;&#153; wszystko, co tylko ludzie zdo&#197;&#130;ali sobie wyobrazi&#196;&#135;.

    "Description": "(from Hexasim website:)&#10;&#10;Kawanakajima 1561, simulates the fourth battle of Kawanakajima. This will be the first game in the series Sengoku Jidai, which will cover battles in 16th century Japan. The system is designed so players can finish a game in an evening, and has simple but dynamic mechanics.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player takes the role of a commander in chief. Each army consists of various clans, and the players have to choose an action for each of their clans. Each clan is represented by 1 to 3 units. The units have various abilities, summarized by the 4 factors: &eacute;lan, mass, fire and the presence of a leader. Elan represents factors such as the unit's mobility, and its boldness in attack, and is also used to reflect the advantage that cavalry can have over infantry when attacking. The unit's mass represents its staying power, such as its ability to resist a cavalry charge or a rout.&#10;&#10;A unit's abilities are tied to the value of its four factors and the current mode of the clan that it belongs to. A clan can be placed in one of four modes: Attack, Defense, Move, and Rally. The owning clan's mode will affect a unit's ability to move or engage in combat.&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of alternating phases where a player can activate his units. The order in which activations will occur is tied to a chit pull system.&#10;&#10;The game system requires each player to plan carefully how to win. They must maneuver to gain numerical superiority, deploy in terrain that takes advantage of their clan's mode, and try to surprise his opponent by attacking troops that are not prepared.&#10;&#10;The system also places the players under the same historical limitations as the actual Japanese leaders. Japanese generals of this time prearranged their battle plans and coordinated their armies with a precise system of semaphore flags and sound signals.&#10;&#10;The game includes 2 scenarios: one depicting the historical battle, and a &quot;what if?&quot; hypothetical scenario. In the historical scenario, Takeda's army is divided in two contingents. One of the contingents is taken by surprise by Uesugi's army, and has to fight a holding action until the rest of the army can come to its aid.&#10;The hypothetical scenario explores what could have happened several days before the historical battle.&#10;&#10;In Kawanakajima 1561 a hex represents about 250 meters and a strength point corresponds to around 100 men.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;     1 map A1 (84cm*60cm)&#10;     228 game counters (88 5/8inch, 140 1/2inch)&#10;     one rule book with scenarios&#10;     Game play aids&#10;     Cardboard jacket&#10;     4 dice&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Age of Inventors will travel back to the second half of the 19th Century where a series of inventions is about to change where and how people live, work, travel, and communicate. Your role is to lead humanity&rsquo;s charge into a bright new future.&#10;&#10;Every player selects one of the four types of laboratories. You may play as a Government Lab, a Corporation Lab, a University Lab, or an Innovator Lab. Each one offers asymmetrical powers to use to your advantage.&#10;&#10;While running the Lab, you will have the chance to purchase different Equipment made available every round. Your choice of equipment will be influenced by each piece&rsquo;s ability and its cost in funds. Your equipment will also indirectly affect your order of play during every round.&#10;&#10;Most importantly, you will be able to use your funds to hire legendary inventors like Tesla, Marie Curie, or Einstein himself! Every inventor has their own unique abilities that might just give you the edge against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Then you need to conceive of the right invention from the inventions offer by spending your most valuable resource, &ldquo;Ideas.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;To complete each invention, you will need to spend the necessary scientific resources (physics, chemistry, or engineering) required by the particular invention. Use your lab assistants as workers and place them on the locations available to research and gather these resources. These locations can either be on your lab or with the inventors you and your opponents have placed on the board. Then, all you need to do is to find an available inventor to invent your invention. Unsurprisingly, you will need an engineer for an engineering invention and so on.&#10;&#10;By completing inventions, you not only gain their unique instant ability, but you also advance humanity&rsquo;s progress in different tracks: Industrial, Economic, and Academic. The player whose laboratory contributes the most to society will be crowned the winner at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;However, there is much more than meets the eye. You may gain secret victory points by cleverly placing inventions on the board and gaining Breakthrough Tokens, or gather experiments to fulfill. There is also the Ingenuity rank that affects most parts of the game where you may advance, but at a cost.&#10;&#10;Experience a strongly replayable game with a different pattern of inventors and inventions created every time. Breaking News cards spice up the game by altering the rules of each round just a bit to make it more interesting.&#10;&#10;Age of Inventors combines Worker Placement and Action Selection mechanics with an interesting blend of asymmetrical power use from your Lab and Inventors, and eventually tile placement of Inventors and Inventions. It is a fast and intense, highly replayable game that is equally enjoyable as a family game or as a competitive euro game for the most demanding gamer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the summer of 1914, Germany&rsquo;s East Asia cruiser squadron&rsquo;s superbly-trained crews of long-service professionals made Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee's small fleet the envy of the China station. But when war broke out, this tiny force found itself far from home and threatened by the powerful Japanese navy, many times the size of the German squadron. Spee decided to force his way home around the world. After an epic journey across the Pacific, his cruisers met their end off of the Falkland Islands in a final battle.&#10;&#10;Cruiser Warfare gives the Great War at Sea series its greatest scope yet: the entire world. British, German, Japanese, Italian, Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Dutch ships begin as they did in August 1914. The German player must disrupt Allied commerce and try to get the cruisers home if at all possible. The Allied player must track them down and destroy them before they can wreak havoc.&#10;&#10;Cruiser Warfare&rsquo;s map divides the world into sea areas, with modified search rules allowing German and Austrian ships to look for prey, and Allied ships to hunt them. Once contact is made, combat is resolved using the standard game rules.&#10;&#10;Cruiser Warfare: Final Edition comes in our popular Playbook format and includes the playing pieces from the first edition (we had several hundred of each in storage), a new map, new full-color play aids, and an all-new book with revised rules and scenarios, additional scenarios plus historical background.&#10;&#10;Cruiser Warfare: Final Edition is a complete game: everything you need to play (except dice) is included in the Playbook.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the night of 5-6 june 1944, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were to be parachuted behind Utah Beach in order to secure the approaches to the beach for the first wave of the landing forces. The sector had been flooded by the Germans, transforming streams and lowlands into swamps and increasing the strategic value of the bridges and roads of the region. Of these, the two bridges located in the commune of Chef-du-Pont and the crossroads of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise are of primary importance for the Allies. In fact, withouth capturing them, it would be impossible to advance quickly into the Cotentin Peninsula and enlarge the bridgehead.&#10;&#10;The paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne need to be dropped onto three Drop Zones: The 505th PIR to the northwest of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise, the 507th PIR to the north of Amfreville, and the 508th PIR to the south of Amfreville. The Americans did have some reservations about the chances of success of this airborne operation. The landing zones were surrounded by several swamps and the smallest error would lead to heavy losses. The most pessimistic predictions had the casualty rate at 80%.&#10;&#10;While flying over the Cotentin, the troop transports were fired upon by German anti-aircraft defenses and thrown into disorder. Some pilots broke formation and gave the order to jump before the drop zones had been reached, leaving many parachutists dozens of kilometers away from their objectives. The less fortunate landed in the swampland and drowned in their heavy equipment. More than three-quarter of paratroopers did not land where they were supposed to, leading to the complete disorganization of the American troops dropped over France. This general state of disorder resulted in a series of clashes all over southeastern Cotentin. The Germans, themselves disorganized, limited their engagements against an enemy force whose objectives and strength remained unknown.&#10;&#10;Despite an extremely high rate of losses (more than 50% during the night of 6 June 1944 alone), the American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions accomplished a great deal of their assigned missions. The Germans, disorganized by the chaos, were incapable of counter-attacking. The landing could begin.&#10;&#10;&quot;Night Drop&quot; simulates the first hours of June 1944 and focuses on the operations conducted by the 82nd Us Airborne division. During the first (night time) game turns, the American player had to regroup his scattered forces in order to re-form companies and regiments. As long as this reorganization remains undone, American troops remain very vulnerable and the American player cannot know which objectives are in priority.&#10;&#10;The German player can use the opportunity to create even more disorder in the American ranks, or chase after isolated paratroopers. But the surprise of the airborne assault keeps the Germans blind to the objectives of their adversaries. As daylight comes, the German player slowly begins to learn the intentions of the American troops and can better organize as reinforcements arrive.&#10;&#10;For the American player, the knowledge of his objectives and the strength of his units give him the advantage over his enemies. The superiority from which he benefits allows him to bluff his opponent by attacking lesser important objectives, obliging the German player to make some critical choices: continue to defend a hex of middling importance and risk abandoning a more important hex, or focus on defending more important hexes and risk having been &quot;fooled&quot; by the enemy! The randomness of the drop, the priority assigned to each objective, and the arrival of German reinforcements assures a different game each time.&#10;&#10;140 counters&#10;34&quot; x 22&quot; map&#10;8 pages rules booklet&#10;&#10;Scale: 1 counter = 1 American company or 1 German section/company&#10;1 game turn = 1 hour&#10;1 hex = 400 meters&#10;&#10;(source: publisher's description)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vitamors, a plagued kingdom, is filled with nothing but woes and desperation. The plague doctor, wearing a beak-like mask, tries to steal lives from the Grim Reapers, again and again, with great effort. Most of the time, his effort is all wasted under the Grim Reaper&rsquo;s manipulation. However, those who come back to life still render hopes to the people of Vitamors.&#10;&#10;&quot;VITA MORS&quot; is a card game featuring secret identity, partnerships, voting, and hand management. Everyone plays as a Grim Reaper, with the VITA-MORS coin in their hands, messes up with the plague doctor, and controls the destiny of the people in the kingdom Vitamors. Through voting and exercising privilege, players get to determine whether a character should live or die. At the end of the game, the one who makes the pattern of life and death the same as they wish, will eventually become the winner.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#10;&#10;&#231;&#182;&#173;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#231;&#169;&#134;&#230;&#150;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#130;&#163;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#231;&#152;&#159;&#231;&#150;&#171;&#232;&#130;&#134;&#232;&#153;&#144;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#143;&#170;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#147;&#173;&#230;&#179;&#163;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#181;&#149;&#230;&#156;&#155;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#229;&#190;&#133;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#226;&#148;&#128;&#226;&#148;&#128;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#231;&#152;&#159;&#231;&#150;&#171;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#180;&#232;&#145;&#151;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#229;&#152;&#180;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#229;&#133;&#183;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#233;&#128;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#231;&#178;&#190;&#230;&#185;&#155;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#229;&#165;&#189;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#229;&#143;&#136;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#179;&#168;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#151;&#133;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#184;&#177;&#231;&#132;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#162;&#171;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#229;&#165;&#189;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#133;&#182;&#229;&#175;&#166;&#229;&#143;&#170;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#229;&#176;&#145;&#230;&#149;&#184;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#155;&#180;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#231;&#151;&#133;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#168;&#186;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#228;&#190;&#157;&#231;&#132;&#182;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#164;&#169;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#134;&#229;&#176;&#141;&#231;&#182;&#173;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#231;&#169;&#134;&#230;&#150;&#175;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#232;&#170;&#170;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#128;&#153;&#229;&#183;&#178;&#231;&#182;&#147;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#183;&#154;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#231;&#182;&#173;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#231;&#169;&#134;&#230;&#150;&#175; VITA MORS&#227;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#231;&#135;&#159;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#232;&#136;&#135;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#231;&#174;&#161;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#161;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#230;&#137;&#174;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#232;&#145;&#151;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#143;&#161;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#161;&#172;&#229;&#185;&#163;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#188;&#132;&#231;&#152;&#159;&#231;&#150;&#171;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#230;&#142;&#140;&#230;&#142;&#167;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#233;&#128;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#230;&#172;&#138;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#230;&#129;&#169;&#229;&#135;&#134;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#232;&#145;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#143;&#136;&#230;&#136;&#150;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#232;&#179;&#156;&#228;&#186;&#136;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#166;&#143;&#229;&#190;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#232;&#180;&#143;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cornish Smuggler allows players to assume the roles of Smugglers in 18th Century Cornwall. Buying and selling goods for gold while employing a network of local characters, secret knowledge, hidden locations, bribes, dirty tricks and a healthy dose of cunning to evade the attentions of the customs officers and the other players.&#10;&#10;When selling goods, players can choose how much to sell them for; making a choice to either increase their reputation and influence in the community by selling cheaply, or maximising their profit by getting the best price possible.  An increased reputation allows a player to transport their contraband more easily and evade customs, but to win the game they must have the most gold out of all the other players.  However, the higher the price goods are sold for, the stronger the customs forces become&hellip;&#10;&#10;Smuggling in Cornwall was rarely performed by just one person; rather large swathes of the community were often involved.  In Cornish Smuggler, players must build a smuggling network by employing characters; each with a unique ability, cost and affect on a smugglers reputation within the local community.&#10;&#10;When smuggling goods, the choice of which goods to buy is key. Players can choose to buy big bulky goods, which are hard to fit on board ship (goods and ships are all different shapes and sizes) or smaller more easily transported goods which are worth far less.&#10;&#10;Also, different sized  towns will offer different prices for goods.  Smaller towns offer a lower price, but with a lower risk.  Larger towns offer better prices and allow smugglers to sell more goods, but the risk of do so is (generally) much greater.&#10;&#10;The customs forces in Cornish Smuggler will move around the board dependant on what the players do.  Landing, moving and selling goods merits their attention although players can also move customs by spending influence or utilising secrets.  Luckily all Customs can be bribed  meaning that once you've bought them they will remain 'your man' until the end of the game...or until another player pays them more.&#10;&#10;Although starting off fairly underfunded and under supported, as the game progresses the Customs Officers will get steadily stronger, harder to bribe and more numerous.  As such, it gets harder and harder to smuggle goods effectively, secretly and profitably so each game has a clearly defined end point that is visible to all players&#10;&#10;Discovering secret tricks can help a players cause, and there are secret storehouses that can be hired out where you can stash your goods, hiding them from Customs and protecting them from being seized.&#10;&#10;There are many possible paths to victory in Cornish Smuggler.  Players will have to adapt their strategy to accommodate the actions of the other players, employ the right characters, buy the right goods, discover the right secrets and make the right deals.&#10;&#10;This game is about real things that happened to real people in a real place, thus creating a directly relatable experience between 21st Century Cornwall and Cornwall at a time when the community was experiencing significant poverty and exorbitant taxation.  As a result, smuggling wasn&rsquo;t necessarily seen as something that was illegal, but rather as something that was &lsquo;fair game&rsquo; and as such was taken with an often light hearted view.&#10;&#10;What this game is:&#10;&#10;Dodging the Law, employing the local vicar, building an network, discovering and using secrets, renting out the mayor's wine cellar, getting rich, a surprisingly accurate historical representation.&#10;&#10;What this game isn't:&#10;&#10;Ship racing, firing cannons, being a pirate&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Disclaimer: This game is an unauthorized, non-profit game that uses names and images from the original movie by Warner Brothers. Neither the designer nor anyone else is allowed to make any financial profit from it.&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;&#10;I hope you remember the great movie &ldquo;Inception&rdquo;. Cobb and his team of Extractors are offered a job to implant an idea into a person&acute;s mind by infiltrating his dreams. The target is Fischer and the client is Saito, who will profit greatly from Fischer's new &ldquo;idea&rdquo;. The reward: a lot of money and the chance for Cobb to return home to see his children. But to plant a thought deep enough into someone&acute;s mind, you&acute;ll have to go very deep. A dream within a dream&hellip; within another dream. And if you die in a dream, you&acute;ll end up in Limbo and probably go mad.&#10;&#10;Guide Cobb and his team through the different dream levels. Recruit your team members and sedate Fischer in the waking reality. Step deeper into his dreams, plant Inceptions, and prepare for the final Kick that&acute;ll bring the team back home. Fight against attackers, Cobb's adversaries and Fischer&acute;s &ldquo;dream police&rdquo;. Cobb&acute;s wife Mal will show up and try to stop the team. And some of your team might end up in Limbo and have to be saved first before they can return to reality.&#10;&#10;About the gameplay:&#10;&#10;Inception is a solo (1-player) card game with a playing time of around 50 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each turn the player draws 2 cards to his hand. Some negative cards (Cobb&acute;s Flashbacks) apply immediately, while the others may be played in the &ldquo;Play cards&rdquo; step. Cards may be played in different ways. They may be discarded to use their one-shop effects. Weapon cards may be attached to a character to increase his strength against attacks. Other cards may be placed in a dedicated &ldquo;Convince Display&rdquo; from which they may be played when trying to convince opponents or to plant Inceptions. But the player should also keep some cards in his hand, to either react to new Events or boost his strength when defending against an attacker. These are the tactical choices that have to be made and that will determine success or failure.&#10;&#10;An Event card is drawn from the Dream Level the Characters are currently in. You will have to evade attacks, convince people, plant Inceptions in Fischer&acute;s mind, and face other challenges. Team members might die, as in the movie, and have to be found in Limbo and convinced to come back with you.&#10;&#10;To win the game, the final Inception on Fischer has to be successful, Mal must be dead, and Saito, Cobb, and enough members for the final Kick must still be alive.&#10;&#10;Designed for the BGG Solitaire Print and Play Contest 2012.&#10;&#10;Inception is available as Print and Play (see file section) via ArtsCow, Printerstudio (thanks Jay) as PC game (thanks David) and as Vassal module.

Long aware of German plans, the Soviets were ready and waiting, with heavily fortified lines backed by 3,600 tanks of their own.&#10;&#10;Kursk - South Flank is a stand-alone game in the Panzer Grenadier series: You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the 40 scenarios. Design is by Panzer Grenadier veteran Mike Perryman (Workers and Peasants among many others).&#10;&#10;In this game the German SS Panzer Corps assaults the lines of the Soviet 40th Army, only to meet fierce counter-attacks from the Sixth Guards Army and First Tank Army. Pieces include masses of tanks: Lend-Lease Grants, T-34 tanks in three models, T-70 light tanks and more. The SS counter with Tigers, mobile artillery and a whole lot more.&#10;&#10;There are four semi-rigid mapboards, just like those found in August 1914 or 1940: The Fall of France.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from Compass Games website:)&#10;&#10;After failing to defeat the invading Japanese forces on the beaches of Luzon, General MacArthur, commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), retreated the Philippine Army to the Bataan peninsula and Corregidor, according to War Plan Orange. Holding fortified positions and bolstered by the crack Philippine Scouts, the Allied forces would hold for months against the well equipped and trained Japanese invaders.&#10;&#10;Bataan! is a two-player game, recreating the battle for the peninsula. Vance von Borries has drawn from his game design experience to create a game engine capable of portraying the tense jungle-fighting which took place on Bataan. While the system is based on a previous success, the changes needed to simulate the fighting on Bataan make this a unique gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Japanese forces will move quickly to out-flank and pry the US/Filipino units from their fortifications. Yet the Americans can successfully launch attacks out of these strong points, particularly when the crack Philippine Scouts are in the lead. From time to time a player may lead with his armor and this was the one battle of the war where the lowly US Stuart tank was the superior tank!&#10;&#10;A chit-pull system is used to randomly determine activations for the various formations on each side. In general, formation size is based on a division. Each formation activates individually for movement and combat. Players alternate activations based on the random chit-pull until all formations have played. Most Japanese formations receive two activations per turn, thereby demonstrating their combat capabilities, preparedness and motivation in taking an offensive role. Individual unit counters represent battalions or half battalions, and include efficiency ratings for combat comparisons and other functions.&#10;&#10;Bataan! features five scenarios. The three early scenarios, which include a learning scenario, all play to a conclusion in one sitting. They feature a surprising amount of movement for a mostly jungle warfare game and rely on sound military tactics. Only the fourth scenario, the last battle, is a true set-piece action. The Japanese planned it that way and yet even the outcome of that battle was not pre-ordained. All scenarios are tied together by a campaign scenario where both players contend with supply and disease to field the best force possible for the final offensive.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     1 map &ndash; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; - [scale of 1.2 km to the hex] &#10;        2 full sheets of 0.6&rdquo; counters [or 408 5/8 inch counters]&#10;        11 full-color set-up and player aid cards&#10;        1 rules booklet [with historical notes] &#10;        1 10-sided dice&#10;        1 full color box and lid set&#10;&#10;&#10;Designer: Vance von Borries&#10;Developer: Mark Guttag&#10;Artist: Tim Schleif&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG user description:)&#10;&#10;Bataan! is a two-player operational level game of this WW II Pacific theater campaign, January through April 1942. It presents a fascinating contest of two mismatched armies on a subject our hobby has not gamed often. The US/Filipino defense, embattled, isolated and led initially by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, for three months held off a numerically inferior but well-equipped and very aggressive Japanese force led by General Masaharu Homma. While the US and Filipino forces can be said to have won most of the first contests: the Abucay Line, the Battle of the Points and the Battle of the Pockets, it would be the final contest that decided the issue. Only because of continued complete isolation would the US lose that final battle in April 1942. And yet it was that heroic defense of sublime courage that helped motivate the US to endure the reverses of the war and persevere to a complete victory. It was &quot;Why We Fight.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

This two-player wargame plays in about an hour or two, with a lightning fast set-up time. The Greeks start in their unassailable supply centers, controlling Jerusalem, but the Maccabeans can use ambushes to whittle their foe while cutting off the Greek supply.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the game you strive for control of critical cities in the region, especially Jerusalem, playing cards to move or recruit units or to use a special ability that benefits only your faction. However, there's only one deck, and the more special ability cards you play, the weaker your side becomes in combat &mdash; which leaves you to make tough decisions at almost every play: Do you push for an early advantage, capturing critical regions and amassing a victory point advantage? Or do you bide your time, watching your opponent weaken themselves, then strike hard at the end to steal the win?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Pawns start on the color matching them, which are 4x4 squares in on each of the four corners of the 11x14 board. The object is simple: to get one of your pawns to a starting spot of your opponent. Each turn players can move one pawn up to two spaces, and also place one wall, useful for blocking off their opponent's move. Walls always cover two squares worth of area, and must be placed according to their color (vertically or horizontally). Once players are out of walls, they keep moving pawns until one wins.&#10;&#10;This game is one of a series of 2 player strategy games by Lakeside from the 1970s.&#10;&#10;",

It's also a well-known fact that the only way to get to BE a bigger goblin is to eat a good breakfast.  This makes breakfast in the Goblin Warren a highly competitive and somewhat dangerous meal...&#10;&#10;In this card game, players take the role of Goblins at the Breakfast table, scrambling to eat as much food as possible and to prevent other players from doing the same.&#10;&#10;Illustrated by Travis Hansen, the game plays from 2 to 6 players, (more with multiple decks.)  It takes about 5 minutes to learn, and 15 minutes to play.  It includes about 60 cards.&#10;&#10;To start the game, a few cards are dealt out to the center table, and on each turn, players can do one of the following four things.&#10;&#10;A, They can take a food or weapon from the center of the table.&#10;B, If they have a bigger weapon than another player, they can steal another card from another player's hand.&#10;C, If they have a food card in hand they can eat it, scoring it.&#10;D, They can play a special action card from the center of the table, immediately playing its effects.&#10;&#10;The result is a fast-paced, light-hearted arms race, with quickly shifting strategy and chaotic fun.  After the deck runs out, the player that eats the most food wins!&#10;&#10;It should be noted that this game was a finalist for the 2014 Ion Awards at the SaltCon board game convention in Salt Lake City.&#10;&#10;",

Full of beautifully illustrated and amusingly inappropriate cards and lore, each match leaves you with a story to tell and laughs to be had by all.&#10;&#10;Gamers will appreciate the nostalgic art style and classic RPG elements that drive the brutal theme of the game. NEXUS puts classic tabletop gaming tools like dice, pen, and paper to good use; to pit genetically engineered champions against one another in visceral combat. Players will experience a rush as their dice rolls determine the fate of their hapless champions followed by thunderous bursts of laughter.&#10;&#10;The skirmish mode, while easily picked up by even the most novice of players, has just the right amount of depth, complexity, and self-generating narrative to make each match exhilarating. Dive even deeper with RPG legacy features and build your wealth and influence allowing for countless upgrades and bribes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Once, the world of Mekannis was united and prospered under the guidance of the Great Engine&mdash;an enormous thinking machine built into the molten heart of the world. Over millennia, Mekannis was transformed until every piece of land was incorporated into the gears and levers of the Engine itself. An act of hubris by the world&rsquo;s rulers caused a series of devastating malfunctions that shattered the land and the death of the Great Engine. Now four empires rise to dominance. The Kestrel Dominion, descending from ancient hereditary rulers and cherishing their ancestral tradition of honor; Nova Centralis, a plutocratic nation built upon exploiting wealth and greatly desirous of maintaining their economic edge; the Sylphian Commonwealth, a once-verdant land now poisoned by the aftereffects of the Engine&rsquo;s destruction; and the Grail Prelacy, a theocratic nation emboldened by prophecies of ultimate victory. Each empire vies to fulfill the prophecy and restore the Great Engine, the source of ultimate power.&#10;&#10;In Empire Engine, players take on the role of a mighty empire, powered by rotating gears. During the game, players simultaneously choose actions to attack, defend, salvage, export, or collect resources (goods for export, soldiers to attack your opponents and inventions to score points). Players use their gears to rotate their engines, and in each round perform the actions on the top edges of their engines. The player who scores the most points for the goods, soldiers and inventions in their score pile at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The invitation left you almost breathless with anticipation. The eccentric inventor, Professor Archibald Timely, has opened his stately manor to the public for the first time in years. What brilliant new breakthrough was to be unveiled? As you walk through the front door, you notice an eerie silence with only the sound of your echoing footsteps filling the cavernous halls. With so much to explore in the sprawling old mansion, you wander to the furthest recesses and back again, and again, and again... Hold on; you&rsquo;re having the strangest case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Can you escape before it&rsquo;s too late?&#10;&#10;The Groundhog Gambit, title #6 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room-style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.&#10;&#10;Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.&#10;&#10;This game is app-assisted. When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion website (compatible with all smartphones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the website will tell you which card or cards to take next. The website also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.&#10;&#10;The website also allows you to interact with objects on cards, in the vein of a classic point-and-click adventure. This will help you gain more clues and solve puzzles.&#10;&#10;This system is non-destructible: some groups may choose to write on cards, but this is not required. A group cannot re-play the game but can pass it on to another group for their use.&#10;&#10;This entry in the series takes about two hours to solve and is rated 3 out of 3 in difficulty.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A team of infiltrators from the triad penetrated the police force. However, the police also has sent a team of undercover agents to infiltrate the triad. Ten years later, they are still undercover, but their minds have been twisted by the temptation of power, authority and money &mdash; and nobody is certain about their original roles anymore. Both groups learn that they have been infiltrated and want to ferret out the moles. Each mole has a secret code to lock their identity file, and once the code is cracked their identity is fully revealed. The battle of wits starts now. Either exposing the enemy or taking the chance to change the identity for good can save their lives as long as nobody knows who is who!&#10;&#10;Internal Affairs is an intense elimination game between infiltrators from both the Triad and the Police Force Infiltrator. Each player has a set of secret ID cards which determine that player's allegiance. Each player also has a secret code, which when cracked reveals the player's real ID. At the beginning of the game, each player has five code cards and chooses three of them to be the secret code that locks the identity file. During their turn, players try to crack other players' codes to find out who is who and get their team to victory. Due to action cards, though, ID cards may be passed from player to player and this may change each player's allegiance. Players must be quick to win, as otherwise they may end up in the losing team when they least expect it.&#10;&#10;Internal Affairs is designed for 5-8 players, but alternative rules have been included to allow for play with 2-4.&#10;&#10;",

The game is designed for 1-3 players.&#10;&#10;All three of the King Sanchos, including any non-player Sanchos, are competing to win by fortifying the castles and towers illustrated on the board (one in each region). Players gain victory points for each castle or tower fortified with their pieces: 3 points for a home castle (2 points in the solo game), 2 points for a neutral castle, and 1 point for a tower. If at any time during the game a Sancho has 10 or more victory points, they win a major victory. If no player achieves this during the game, the Sancho with the most victory points after the last card is played wins a minor victory.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. Each player has a turn during each round. At the start of the round, the commander for the round plays a card from their hand. This card indicates the number of command points (CPs) from 1 to 3 that the commander uses during the round, and it also describes the actions that each other player must take on their turn, if possible. The game ends either at any point when a Sancho has 10 or more victory points, or after the final card from all players' hands has been resolved.&#10;&#10;",

One of the players is the commander of the Pursuit Brigade - Polish fighter group defending Warsaw on September 1st., 1939, the very first day of World War II, while the other commands the attacking German Luftwaffe. Polish player has access to four P.11 fighters, outdated and slow but highly manoeuvrable. German player uses two powerful Heinkel He-111 bombers and three fast and well-armed Messerschmitt BF-110 fighter. They conduct aerial duels by using special dice. &#10;The mission of the Third Reich&rsquo;s air force is to bomb Capital City. Polish Air Force mission is to shoot down the bombers using the advantage of clouds, hidden airfields and anti-aircraft artillery. &#10;The name of the game &ldquo;111&rdquo; evokes one of the escadrilles, which pilots, after Poland&rsquo;s defeat in 1939, formed the personnel of the famous 303 Fighter Squadron in 1940 during the Battle of Britain. This makes the &ldquo;111&rdquo; the prequel of &ldquo;303&rdquo;, showing the crucial differences between aerial war over Poland in 1939 and Britain in 1940.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Set in an age of feuding samurai, wandering swordsmen and fearless warrior monks, Ronin is a skirmish wargame that captures the flavor and excitement of such Akira Kurosawa films as Seven Samurai and Yojimbo. Whether they prefer the loyal samurai retainers of a feudal lord or a horde of desperate bandits, players choose from one of several factions and build forces to battle for dominance and survival in 16th-century Japan. They may also recruit swords-for-hire to supplement their forces &ndash; masterless ronin, martial arts masters and secretive ninja will lend their skills to any commander who can afford them. A full points system, incorporating a wide range of equipment and skills, allows for detailed customization of characters, while scenarios and a campaign system permit them to gain experience and develop over time. The fast-paced rules simulate the cut and thrust of hand-to-hand combat and require the player to make tactical decisions in the middle of a fight, immersing them in an era of war.&#10;&#10;",

Winners become stronger and faster for the next battle. Losers die.&#10;&#10;Each counter in this fast-moving game is a single warrior. Players choose weapons and tactics for their fighters, and send them into combat against men, beasts, or monsters -- to victory, or death.&#10;&#10;Wizard -- The magic companion to Melee -- sorcerous combat, in the arena or in the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Create your wizard, choose his spells, and go into combat. Zap your foe with fireballs or lightning. Summon giants, dragons, and wolves to destroy them all. Or be subtle and entangle them with Magic Rope and Slippery Floor spells. Successful wizards gain skill and power. Losers die.&#10;&#10;Includes rules, classic-sized counters and maps, and three 12mm d6. Two games in one!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It was created in collaboration between Akira It&#197;&#141; (Yu-Gi-Oh! R), Satoshi Nakamura (Duel Masters), and Bushiroad president Takaaki Kidani. The game was also released in conjunction with a TV anime series, &quot;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#136;!! &#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&quot; (Cardfight!! Vanguard).&#10;&#10;In the game, players &quot;ride&quot; a unit as their Vanguard, which represents them on the board. They may also summon other units as Rear Guards to attack or support. The game is won by doing 6 points of damage to the opponent's Vanguard.&#10;&#10;As players attack, if they are using their vanguard they can &quot;drive check&quot; whereby they check the top card of their deck for &quot;triggers&quot; which increase power and have other effects, and add these cards to their hand. Triggers can also be revealed when players take damage to their vanguard by performing a &quot;damage check&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player places their grade 0 starting vanguard face down in the &quot;vanguard circle&quot; and then draws 5 cards. They may return any number of cards to the deck and re-draw to form their starting hand, but only once. It's a good tactic to return trigger cards from your first hand as these are better utilised when drawn from the deck as part of a &quot;drive check&quot; or &quot;damage check&quot;.&#10;&#10;Once the players are done setting up their initial hand they determine who goes first (often, rock-paper-scissors is used for this) and then each turn follows the same turn order:&#10;&#10;1. Stand up (only at the start of the game, and both players perform this action simultaneously whereby they flip over their vanguard)&#10;2. Stand and Draw&#10;3. Ride&#10;4. Call&#10;5. Attack&#10;6. Guard&#10;7. Drive Check&#10;8. Damage Check&#10;9. (more attacks? Go back to 5)&#10;10. Turn end - change to other player and go back to 2&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that strategically, taking damage early in the game can be beneficial as you can use cards in the damage zone to &quot;counter blast&quot; (flip the cards over to activate special actions on certain units).&#10;&#10;",

Buildings are lucrative only if the immediate surrounding area is preserved. The value of nature is appreciated so much more if it is in danger of disappearing. Correspondingly, the price of virgin land varies widely - either very high, or very low - because preservation of nature does not give you income, but it does get you more recognition for your troubles.&#10;&#10;This edge between commerce and nature is rendered even more difficult for the players because at the end (at least in this game) only one pays you money. Who then possesses little at the start, and who has lost in every game, matters little, except who is the richest person at the end.&#10;&#10;Each round, players bid for tiles to lay on the island paradise. One side is a building, the other a forest. The buyer chooses which side to play on. The more forest remains, the more your buildings are worth. However, the more buildings you own, the less forest there will be. Players bid with coins in their closed fist. The highest bidder wins, however, they only pay the cost of the second highest bid. In order to win, you must finish with more money than you started with. As soon as the last building counter has been sold and placed on the board (and any resulting bonuses have been paid) the game ends. All players who have less money than they started with have lost. Out of the remaining players, the winner is the person with the most money.&#10;&#10;",

This GOSS series game presents Third Army&rsquo;s Fall 1944 offensive to just before the Germans launch their Ardennes Offensive further north. The battles of Metz, Fort Driant, and the German counteroffensive attempt against Patton using the new German Panzer Brigades are included. Smaller scenarios allow players to game smaller periods of time in each of the four months making up the campaign. Variant counters are included for an optional airborne operation. The game maps mate to Wacht am Rhein (2012), allowing more options for both simulations. Five maps, 12 counter sheets.&#10;&#10;",

The system scale has 25 light second hexes, and 1 hour turns, making the pursuit to the hyper limit a challenging tactical puzzle. Every warship in the series will be statted out over the release schedule of this product line, as well as additional ships approved by David Weber himself.

Whenever he stops to look at a particular type of parts, a demand for that type of part is created; all the parts at the cheapest price get sold. If there is still a demand, all the parts at the next cheapest price get sold. This continues until demand is met. If parts sold exceed demand, a surplus is created, which may put an extra townsfolk back into the population. If the demand is not met, a shortage is created which will be filled by removing a townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players get a part from their gravediggers, and can pay for more parts. Players can buy store shelves, and stock those shelves with parts, setting them to a specific, fixed price. If parts don't sell. the may be shuffled off to the &quot;parts unknown&quot; pile, which will automatically sell at certain times at a highly discounted rate. There could be, at times, a monster on the loose which scares off shoppers, getting them to buy parts only at the cheapest price, ignoring other available parts. Also, villagers might riot, which causes parts from the gravediggers to be more expensive.
