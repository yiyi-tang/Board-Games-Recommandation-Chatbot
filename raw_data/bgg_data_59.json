Players lead three expeditions to various locations by placing arrows on a map. When an expedition arrives at a location that matches either a location card held by that player or a public location, that player scores that card by placing it in front of him.&#10;&#10;Expedition: Famous Explorers retains all the core rules of earlier versions of the game, but adds optional advanced rules that allow players to score additional points based upon purchasable explorer and event cards. Another game mechanism introduces secret locations.&#10;&#10;",

Cubes come in four colors and are worth 1-3 points depending on their symbol. You can remove a cube as long as two or three faces are exposed and it's not touching a cobra cube. (You can remove the cobra cube itself, but it's worth zero points. With no other options, though, you might have to remove it!)&#10;&#10;As cubes come out, others slide down toward the base. When only a single layer of cubes remains in the plastic tray, the game ends. Remove all the cobra cubes on the bottom level, along with any cubes that share a face with cobras. Whoever has the most ankhs in each color now claims any cubes of this color from the tray. (In a tie, no one claims these cubes.) Players then tally their points, and whoever has the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beneath the Med is a solitaire tactical-level game placing you in command of an Italian submarine during WWII. This is the fourth game in the The Hunters series, and covers one of the largest fleets of submarines in the world at the time. You command one of many submarine models available starting in 1940, and look to successfully complete patrols until the armistice in September 1943.&#10;&#10;While your mission is to destroy as much Allied shipping and as many Capital ships as possible, players will find it extremely challenging to survive until the Armistice.&#10;&#10;Beneath the Med is purposely designed to deliver a brisk yet intensive gaming experience that forces many decisions upon you as you take command of the major Italian submarine classes. All the major classes are accounted for, with every level of detail, including period of service, armaments, crew make-up, damage capacity, and more. Fans of The Hunters will enjoy the same nail-biting game system, but will be challenged by the thick Allied air cover and the problematic fire control systems of the Italian boats.&#10;&#10;Ten Italian submarine classes are profiled and available for you to choose from. Patrol zones reflect the period during the war at sea and will shift as the war progresses. All stages of the U-Boat campaign are represented; difficult missions include mine-laying, commando delivery, and the extremely dangerous harbor penetration missions.&#10;&#10;The major Italian classes are are represented and accurately profiled for the patrols you will undertake during the war:&#10;- Acciaio Class&#10;- Adua Class&#10;- Cagni Class&#10;- Calvi Class&#10;- Foca Class&#10;- Glauco Class&#10;- Liuzzi Class&#10;- Marcello Class&#10;- Marconi Class&#10;- Perla Class&#10;&#10;Patrol Assignments include:&#10;- Atlantic&#10;- Brazilian Coast&#10;- Caribbean&#10;- Eastern, Central and Western Mediterranean&#10;- Singapore&#10;- Spanish Coast&#10;- West African Coast&#10;&#10;The game delivers an historical narrative as 480 ship targets are uniquely identified (including tonnage) with their historical counterparts that were sunk during the war, including freighters, tankers, and American ships.&#10;&#10;Game System Highlights:&#10;- 10 Italian submarine classes represented&#10;- 9 different Patrol Assignments, including supply delivery to Japan&#10;- 480 named shipping targets, including 20 Capital ships&#10;- Special Missions for Commando Team Delivery, Supply Delivery, Human Torpedo attack, and Minelaying&#10;- Combat encounters with individual ships, ships with escort, convoys, enemy submarines, and aircraft&#10;- Daytime and Night Engagements&#10;- Submarine damage includes flooding, hull, torpedo doors, periscope, fuel tanks, crew injury (by crew type), engines, hydrophones, AA gun(s), deck gun, batteries, radio&#10;- Crew Advancement, Commander Promotion including decorations such as the  &quot;Medaglia d'oro al Valor Militare,&quot; the &quot;Medaglia d'argento al Valor Militare,&quot; and the &quot;Medaglia d'bronzo al Valor Militare,&quot; along with other Italian awards.

    "Description": "In June of 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia, meanwhile on the other side of the world the young republic of the United States declared war on Great Britain. It was one of America's most unpopular wars and &ldquo;Mr. Madison's War - The Incredible War of 1812&rdquo; is a strategy game based on the US campaigns to take Canada in the years 1812 - 1814.&#10;&#10;The map board measures 35&rdquo;x24&rdquo; and covers the the northern part of the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and the Canadian provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, the area where most of the battles were fought. The game features over 203 counters that feature the named regiments and battalions that fought the war including militia and Indian units. Also included are named individual Schooner, Brigs and Frigates that fought the naval war on the great lakes. The principal leaders of the war are included such as Major General Isaac Brock, Sir George Prevost, Major General Hull and many others.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the new 'card driven system' which enable players to perform their actions on the game board and score automatic points for the playing of a card as an historical event. The colorful cards include historical information, the year the event took place and a detailed description of the function of the card. There are 110 individual cards in the game.&#10;&#10;The illustrated Rule Book is approximately 20 pages long, and there are 5 player aid sheets that contain the Combat Results Table along with cards to set up the various reinforcements.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to gain Victory Points by invading your enemy's territory while maintaining your own. In complexity the game would be rated as average and would appeal to any student of the Napoleonic Wars in general. It is at present the most comprehensive treatment of the War of 1812 yet offered to the public.&#10;&#10;The publisher, GMT Games, also produced a mounted map for this game which was sold separately.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Deck-Building Game, each player takes on the role of a member of The Company as they set out on the long and treacherous path to Lonely Mountain. Play as Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, Thorin Oakenshield, or others. Your Hero card will guide your strategy throughout the game, or you can break away with a plan of your own.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into a well-oiled machine, and five types of cards can be acquired: Enemies, Allies, Artifacts, Maneuvers, and Locations. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &quot;Path&quot; from which players make their purchases. Each player always has five face-up cards from which to choose each turn, so new options and surprises await each turn.&#10;&#10;When you have amassed enough Power, you can take on an Archenemy! Each Archenemy has Loot cards you can acquire. Defeat a Troll and you might find Sting, Orcrist, or Glamdring! Take on The Goblin King and you might find the maneuvers you need to escape from the Misty Mountains. Azog is the final Archenemy, and he has unfinished business...&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who has accumulated the most Victory Points from the cards in his deck wins.&#10;&#10;Cryptozoic's The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit deck-builder series:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Deck-Building Game Expansion Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tiny Epic Crimes is a fast-paced, crime-fighting, deduction game for 1 to 4 players that offers multiple ways to play. The game can be enjoyed competitively, cooperatively, or solo.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of detectives, and depending on the game mode, will be working either together&hellip;. OR separately&hellip;. to crack the murder case. Time matters, and the first 48 hours after any crime are the most critical. Players race around Echo Ridge City collecting evidence, such as the murder weapon, forensics, or the getaway vehicle.&#10;&#10;This secret evidence is sifted through using the novel Tiny Epic Decoder System, which keeps all of the murderer&rsquo;s other evidence hidden. This knowledge eliminates suspects and helps identify the true killer. But crime doesn&rsquo;t stop for one investigation. Players must answer the call of duty, juggling their time as other criminal activities arise across the city. Resolving these events allow players to gain useful alibis and powerful Force Cards, but knowing full well that their actions will take them hours closer to a reckoning.&#10;&#10;In their final hour, players will stake their careers on a final guess: who they think the murderer really is&hellip; hoping that their wits and detective skills are enough to bring the correct suspect to justice.&#10;&#10;Can you hold this city of crime together long enough to crack the case, or will it go cold and your time on the force run out?&#10;&#10;",

The games end when the last objective is triggered, or a player reaches 7 points.&#10;&#10;Movement is tight, requiring you to second guess your opponents plan. Timing is crucial, triggering objective scoring only when it benefits you. Like a sparring match, every move should be chosen with precision and efficiency, or your opponent will strike.&#10;&#10;",

All those pirates you loved:  Black Bart Roberts, Long Ben Avery, Ned Lowe, L'Ollonais, and, of course, Edward Teach (Blackbeard)--23 in all--are still there, as are the King's Commissioners sent out to stop them. However, the entire play system has been overhauled, and the result is a game that highlights and specializes in player interaction, with almost no down time for any player.&#10;&#10;Players control individual pirates, using them to gain Victory Points by amassing booty and, even more importantly, earning Notoriety for their dastardly deeds;  seizing merchants with cargo ranging from useless paper to the monumental treasure of the Mughal emperors, attacking and sacking ports, fighting storms and scurvy, seeking safe haven in infamous pirate ports such as Tortuga and Madagascar, and, hopefully, using Letters of Marque to retire successfully.&#10;&#10;At the same time that one player is doing all of this, the other players are playing their cards and seizing opportunities to harass the competing pirate.  There is a constant interplay among players, and you never know what might happen when you set out on any given mission.&#10;&#10;We've simplified movement (no more hexes) and ship battles; we've expanded the use of Royal Navy warships; we've even added individual hostages!

In the span of only four minutes the war in the Pacific was changed forever. The chance convergence of the Enterprise and Yorktown Strike Groups between 10:22 and 10:26 AM on June 4th led to the devastation of the Japanese flattops and sparked the infernos which would engulf the Japanese Empire.&#10;&#10;Like its predecessor, The Hell of Stalingrad, Midway drops you right into the seat of the action. You make the strategic decisions necessary to first locate the enemy fleet and then destroy it! Scramble your fighters and organize your Strike Groups for their deadly missions. Will they destroy the enemy and make it back? Your squadrons must contend not just with the enemy's anti-aircraft fire and fight vicious engagements with the enemy's CAP, but also navigate the wide and empty expanses of the ocean. Do the survivors have enough fuel for the return trip to your fleet? Or will they too be lost forever to the misfortunes of war?&#10;&#10;The Fires of Midway explores in separate scenarios the four major carrier battles of 1942: Coral Sea, Midway Island, Eastern Solomons, and Santa Cruz. Also included is a campaign game linking them all together in which players must husband their resources not knowing which of these battles, if any, will yield the decisive result and turn the tide of war in their favor like the historical battle of Midway did.&#10;&#10;The Coral Sea can be played in as little as 1 hr and up to 2.5 hrs for the Midway Battle.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     200 playing cards&#10;     1 sheets of counters&#10;     1 large deck of 18 Carrier Cards &#10;     3 Play Mats&#10;     A 16 Page color Flight Manual (Core Rules) &#10;     A 24 Page Operations Manual (Advanced Rules)&#10;     Dice (2 different colors, D-6)&#10;     Box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Are you ready to prove yourself Khorne&rsquo;s mightiest, most ruthless champion? Gorechosen gives you the chance! This brand-new boxed game from Games Workshop lets four players slug it out for brutal supremacy in brutal pit fights. The box includes four plastic multi-part Citadel miniatures: the Exalted Deathbringer of Khorne, the Skullgrinder, the Slaughterpriest and the Aspiring Deathbringer with Goreaxe and Skullhammer &ndash; four iconic champions of Khorne.&#10;&#10;The game itself is a simple, cunning and laugh-out-loud mix of subtle strategy and straightforward brutal combat, and four players can play through a game in about an hour. 24 action cards let your chosen fighter pick from a variety of painful attacks and gambits (our favourite being the humble Shove, should your victim happen to be standing next to one of the fire pits present on the game&rsquo;s board) while 16 injury cards present, in gruesome detail, the inevitable results of standing in a spiked pit with three other crazed madmen. And the fun doesn&rsquo;t stop with the feuding &ndash; players who have been knocked out can still influence the game thanks to special Fate of the Slain rules. Full rules for these fighters are presented on four fighter sheets, and rules for four more (with miniatures available separately from Games Workshop) are included inside the game&rsquo;s rulebook.&#10;&#10;Each fighter has a unique Kill Zone which dictates what they can hit, and how powerfully. The Slaughterpriest in the box, for example, has enormous reach forwards with his axe (because it&rsquo;s flipping massive) but is weaker when to the sides. (You can imagine an overhead chop, rather than a sweep around him.) Each fighter also keeps track of his wrath using the Wrath Track. Wrath can be spent to make actions, and is usually accrued when fighters are wounded &ndash; injury cards, which are received when combatants are damaged, affect wrath in this way.&#10;&#10;Wrath also has an effect on who goes first, because the angrier fighters are, the more chance there is they will act first! Each turn, fighters put in a number of initiative cards equal to their wrath (each player has a unique design of initiative card), then the top initiative card is turned over, dictating who will act. After that player has made an action, the next initiative card is turned over, and so on and so forth.&#10;&#10;",

The two maps included are painted by original map artist Charlie Kibler. The military unit counters have been redesigned by Charlie Kibler to harken back to the counters in the original games in the series but with a more modern graphical treatment.&#10;&#10;Atlanta Is Ours contains an updated version of the GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that all the other games in the series use. The Advanced Game rules are also standardized so players will be able to move quickly from one campaign to the other.&#10;&#10;Atlanta Is Ours includes fourteen Basic Game scenarios and five Advanced Game campaigns, all extensively playtested:&#10;&#10;Basic Game Scenarios&#10;&#10;    The Opportunity of a Lifetime (Snake Creek Gap/Resaca (5/9/1864, 1 turn, small forces): Beginner&rsquo;s scenario, great for learning how to play.&#10;    The Gap Is Blocked (5/8-5/10/1864, 3 turns): Hypothetical scenario, what could have happened if Sherman had not sent McPherson to Snake Creek Gap and instead attacked or tried to outflank other points in the Confederate defenses.&#10;    Battle of Resaca (5/14/1864; 1 turn): Sherman's entire army reinforces McPherson's corps outside Resaca, and attacks Johnston's army in Resaca, which has just arrived from its positions around Dalton.&#10;    From the Oostanaula to the Etowah (5/17-5/23/1864, 7 turns): Sweeping maneuver from one river to the other, with the aborted battle of Cassville near the end of the scenario.

The goal is to force the Confederates to fight outside the forts or abandon Atlanta. Tara is the fictional plantation in the movie Gone With The Wind, and is &quot;located&quot; a few miles from Jonesboro where the armies have their final battle.&#10;    Last Stand At Tara (8/31 - 9/2/1864; 3 turns): This scenario encompasses both the Confederate attack on the Union at Jonesboro and then the Confederate retreat and consolidation of their army at Lovejoy&rsquo;s Station to the south on the RR line.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Advanced Game Scenarios&#10;&#10;    To The Chattahoochee (Advanced scenario, May-July 1864): This scenario covers Johnston's retreat and the Union advance from the initial lines at Dalton to near Atlanta.&#10;    The Real Game For Atlanta (Advanced scenario, July-Sept. 1864): This scenario encompasses Hood's attacks near the Atlanta forts and Sherman's maneuvering resulting in the Union capture of Atlanta.&#10;    The Atlanta Campaign (Advanced scenario, May-Sept 1864): A &quot;grand campaign&quot; linking the two above advanced scenarios.&#10;    The Hardest Knocks (Advanced scenario, May-July or Sept 1864): Alternative setups to the May campaign startup.&#10;    Without Home Or Habitation (Advanced scenario, Sept &ndash; Oct 1864): After the fall of Atlanta, Hood heads north to cut Sherman&rsquo;s rail line.

    "Description": "Hood Strikes North is the latest design in the award-winning Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (GCACW) series. It depicts the desperate offensive undertaken by General John Bell Hood&rsquo;s Army of Tennessee in November 1864 through central Tennessee in an effort to capture Union-held Nashville. Union forces defending the critical Nashville-Chattanooga corridor, led by Maj. Gen. George Thomas (&ldquo;The Rock of Chickamauga&rdquo;), were initially scattered and ill-prepared to meet Hood&rsquo;s thrust. But under Thomas&rsquo; prudent and patient leadership, the Rebels were stopped at the gates of Nashville and then thoroughly defeated by a Union offensive in mid-December.&#10;&#10;Hood Strikes North will include a single map, two countersheets, and limited special rules, thereby making it a highly suitable game for newcomers to the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series. The game is designed by Joe Balkoski (the original GCACW series creator), Chris Withers, and Ed Beach. Based on mid-19th century Tennessee county maps, the game map will adhere to the high graphic standards of its predecessors, with map design executed by artist Charlie Kibler&mdash;whose work on the series dates back to its creation in 1992.&#10;&#10;Hood Strikes North will use the latest version of the GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that all other games in the series use. After more than a quarter of a century of refinement, these rules are extremely well organized and relatively easy to learn, even for series newcomers. The Advanced Game rules will cover situations specifically applicable to the November &ndash; December 1864 timeframe.&#10;&#10;Hood Strikes North includes eight Basic Game scenarios and one Advanced Game campaign, all extensively playtested:&#10;&#10;    Here Come the Rebels! (November 24, 1864, 1 turn): Introductory scenario, great for learning how to play, depicting the arrival of Nathan Bedford *Forrest&rsquo;s Rebel cavalry in central Tennessee, as Union forces under Maj. Gen. John Schofield hastily retreat to Columbia, Tennessee, covered by their cavalry.&#10;    The Race for Columbia (November 23 &ndash; 29, 1864, 7 turns): The initial attempt by Hood to cut off Union forces in southern Tennessee from Nashville.&#10;    A Great Chance Was Lost (November 28 &ndash; 29, 1864, 2 turns): Hood&rsquo;s army outflanks Union troops defending Columbia, Tennessee, and at Spring Hill attempts to cut them off from Nashville.&#10;    We Will Make the Fight (November 30 &ndash; December 1, 1864, 2 turns): Union troops under Maj. Gen. John Schofield make a stand against Hood&rsquo;s onrushing army at Franklin, Tennessee in their attempt to escape to Nashville.&#10;    The Battle of Nashville (December 15 &ndash; 16, 1864, 2 turns): Thomas takes the offensive and strikes hard at Hood&rsquo;s Rebel army entrenched on the outskirts of Nashville.&#10;    The Enemy Was Badly Whipped (December 4 &ndash; 7, 1864, 4 turns): While the Rebels entrench south of Nashville, Hood orders Nathan Bedford Forrest to attack the Union stronghold at Murfreesboro in an attempt to relieve pressure on Hood&rsquo;s eastern flank.&#10;    Hood&rsquo;s Retreat (December 17 &ndash; 19, 1864, 3 turns): Maj. Gen. James Wilson&rsquo;s Federal cavalry aggressively pursues Hood&rsquo;s beaten army, but Forrest&rsquo;s Rebel cavalry stands in the way.&#10;    That Devil Forrest (December 23 &ndash; 24, 1864, 2 turns): A fast-playing introductory scenario for learning how to play multiple turns. Forrest&rsquo;s Rebel cavalry is the rear guard trying to delay pursuing Union infantry and cavalry.&#10;    Hood Strikes North (November 23 &ndash; December 24, 1864, 32 turns): advanced scenario - A depiction of the entire campaign.&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;    GCACW Series rules booklet (24 pages, including illustrations, play examples, charts)&#10;    Hood Strikes North rules booklet (36 pages, including scenarios, the Game as History, map gazetteer, etc.)&#10;    one 22&quot; x 32&quot; full-color map sheet&#10;    two countersheets (560 counters)&#10;    one Terrain Effects Chart&#10;    two full-color Force Displays&#10;    two 4-page color Charts and Tables&#10;    two 6-sided Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But don't delay or you will be bombarded by your opponent's zooming discs. Ride the fine line between speed and accuracy to win!&#10;&#10;All wooden game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stonewall's Sword: The Battle of Cedar Mountain is a two-player wargame on The Battle of Cedar Mountain, August 9th, 1862. One player commands Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson's Confederate troops and the other controls Nathaniel Banks' Union troops.&#10;&#10;Players win by controlling key areas of the map and by earning victory points by eliminating enemy units. There are two scenarios available, each with their own victory conditions, length, and aspect of the battle that is focused on.&#10;&#10;Stonewall's Sword: The Battle of Cedar Mountain also features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the current situation. Unlike traditional chit-pull mechanisms, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.&#10;&#10;Charles Kibler created the artwork for the counters and Rick Barber is the artist for the map.&#10;&#10;",

The World Championships are held every two years, with the most recent event in Germany (30 May-1 June, 2019), and the next event planned for Netherlands (2021).&#10;&#10;Playing involves each player having three rounds of sliding 30 wooden disks along a 2 metre long table in an attempt to get them through four arches numbered 1 to 4 at the other end. Getting disks into the low scoring compartments is just as important as the high ones because each set of 4 disks in the four compartments scores double (20 instead of 10 points).&#10;&#10;Note that sjoelbak is the name of the board, not the game itself.&#10;&#10;",

Designed by Bill Crenshaw as the successor to the Age of Renaissance, and developed by Ken Gutermuth, Manifest Destiny combines the strategic components of earlier, longer civilization-based games with the elegance of streamlined European gaming. While reminiscent of its predecessors in some respects, it is significantly simpler and quicker to play. Designed to appeal to a wide range of gamers, Manifest Destiny combines several unique elements that require strategic balancing to succeed.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a mercantile empire as it expands into territories containing new markets across the continent. Players use cash to purchase Progressions and tokens. Progressions give players additional capabilities during the game. Tokens are used for territorial expansion and to purchase Pioneers, cities and additional cards.&#10;&#10;Each game is unique, with no standard path to victory. The game has several elements that keep all players competitive; cards and Progressions are designed to assist lagging players. How you balance the competing opportunities will determine whether you achieve your destiny.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Sex &amp; Crime&quot; contains historical events related to more or less famous and sometimes hilarious crimes and some more adult themes, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Around these map cards, players place action cards, with them consulting one another to decide the best choice to make from those available: draw a card, turn over a card, discard, etc. Urgent cards, which should be read entirely before doing anything else, can change the game in an instant. Object cards are placed in front of players and can be useful throughout the game. The game includes a tutorial to accompany the first game, and its simple and original playing system allows you to explore the scenario several times before discovering all of the game's secrets.&#10;&#10;In Cartaventura: Oklahoma, it's 1854 in the United States. Your name is Bass Reeves, and you are about to turn twenty-three years old. Born a slave, the son and grandson of slaves, you spent your early years working your fingers to the bone in cotton and sugarcane fields. One day soon, you know you'll escape and then...whatever happens, happens! Will you find the Indian camp? Will you become a Marshall? Can you win the poker game? Can you escape your former master? Can you find your way to freedom?&#10;&#10;You play Oklahoma by flipping over the story cards, building out the map, and making decisions that will impact the ending you receive! The game is simple to play and will lead you through the game mechanics as you move through the story.&#10;&#10;",

Then players play a trick-taking game with trumps, after first predicting how many tricks they will win.&#10;&#10;The first play is two cards, a number and suit card. After that, you play one card, a number or a suit card, so that your other card still shows. In this way, you play out 12 tricks and score plus or minus points depending on your prediction. It is recommended to play out 8 games of Dois to get a balanced match.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&quot;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;2&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#233;&#153;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#135;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#230;&#143;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#136;&#230;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;8&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A long, long time ago in a distant kingdom, there was a town, a town so small that the cartographers in the kingdom did not bother to put it on any of their maps.&#10;&#10;The mayor of the city decided to change this. He sent messengers all around the kingdom to announce that a skillful, smart and experienced entrepreneur was needed to elevate the economy of this small town. The price for this effort would be a memorial on the main square of the town, eternal glory, and the satisfaction from a job well done.&#10;&#10;Years passed before the candidates finally reached the city. The mayor had never been happier, but he didn't know which of the entrepreneurs would be most suitable for the position, so he decided to give each of them a chance to prove that he was the long-awaited entrepreneur. Each of the candidates received five helpers who were admittedly not very bright, but who were certainly loyal and obedient. They have three years to prove their craftsmanship and skill, and after this time, the mayor will decide which candidate most deserves the honorable position.&#10;&#10;In Craftsmen, players try to gain appreciation points by building production buildings, creating connections between these buildings, producing raw materials and consumption goods, or buying them outright. They can also gain points by sending produced goods to the farthest parts of the world. In the end, whoever has the most appreciation points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'In the lands of the North, where the Black Rocks stand guard against the cold sea, in the dark night that is very long the Men of the Northlands sit by their great log fires and they tell a tale... '&#10;&#10;So began each of the Sagas of Noggin the Nog, in which the crown of Noggin, Prince of the Nogs is sought by his wicked uncle Nogbad the Bad who devises evil plots to threaten the safety of the kingdom, in order to force Noggin to give up his crown. In this game, players are the noble Lords of the north, looking to assist Noggin however they can in his adventures with resources and wise council.&#10;&#10;Players use their influence to take actions on the board which as a back drop is Peter Firmin's classic hand drawn map of the Northlands. The time taken on each action is plotted on a roundel which acts as the game clock, changes the turn order and progresses the seasons. However Nogbad is never far away from the source of the Kingdom's troubles and Noggin must use his cleverness, intuition and resourcefulness to thwart Nogbad and confirm his position as King of the Nogs. The game ends when Noggin secures the crown or if Nogbad manages to get there first.&#10;&#10;In Tales of the Northlands: The Sagas of Noggin the Nog, players must work together to successfully complete the adventures revealed by the saga cards. By offering much needed resources and making key decisions that effect the progress of the adventures, players will, if successful add to Noggin's popularity. Should their decision be unwise or they take too long the popular vote might sway toward Nogbad.&#10;&#10;The game includes all of the characters from the TV series, Noggin, his Queen Nooka, Knut their son, Thor Nogson the grumpy Captain of the Royal Guard, Graculus the Great Green Bird, Olaf the Lofty, the Court inventor, and Romf, the little man from the Hot Water Valley.&#10;&#10;These adventures are all based upon the books and stories developed by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin. The game is fully licensed has access to all artwork previously released in books and film and includes over fifty new pieces of new artwork commissioned from Peter Firmin specifically for the game. The game has three levels, solo, a family game with simplified rule set and a gamer's version with deeper strategy options.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 532, Buddhism arrived in Japan, and took its place alongside Shintoism, which is the official religion. Prince Shotoku, seduced by this new religion, commissioned Buddhist monks to construct a village endowed with an immense garden, in which 8 pagodas (tajuto) would be erected. He announced that once the fourth tajuto was complete, it would make this city an important pilgrimage destination for all Buddhists around the world. The Buddhist monk who has attained the highest level of Spirituality, through deep Meditation and other mental qualities, at this precise moment will be rewarded, and the Prince will name them &quot;Great Guardian of the Sacred Garden of the Eight Pagodas&quot;, and this monk will become the overseer of pilgrimage.&#10;&#10;In Tajuto, players take on the roles of the Buddhist monks, trying to achieve the highest spirituality. On their turn, they can activate their action tiles to draw (and build) pagoda tiles from the bag, make offerings to gain meditation points, and acquire tiles that will help them progress more quickly or earn them spirituality points. Activating more than one action tile or acquiring tiles costs meditation points. The game ends once the fourth pagoda is finished. The player with the most spirituality points wins.&#10;&#10;The key feature of the game is drawing the pagoda tiles from the bag. The pagoda tiles have a decreasing size per level. Players are welcome to blindly rummage around to try to recognize the floor by its size, but they aren&rsquo;t likely to be able to detect the color this way, so drawing the floor size they want depends on their tactile recognition, but they have to weigh their odds to draw the color they want.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Have you ever dreamed of commanding a powerful army? Have you enjoyed a good historical novel about Ancient Rome and you would have liked to move to this period in the middle of battle? Would you like to be able to change History or revive exciting historical events? If you have answered affirmatively to any of these questions then this is your game.&#10;&#10;ONUS! Traianus is a historical battles wargame, similar to a miniatures game, where two sides confront each other in an Ancient battle. This game is focused on the armies of the great superpowers of the apogee of the Roman Empire, during the reign of the emperors Trajan and Hadrian, between the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. In this game, different action cards recreate varied kinds of orders and battle events, that allow every match to be unique and to any combat to be epic, unpredictable and exciting.  ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm).&#10;&#10;Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants. Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements. Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated; meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.&#10;&#10;Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A solitaire, CDG-flavoured, strategic-level game set during the Marcomannic Wars, 170CE-180CE. Playing from the perspective of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, your goal is to defeat and pacify three different tribes while managing off-map wars and rebellions, troop shortages, limited resources, and the effects of plague&mdash;all while maintaining your standing with the Senate and people of Rome.&#10;&#10;The Marcomannic Wars were a series of conflicts fought by the Romans against a loose coalition of German and Sarmatian tribes along the Danube from 166CE to 180CE. After crushing a Roman army and killing as many as 20,000 Roman soldiers near Carnuntum, German barbarians ravaged the Danube provinces and besieged Aquileia, marking the first time a hostile force had entered Italy in nearly 300 years. Meanwhile, Sarmatians invaded Dacia and Costoboci descended deep into the Balkans and Greece as far as Athens. It took Rome more than a decade to restore peace, with war and plague extracting a terrible cost of human and material resources.&#10;&#10;The game covers the war from the disastrous Battle of Carnuntum in 170CE to Marcus Aurelius' death in 180CE. Each turn (lasting one year) is divided into four rounds: early campaign, late campaign, winter and an attrition/house keeping round.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, the player draws three barbarian cards and resolves their effects. Barbarian cards activate enemy tribes (restoring their morale or causing them to advance), trigger off-map conflicts, or cause special events such as plague, mutiny, or rebellions.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the Roman player draws a set number of cards (5 during the early campaign, 3 during the late campaign, and 1 during winter) and plays as many or few as they choose for either actions or events. Actions include: attacking barbarian tribes; building forts; moving legions; and increasing &quot;Imperium Points.&rdquo; Many cards can also be played for historically based events, such as the &quot;Lightning miracle&quot; depicted on the Column of Marcus Aurelius; and the &quot;Galen&quot; event that mitigates the effects of plague. All cards must be used by the end of the year or discarded, except for one card that can be held over into the next year by use of the &quot;Meditations&quot; deck.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved by rolling 1d6 for the Romans and 1d6 for the Barbarians. The Roman role is modified by the number of legions assigned to the front and the combat rating of the leader. Cards can be spend to commit &quot;reserves&quot; to avoid a defeat or eke out a victory. Other cards including &quot;Ambush,&quot; &quot;Tactical Superiority&quot; and &quot;Route&quot; can affect the outcome of battles. Enemy die rolls are modified by the morale of the tribe and the terrain, representing the barbarians' knowledge of the lands north of the Danube and Romans' difficulties in maintaining supply lines.&#10;&#10;Players can lose in a number of ways: if the Marcomanni break through into Italy the game immediately ends. Suddenly death also occurs if the player's Imperium Points (IP) drop into &quot;usurpation.&quot; If all three tribes have not been defeated and pacified by 180CE the game also ends in a loss.&#10;&#10;The player wins by driving barbarians back into their home space and defeating them there. Once a tribe is defeated they must be kept pacified by building forts and keeping troops assigned to garrisons, or they may break their treaty and rejoin the fight (as happened historically). Final victory occurs if all three tribes have surrendered. The player's score takes into account the number of years that have elapsed, their IP level, and the number of off-map conflicts they have resolved.&#10;&#10;",

Only the player who can correctly judge the timing of such decisions will be successful in the end.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player receives a small, unprotected principality. Over three epochs the various principalities can be developed. A steady production of money and food is needed to expand the principality and to maintain an army of mercenaries. During the game there are several cultural and military valuations that give the players victory points.&#10;&#10;The unusual part of this game are the action cards, which are available to all players. From the changing pool of possible actions, players have to secure the most suitable cards and use them at the appropriate time &ndash; reaching for the new means while parting with the old. This simple mechanism turns Principato  into a varied tactical game full of tough decisions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ultimate Werewolf is an interactive game of deduction for two teams: Villagers and Werewolves. The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf takes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf, and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns if one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf, a new edition of the award-winning, best-selling werewolf title from B&eacute;zier Games, has been reimagined to allow new players to quickly get up and running, with a larger box, totally rewritten and simplified rules, and a guide for the included roles. With all-new art and a great new card design, it's the perfect way to introduce groups of 7-30 people to Werewolf.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The castle is besieged! Hordes of monsters gather near the ancient walls and are about to smash open the castle gates. Mountain giants trample the fields, fire riders burn the surrounding settlements, and the ice dragon has nested on top of the citadel tower, horrifying the minds of the inhabitants of the bastion. Only a squad of stubborn heroes stands between the enemies and their ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Bastion is a cooperative castle defense game set in the Berserk universe, with 1 to 4 players taking on the roles of magical castle defenders. The castle is located in the center of the game board and is menaced by a great variety of invading enemies: dangerous beasts, ferocious warriors, terrible monsters, giants, mages, and even mighty dragons.&#10;&#10;You will travel the bastion districts, draw energy from sources of magic, build obelisks, bombard the enemies by magical devices and learn new spells. You will be gathering specific mana that is required to defeat each of the invaders. Victories allow castle defenders to gain new abilities, build powerful artifacts, and perform magic rituals.&#10;&#10;To defeat a monster you usually must travel to its location and spend a specific amount of mana of a required color. Each defeated monster provides you with a new spell. The tougher the defeated enemy, the better spell you will get. Castle defenders should try to be as efficient as possible. If you take too many actions to defeat your threats, the bastion will fall.&#10;&#10;Bastion is a cooperative adventure: you either defend the city by concerted efforts or it will fall under the pressure of the attacking hordes. Bastion is a highly customizable and replayable game. There are several scenarios and difficulty settings in the rules, along with the solo mode.&#10;&#10;",

It includes most of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. 18Scan is a small game, in the style of Mark Derrick&rsquo;s 'one-state' games 18GA and 18AL, and is intended as a change from the more robust 18xx games often played.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the Designer Notes: &quot;This is my second attempt at a 'small, short' 18xx game: the first, 18VA, has matured -- alas! -- into a solid, medium-length performer, but has become quite unsuited for a quick 'fill-in-the-cracks' session. I am hoping that 18Scan will not only prove to be a better short game, but will be sufficiently straightforward that it can also be used as an introduction to the 18xx system.  In 18Scan, I hope to bring to the table a simple game, yet with some strategic options, and a forgiving game -- unlike, say, 1830: Railways & Robber Barons. At the same time, 18Scan has a number of subsystems (Minor Companies, a merger railroad, Destinations, various categories of trains) that provide a panoply of the wide variety within the 18xx gaming space.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Robots can also interact with other robots so even the best laid plans can end up slightly different than expected.&#10;&#10;The player who harvests the most valuable crystals wins.&#10;&#10;",

Not only are there toys to be built, but reindeer to be tended and coal to be mined (sadly, not all the children are on the &quot;nice&quot; list). Candy canes and gingerbread houses are nice, but by working hard-and smartly-you and your team of elves may find yourselves on a beach drinking something with an umbrella in it.&#10;&#10;Santa's Workshop is a worker-placement game, taking place over nine rounds, in which players use their elves to collect materials in order to build gifts, and tend to the reindeer. Players may customize their workforce by sending elves to be trained in certain aspects of the game, which provide a benefit for the rest of the game. For some gifts, plastic may be substituted for the standard materials of fabric, wood or metal. This will cause those gifts to score fewer &quot;Christmas Cookies&quot;, but may allow a player to build more gifts in a shorter amount of time. This can be helpful when Santa comes around three times during the game for an inspection to see which team has made the most gifts.&#10;&#10;Players will have to decide when to visit the mail room in order to pick which gifts to build, and when to tend to the reindeer. The reindeer accumulate points the longer they go untended &mdash; and each of the eight reindeer provides a unique bonus to the player.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The gray morning has arrived, and the vampires of the ancient clans must now hurry back to their tombs. For the high and mighty this is easy, but the smaller, weaker vampires have the strength to do this only in groups. Thus, you as the vampire lord might want to play out several with low values together in order not to be surpassed. Whatever you do in Vampire Queen, though, be sure to rid yourself of an intrusive vampire hunter because no one wants to get stuck with that!&#10;&#10;The deck consists of cards numbered 1-13, four vampire queens that have variable value, and two vampire hunters. Players start with a hand of 9-13 cards depending on the player count, and the start player for a round plays from their hand either a single card, multiple cards of the same value, or a vampire hunter. Vampire queens on their own (or in a pair, triplet, or quartet) are valued at 14, but they can be played with other cards and adopt the value of those cards. For a single card or a set of cards (e.g., three 6s), each other player in turn can either pass or play the same number of cards but of a higher value (e.g., three 9s). Whoever plays the highest card(s) wins the round and leads off the next round.&#10;&#10;If the round's start player leads a vampire hunter, it counts as value 0 and each other player must play exactly one (non-vampire hunter) card of whatever value they want. Whoever plays the highest card takes all played cards into their hand, then leads off the next round, but they cannot lead with the same vampire hunter they just won.&#10;&#10;When one or more players have emptied their hand at the end of a round, the round ends. Players then score points for all cards still in hand, with number cards being worth their face value, queens being 14, and vampire hunter cards being 15 or 20, as indicated. Players with vampire hunters in hand keep them, then shuffle all cards and deal new hands to all players, with the player who holds the 20 starting. After five rounds, whoever has scored the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rolling Stock is a card game about stock and company trading. Players are investors buying private companies in auctions, which they may later use for an IPO (to turn them into corporations) or sell to already existing corporations (to turn them into subsidiaries of that corporation). The majority share holder of a corporation controls its actions: issuing new shares, paying dividends, and buying more subsidiaries from other corporations, players, or an ominous foreign investor.&#10;&#10;The companies are transportation themed, starting with the early Prussian railroad. As more companies are bought, the scope of the game expands to Germany, later Europe, and ultimately even space. With expanding scope, older companies become less and less profitable until they have to be written off eventually, severely hitting the book value of their owner.&#10;&#10;As a pure card game, Rolling Stock has no game board to simulate actual transportation. Instead, networking effects are modeled by synergies between geographically adjacent companies that are subsidiaries of the same corporation. This simplistic model merely sets the stage for the trading of stocks and companies, which is the heart and soul of the game.&#10;&#10;Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but it is clearly not a part of it. Obviously, track building is missing entirely, but even the stock market with all its superficial similarities turns out to be fundamentally different.&#10;&#10;Compared to the 18xx series, Rolling Stock has extremely simple rules. Strategically, however, it is comparably deep and complex.&#10;&#10;",

As the Military and Political leader of Japan, you must drive the enemy &quot;Fronts&rdquo; far away from the Home Islands while also securing enough precious resources to maintain your Empire.

The 104 cards in the game are split in three ages, which represent the natural evolution of global civilization through the timeline, but the cards of each field aren't split equally. Once the second age has finished, for example, if you haven't yet reached supremacy of Religion, it's time to think about another strategy.&#10;&#10;Each field gives powers to the player who succeeds in reaching the limit of cards in their play area (depending on the number of players). There are different kinds of powers, two levels of permanent effects, and one sacrifice effect for each field. Using these powers in combination will be necessary to be the first to reach supremacy &mdash; but using these powers is also a way to keep competitors from reaching victory.&#10;&#10;You will need all your diplomacy skills to get help from others and prevent the leading player from winning, yet today's friend could be tomorrow's enemy, so pay attention to all and think about which combination of powers might lead to a surprise victory! Be the first to use it!&#10;&#10;The game includes rules for 1v1 play, 2v2 team play, and 3-4 player games.&#10;&#10;CIV FAQ&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Story&#10;&#10;The King of Blackthorn rose to power on the strength of his sword, gaining the devotion of the people as he forged a nation and purged the ravages of war. Once a much needed beacon of strength for a foundling kingdom, he has now grown old and is no longer a vital part of a now robust and powerful country. Others have risen to prominence and power within his council. Adept in their machinations and plots, the councilors have their own self serving ambitions. In a shadowy battle of subterfuge they ruthlessly vie against one another for true control of Blackthorn. In this dance of treachery, each must seize as much power as able without drawing suspicion for whispers of treason echo through the halls of the King of Blackthorn. Whispers from fellow councilors designed to implicate and see the competition shortened by a head. The King will call for the axe for any he deems a traitor and there is always the risk that he is not as ignorant of the schemes as he seems.&#10;&#10;As a member of the Council of Blackthorn, you must build influence with the kingdom&rsquo;s factions to expand your political influence. Rumors, bribes, spies and poison are the tools of your trade. Council of Blackthorn is about secretly gaining power while convincing your rival council members that you are not a threat. Deflect all eyes onto your most powerful enemy and take the keys to the kingdom as well as a great seat at his or her execution. Attract too much attention to yourself and the King&rsquo;s axe will find you!&#10;&#10;Gain influence, accuse your rivals, keep your head!&#10;&#10;Game Overview and Objective&#10;&#10;Council of Blackthorn is a board game for 2 to 6 players. Each player assumes the role of a member of the Council of Blackthorn. There are several different council member characters to play. Each player must build influence with the kingdom&rsquo;s political factions by playing ally and building cards. Custom dice change the game conditions for each round. As players gain influence and power, they also gain hidden treason points. The players that appear to have the most power will typically gain more treason points. The player with the most treason points at the end of the game is beheaded for treason and is removed from the game. The remaining player with the most total influence points, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Menace Among Us is a semi-cooperative game of intrigue and survival in deep space. Adrift and powerless, your crippled vessel is bleeding oxygen. As you effect repairs, every breath you take brings you one step closer to death. You must work together to restore power before the air runs out &mdash; but hidden among you, as loyal friends and crew members, are imposters who have infiltrated security and continue to sabotage the ship. Their only goal is to avoid detection and kill the crew, by force or by asphyxiation. Can you identify them in time and eliminate the threat? Or will succumb to the menace among us?&#10;&#10;The Menace Among Us is a 40 to 60-minute, asymmetrical card game for 4-8 players. Each player chooses an Agenda at random, either a loyal Crew member, a deadly Menace or the Coward, who&rsquo;ll take any side just to survive. Your Agenda card sets a Team Goal and an Individual Goal, as well as outlines any special abilities and the card composition of your individual 13-card deck. Then, knowing your Agenda and Goals, you choose a Character who you believe will best help you achieve them or mask your true identity. Characters add 7 new cards to your deck, shuffle-building a unique combination of cards, as well as provide you two specialized Above Deck Actions.&#10;&#10;In this hidden traitor game, how you play your cards and abilities is far more important than the meta game aspects of accusations and denials. Cards are played face down and shuffled together as &ldquo;Below Deck Actions.&rdquo; Here, Menace players secretly sabotage the ship&rsquo;s systems and attack crew members, who are trying to save the ship with their cards. If too few crew members risk going below deck to effect repairs, the ship&rsquo;s Emergency Maintenance Assistant (EmMA) adds cards to the pile to help. However, the system has also been compromised and occasionally places damaging cards into the mix, providing plausible deniability to the Menace players. In contrast, Above Deck Actions are conducted in full view of the crew. Most of these abilities have costs, either in Energy or Oxygen, both resources the crew is trying to increase. So, while The Doctor has the ability to heal a crew member and remove a debilitating effect, a Menace player, who may be secretly in control of The Doctor, cares far more that it costs 2 Oxygen to perform the healing.&#10;&#10;At some point, someone&rsquo;s behavior will raise suspicion. But, did they do so because they are trying to fulfill an Individual Goal &ndash; or are they a Menace? You can call a vote to expose their true nature. But if they are a loyal Crew member, you&rsquo;ve just blown precious Oxygen in the effort to detain them. For that matter, was it a Menace player calling the vote in hopes of wasting the air on purpose?&#10;&#10;If the Crew can find and eliminate the Menace players &ndash; and raise the Energy to a safe threshold before the air runs out, they win. If the Menace can prevent this or kill the crew outright, their mission succeeds. Special commendations are awarded for surviving and for achieving your Individual Goal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You must build wealth through investments and strategic serial marriages.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is divided into rounds; each round consists of four separate phases: drafting, investment, husband, and housekeeping. In each round, each player drafts a hand of cards, pick-and-pass style. Certain cards are played into players' tableaus. Instant cards are used and discarded. Players using death cards partially reset their tableau and get income. Players discard down to eight cards in hand, then draft four new cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has no current husband, no more than 9 infamy, spends 120 crowns, and plays a remarry card to marry the Duke.

Begin your amazing journey by dropping into the crater of the dormant Icelandic volcano Snaefells.  Explore a dense forest of giant mushrooms, traverse a turbulent underground ocean, and then get hurled out of an Italian volcano to return to the earth's surface.&#10;&#10;On your epic journey discover fossils both small and large, collect gold, and overcome dangerous obstacles. Explore the many parts of the vast subterranean cavern, using clever orienteering, critical equipment, and luck to overcome each new challenge along your breathtaking path. The player who escapes with the best collection of natural treasures wins! Will you direct our heroes on a journey of danger, discovery, and fortune?&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;The players slip into the roles of three courageous explorers: mineralogy professor Otto Lidenbrock, his nephew Axel and their Icelandic guide Hans Bjelke. You explore the inside of the earth in three stages. You descend down the dormant Icelandic volcano Snaefells. You then cross a turbulent underground sea. Finally, you escape through a volcanic eruption on the Italian island of Stromboli. You make important discoveries by cleverly using equipment like Ruhmkorff's famed induction (electric) lamp, in search of fossils and experiences that will bring you international acclaim. By earning the most fame points you win!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;The board has 3 areas: the descent through the mountain, the journey across the lake, and the exit through the volcano (~5 min only). There are 3 explorer tokens (red, yellow, blue) and 2 types of cards: equipment and explorer (players start with equal number, same mix of cards; there are face up cards and face down draw decks). Explorer cards are used to move explorers (3 colors; 1 card = 1 movement pt for that color explorer) while equipment cards modify movement.&#10;&#10;In the first 2 parts, on your turn you either take 3 cards (any combination of face up/down explorer/equipment cards) OR move orthogonally; if moving, must advance (1 level deeper in mountain, 1 column further across in lake) at least 1 row/column. Each space costs 1 MP; some cost more (shown as 2 or 3 rocks). Equipment allows you to move diagonally, or get across pits/whirlpools, or make rock-spaces only cost 1 MP, or give you bonus MP. Moving over some spaces gives you a water token. If you end on specific spaces, you may discard a combination of 1-3 equipment cards (pictured on board) to draw as many fossil cards (lamp allows you to draw an extra fossil card to choose from). At the end of the Mountain part, you may keep 3 fossil cards for every water you discard. In the lake phase, all explorers are on 1 raft, so any single color may be used to move the entire raft.&#10;&#10;After moving and resolving lake space effects, draw a random event card (may hurt someone or give bonus VP if [un]able to discard specific combo of explorer cards). The player getting the first explorer to the end of the Mountain, or the raft to the end of the Lake, scores bonus 4 VP. In the final Volcano phase, draw random explorer card and move raft to next like-colored space; players must discard cards shown, or pay penalty.&#10;&#10;At the end, score VP = sum of values of fossils (various types, sets score higher if you have more parts of the set) + bonus VP + 1 VP/water token. Most VP wins!&#10;&#10;",

Race against the timer to get as many guess words as possible. Will you have to draw them, use as few words as possible to describe them, play Classic Taboo or twist Bendy Bob to help your team guess them? You even have a chance at a brain-bending memory round!&quot;&#10;&#10;Following in the footsteps of Cranium, The Big Taboo is attempting a new lease at life through adding extra mechanics and expanding the basic concept of the original game with variants.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Afrika Korps is an easy and fun historical game of  Rommel&rsquo;s battles with the English in North Africa during WW2. One of the early Avalon Hill beginner war games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Ever since men began making weapons they have used them to create legends: in early 1941, when his conquest of Europe was embarrassed by the rout of his Italian allies in Africa, Hitler dispatched General Erwin Rommel to forestall a seemingly inevitable Axis defeat. Reorganizing the forces under his command as the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK), Rommel immediately launched the first of his legendary desert offensives.&#10;&#10;Now, the legend of &quot;The Desert Fox&quot; is recreated. From April 1941 through the climatic battle at El Alamein in later 1942. Afrika Korps simulates the mobile conflict between Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika and the British Eighth Army defending Egypt and the Suez Canal. During each monthly game-turn, the initiative may switch from the Germany to the Allied player as both come to understand why Rommel called North Africa &quot;A tactician's paradise; a logistical officer's nightmare.&quot;&#10;&#10;A 2 on Avalon Hill's complexity scale of 1(low) to 10(high). Playing time 2 to 4 hours&#10;&#10;Includes 44&quot; x 14&quot; mounted mapboard of North Africa, set of die-cut Axis and Allied military unit counters, combat results table, time record card, die, and rules.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",
