    "Description": "Djarhun is a world in peril.  The evil wizard Gharad has stolen the Book of Avrakar and has unleashed many creatures throughout the land.  In a desperate hope, the King of Elidor is seeking the help of a few brave adventurers to recover this book and return it to Elidor in the hopes that the City's mage may put an end to the evil that runs amok throughout the land.  Others, of vile morality, seek to take the Book to the Gypsies in a hope of finding its secrets for their own evil purpose.  You are one of these adventurers that seek the Book.  Along the way, you will encounter many perils and much treasure.  You will gain new friends and meet helpful strangers.  When you are strong enough, you will travel to the Abyss, where you will fight Gharad in a battle that may decide the fate of Djarhun.&#10;&#10;Djarhun is a fantasy board game that can be played by up to 6 players.  As players move around the board, they will find items, and slay monsters, that will increase their power.  When a player is powerful enough, they may head for the center of the board and try to claim the Book of Avrakar.  Whoever brings the Book to the predetermined location, is the victor.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Ruined Urthe: A Djarhun Expansion&#10;     Goblin Invasion: A Djarhun Expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Al Capone was just moving up in the 'Family'.&#10;&#10;Don and MeMe Wannabe are hosting the grand opening celebration for their new Juice Joint, The Four Deuces, and you are invited to attend. The Four Deuces is a lavish joint serving booze and music in the front. In the back is the game room and upstairs is a very high class and exclusive brothel (no brothel in the teen rated version). The cream and not so cream of society will be here. With gangsters, politicians, dolls, molls and many other interesting guests in attendance this event is sure to be the bee's knees.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/4deuces.htm&#10;&#10;",

The players each champion one of six characters: Jack the Ripper, The Inspector, Lady Coverup, Lord Brutal, Mr. Revenge and Pretty Nell (everyone's victim). Each character has conflicting goals which lead them to try to pin the murders on one another or try to capture or protect Jack. The game plays in a whirl wind of back stabbing.&#10;&#10;Each turn players pick a question from the game board to answer. Another player judges how likely it is to happen. A roll is made and the action happens or doesn't. If it happens it becomes a fact. Facts add up to tell the story. Players can interrupt answers with counter-arguments that are resolved with a dice rolling contest. This is a beginner game that can be played by anyone. It is about a murderer though so there is plenty of violence.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 16x21 color laminated sheet that folds up into a 8x10.5 folio for storage. There is a separate laminated rules sheet that stores in the folio. The back side of the sheet has the front and back of the folio and an example of play. The game board side of the sheet has a game opening narrative, a cast of six characters (each with a picture and short written description) and a large picture with plot driving questions listed on it. The rules sheet includes all the rules needed to play including the &quot;Argument Strength Table&quot; that is used to judge how strong argument are.&#10;&#10;The game is available in a PDF and paper version.&#10;&#10;Chris Engle&#10;Hamster Press = Engle Matrix Games&#10;3-15-07&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pope Joan is a card game of the &quot;Stops&quot; type, named after a legendary female Pope of the 9th century. An ordinary pack is used, from which the eight of diamonds has been removed, and a special round board in the form of eight compartments, named respectively Pope-Joan, Matrimony, Intrigue, Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Game (King, Queen and Knave are sometimes omitted).&#10;&#10;Each player &ndash; any number can play &ndash; contributes a stake, of which one counter is put into the divisions Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Game, two into Matrimony and Intrigue, and the rest into Pope-Joan. This is called &quot;dressing the board.&quot; The cards are dealt round, with an extra hand for &quot;stops,&quot; i.e. cards which stop, by their absence, the completion of a suit; thus the absence of the nine of spades stops the playing of the ten. The last card is turned up for trumps.&#10;&#10;Cards in excess may be dealt to &quot;stops,&quot; or an agreed number may be left for the purpose, so that all players may have an equal number of cards. If an honor or &quot;Pope&quot; (nine of diamonds) is turned up, the dealer takes the counters in the compartment so marked. Sometimes the turning-up of Pope settles the hand, the dealer taking the whole pool. The Ace is the lowest card, the King the highest. The player on the dealer's left plays a card and names it, the player who has the next highest then plays it, till a stop is played, i.e. a card of which no one holds the next highest. All Kings are of course stops, also the seven of diamonds; also the cards next below the dealt stops, and the cards next below the played cards. After a stop the played cards are turned over, and the player of the stop (the card last played) leads again.&#10;&#10;The player who gets rid of all his cards first takes the counters in &quot;Game,&quot; and receives a counter from each player for every card left in his hand, except from the player who may hold Pope but has not played it. The player of Ace, King, Queen or Knave of trumps takes the counters from that compartment. If King and Queen of trumps are in one hand, the holder takes the counters in &quot;Matrimony&quot;, if a Queen and Knave, those in &quot;Intrigue&quot;, if all three, those in the two compartments; if they are in different hands these counters are sometimes divided. Unclaimed stakes are left for the next pool. Pope is sometimes considered a universal &quot;stop.&quot;&#10;&#10;Re-implements: Jeu du Nain Jaune&#10;&#10;",

The Somalians quickly captured most of the Ogaden province but was defeated and thrown back to Somalia by a massive Soviet airlift of men and equipment and intervention by thousands of Cuban mechanized troops and large numbers of Soviet aircraft.&#10;&#10;The war was important as not only did it show Soviet airlift and power projection capabilities but also proved dire for Somalia as it never recovered militarily from the war and led to the collapse of Somalia in the 90s which had consequences for the U.S.(Blackhawk Down) and Ethiopia(the current 2007 invasion) later.&#10;&#10;The game uses a heavily modified Iraq 2003 system (by Tetsuya Nakamura)laced with random events, a simple but detailed and effective air system, chit pull for Ethiopian reinforcement(to show the chaotic Ethiopian military system at the time), Somali supply situation and air interdiction etc. etc.etc.&#10;&#10;The game is 18 turns long(two weeks per turn).

    "Description": "A game all about the economics of growing and selling marijuana, British Columbia&rsquo;s largest cash crop! This game was designed in 1997, printed in one edition of 1,000 copies and sold in &ldquo;head&rdquo; shops in Canada, Hawaii and Seattle. Press releases stated that it cost the two men behind the project about $50,000 Canadian to get the game to market. The reviewers' copy, numbered 106/1000 and signed by the designer, was found in a thrift shop for $3.99.&#10;&#10;Play is divided into three phases, corresponding to the three growing seasons. The length of the game is derived from the number of Seasonal Cards, which is adjusted according to the number of players in the game. Each player starts with a car, six Plant tokens and $9,000 cash.&#10;&#10;Each player-turn a player turns over one Seasonal Card and two &ldquo;Daily Grind&rdquo; cards. He moves (moving costs money, a player can go as far as he wants to spend) to a location and sets up grow-ops.&#10;&#10;Indoor operations require periodic rent and the investment of Equipment and Plant tokens. Yields are smaller but come every turn, and are measured in salable ounces or new Plant Tokens to start other operations. Indoor operations are usually less risky unless someone &ldquo;rats you out&rdquo; for a quick $3,000.  Outdoor operations are set up in spring or summer. They do not need rent or equipment but are subject to the depredations of deer, rabbits, wandering hikers or police helicopters. Outdoor operations are harvested once per game, in the autumn, and players have to travel to the location to do the harvesting themselves &ndash; so, depending on where you and the other players are, you may lose some crop.&#10;&#10;Between seasons players pay bills and rent, and may buy or sell equipment. At the end of the game (when all the Seasonal Cards have been turned up), players calculate the value of all Equipment and harvested outdoor Plants, and any salable ounces (a handy price table is supplied if you are too zonked to do the multiplying yourself). Players then pay all outstanding bills, loans, and fines. The winner is the one with the most cash on hand.&#10;&#10;This would be an unremarkable farming-type game, if not for the illegal nature of the crop. This frames the rather small amount of player interaction (which is mostly limited to ratting out other players for a quick buck, or negotiating commissions for other to sell or harvest dope for you at locations where you aren&rsquo;t), the random disasters that can befall players through the Daily Grind deck, and the pro-legalization rhetoric found throughout the rules. The rest of the game is about investing funds and taking risks &ndash; it might as well be about growing Swiss chard.&#10;&#10;",

Similar in theme to Goa with mechanics like Puerto Rico and El Grande but with a map, limited combat, some secret movement elements.&#10;&#10;The time is the late 1500s and the domination of the Spice Trade is in the balance.  Far from playing colonial powers, the initial countries sent Factors, or professional trader-agents, to live with native peoples, and manage their trade interests while the fleet returned home. These factors lead dangerous lives, and the success of the next fleets&rsquo; mission usually lay in their hands.   The factors built warehouses, or factories, to house goods collected while fleets were gone, and they were under constant surveillance form the un-trusting locals.  Whether you use brutally repressive means against locals like the Portuguese or Dutch, or more congenial methods like the English you must develop a strategy that lets you maximize your profit while minimizing your losses. Factors of Spice allows player the flavor of the spice race managing fleets, trading with natives, and vying for political influence in these far away tropical islands that changed the course of world history.&#10;&#10;Players act as Portugal, Spain, Holland or England.&#10;&#10;Each turn is simple:&#10;1. Take 3 cards from Tier I Deck containing simple ships, crews, and characters.&#10;2. Take 2 cards from Tier II containing advanced ships and characters&#10;3.  Buy a Special Card&#10;4.  Increase income&#10;5.  Buy an Influence Card (worth 2-4 VP at games end) but 1 is lost per attack!&#10;&#10;3 Years-8 seasons (turns)-and the game is over!&#10;&#10;Interesting Mechanics:&#10; Players can have up to 5 distinct fleets on the board and may fission and fusion at will.&#10;1. Players build a hand and &quot;launch&quot; a fleet of as many ships as they have.  Fleets are secret until they land in the East Indies or are moved into by a separate fleet. &#10;2.  Resources &quot;bloom&quot; and then rot a few turns later, creating interesting timing problems. &#10;3. Types of resources: harvest, mine, or delivered-different mechanism for each.&#10;4.  Value increases the longer a good has not been returned to Europe!&#10;5.  Diplomat Characters used in East Indies area control for VP at end of game. Seizing goods erases all diplomatic good will! &#10;6. Interesting and simple interaction with natives&#10;7.  Variable event card played each turn changes weather and conditions in the East Indies.&#10;8.  Special bonus cards that add flavor and strategic options to the game.&#10;9. Simple but interesting combat mechanism between fleets.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One Bullet, One German covers the Polish uprising in Warsaw and the military operations in the immediately envi-rons east of the city in August, 1944. It was critical time for the German: not only was there the Warsaw Uprising to con-tend with, but a few miles east of the city, the German panzers were reeling back from a massive Red onslaught. The only up-side for the German was their keen ability to multitask with weakened forces. The Russians had their own set of problems. The onslaught had created directional problems as their armies approached the Vistula River. Because of this, their strength was divided. Many forces were ordered to seize bridgeheads across this key river south of Warsaw. Others were ordered to move along the Vistula north to Warsaw, still others, simply advance westward. The Russian forces were fast approaching the end of their supply chain after advancing hundreds of miles. Their tanks had also taken a toll from combat and breakdowns. All units had arrived in the area of Warsaw in a tired and weakened state.&#10;&#10;The main reason for the Polish uprising was to seize the bridges and portions of Praga, the east part of the city east of the Vistula. It was hoped that the Russian forces would meet them there and cleanse the area of Germans. This is what the game covers: the Uprising and the last panzer victory a few miles east of the city where the 3rd Tank Corps&rsquo; was ripped apart by the withdrawing panzers!&#10;&#10;The map scale is about 400 yards per hex on the Warsaw map and 1 mile on the East of Warsaw map. Each combat unit is a battalion unless otherwise designated. A game turn represents 4 days of time. Each Polish resistance fighter unit is around 500 men. The game uses a modified system used in ATO's Into the Beartrap game.&#10;&#10;Two 11x17&quot; maps, over 300 counters. Rules cover: Unit Activation, Random Events, Polish Ammo Limitations, Sewer Movement, Air Units, Close Assault, Divisional\\Corps Integrity, Using &quot;Karl&quot;, Barricades, Snipers, Rubble, Airdrops and more!&#10;Map scale: 400 yards per hex (Warsaw map), 1 mile per hex (East of Warsaw map)&#10;Unit scale: Battalion &#10;Time scale: 4 days a turn&#10;&#10;",
