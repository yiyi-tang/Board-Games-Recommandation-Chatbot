    "Description": "Description from BoardgameNews.com:&#10;&#10;Army of Frogs is for 2-4 players and resembles Hive in that the gameboard is created while you play. The goal of the game is to create one large group of frogs&mdash;an army, if you will&mdash;through tactical manoeuvring and placement of the pieces, which are hexagonal Bakelite frogs. Each player starts with two randomly drawn frogs, and on a turn a player takes the following three actions to build and shift an island of frogs in the center of the table:&#10;&#10;     if possible, move a frog of his color that&rsquo;s on the board to a new location (something that&rsquo;s obviously skipped on the first turn)&#10;     add one of the frogs in his supply to the board, and&#10;     draw a new frog from the bag and add it to his supply.&#10;&#10;&#10;The first player to link all their frogs (with at least seven in play) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's the crack of dawn on Christmas Day when the early morning silence is broken by a sudden &ldquo;Kerplunk!&rdquo; Something strange has dropped down the chimney! You race to the hearth to find a soot-covered envelope with &ldquo;URGENT&rdquo; scrawled across the front. Anxiously, you open the letter and discover a cryptic message. As you begin to read,  the air fills with the sound of jingle bells and the sweet smell of peppermint. Just then, you are magically whisked away to the North Pole!  It seems that a dastardly crime has been committed and Santa needs your help to catch the ne'er-do-wells!  There's no time to wait; Santa is counting on you!  Are you ready to save Christmas?&#10;&#10;The Kringle Caper, title #1 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.&#10;&#10;Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.&#10;&#10;When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion website (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the website will tell you which card or cards to take next. The website also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.&#10;&#10;This system is non-destructible: some groups may choose to write on cards, but this is not required. A group cannot re-play the game, but can pass it on to another group for their use.&#10;&#10;This entry in the series takes about an hour to solve, and is rated 2 out of 3 in difficulty.&#10;&#10;",

The Freemen Coalition is a loose-knit band of human rebels who specialize in guerrilla warfare, and the Combine is the military arm of the government that rules over much of what is left of the world.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-player competitive play or solitaire play, and each set can be played by itself standalone, or combined with other sets to form a larger narrative. Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six Factions.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play For What Remains: skirmishes and campaigns. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Campaigns are a series of skirmishes linked together to form a larger narrative. For What Remains is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually secondary. Players win skirmishes by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.&#10;&#10;The game board is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. The default game board is a destroyed urban setting. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement.&#10;&#10;Each character is represented by a counter and has a corresponding character card and tokens. During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite level. A chit pull system is used for unit activation, and a step-loss system is used for tracking injuries during skirmishes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The 8 Trolls start the game in the middle of the board as they have been ambushed by 32 Dwarves (surrounding them at the outer edge of the board). Trolls and Dwarves have different ways of moving and capturing. Each battle is ended by mutual agreement and then scored. When the first battle is over, the players switch sides. The combined scores from both battles determines the winner.&#10;&#10;Thud! is similar to Hnefatafl but is not actually a member of the tafl family (See http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/4049/tafl) because the manner of capture has been modernized and the game involves no king piece.&#10;&#10;",

War had been waged in Bavaria against the Prussians, Catalonia against the Spaniards, under the great pyramids against the relentless Turk and even at New Orleans against those upstart Americans. Now new challengers have arisen and a completely foreign army is arrayed across the battlefield. The Tri-Color fluttered in the breeze as rocket shells burst in the air. A new type of warfare was about to be unleashed.&#10;&#10;Manoeuvre: Distant Lands is a stand alone expansion for Manoeuvre. Four new armies are included to allow you to bring the fight from the frozen north to the sub-continent and the mythic east. Included in this set are counters and cards for Sweden, the splintered Kingdoms of India, the Chinese 8-Banner Army and the crumbling remains of the Japanese Shogunate. Also included is a set of 8 new land tiles that will force veteran players to learn new tactics among the swamps and fields of the Orient as well as the forests of Scandinavia.&#10;&#10;Sweden: The Swedes are reminiscent of the more traditional European powers and fit nicely into the current game hierarchy to allow for more balanced tournament play. The Swedish army fits the mold of both the Prussians and Russians but falls into line just below them in overall strength.&#10;&#10;Indians: The Kingdoms of the Marathas, Mughals, Mysore and Sikhs from the Punjab have banded together to overthrow the colonial powers of the day. Their problem is overcoming the lack of a true leader that makes it difficult to set aside their rivalries and squabbling. They have speed rivaling the Ottomans but far less of a capacity to use it well. They are a true guerilla force adept at denying their opponents resources or freedom to maneuver.&#10;&#10;Tokugawa Shogunate: The Shogunate is crumbling. The army seeks to modernize against the will of the Shogun and in a few years Japan will step into the Industrial age. However, at the turn of the 19th Century, insular clans still dominated the military. Every Daimyo leads his own army into battle with their own guns, cavalry, samurai and teppo. Only the Shogun can be called on to make any Clan work with another. Beware the deadly fury of the Banzai charge and even cornered units will fight to the bitter end and the last man.&#10;&#10;China: The Chinese 8-Banner army boasts a core of elite units, including three cavalry units that can stand their ground against any European foe. Unfortunately, the Han conscripts and the peasants that form the Tuan Lian are ill-suited and under-equipped in relation to their Manchu and Mongol horsemen. Will rockets and witchcraft bring disruption to the orderly European battlefield?&#10;&#10;&quot;I have not imagined that the Napoleonic experience can be brought to the orient!&quot;&#10;- Thunder Wong, Playtester Extraordinaire&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;32 Unit counters (8 for each nationality)&#10;240 Cards (60 for each nationality)&#10;8 Terrain tiles&#10;Rules for the new abilities and some advanced Manoeuvre additions.&#10;3 Advance-to-Contact Counters&#10;&#10;Designers: Jeff Horger and Joe Roush&#10;&#10;",

On a player's turn, they must play an action card and execute its effect, e.g., moving the fourth critter card forward or backward two spaces, moving the number 6 critter card forward or backward one space, or exchanging one of your betting cards with an unused betting card.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the player can pick up one of the three &quot;dark horse&quot; tokens, which is worth 5 points if the &quot;dark horse&quot; ends the race in the top three positions; if not, that token is worth -3 points.&#10;&#10;After five turns, each player reveals their two betting cards and receives points according to the matching critter card's position: 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point(s) for first through seventh place. After accounting for the dark horse tokens, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Minuscule was first released under the title Dark Horse with a horse-racing theme.&#10;&#10;",

As part of an ancient tradition, apprentices gather around a fire to drink a strong mushroom potion. The Shaman's quarters are warm and comfortable. The fire burns in the middle of the hut. Smoke moves through a hole in the roof. The sun will set soon.&#10;&#10;The Shaman and each apprentice drink from the bowl simmering near the fire. The taste, bitter and revolting. The Shaman's assistant does not drink; he stands calmly beside her. The assistant is invisible. Adorned in animal skins and strange ornaments, the Shaman begins to guide the ritual. A drum is tapped with elderly fingers, creating a primitive disjointed rhythm. The weathered drum is played for some time, then stops abruptly. The Shaman looks about the room. She looks up to the ceiling, observing the smoke escaping into the sky.&#10;&#10;&quot;The plants now speak to us.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the adventure board game The Mushroom Eaters, 2-5 players are apprentices who have consumed a drink of the psilocybin mushroom. Each player enters into a psychedelic state together. The Shaman is guiding and observing the group, trying to understand who would be the wisest to replace her. While the group travels together, some may wander into faraway realms of their own mind, but when the mushroom wears off everyone will return. The wisest apprentice is chosen to guide the village in the future.&#10;&#10;This is the first game in a series to incorporate an &quot;Action Path&quot;. Each player uses a hand of cards to help the group advance along this path. If cards are played correctly, the path may help the individual or the group entirely; if cards are played poorly, the entire group could be affected by the changes in the environment. Players aim to gain Experience by awakening to new understandings, centering one's self in the oblivion of the moment, gaining intense realities witnessed in the Great Paradox, and building wisdom from profound revelations.&#10;&#10;",

You are American rail luminaries, creating small independent lines to serve local cities. Plying your business acumen, you plan to sell these lines to larger companies. Of course, you wouldn&rsquo;t be where you are today without knowing a thing or two about turning tricky situations to your advantage: You have a scheme in mind to get the big companies what they need, without necessarily having, shall we say, exclusive ownership of it&hellip;.&#10;&#10;20th Century Limited condenses the history the American railroad into a sixty-minute game. Players take on the roles of the great railway robber barons as they set up small railroads, turn them into larger rail lines, then sell them off and start all over again. The spread of the North American rail system can happen on your game table in about an hour as the network develops in a fashion similar to the historical model.&#10;&#10;The game possesses the simple route-building mechanisms that were used in Transamerica. The placement of pieces is easy to understand, and this simple feature is livened up by the Rail Line cards that dictate the placement of rail segments to recreate the various historical railways of America. The second piece of the puzzle are the Demand cards that serve as a pseudo pick-up-and-deliver system. Players are able to choose what path suits them in the game. You can go for the fulfillment of demands or you can try to build the great rail lines that shaped America. Everything from the Santa Fe to Boston &amp; Maine and many other memorable lines are represented, including the game's namesake: the New York Central Railroad.&#10;&#10;",

An army of unspeakable horrors of an ancient and forgotten race of infernal creatures awoke deep within the earth and marched across the lands. The Darkness ravished the Five Realms with death and destruction and nearly brought the continent to its knees. Faced with a desperate fight for their very survival, the great races put aside their differences and united into a warband of such magnitude and strength as had never been seen before. The world trembled.&#10;&#10;Though their great loss of life on the battlefield was nearly insurmountable, the warband's sheer size overpowered the armies of Darkness and largely drove them back beneath the earth. Sorcerers and shamans and magi of the great races invoked binding blood magic to start sealing the enemy away for an eternity. In the final days of battle to determine the fate of the lands, the hordes of Darkness and the great warband clash on four remaining battle fronts that are each located near a border landmark that separate the kingdoms of the Five Realms.&#10;&#10;The last four campaigns wage on. The end is near. May the Maker protect us all....&#10;&#10;As a player in Warband: Against the Darkness, you control the warband armies of one of the great fantasy races of the Five Realms. Although the great races are currently working together in mutual defense, old habits and rivalries are hard to break and this isn't in any way a co-operative game. It's important that your kind emerges victorious from the war with more battle prestige and honor than your temporary and untrustworthy comrades. The player who collects the most Victory Points of one-upmanship for their race by the conclusion of the final battle against the Darkness &ndash; gained by advancing your soldiers in the warband, earning gold for your army captains, reconnoitering the combat fronts with your scouts, and defeating enemies on the battlefields &ndash; has achieved the greatest leadership glory and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Warband: Against the Darkness is perfectly balanced in the design space between Euro and Ameri-style gameplay, combining strategic depth with an evocative fantasy theme and tense player conflict.&#10;&#10;",

These land cards give you victory points, and the first player who has gained seven points wins.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, players choose twelve unit cards to construct a deck of their own. On your turn, you execute four phases: control, maintenance, income, and military. Military is the most important phase in a turn, during which you can muster, deploy, or move your units. You can also gain food. You consume action points to execute these actions. You need food to muster units and activate them. Managing food and maximizing synergies of units are the keys to winning the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

    "Description": "In the vast realm of Backyardia, the Bug Council convenes to discuss important things like picnics, how to ruin picnics and, of course, income tax reform. The different factions of bugs &mdash; ants, flies, bees, mosquitos and cockroaches &mdash; find themselves in an ever-shifting balance of power and only those who ally themselves with the most powerful will seize the day.&#10;&#10;Bug Council of Backyardia is a trick-taking game that utilizes a mancala mechanism to dynamically shift which suits are powerful throughout the game, which is played over three rounds. Each round, players receive eleven cards to play ten tricks. During the tricks, the leader plays a suit and the rest of the players follow with a card of the same suit, if possible. Whoever plays the strongest card of the strongest suit wins the trick and collects it for scoring! Meanwhile, whoever plays the lowest on-suit card gets to visit the Bug Council; this player chooses a faction tile, collects its strength cubes, then distributes them in a clockwise fashion around the council, thus altering the strength of the suits.&#10;&#10;At the end of ten tricks, players use their remaining card to claim their allegiance to the faction matching its suit. If you play your cards right and manipulate the council to your favor, you can get a nice allegiance bonus to add to the tricks you've won.&#10;&#10;At the end of three rounds, whoever has the most points wins the game and will be forever remembered in the annals of Backyardia history!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The kingdom is reuniting, but the work of El Cascadero and his ministers has only begun. Many challenges and opportunities await the kingdom. Bandits threaten to overwhelm the towns, rivers present new modes of travel, trade continues to grow, and the borders must be defended.&#10;&#10;Cascadito is the smaller spiritual sibling to Reiner Knizia&rsquo;s big box tile placement strategy game, Cascadero. Each player receives their own sheet and a pencil. 6 dice are rolled, and players take turns drafting a die used to fill in a space on their map. The dice display 5 colors, representing the 5 town types on the map. When a colored die is chosen, the player fills in a space adjacent to a matching colored town.&#10;&#10;By reaching towns with groups of filled in spaces, players will trigger town scoring in the book of successes on their sheet. If players plan their routes wisely, these escalating successes can trigger a cascade of combos to give them a competitive edge in earning the public achievements and private bonuses.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when all the public achievements have been claimed or when one player gains all the private bonuses. Players will then tally up their successes and achievements to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Cascadito retains the challenging, combotastic core of Cascadero &mdash; the interplay between the map and book of successes &mdash; while providing a refreshingly unique and complementary experience:&#10;&#10;     Players are limited to the dice options on the table, and they must watch their opponent&rsquo;s plans and routes carefully when drafting a die on their turn.&#10;     Features 4 dramatically unique sheets with different maps, tracks, achievements, strategies, landmarks, and bonuses. These sheets are (1) Rural Beginnings, (2) Raiding Bandits, (3) The Two Rivers, and (4) Trade and Defense.&#10;     Contained within a smaller and faster package, great as a filler game or travel companion.&#10;     Includes a solo mode for each sheet with a standard and advanced difficulty.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The world is a dynamic place, always changing and never stops flowing. New and improved ways are challenging traditional values and, with the wave of renaissance sweeping through, you will not be spared.&#10;&#10;With great power comes great responsibility to provide stability and protection, resulting in a new golden age. Endure the tides of time, and leave an epic impression of your civilization upon the heritage of mankind.&#10;&#10;Guns &amp; Steel: Renaissance is a standalone expansion for Guns &amp; Steel, providing new cards and new mechanisms that can be played by itself, or combined with the base game to provide a rich and dynamic adventure throughout history. Here's the overview of a player's turn during the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Resource Phase&#10;        Play a card face-down as a resource card.&#10;    &#10;    Development Phase&#10;        Play a card face-up as a development card.&#10;    &#10;    Purchase Phase&#10;        May buy one card from supply.&#10;    &#10;    End of Turn Phase&#10;        0 or 1 card in hand: &#10;             Retrieve cards to hand.&#10;        &#10;        2 or more cards in hand: Do nothing.&#10;        Check if you can place glory cubes on a wonder.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of the wonders are taken, or when all space age cards have been bought, or when a player has 15 VP tokens. At this point, whoever has the most VP wins.&#10;&#10;",

Competing power companies are scrambling to extract as much PRISM as they can to increase their influence by powering districts and ultimately controlling the city's power needs.&#10;&#10;Activating a district card allows players to expand their power grid capabilities and also increases a company's influence.&#10;&#10;Instead of activating a district, a player could instead use the card's exchange ability to perform a powerful action at the cost of giving up the district, placed on The Exchange for others to take.&#10;&#10;Players take turn extracting PRISMs and using them to fulfill district contracts offered by the government. As players power districts, their play area will reflect the state of their city influence. When powering districts, players are rewarded for paying the exact amount, portraying efficiency and promoting careful planning.&#10;&#10;When a player activates their 8th district, the game enters the last round phase. At the end of the game, players with the highest influence points, earned by activated districts and their private agenda, are declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

If the player chooses the jar which matches the color of the emotion, then they can place the emotion token into the jar. Otherwise, the jar goes back to the shelf as it was. In order to pick up an emotion token, players have to explain a memory or a situation in which they feel like the emotion they are picking up (Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Fear or Calm). The players can lose the game if the Monster gets too confused and they flip over too many mixed emotion jars, or win the game when the emotions are all placed in their correct jars.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Emphasis is on infantry combat.&#10;&#10;Crossfire is an innovative set of rules very unlike most other systems out there.  &quot;Turns&quot; (having the &quot;initiative&quot; is the term in Crossfire which loosely matches the concept of a &quot;turn&quot;) are not sequential (as in &quot;step 1 movement, step 2 artillery fire, step 3 melee, etc, etc&quot;) and distances and moves are not measured (we do some measurement in our house rules).  This different approach makes for a breathlessly exciting game system where critical situations are developed realistically and resolved quickly. The mechanics also make for amazingly quick games.  Scenarios that have previously taken more than a day to complete are finished within a few hours.  Once you try this game, you won't want to go back to others, believe me!&#10;&#10;Crossfire focuses on infantry action at the company level with squads as the smallest element. Some people play with house rules which add more detail to the armor rules - but the existing rules work fine as Crossfire is primarily and infantry orientated rule set.&#10;&#10;Crossfire is actually a step up from our 1:1 preferences, with figures mounted on stands of 2-3 figures representing a squad.  This was a bit of a nervous jump from 1:1 for me, but the result has been very rewarding.  I think one of the reasons I like it so much is that the idea of squads moving about is a bit like Avalon Hill's Squad Leader which we played years and years ago.  That was a great game.&#10;&#10;Also Available: Hit the Dirt! (CrossFire Scenarios) 21 scenarios for Cross Fire in a booklet.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The new century is upon us, and the 20th Century promises to be something great for the game of baseball. Across the eastern half of the United States the national pastime is taking shape. The leagues are settling into traditional formats that will remain unchanged for decades.&#10;&#10;You are an owner of one of the charter franchises, a leader with the money and vision to grow the game into its modern form. Invest wisely &ndash; it is not only the team on the field that matters, but also the stadium, media, and fans that can set you up for success! This is not a baseball game simulation; this is a game about building a baseball dynasty. Your business savvy and skills will win the day.&#10;&#10;Lords of Baseball is for 1-4 players (expandable to 6 or 8 and can even be expanded to 16 with two base games and 4 expansions). Lords of Baseball takes about 40 minutes per season to play. It is a card-driven strategy game that unfolds over multiple seasons (you can choose to play a short, medium, or long game).&#10;&#10;A game of Lords of Baseball is played out over a pre-determined number of seasons (three, five, or seven). Each player has a team and stadium mat where they track the progress and development of the franchise. Players will utilize the various card decks to alter their team&rsquo;s abilities and to gain competitive edges during series against their opponents. Results are tracked on the main game board. Wins each season, fan support and victory points are shown there. In general players need to balance three objectives: winning games, earning money, and improving their stadiums. Be careful, it is easy to lose focus on one category and fail to score as well as someone that keeps all three balls in play.&#10;&#10;",

There are the fast Hetzer tank destroyers, too. Road to Berlin has both regular army and Waffen SS pieces, including SS cavalry. There are also pieces for the German home-defense militia called out in the last days of the Thousand-Year Reich.&#10;&#10;The Red Army of Workers and Peasants is also loaded with powerful weapons: The JS-1 and JS-2 heavy tanks lead the way, but there are also all sorts of vehicles not seen before by Panzer Grenadier fans: T-34/85, T-70 and KV-85 tanks; SU-76, SU-85, SU-100, SU-122, SU-152 and JSU-152 assault guns. There&rsquo;s also 122mm artillery for the first time, and Ba64 armored cars.&#10;&#10;Returning to the Panzer Grenadier system are the Soviet Guards, the elite of the Soviet armed forces. They bring the modern weapons of 1944 and 1945 plus rocket launchers and a full array of ground forces. We first debuted these in Heroes of the Soviet Union, which will be retired when the last copies are sold, but this is a much fuller treatment.&#10;&#10;Just as Eastern Front includes the Armata Romana, so does Road to Berlin bring the Royal Honvedseg, Hungary&rsquo;s army. The Hungarians have excellent cavalry and a number of Hungarian-made armored vehicles that are, well, less than excellent: Turan and Toldi tanks and Nimrod and Zrinyi assault guns.&#10;&#10;As for playing surface, Road to Berlin features eight of the semi-rigid mapboards of the type found in Airborne and Eastern Front. These are new to players of the series, with art by Terry Moore Strickland.&#10;&#10;And as will be true for all games in the series, there are plentiful replay opportunity: 75 scenarios drawn from the battles of 1944 and 1945 on the Eastern Front. &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Arctic Front: Finland's War, 1939-1944 &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book: Deluxe Edition&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Blue Division&#10;    Campaigns & Commanders: War in the East, 1939-1945 &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Campaign Book&#10;    Edelweiss: A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book&#10;    First Axis: Slovakia at War 1939-1945 &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Scenario Book&#10;    Fronte Russo: A Panzer Grenadier Expansion Book&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Curtain&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Iron Wolves &#226;&#128;&#147; Lithuania's Army&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: March on Leningrad&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: North Wind&#10;    Red Warriors&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: Siege of Leningrad&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: South Africa's War&#10;    Panzer Grenadier: War on the Equator&#10;    White Eagles: A Panzer Grenadier Supplement Book&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Gamers who cherish the finer things in life such as wonderfully painted armies, fighting over luxurious terrain and doing so in the company of friends. No need for the use of protractors to wheel a unit. Arguments over whether a charge is 2mm out of range are not something you&rsquo;ll need to worry about. In essence it&rsquo;s a very relaxing game that can produce stunning conflicts - conflicts that can see one side appear doomed only for them to pull victory from the icy grasp of Mistress Defeat!&#10;&#10;The book itself is glorious. Hardback covers binding 184 full-colour pages filled with atmospheric anecdotes and the most sumptuous photographs of model soldiers you will have seen.

In the interactive card-driven worker placement game Taverna, you play an innkeeper of the city, eager to profit from this celebration and make his renown widespread. In order to do so, you will need to get along well with the four peoples of the kingdom, and you will need to cope with the demands of the Royal Court. It is up to you to be courteous with all of them. Will you play fair? Or will you use trickery, magic, and your influence with the most famous dignitaries?&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will chose one customer among the four available cards and place it in one of the five taverns. The property owners receive gold and the innkeeper is rewarded if he fulfils the expectations of the patrons. During your turn you can play one of the four dignitaries, cast spells, use royal favours and benefit from privileges. At the end of turn six, players will score one of the five members of the Royal Court, each scoring being available once. Your popularity with the four people will determine the royal scoring order and final bonuses. Power and glory to the most popular innkeeper.&#10;&#10;",

Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable, but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles. The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the often chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level.&#10;&#10;Into the Woods: the Battle of Shiloh includes ten scenarios. They range from division level contests on half sized maps to two-map battles depicting both the first and second day of the struggle. Experienced players will be able to play many of the scenarios in one sitting. The game reflects the Confederate surprise, the &quot;greenness&quot; of many units on both sides, as well as the unique role Albert Sidney Johnston played in the Confederate attack.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 1 hour&#10;    Hex: 110 yards / 100 meters&#10;    Units: Battalion to Brigade (mostly Regiments)&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;    One 11 x 17&quot; double-sided full color map&#10;    Four &amp; half double-sided countersheets of 1,260 1/2&quot; counters (4 full sheet &amp; 1 half sheet - zero blank counters)&#10;    One 44-page GBACW Series Rule Booklet&#10;    One 56-page Shiloh Battle Book&#10;    Two 4 page Player Aid Card Folders&#10;    Two double-sided Battle Events Chart/Ammo Resupply Charts&#10;    Two double-sided Terrain Effects Charts/Disorder Tables&#10;    One double-sided Turn Track Cards&#10;    One double-sided Alert Schedule/Union Brigade Missions Card&#10;    Two double-sided Efficiency/Activation Charts&#10;    Two 10-sided dice (1 blue &amp; 1 gray)&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium-High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 1-4&#10;Playing Time: 3 to 8 hours&#10;&#10;SYSTEM DESIGNER Richard Berg &#10;GAME DESIGN Dick Whitaker &#10;DEVELOPER Bill Byrne &#10;RESEARCH Albert Smith &#10;MAP ART Charlie Kibler and Dick Whitaker&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;",

Each piece on the board is a corps in the French, Anglo-Allied, and Prussian armies, so each side has 4 - 8 pieces on board.  As your pieces move they will gain fatigue, and as they battle they gain fatigue and casualties.&#10;&#10;The battle system is card play, matching the cards played based on the type of units in the corps (infantry, cavalry, or artillery).

    "Description": "Four Gods is a real-time tile-laying game in which players create a world &mdash; one tile at a time &mdash; before laying claim to one of the four gods of their world and attempting to win followers by sending prophets into that world.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players sit outside of a cardboard frame that represents the limits of the world. Each player starts with two randomly-drawn tiles in hand, with each double-sided tile depicting 1-3 types of landscape out of the four types present in the world.&#10;&#10;When play begins, each player simultaneously starts laying tiles into the frame; each tile must be adjacent to two sides to be placed, so initially tiles can be placed only in the corners of the frames, with players building inward from there. Players can place tiles anywhere that they can legally be placed (two sides are adjacent to the frame or previously placed tiles and all landscapes match across tile borders.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile, a player can place it in their personal discard area, which can hold at most ten tiles. When a player has both hands free, they can draw two new tiles from the bag; alternatively, any player with a free hand can pick up any tile in any discard area and place it in the world.&#10;&#10;At any point during the game, a player can claim one of four gods and that god's followers. Each god is associated with a particular type of landscape, e.g., the merfolk god. Once a player has followers, they can place a prophet on a tile they just placed to claim that section of landscape. Players can place any number of prophets in a landscape as long as they're placing each prophet on a tile they just added to the world.&#10;&#10;At any point in the game, if a player thinks that a section of the board cannot be filled with a tile &mdash; e.g., a space that's surrounded by four types of landscapes &mdash; that player can place a round city marker in that space, and then claim that city with a prophet. If a matching tile is found later, a player can &quot;smash&quot; and collect that city, replacing it with the tile.&#10;&#10;Once the world is filled or players agree that no more tiles can be placed, the game ends. Each player scores five points for each city occupied or smashed. Each landscape with one or more prophets is worth a number of points to the player(s) with the most prophets in it equal to the number of tiles in that landscape minus the number of prophets in it. The landscape with the largest mass rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest masses rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses; similarly, the landscape that appears in the most distinct groups rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest groups again rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses.&#10;&#10;Whichever god has scored the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mexican Train is a fairly recently developed variation of Domino train type games that has become extremely popular.  Because of its simplicity and interaction,  it can be played by nearly anyone, anywhere.  Depending on the type of game you play, it can last from a single, 20-minute game to a 12 round game lasting hours.&#10;&#10;Although Mexican Train can be played with a standard set of Dominos, branded versions usually include a range of parts to facilitate play and highlight the theme, such as a train station, train pieces to mark players' trains and the &quot;Mexican train&quot;, and a &quot;woo woo!&quot; train whistle.  It is typically played with a set of double 12 dominoes (although double 6 and double 9 sets can be used with fewer players), and there are a variety of sets packaged by various manufactures as &quot;Mexican Train Dominoes&quot; that include all the necessary components to play.&#10;&#10;A double-twelve domino set has 91 tiles. The goal is for the players to get rid of their dominoes. Starting with the highest double tile placed in the middle of the table, which is the station, each player creates a line of dominoes. This is their train. Another train, the &quot;Mexican Train,&quot; can be played on by anyone. In the event that a player cannot play at all, even after drawing a new tile, she must place a marker (often little colored plastic trains that come with the game) on their train which allows others to play on her train temporarily until the marker is removed.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player is out of dominoes, the other players add up the value of their remaining tiles. At the end of the evening, the player with the lowest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Orl&eacute;ans Stories is based on the bag-building mechanism known from Orl&eacute;ans, with this mechanisms having been further developed into a storytelling experience in which players go through different eras and face different challenges. Broadly speaking, instead of focusing on the city of Orl&eacute;ans and trade with the surrounding villages, player are now settling the Loire Valley. Players must farm and produce, found villages, and build fortresses and churches. They will experience times of prosperity and success, but also times of deprivation; they must defy hunger and plague, fight for their land, and perhaps conquer foreign lands to secure the lives of their settlers. In the end, however, there is peace and the joint administration of territories and villages.&#10;&#10;The game includes two stories: &quot;The First Kingdom&quot; and &quot;The King's Favor&quot;. &quot;The First Kingdom&quot; is an epic story that spans eight so-called eras, and each era features different conditions and emphases. Sometimes knights settle down, with whose help you can conquer foreign territories, sometimes the plague threatens to decimate the population of settlers unless all have worked together to develop medicine.&#10;&#10;&quot;The King's Favor&quot; is shorter, simpler, and more suitable as an introduction to the game. Over five eras, certain tasks have to be fulfilled by the end of each era, and those who fail to do so will drop out mercilessly. The threat of having to end the game prematurely provides a constant thrill, but all tasks are achievable, so that (usually) all players experience the end of the fifth era &mdash; but those who have concentrated only on the tasks will be punished because at this point everyone's achievements will be compared in the king's castle, and you will receive victory points for territory size, buildings, goods, and coins.&#10;&#10;The different eras affect the parameters of play as well as the rules of the game, creating new strategic possibilities. This challenges players to constantly adapt to current conditions, giving you the impression of experiencing a story, but unlike in legacy games, these stories can be repeated as often as you like. The changes from era to era require a new way of looking at things from a distance, but this is made easier for players by a story booklet in which players will find not only all relevant information and rule peculiarities, but also hints of how to prepare for the upcoming game in the form of a narrated story.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All the exciting books, graphic novels and movies full of tireless discoverers and travelers, surprisingly lethal archeologists, secret agents, or crocodile hunters. Now grab your cards and use them to form a unique expedition to find legendary treasures! So, where&rsquo;s the catch? The heroes we&rsquo;re talking about are close to immortal &ndash; whatever happened they always found a way out, never actually meeting enemies powerful enough to defeat them. You, on the other hand, will have to face your friends, who probably had the same sources of inspiration as yourself&hellip; It's time to prepare for a tough competition full of dirty tricks!&#10;&#10;When playing Venturesome, you try to gather a group of adventurers able to undertake a chosen challenge while evading any threats. You use the abilities of your expedition members in order to thwart your rivals&rsquo; plans. However, bear in mind that your opponents are equally ready to steal, manipulate, or do anything that is necessary to defeat you. If you don&rsquo;t act quickly and decisively, instead of finding the treasure, your expedition will get into real trouble. So, forget about scruples and compromises. Be smarter, quicker, and meaner that your rivals.&#10;&#10;Venturesome is the spiritual successor of the legendary Palastgefl&uuml;ster. With the updated game mechanics and victory conditions, you can expect hours of gaming full of negative interaction. In this game each move is a risk that might pay off.&#10;&#10;Just remember about the most important rule: be RUTHLESS!

You acquire smaller corporations in global stock markets, borrow from debt markets to finance your investments, use superpowers like a pawn to invade third world countries and take their oil, lobby the governments to grant you more subsidies and compete with other mega-corporations for leadership in market share.&#10;&#10;Uncontrollably, the world is not in its most stable state either.

    "Description": "Monster Match is unique among speed games for one simple reason: more than 1 person can get a match every round. This sounds minor but it makes a huge difference in game play.&#10;&#10;There is usually a dominant player in any given speed game which makes the game frustrating for the other players who have a hard time getting points. In Monster Match, it is possible for every player to score in a round. This makes the game more fun for a greater number of players and it adds a layer of strategy to the game as players decide whether to grab the first match they see or search longer for a match that might be worth more points. Another unique element in Monster Match is that the number of cards on the table changes every round. This creates a dynamic landscape which directly affects your strategic decisions each round between grabbing quickly or taking more time to find a high point card. The end result is a game that is more fun and engaging than other alternatives on the market.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;- Scatter 10 Monster Cards face-up on the table.&#10;- Roll the special Monster Dice.&#10;- Everyone races to find a monster that matches the roll.&#10;- Touch a card with your finger to claim it.  You cannot change your claim once you've touched a card.  &#10;- Each player scores 1 - 3 points depending on the number of donuts on the card they claimed. Incorrect claims lose points.&#10;- The Monster Dice passes to the left.  Rinse and repeat.&#10;- Be the first to claim the &quot;Zilch&quot; token if there are no matches after the die roll.  Get a random card as points and then scatter 10 new Monster Cards on the table.&#10;- The game ends immediately when you cannot replenish the table with 10 new Monster Cards after a Zilch has occurred.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&#10;&#10;(7 of the games are described below)&#10;&#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&#10;&#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&#10;&#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Mercator : 3-7 players&#10;&#10;This game is Medici&#039;s ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&#10;&#10;Imperium : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&#10;&#10;Senator : 2-3 players&#10;&#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&#10;&#10;Consul : 2-4 players&#10;&#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.&#10;&#10;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.&#10;&#10;",

(3's a Crowd!), no player escapes this question as they decide which cards to play when.&#10;&#10;To set up, place the start cards in the middle of the table, then deal a deck of twenty cards to each player. Each player draws a hand of eight cards from their deck.&#10;&#10;On your turn, play one number card from your hand into the display on the table. Each card you play has a certain place in the numerical sequence. If you add the fifth card to a row, you must take one to three cards from the display (depending on the position of the card you played), and place them in front of you, sorted by color. If you have one or two cards in a color at the end of the game, those earn you positive points; however, if you had to take a third card of that color, they earn you negative points instead. Both during and at the end of the game, you can earn bonus points for having cards in many different colors. The game ends when each player has played a total of eighteen cards. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn you can take the top card from the discard or draw pile. You can exchange one card (hidden or open) from your display with it or discard the drawn card to turn one card face up. The round ends when one player has only open cards. All cards will be revealed, and the points added for each player (Cards are ranked from -2 to 12). The game ends when one player reaches 100 points or more. Whoever has the lowest score wins.&#10;The trick is: Whenever one column of 3 cards all have the same value, the whole column is dicarded, so if you are feeling lucky, you can try to collect sets of high cards (which everyone else will likely discard, so you can take them from the discard pile).&#10;&#10;Skyjo Action adds (as the name suggests) Action Cards, which allow for special moves: Exchange cards in your tableu, Exchange cards between players, Steal an action card, Take two turns in a row etc. You get an action card whenever you put or reveal a Joker in your tableau, or you can take an Action Card instead of a normal move. Jokers allow for easier set collection and make very valuable sets in themselves (-10 or -15 points). &#10;As a new rule, rows of identical cards are now also discarded.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Like its predecessor Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves, Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players. The game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic, tactical card battles, with the armies in this set particularly focused towards cavalry and ranged combat.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn. Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Elves and the Lizardmen. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Elf faction is based around strong cavalry units and archers, but has a relatively weak infantry. The Lizardmen army is the most flexible Lords of War army released so far and is best used to disrupt and counter enemy attack strategies.&#10;&#10;Elves versus Lizardmen is compatible with Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Released July 8, 2016 - 3 months ahead.&#10;&#10;Moscow '41 is the first chapter of the Barbarossa Trilogy (the other two are Leningrad '41 and Kiev '41).&#10;&#10;MOSCOW '41 is a light/medium wargame covering the German Army Group Centre offensive aimed to seize Moscow, after having successfully defeated several Soviet armies in the great encirclement battles at the frontier and established two bridgeheads on the Dnieper.&#10;&#10;Although based on a historical event, the two players can modify the course of the operations, with the Germans trying to achieve a decisive victory before the winter comes, and the Soviets playing a fighting withdrawal, until ready to strike a decisive blow at the invaders.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for two players, but has excellent solitaire suitability.&#10;&#10;Historical Introduction&#10;&#10;&quot;At the beginning of each campaign, one pushes a door into a dark, unseen room. One can never know what is hiding inside.&quot;&#10;&#10;- Adolf Hitler, June '41&#10;&#10;In December of 1940, Hitler made the decision to invade Russia and set the date for the middle of 1941. He had good reason to be confident that Russia would collapse under an uncompromising assault. Since the outbreak of hostilities, the German Wehrmacht had accomplished a stunning and unparalleled series of victories: Poland had fallen in one month, Denmark in one day; France, till then regarded as the strongest power in Europe, had capitulated in under six weeks, Holland in under six days; Belgium, Norway, Yugoslavia and Greece took less than three weeks each. The German military might was at its peak and the word Blitzkrieg had entered the language.&#10;&#10;Russia, on the other hand had taken over three months to bring Finland to heel, despite overwhelming strength of numbers. The Russian army had not yet recovered from Stalin's purges of 1937-1938 where 400 generals were &ldquo;removed&rdquo; including three field marshals and 13 Army commanders. It was well that Hitler could say, &ldquo;Before three months have passed, we shall witness a collapse in Russia, the like of which has never been seen in history. We have only to kick in the front door and the whole rotten Russian edifice will come tumbling down.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;On the 22nd of June, 1941, Operation Barbarossa - the invasion of Russia, began. Three million Axis troops in three Army Groups attacked on a front that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea: Army Group North under Field Marshal von Leeb was tasked with taking Leningrad; Army Group South under Field Marshal von Rundstedt was to capture Kiev and seize the Caucasus; Field Marshal von Bock's Army Group Centre, the one that concerns us, had Moscow as an objective, with Timoshenko undertaking the task of defending the capital.&#10;&#10;Initially, the operation succeeded beyond Hitler's wildest dreams. Within a day, the Russian Air Force was destroyed on the ground, then vast inroads were made on all fronts accompanied by large scale surrenders of encircled Russian troops. Army Group Centre with its four armies consisting of a total of 48 Divisions, of which nine were armoured, and backed by the Second Air Fleet, had reached the outskirts of Smolensk by the 15th July. This was two-thirds of the way to Moscow and it seemed that nothing could stop von Bock from blowing up the Kremlin within another three or four weeks... or could something stand in his way?&#10;&#10;Four things could now cause problems to von Bock: firstly, his supply line is stretched and had almost reached breaking point; secondly, Russian resistance is stiffening; thirdly, his infantry divisions are having difficulty keeping up with the Panzers and finally, a new Russian ally is about to enter the field: General Winter.&#10;&#10;Additional concerns may come in November, with three-quarters of a million experienced Siberian veterans freed by garrisoning Soviet Far East, thanks to Stalin's spies in Tokyo revealing Japanese intentions to attack America, and not Russia.&#10;&#10;As the German Commander, you must push on to Moscow before it is too late. As the Russian Commander you must re-evoke the Patriotic War and stop the invaders at any cost.&#10;&#10;",

The hunter wants to see those cute dragons dead, but must get past the dragon keepers. The keepers belong to different tribes but together they have the common goal of protecting the dragons. The keepers use magic in their duels with the evil hunter.&#10;&#10;Dragon Keepers was designed by Vital Lacerda and his youngest daughter, Catarina. Says Vital, &quot;She is the one who knows a lot about dragons and I could have never been able to do this design without her.&quot; Dragon Keepers has two different games in the box:&#10;&#10;KEEPER GAME: 3&ndash;6 players | 10&ndash;15 minutes | ages 6+&#10;In this competitive mode, the hunter rolls dice to attack the dragons and the players choose which of the attacked dragons they want to defend. The game ends when one player manages to heroically defend three different dragons or if one dragon gets three hits. The winner is the player with more successful defenses.&#10;&#10;DRAGON GAME: 2&ndash;4 players | 20&ndash;40 minutes | ages 9+&#10;In this cooperative mode, the keepers work together to defend and train the dragons so that they attack the hunter. Players can take four different actions: Defend, Cure, Train and Attack. Those actions are limited and they need to cooperate and organized as a group to manage to stop the hunter's attacks during the game. The players lose if a dragon is killed by the hunter, or if the battle event deck runs out. The players win if X dragons (where X is determined by the difficulty level) manage to successfully attack the hunter.&#10;&#10;",

If they end their movement in a space with a ghost, they fight that ghost by rolling a fight die. If they roll the matching symbol, they remove the ghost from the game board.

    "Description": "Afrika: The Northern African Campaign, 1940-1942, is a simulation game covering the North African Campaign from September, 1940 through December, 1942. In late 1940, the Italian Army invaded Egypt beginning the famous North African Campaign of World War II. After a short withdrawal, the Commonwealth forces counterattacked and all but threw the Italians back to Tripoli. Not content to let his southern partner bring disgrace to the Axis arms, Hitler dispatched a German contingent under a new commander: Erwin Rommel. His arrival began a rapid mobile campaign across the rocky sands.  However, by the end of 1942, Rommel had failed in his final bid to seize the Nile Delta and was thrown completely out of the theater by Montgomery's pursuit after El Alamein. Axis fortunes would never rise on the African continent again.&#10;&#10;Afrika is a fast paced game of mobile warfare at the operational level. Can you take the Nile? Can your Commonwealth forces kick the Axis armor out of Egypt for good?  This game gives you the tools to find out. The game's easy-to-use supply system (no writing) allows for a correct logistical aspect to the game.&#10;&#10;This is the second game in Standard Combat Series by The Gamers that began with the game Stalingrad Pocket. The series rules have been refined after lessons learned with the earlier game. This series of games was designed to off-set The Gamers's line of more complex products. Experienced players will feel comfortable with the rules as soon as they read through them.  It is designed as a fast paced fun game giving a reasonable simulation of events.

In a tie, the tied player with the exact shape shown on the token wins.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game, the players must grab only the exact piece shown on the token.

On your turn, play a single card from your hand to the tableau to a column that matches that card. If no such column exists for that type of card, start a new column. Next, activate that card's ability, then draw back up to three cards in hand. Each of the seven different types of cards has a unique ability that offers lots of strategy and replayability.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the seventh card of a column is played. This card is played sideways and counts towards the hand of whoever played it for endgame scoring. Whoever has the most points in hand wins.&#10;&#10;",

Some cards produce resources or transform one type of resources into another and award victory points, while others let you perform actions.

At the start of each turn, players have five cards in hand, with six cards being face-up on the table as a card market. During the turn, players first have a chance to exchange some cards from their hands with those in the market, then they play and resolve their cards step by step, performing actions, trading and gathering resources, and most importantly, refining certain resources into other resources to earn victory points. Crystals on the players' individual resource boards keep track of their resources as they are bought and sold. Crystals placed beside the board represent player's coins. The final score is determined after the fourth turn, with players selling any remaining resources to score additional victory points (one point per four coins). The player with the most victory points is considered to be the wisest medieval ruler and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the Soulgivers multiverse, two populations fight for the Fragment, the remains of an ancient planet as well as the only cure that can save them from a cosmic disease called Decay. The clash between the two civilizations is harsh and desperate: the warring creatures can control the field, manipulate the elements, bend the enemy&rsquo;s will. All of it for just one goal: carry the Fragment to their own Portal, to rush back to their dying planet, before anyone else does it. And you, are ready to save your world from extinction?&#10;&#10;Soulgivers is a strategy, 1vs1 and 2vs2 game. The goal of Soulgivers is to capture the Fragment, which is located in the center of the board, and deliver it to one of your two Portals.&#10;&#10;There are two populations fighting for the Fragment in order to survive a dreadful illness called Decay: Shells and Specters. Both factions are made up of a party of 10 characters, each one of them characterized by particular Abilities and/or an Aura. The two players face off by playing three characters at a time.&#10;&#10;Soulgivers gets its name from the fact that when a hero dies, they leave their Soul imbued with their abilities on the battlefield. This Soul can be absorbed by the teammates of the fallen hero, an action that will gift them with added abilities. Only the best and most strategic combination of Soulgivers and Souls will allow you to save your population.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On December 2nd, 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned Emperor of France. By placing the crown upon his head with his own hands, Bonaparte brought all of Europe to the brink of war. For by its very nature, the act of self-coronation threatened the rule and challenged the legitimacy of every government then in existence.&#10;&#10;To restore the sanctity of the divine right and position based on noble birth, the European monarchies branded Bonaparte an international outlaw and pledged to remain at war against France until the Corsican usurper was overthrown and the Bourbon was restored. For the next ten years, the fate of the French Empire rested on the on the abilities of the man: as a warrior and as a peacemaker.&#10;&#10;Now YOU command Napoleon's Grand Armee! From the autumn of 1805 through the climactic summer of 1815, the entire ten-year conflict between France, England, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Spain, is re-created in ten separate scenarios. Each historical scenario is presented as a separate two-player game with an average playing time of 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;&quot;War and Peace&quot;, Mark McLaughlin's classic wargame on Napoleonic conquest, is here revitalized and enhanced with completely updated graphics and production, and a completely revamped rulebook that incorporates all known errata, additional scenarios, and all official variants and optional rules. What you get with this new version is all of the Napoleonic Campaigns in one box, plus a newly revised Grand Campaign Game, with an all-new map, components, modern artwork, and greatly updated rules with new optional rules for chrome and increased emphasis on the Operational Arts.&#10;&#10;The thirteen scenarios (not including the Grand Campaign Game) are as follows:&#10;I. THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN OF 1796-97&#10;II. THE ARMY OF THE ORIENT: BONAPARTE IN EGYPT 1798-99&#10;III. MARENGO &ndash; THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN OF 1800&#10;IV. THE SUN OF AUSTERLITZ - 1805&#10;V. NAPOLEON&rsquo;S APOGEE: 1806-1807&#10;VI. WAGRAM - 1809&#10;VII. THE CAMPAIGN IN RUSSIA - 1812&#10;VIII. STRUGGLE OF NATIONS &ndash; 1813&#10;IX. NAPOLEON AT BAY &ndash; 1814&#10;X.

    "Description": "The Twelve Doctors is an unauthorised, non-profit and non-collectable card game set within the immensely popular Doctor Who universe.&#10;&#10;Consisting of two balanced 60-card decks, the game pits two players against each other for the fate of the galaxy. One player takes the role of the Doctor in all his regenerations, and his opponent assumes control of his arch enemy, The Master.&#10;&#10;At his disposal, the Doctor has a roster of companions from his past to help struggle against the renegade Timelord, featuring Rose Tyler, Romana, Adric, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, etc. His equipment includes, amongst others, his Sonic Screwdriver, K-9, jelly babies', and the Hand of Omega.&#10;&#10;The Master has a wide selection of villainous temporal marauders to choose from: Zygons, Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Robots of Death, Omega, The Valeyard, Sutekh, and The Rani, etc. He even has the meddlesome option of starting an Interstellar War - much like he did between the Draconians and the Earth Empire in Space War. His deck also features such interesting devices as the Laser Screwdriver, Tissue Compression Eliminator, and a Raston Warrior Robot.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. The Twelve Doctors is played using a 3-column time-line system, representing the battle for Gallifrey, Earth present and future, and Earth past. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with companions EX-TER-MI-NATED! frequently, and marauders being dropped into black holes, or destroyed by the well-placed use of Venusian Aikido.&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, The Master has 3 planets that he can atomise during the course of each game: Telos, Metebelis III, and Skaro. This is in addition to the damage he may wreak upon Earth or Logopolis, etc, through cardplay. Destroying a planet has long-term consequences for the player, as well as short-term benefits. The Doctor, on the other hand, has the Journal of Impossible Things to use, but if he does so, makes the game easier for The Master to win.&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has three values: power, cost, and disrupt. Both player's decks are also a measure of the time they have remaining to thwart each other.&#10;&#10;The Twelve Doctors lineage can be traced back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever cannot draw a card has lost.&#10;     The Master wins if he disrupts more cards than the Doctor has left in his deck.&#10;     The Master wins if Gallifrey's power is reduced to zero.&#10;     The Master wins if Earth's power is reduced to zero (past and future).&#10;     The Master wins if all 11 incarnations of the Doctor are regenerated/destroyed.&#10;     The Master wins if 5 tokens are placed upon the Wirrn.&#10;     The Doctor wins if all 6 incarnations of the Master are regenerated/destroyed.&#10;     The Doctor wins if 5 tokens are placed upon Lucy Saxon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever gets 5 Key to Time cards in play first wins (expansion victory condition).&#10;&#10;&#10;",
