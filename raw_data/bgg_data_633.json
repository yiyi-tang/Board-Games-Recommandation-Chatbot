    "Description": "A very old pair of games (1930s?) in German.  Himmel und Erde is a chutes and ladders type game where players travel from Spring through Christmas by either going on the Earth or through Heaven.  The description on the box cover states &quot;Das lustige Wurfelspiel der bunten Welt im Jarheslauf&quot;.&#10;&#10;Die Tierschau has pictures of animals with a pair of dice with different totals on a board.  The players apparently work their way across the board by advancing a pawn from animal to animal along the way.  There are four different sets of rules, for shorter, longer and &quot;Doppelspiel&quot;, or &quot;double play&quot;.  The box top describes the game as &quot;Im Spiel kreuz und quer durch das Tierreich&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Revised for 2012, Haiku: The Card Game is a system that supports 6 different rule variants in the base game.  Originally, Haiku: The Card Game only played like the variant mentioned below named Haiku Hustle, which makes a good party game but experienced gamers demanded more, as did the designer.&#10;&#10;While the core of the game, forming Haiku from the cards you collect, remains the same across all six variants, each of the six different rule sets change how you do that dramatically.&#10;&#10;Haiku Helpers&#10;In this collaborative version, designed for younger gamers, players are awarded points for completing lines in a Haiku both in front of them and other players. The game is over once all players have a completed Haiku in front of them.&#10;&#10;Haiku Hustle&#10;One of the simplest game modes, this version focuses on completing Haiku&rsquo;s quickly and the winner deciding who made the best Haiku. This version works great in a party setting or as an introduction to Haiku.&#10;&#10;Haiku Rummy&#10;The quality, as well as quantity, of Haiku plays a major factor as an end of the game &#10;scoring round may determine a winner based on the quality of their best Haiku.&#10;&#10;Haiku Auctions&#10;Players outbid one another for a chance to recite their Haiku in front of the Emperor and gain Favor points. In the end, only the player who scored the most valuable favors will win.&#10;&#10;Haiku Seasons&#10;In this version, special Season Cards allow players to retain parts of their Haiku for points while a simultaneous action mechanic introduces special voting rounds.&#10;&#10;Haiku Stackers&#10;A quick paced abstract variant which focuses on building up or breaking down the &#10;Syllable Cards in a communal Haiku to maximize your point value.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Perseus and the Sanctum of the Medusa is a non-profit, unauthorised, non-collectable card game, set within the confines of a torch-lit underground chamber holding the only mortal Gorgon, Medusa.&#10;&#10;Consisting of two balanced 50-card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of the mythical hero Perseus, and his opponent assumes control of his quarry, the serpentine Medusa.&#10;&#10;At his disposal, Perseus has four Greek soldiers to help corner and behead the, once beautiful beast, whose very expression now turns people to stone. His equipment includes treasures gifted to him by various Olympians and the Hesperides: a polished shield, adamantine sword, and a knapsack kibisis to safely contain Medusa's head.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Perseus and the Sanctum of the Medusa is played without a board or map, with cards placed out by the Perseus player to simulate the Greeks' investigation of the column and statue strewn chamber. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Greeks petrified, or slain by bowshot and acid pool frequently.&#10;&#10;Drawn partially from Greek myth, the game is inspired hugely by the 1981 film Clash of the Titans.&#10;&#10;The game's lineage can be traced back to Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.&#10;&#10;",

The player decides which begins on a playing card with his main roster, and decides whether he wants to attack or defend. He turned the card to reveal Superstar. The opponent must then take a card either defend or attack (depending on the choice of boot drive). The losing card is removed from the game. At any moment a player can choose to spend a card to one of two cards Tag Team. There are also Champion and finishing move cards. These contractors and finishing move cards are superior to the rest of the bridge, but can not be used for cards Championship is equipped with that specific Superstar.

    "Description": "Scoreboard Baseball is a full-stat quick-play baseball game that can be played in around 10-12 minutes from out of the box to stat completion. There are no lineups to decide upon and no score sheets to fill out yet the game unfolds inning by inning with a key player and action being revealed along the way. While it can be used to add on to existing full play baseball games, such as Inside Pitch Baseball, it can also hold its own as a season replay game.&#10;&#10;Each team is represented by a single chart that shows all of the possible players and how they effect scoring in an inning when called upon to deliver as a key player. It could be the 3rd string catcher that comes through or maybe your backup shortstop. One roll per inning gets you all the action plus all the pitchers stats for that inning.&#10;&#10;All hitters are rated for, basically, runs created. This is how runs can be scored during an inning. They also have ratings for HR, 3B, 2B, SB and hits in general. How often a hitter is called upon is based on how many plate appearances he had during the season being replayed. The bigger the hit type, a HR beats a single, the better chance to have that big inning. How many runs a team scored in an inning during the year is recreated with Scoreboard as each team has its own scoring chart.&#10;&#10;Pitchers are rated on H, K and BBs. They also have ratings which can cause runs to score in an inning or block potential runs from scoring. The pitchers' stay in the game relies upon how many hits, runs and walks he gives up in his stint. Deciding who pitches doesn't slow the game down as pitchers have start and relief ranges that you can use to &quot;coach&quot; the team.&#10;&#10;Relievers are not left out of the mix as all their appearances and stats can be tracked as well. When to bring in a certain reliever is also covered with 7 different scoring/inning breakdowns that are based upon actual year appearances. Your middle guys will come in at the proper times and be effective (non-effective) just like the year the charts recreate.&#10;&#10;While most stats are gathered during the game some loose ends must be accounted for at games' end. These are handled with each player given ranges to fill in those RBI and hit stats so that the score sheet comes out even.&#10;&#10;You don't just roll for a final score in Scoreboard but you get the ebb and flow of the game broken down per inning. Sometimes your less than stellar players will need to come through in a pinch recreating the excitement of a play-by-play game just done quicker. By the end of the game, you will have these stats for the players as well as see when and how they happened in the game.&#10;&#10;Pitchers: W, L, SV, IP, H, R, ER, K, BB&#10;&#10;Hitters: H, 2B, 3B, HR, SB, RBI&#10;&#10;After a series or two from a team, multipliers are given to each player to show how many AB he would have based on the number of games his team has played. This can be used to get you batting average leaders, etc... for your league.&#10;&#10;Get on the Board with Scoreboard Baseball!&#10;&#10;",

This adds a meticulous costing system to every item already included in the game. This is particularly useful for the more casual gamer who is not looking to recreate a specific action.&#10;&#10;The five new scenarios are very well presented and now include a useful General Situation, Commanders' briefings and Umpire notes.&#10;&#10;",

The trays are placed side by side on the board and each player starts the game with 12 marbles. On each players turn he can place one of his marbles on any tray as he chooses and thus trying to make four in a row (or a Q4 as it's called in the game rules). The Q4 can be on a single tray or spanning all the trays (that is, three dimensional).&#10;&#10;After a player has played all his marbles he can start to move them around (on the same tray or between trays). After placing a marble he can claim a Q4. If the Q4 is on a single tray it should be fairly obvious whether it's a Q4 or not. If the Q4 spans all the trays, they must be stacked (the leftmost being on the bottom, the rightmost on the top) and then it can be checked whether the claim for a Q4 is true or not.&#10;&#10;The first one to make a Q4 wins the game.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    3D Tic Tac Toe - which is played on 3x3x3 grid&#10;    Four Letter Words - though with words&#10;    Qubic - which is also played, with placement only, on 4x4x4 grid but with 32 markers for each player&#10;    Tetrano - which is the same game represented on a 4x4 board.&#10;    Qubic - which has a version for 3 players also&#10;    Score Four - 4x4 grid of pegs that are filled from the bottom up&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Portal is a two-player abstract game played on a hex board where player's attempt to capture each others pieces.  Each player has four different sized units that can move different amounts of spaces on a turn (1-4).  Pieces are allowed free movement but may not move through a space they have already occupied that turn or move through another piece.  Pieces can only capture in a straight line of hexes equal to their movement amount and may jump other pieces when capturing.&#10;&#10;A key aspect to Portal is the turn structure.  On alternating turns players will make one and two movements.  That is, on turn 1, P1 will move once and P2 twice.  On turn 2, P1 moves twice and P2 moves once and so on.&#10;&#10;A portal board consists of three seperate types of &quot;special&quot; hexes.&#10;&#10;The middle hex is the Portal.  If you begin your turn with a piece in the portal you may move it to any open open, non-special space on the board and then make your movement(s) for that turn.&#10;&#10;The spaces surrounding the portal are weakened.  A piece in those spaces may not make a capturing move, except a &quot;1&quot; may capture into the portal only.&#10;&#10;The red corner spaces are protected.  A piece in that space cannot be captured, however, it must be moved out of that space on the player's next turn or it is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has one or fewer pieces remaining on the board.  Each remaining piece scores points equal to its movement value.  The player with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;Portal is currently entered in the nestorgames continuous abstract contest as well as the 1,000 Year Design Challenge.&#10;&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/48043/item/1260124#item1260124&#10;&#10;www.thousandyeargame.com&#10;&#10;",

Being lazy will cause a player to lose a turn, and sometimes it's best just to Go Home to Mama.  However, if a player can catch a Lucky Break, then end up on a square of their choice, which is the best way to land a profession!&#10;&#10;The mechanics are simple, but remembering who has what can be more difficult as cards are constantly being exchanged.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Tall Towers each player represents a carpenter during the Medieval Age who has been tasked with building a city tower for the Prince. Each player must build a tower taller and more efficiently than the other players. Everyone grabs one of the 6 foundation boards, each with a unique build queue that you are trying to complete during the frantic trading sessions.&#10;After everyone has chosen a foundation board, the game can begin. There are 2 phases repeated throughout the game. The first phase is the Trading/Resource Gathering Phase. Everyone starts with the same deck of 40 Cards, but you will not be using your own cards to build your Tall Tower. Instead the trading/resource gathering is done through an interesting real-time blind trading mechanic. It is a quick thinking and chaotic trading session quite similar to games such as Pit, or Set. Everyone is trading simultaneously, so act fast to get the cards you need, and bluff your opponents into taking the bad cards from your hand.  &#10;The second phase is the Build Phase, where you use the cards you received in the previous phase to build your Tall Tower. Of course it is not as easy as it sounds. You must play the cards in the order you received them, you cannot rearrange your hand. Some cards are good and will help you finish up the next floor of your Tower, or they could be bad and send cracks through a few of the stones you gathered during the Resource Phase.&#10;The Players go through 8 Rounds (of 5 cards each) alternating between these 2 phases, and the one with the Tallest Tower wins. There is lots of chaos during trading, lots of speculation between players as they try to talk each other into taking their cards, and lots of fun as you flip over your resources and see how good you did or how bad you crumbled.&#10;&#10;",

It is unknown whether or not this game ever made it into full production.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;- 1 Rules Folder (6 pages on continuous paper)&#10;- 54 Ship Cards (all cards for this game are printed on sheets for players to cut out)&#10;- 1 Set of Hit/Destroyed Counters (the sheet devoted to last minute changes indicates that these are not included)&#10;- 6 Play Sheets &#10;- 6 Player Order Cards&#10;- 114 Action Cards&#10;- (a six-sided die is required, but not included)&#10;&#10;Notes on play:&#10;Each player has a Play Sheet where ship status and damaged is tracked. Essentially, the Play Sheet represents a player's home base... their ships (as represented on Ship Cards) are placed on areas on the Play Sheet that show the ship's position relative to their base. Players score victory points by finishing off other player's ships.  The game ends and victory points are totaled when only one player has active ships left.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the Web Site)Untold Battle&trade; is a fast-paced, exciting way for players to duke it out with custom built creatures and parties. Showcasing the many Battle Factions of the Untold universe, Untold Battle was created for two players to choose two opposing factions and fight with tooth, bullet, tentacle and spell until only one side remains. But Battle players are not limited - they can use all of the Untold cards to change and make their units unique, or even create their own character, just as if they were going to play the roleplaying game. And Battle doesn't need to be two sided, the rules work for one-on-one, one-on-many, or many-on-many. Untold Battle Rules provide a brutal, bloody, and hard-hitting game that packs a punch!&#10;The Battle Factions&#10;&#10;Untold offers limitless possibilities for worlds and adventures. And on every world there are nations, corporations, shadow organizations, alien marauders, and so forth; we collectively call these Factions. We've built all the unique creatures, minions, soldiers, and things that go bump in the night and put them together in Battle Faction packs, so you can pick your favorites or mix and match to do Battle. Untold Battle offers an arena for all the forces of your imagination to duke it out. Now you can pit zombies against soldiers, or tentacled demons against steam punk robots. Or you can help shape the destiny of one of the Untold worlds: will the brave forces of the North American Union overcome the twisted Flux Horrors? Or you can help reshape the face of Europe as the Churl Confederation advances on the new knights of Novus Europa!&#10;The Untold Rules&#10;&#10;Untold Battle utilizes Untold Minion Cards because they are quick to use. Minions are one card, instead of a number of cards, that represent a single character, and that is important when your Battle has a large number of forces. And Minions still offer the limitless customization of Untold Powers through Swapping.&#10;&#10;Once players choose their Factions and/or characters, Battle is as simple as lining up the cards on the table across from each other and taking turns between their minions. Battle utilizes Untold's simple and quick combat mechanics (see our Online Primer for more, or just refer to back of the handy insert that comes with every Battle Faction pack), and all the rules you need for the minions are on the cards!&#10;&#10;",

In the game, the dragon riders attempt to reach the Dragon Isle, while the dragon Screaming Death tries to prevent them from doing so.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game, the board is created by lining up island tiles, starting with Viking Island (start) and ending with Dragon Isle (finish). The islands between start and finish come in four different colors.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. Each round, one player plays Screaming Death, while the others play a dragon rider. Each dragon rider has a hand with colored island cards. Each turn, each dragon rider selects one of these cards. At the same time, Screaming Death selects one color of islands to attack. Then, everybody reveals their cards. Each dragon rider that has selected the color that is being attacked by Screaming Death cannot move; the others move to the next island of their chosen color.&#10;&#10;The round ends when two dragon riders have reached Dragon Isle, or when the dragon riders can no longer move because the deck of island cards has run out. The first dragon rider to reach Dragon Isle gains two coins; the second rider gains one coin. If no dragon rider reaches Dragon Isle, Screaming Death gains three coins. If only one rider reaches Dragon Isle, Screaming Death gains one coin.&#10;&#10;The game continues with a new round, until each player has played Screaming Death once. Then, the player who has collected the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Spooky, an earlier version of this game, had the players as ghosts moving through a castle, with each player taking a turn as Merlin to try to stop the ghosts.&#10;&#10;",

Can you outbid the other tycoons and be the one to cash in on this prospering town?&#10;&#10;Sold! is an extremely mean auction game where players vie for control over the new properties in town. Over a series of 25 rounds, players bid for coloured cubes which are used to exert influences over the sales of individual properties. Will you channel your financial might on the office towers? Or will you bet on monopolizing the retail scene? Only the most cunning and opportunistic businessman will stand a chance to win!&#10;&#10;Be wary though, there plenty of opportunities for your competitors to foil your most well laid plans!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flying Officer Stumpy Prangsworthy&rsquo;s handlebar moustache streamed behind him in the 280mph wind as he craned his head round trying to locate where Von Strudels Focke Wulf 190 A8 had gone to. Deep within the cloud, the spineless Boche had shown his true colours and escaped Stumpys righteous justice. The growling Merlin engine sang a new song as he side-slipped his trusty Supermarine Spitfire down towards the now helpless Dornier 17.&#10; The Dornier was almost at the target and in scant moments would land at the brewery and snatch No14 Squadrons Claret from under their noses. Well Stumpy would see about that. He loosed the safety off of his eight .303&rsquo;s and aimed at the Dorniers port engine.&#10;  Suddenly from behind screaming out of a wingunder manoeuvre the FW 190 appeared in Stumpys vanity mirror, its cannons sparkling motes of fire. A shell smashed into the Spits wing and tore the aileron. &ldquo;Blast you, Von Strudel &ldquo;yelled Stumpy as he realised that he had been sold a duffer and was gone for a burton. Only one trick could save him. Feathering his Kites prop, he hit the airbrakes and was rewarded with the bright green FW 190 flashing under him. Dropping the nose Stumpy let rip a corking burst which caught the Jerry a treat. Flames poured from the FW 190&rsquo;s  engine and Von Strudel Hit the Silk. &#10;Von Strudel shook his fist as Stumpy flashed past. &ldquo;Verdammt Englander! Finish me now! The shame is too great!&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Not a chance old pip,&rdquo; grinned Stumpy; &ldquo;A Englishman flies by the rules of the game, and potting a Chap on his chute is defiantly not playing the game.&rdquo;&#10;So what is playing the game? You are about to find out!&#10;&#10;Blazing Skies is a Tactical WW2 Flight combat game. Each player takes control of a WW2 aircraft and battles his/her opponents in fast paced duels to the death. The roar of engines, the rattle of dice , the contrails streaming from wingtips and the chugging down of pints of claret. Its all here in Blazing Skies.&#10;&#10;45 full colour pages of rules, background, templates, charts, diagrams and quick reference sheets&#10;Six exciting scenarios and one boring one.&#10;A physics model that simulates the effects of gravity, engine power, high energy manouvers.&#10;A campaign game that rewards skillful pilots&#10;Take offs!&#10;Landings!&#10;Prangings!&#10;Collisions!&#10;Gongs!&#10;Random Events!&#10;A huge list of literally hundreds of WW2 and interwar aircraft.Evrything from the mundane to the mad with more on the way!&#10;Support via email and forums&#10;Clouds&#10;Flack&#10;Bombing&#10;Pilots personal skill&#10;Idiosyncratic Aircraft that behave like their real life counterparts! Except in model form! if its a avro Manchester, it will handle like slop and struggle at altitude, its engines will also overheat!&#10;Updates to new kites and scenarios as and when I get round to doing em.&#10;This is a truely epic set of WW2 rules and is set to become the benchmark for Air Combat games. it is designed for 1/144 or 1/72 scale aircraft and a dogfight is easily playable in 30 mins. Multiplane fights are easily fought to a conclusion in a hour.&#10;&#10;The Luftwaffe trained its best pilots in WW2 using these rules.*&#10;&#10;The rules are easy to pick up and play and have plenty of examples. in fact, you start off at RAF Debden where the Sq ldr will take you through your first flight.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Not actually true&#10;&#10;&#10;Dust off your old airfix kits or FOW 1/144 planes and put in an order to Topgunmarketing for some flightstands.&#10;&#10;Chocks Away!&#10;&#10;",

All the games are compatible -- and they can be used to trace the evolution of tactics over the course of history from 3000 B.C. to 1550 A.D. Each game in the series covers a segment of the period, and presents the tactical situations faced by leaders of the great battles of the period.&#10;&#10;User Notes:&#10;The five (5) separate games included in the hard to find PRESTAGS Master-Pack are: &quot;CHARIOT: Tactical Warfare in the &#039;Biblical&#039; Age, 3000-500BC&quot;; &quot;SPARTAN: Tactical Warfare in the Hellenistic Age, 500-100BC&quot;; &quot;LEGION: Tactical Warfare in the Roman Age, 100BC-700AD&quot;; &quot;VIKING: Tactical Warfare in the Dark Ages, 700-1300&quot; and &quot;YEOMAN: Tactical Warfare in the Renaissance Age, 1250-1550&quot;. Each game in the pack comes with 400 counters, so the full set contains a whopping 2000 counters. The set is comprised of not one, but two SPI flat packs, along with maps and rules for each game, and with PRESTAGS rules that cover the full series. All the sets are compatible, or as the back of the box states, &quot;Because the strength values of the the units were all derived from the same base, units from one game are entirely compatible with another.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The final chapter in the destruction of  Third Reich began on April when  Stalin unleashed the brutal power of  20 armies, 6,300 tanks and 8,500 aircraft  with the objective  of  crushing  German  resistance and  capturing  Berlin.  The depleted  German forces put  up a stiff  defense, initially  repelling the  attacking Russians, but  ultimately succumbing to  overwhelming  force. The  Soviet army  surrounded the city  slowly tightening its stranglehold on the remaining defenders. Fighting street-to-street and house-to-house, Russian troops blasted their way towards the city's center.&#10;Game&rsquo;s Goal&#10;The Soviet army must reach the Reichstag and defeat the defending German troops at that area by outnumbering them by at least 2 to 1.

The glamour, mystique and courage of the battle of Britain is brought to life in this elegant design of that great campaign that marked the end of the beginning of the greatest Conflict in History. Take command of the German or Commonwealth air fleets as you battle it out over the skies of London and England desperately trying to save your country from destruction from the sky.&#10;&#10;Battle for Britain is a stand alone boxed game that is fast paced, easy to learn but tough to master game covering the entire air war over Britain during those critical months of August and September 1940 when the world held its breath as to the outcome. Containing a unique hidden movement system, a wide variety of units and a rich array of strategic detail, Battle for Britain gives you everything you need to re-fight the greatest air battle in history. Can Germany knock out England&rsquo;s air defences preparatory to an invasion of the plucky little island or can England repel the Nazi sky hordes and begin preparing for the time when she can return democracy to Europe?

If a Kurzschluss shows up all cards of that turn are lost and placed face down under the stack together with the Kurzschluss. Instead of revealing new cards the active player may exchange a card from his hand with a higher valued cards from the open cards of the same category.&#10;&#10;Round ends when a player collects one hint from each category.

(RL!) is the seventh volume of Red Sash Games' Lace Wars series, and opens a new subject, the Nine Years War, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg, Toward the end of the 17th Century, at a time when Europe is consumed by war, the powerful Catholic dynasty of the Habsburgs, and the Pope, have formed an unnatural league with the Protestant states of northern Germany, and with the Prince of Orange, de facto ruler of the Netherlands, against their coreligionists, the French. They oppose the overweening ambitions of the Sun King, Louis XIV. To augment the strength of the League, William, Prince of Orange, has taken advantage of popular dissatisfaction with his father-in-law, King James II, to engineer an armed coup and take over the government of England. This will help fill the coffers of the League and ensure that England does not ally with France.&#10;&#10;But the English throne brings with it the governance of Scotland and of Ireland. While some in these countries welcome the Glorious Revolution, many do not. Especially is this so in Ireland, where a small Protestant minority lords it over a helot population of Irish and Anglo-Irish Catholics - an Ascendancy secured only a generation before by the swords of Oliver Cromwell's men and still maintained by force of arms and by force of English Law. In the last years of King James' rule, his Deputy, Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnel, has worked hard to overturn this Cromwellian Settlement, stuffing the Administration and the Army with Catholics. The Protestants are afraid.&#10;&#10;King James, abandoned by many that he trusted, including his own family, suffers a nervous breakdown and leaves England for France, determined to devote the rest of his life to religious pursuits. But his cousin, King Louis, points to Ireland as a place where a fallen monarch may retrieve his fortunes. Tyrconnel and the new Irish Army, and a picked brigade of veteran French, will enable James to drive his son-in-law from the British Isles - and incidentally, force Dutch Billy to withdraw much of his army from the Low Countries, where the French hope to gain much in the next few campaigns. The last Irish &quot;rebellion&quot; lasted eleven years....&#10;&#10;",

There are five resources that are farmed by all players throughout the game. Players collectively keep track of plagues which eventually end the game. Aside from the seven resource dice, there are three speculation dice which allow players to increase the amount of dice they roll each turn and to modify the results of their dice. Scoring is done as in Nile the card game where your score is equal to the resource of which you have the least.&#10;&#10;One major difference in Nile: the Dice Game from the original card game is the solo option. In a solo game you are challenging an invisible player whose score increases as you go.&#10;&#10;Nile: the Dice Game is fast (10 - 20 minutes), easy to learn, easy to setup and put away, and best of all... FREE!! (at least for now).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Published by Forerunner Publishing a division of Friends of the Bridegroom, Inc, Omega the End Times Board Game is a game of knowledge (trivia question and answer) based on biblical eschatology. Trivia questions are based on knowledge of certain books of the New King James bible, such as Daniel, Matthew, and the Book of Revelation.&#10;&#10;The board contains six colored tracks that extend from left to right along the rectangular game board. Each colored track corresponds to six colored playing pieces. Each player selects a colored playing piece and places it on the track.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the player gets an opportunity to answer a trivia card question. If answered correctly, the player moves forward along the track and they get to draw special &quot;oil&quot; or &quot;crown&quot; cards that count for victory points at game end. The tracks have certain phases which represent passage of time. For example, the left most track section is the present, the middle of the track corresponds to the &quot;tribulation period&quot;, the end of the track corresponds to the &quot;millennium&quot;, etc.. The first player to reach a time-based stage causes all other players to immediately move forward to that stage.&#10;&#10;In order to win the game, a player must answer questions correctly allowing them changes to collect oil and crown cards that are worth points. When a player reaches the final stage of the track, all players get one more turn. Then card-points are added up to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;It is an educational game focused on the escatolagical teachings of Friends of the Bridegroom, Inc, AKA International House of Prayer, located in Kansas City.&#10;&#10;",

When you play this card, that character moves one space to the center. But there are influences between characters - water tames fire and so on, so when you play fire, fire character moves one space forward, but another two characters move too - one forward and one backward. These influences are nicely shown on the board.&#10;When first of kiumbis reaches the centre the game ends and who has supported this character wins. Game can also end sooner, when somebody guesses another players secret favorit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spaceport Criminal Escape is a cooperative game, set on a planetary space station far into the future. &#10;During the game players become one of earth&rsquo;s most wanted criminals (a thief, forger, hacker, smuggler and assassin) who are attempting to flee earth to avoid trial. In order to escape they must purchase a ticket to board an outbound ship. At the same time they must avoid being recognised and arrested by the station&rsquo;s patrols.&#10;&#10;During the game the players move around the station attempting to collect enough money in order to purchase a ticket to escape, with each character having its own way to do so e.g. The thief steals wallets while at luggage stations while the hacker steals money from currency terminals (ATMs). Once a player has enough money to escape they purchase a ticket from the ticket office and move to the embarkation area where they become &ldquo;Safe&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;",

The Greeks had a word for it, Deipnosophy, from the words Deipnon - dinner, and Sophist - wise man, which when combined mean Skilled in Dining and Table Talk!&#10;&#10;Stimulating and fun to play, this gourmet After-Dinner Game combines Luck, Skill &amp; Team Strategy to win.&#10;&#10;-(from the box cover)&#10;&#10;&quot;Table Talk&quot; is a food-related trivia game. Each team receives a &quot;Menu&quot; of 600 questions and answers, and appoints a &quot;Chef&quot; (team captain) to ask the questions of the opposing team, operate the timer, record the score, etc. Each chef, in turn, will ask successive players on the opposing team a question: if the team confers (answering &quot;Table d'h&ocirc;te&quot;) and answer correctly, they score a point; however, if the player asked chooses to answer without conferring with his teammates (&quot;&Agrave; la carte&quot;), a correct answer scores 2 points.&#10;&#10;Each page of the Menu provides questions in the following categories, in order: Starters; Main Course; Side Dishes; Desserts, Savouries &amp; Cheese Board; Wine List; and Culinary Trivia - &quot;Table Talk&quot;. Questions must be asked in the order they appear in the Menu: players do not have a choice of the category of the question. Note: A number of culinary anecdotes (&quot;Jokers&quot;) have been randomly inserted in place of a question; a player who receives a Joker scores a point without having to answer a question.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for 4-12 players, split into two teams.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;     2 Menus, each containing 600 questions (1200 total) and the rules&#10;     2 coloured page clips - one for each Menu - to mark the current question&#10;     2 score indicators&#10;     2 score indicator stands&#10;     Egg timer&#10;&#10;&#10;-(user summary)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game consists of 20 pieces, all of which are differently shaped. There are several suggestions for solitaire puzzles, but also a multiplayer game idea:&#10;&#10;An architect and a master builder are chosen from among the players. The other players are builders. The master builder choses a piece as the base, the architect adds another piece on top of it (the pieces are interlocking). Then all players take turns adding another piece. The &quot;building&quot; has to remain stable and it is not allowed to block the next player. The players may hold the building while adding their piece; when they think it is stable they let go. If it collapses, the player who caused that is penalized, so is the architect. If all pieces are used up, all players get points with the architect getting a bonus. Several rounds are played and points are noted. When the players decide to end the game, the player with most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are several versions of this game, using different materials: wood, aluminum etc.&#10;&#10;",
