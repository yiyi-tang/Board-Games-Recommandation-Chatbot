Together, these ragtag groups of recruits become Rebel Troopers, carrying out the fight against the Empire on dozens of worlds across the galaxy. The Rebel Trooper is well-used to embarking on stealthy missions, and above all, they've learned to trust the other soldiers in their squad with their lives.&#10;&#10;The Star Wars: Legion &ndash; Rebel Troopers Unit Expansion features a full unit of seven Rebel Trooper miniatures, identical to the Rebel Troopers included in the Star Wars: Legion Core Set. This expansion also includes the unit card and an assortment of upgrade cards, inviting you to kit out your Rebel Troopers for any battlefield scenario.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The ships are of different sizes represented by the number of their masts.&#10;&#10;A ship can take (destroy) an enemy ship of the same or smaller size and can move a number of points on the map based on its size (big ships move less than the smaller ones).  If a ship has other ships on points surrounding it, it is considered protected and cannot be taken.&#10;&#10;The units are flats and appear to be hand painted.  The Flagship of the Hanseatic league is the &quot;Colorful Cow&quot; and the pirate's Flagship is called the &quot;Sea Wolf&quot;. Both Flagships move and attack with a range of 1 but can take out all ships including each other. Victory is determined in multiple ways related to which ships have been lost.&#10;&#10;A truly amazing game from the late 1930s.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The world&rsquo;s mightiest heroes, sinister villains and mercenaries have all mobilized and are searching for magical relics that have the power to stop or advance the looming events. Krahgen is entering perilous times and it is going to take a coalition of heroes to save the world from the incoming threats. &#10;Lords of the Motleyverse is a 2-4 player, tactical, miniatures and dice skirmish game where players control squads of unique characters fighting for supremacy over treacherous battlefields. Every faction has a distinctive play style and every hero and villain is loaded with its own set of potent abilities. The game has ten built in scenarios and three different modes of play: Slaughter Box, King of the Arena and a Campaign mode. The object of the game is simple, destroy your opponents, collect relics, and be the last faction remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;The combat system is built around rolling dice and creating attack sequences from the results. The attacking player rolls five dice and lines them up from left to right to create an attack sequence and the defending player must match the dice facings in the exact order that the dice are arranged, in three rolls or less. Each unblocked facing on the dice inflicts damage and most importantly determines the direction which enemy models are pushed. Learning to optimize your dice combinations and utilizing the layout of the board is the key to victory.&#10;&#10;The game features a randomized activation order that tends to create high risk, high reward situations and continuously opens fresh avenues for new tactics and strategies. The arena is full of danger and players must pay heed to the terrain itself. Mobile saw blades, pits, spikes and man eating Skull Columns litter the field and have the capability to inflict massive amounts of damage.&#10;&#10;Lords of the Motleyverse is a dynamic game of conflict and perseverance, packed full of action and mayhem, and designed to excel at casual and tournament play alike. The unpredictable activation order, specialized character abilities, vicious terrain features and ever changing circumstances guarantee that no game is ever the same.&#10;&#10;",

In both cases landing on a red star along the path may lead to a penalty or bonus.&#10;&#10;The graphics between both version also has considerable differences, with the later version showing rockets along the course and the early version having hangers for the biplane playing pieces. The boards were informative for the players by having facts on all the celestial bodies known at that time&#10;&#10;",

It allegedly glows in the dark.&#10;&#10;To use the Astral Acolyte in the game, all players must agree.&#10;&#10;How to Place the Astral Acolyte:&#10;At the end of the first Doom Phase, the First Player takes and places the Astral Acolyte in any Area that has no other Units. (If no such Area exists, do not place the Astral Acolyte this game.)&#10;&#10;How to use the Astral Acolyte:&#10;The Astral Acolyte cannot be Captured, Eliminated, or targeted in Battle. It does not receive Pains or Kills, and is functionally immortal. It cannot be targeted by any Spellbooks or abilities, even beneficial ones from its own Controller.&#10;&#10;If the Astral Acolyte is in an Area containing a Gate, it must always be placed on top of the Gate, automatically replacing any other Unit on that Gate. While a player Controls the Astral Acolyte, he or she gains the benefit of any Gate the Astral Acolyte Controls: earns Power and Doom from the Astral Acolyte and its Controlled Gate, can Move it in a normal Move Action, and can Summon Monsters, etc., using that Controlled Gate.&#10;&#10;How to Control the Astral Acolyte:&#10;The Astral Acolyte is under the Control of the player with the highest-ranking Unit in the Area. Units rank as follows (1 being the highest): &#10;1. Faction Great Old One&#10;2. Independent Great Old One&#10;3. Terror&#10;4. Monster&#10;5. Cultist&#10;&#10;If no other Units are in its Area, or if there is a tie between ranked Units in the Area, no player Controls the Astral Acolyte. If the Astral Acolyte is not Controlled, that Gate is NOT considered Abandoned, and therefore gives no Power to any player during Gather Power. When not Controlled, it stays on top of a Gate if one is there, and cannot be removed. It is ignored in Battle, and unaffected by any Spellbooks or abilities as normal.&#10;&#10;When an Astral Acolyte Moves, its Controller can change at once. If the Astral Acolyte or other Units in the Area Move, it may switch Control or become Uncontrolled at the end of that Action.&#10;&#10;This promo figure was released in Game Trade Magazine issue 213 (November 2017).&#10;&#10;An additional transparent Acolyte was included in Game Trade Magazine issue 215 (January 2018).&#10;&#10;",

The cassette must be played from start to finish through the game without pausing or stopping. When somebody is talking on the cassette, play stops while the players listen to the instructions. Otherwise the players roll the die and move in turn. On the map grid there are octopus squares that the players must avoid while trying to reach the Aleutian Islands where they can collect different types of cargo. The player then has to return the cargo to their home port to earn points depending on the type of cargo. The Nautilus is also moving around the board based on instructions spoken by Captain Nemo on the cassette. If this lands on or passes over a players ship, that ship has to return to the home port.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player to accumulate the highest cargo value when the cassette ends.&#10;&#10;",

There are 6 types of counters: beat (1 hand), beat (2 hands), clap, silence (pause), finger snap and shouting &quot;Ol&eacute;&quot;. Six counters are randomly inserted. The spinner decides where to start the cycle. So 1 cycle could be beat(1)-beat(1)-&quot;Ol&eacute;&quot;-snap-beat(2)-beat(1)-clap. &#10;All the players together now have to perform this. When 1 makes a mistake or doesn't keep the beat with the rest, he's out. The rest continues till 1 is left. He chooses 1 counter, removes it and replaces it with a random new one. &#10;Game ends when 1 player has collected 6 counters.&#10;&#10;Players should use the box as drum.

They all bring their toys, and start bragging and stealing them from each other. You must share your stolen toys with your pals, but there's the rub: each toy is valued differently for all your pals. And if they're not content, they'll just say no!&#10;&#10;How much can you handle this unfairness? How will you share your toys?&#10;&#10;",

Next, pick the Guy you're going to flirt with. It can be a different Guy than the one you peeked at. Finally, play by rolling the dice. If your roll is high enough, congratulations! You get the Wiener! Guys who like your character's Traits have easier rolls for you, so peek and pick carefully!&#10;&#10;The game is over when there are no Wieners left to grab. Only your highest Wiener gets scored. All other Wieners are worth +1 inch regardless of their size. Whoever has the most total inches of victory wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tala is a well-balanced native american warrior aided by the animal spirits in nature. She has a very unique ability on her character card which allows her to increase the utility in each of her attacks. The core of Tala's playstyle comes from her ability to be able to add secondary effects from her fighter cards to any cards she plays. This provides her with two significant advantages: first, adding more secondary effects obviously can make cards stronger in new unpredictable ways, second, she can change an action&rsquo;s effect after revealing them, allowing her to react appropriately to an unexpected turn of events. All of her fighter actions will be sure to find a use one way or another. Her mode Totemic Strength and her block, both compliment her playstyle, by allowing her to dig for fighter cards in her deck and return those that she has discarded. Due to the decisions that are presented when determining to discard cards for their effect or holding on to them to be used as an action, Tala is somewhat harder to master than the other fighters.&#10;&#10;Victoria is a british-born aristocrat adopted into a clan of assassins, and currently Severina&rsquo;s most trusted advisor. With three soft style techniques to choose from, Victoria is speed and grace incarnate. The ability on her character card compliments the strong combo heavy nature of the soft style. Her psychic energy shurikens and kunai, along with the use of chi techniques, gives her just the right amount of ranged control. Moreover, her Kawarimi Block and Flickering Image actions give her the Traverse effect allowing her to instantly escape move or vanish, in a true ninja fashion. Her origins can be shown in Noblesse Oblige, which can double as a second copy of the Initiative Card, and Spiffing Kick is a brutally painful attack that will deplete your opponent's hand. Her truly special attack is Touch of Death, a very close limited but deadly attack.&#10;&#10;The Tala vs Victoria Fighter Pack also comes with two sets of actions. The Pain technique from the Soft style is composed of a subtle array of options around the Trash effect, denying your opponent that perfect hand. The Internal technique from the Chi style brings more denial and versatility, along with high and low blasts, to any chi fighter&rsquo;s deck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, this rule does not apply if you are multiplying or dividing by the number 1&#10;- a double digit number (e.g., 78) scores 3 points (2 for the 7 + 1 for the 8), a three digit number (e.g., 678) scores 6 (3 for the 6 + 2 for the 7 + 1 for the 8) and so on&#10;- 1 bonus point for using 12 dice&#10;- 2 bonus points for using all 13 dice&#10;&#10;GAME N.1 - ONE BY ONE&#10;Each player throws all the dice in turns (clockwise).&#10;There is a target score to win.&#10;&#10;GAME N.2 - ALL TOGETHER&#10;Each player needs a sheet of paper and a pen.&#10;The 13 dice are all thrown and left on the table in clear view of all the players. The dice must not be moved.&#10;Each player makes the longest possible equation with the numbers and operations, and writes it on his/her paper.&#10;There is a target score to win.&#10;&#10;GAME N.3 - THE LAST DIE&#10;The first player throws all 13 dice and makes an equation with the numbers and operations, moving them around to try and use as many dice as possible. When he/she has finished, it is then the turn of the player on his/her left, who throws only the dice not used for the first player&rsquo;s equation, and tries to make a new equation using at least one new die. The dice used in the initial equation cannot be changed, but can be rearranged to make the new equation.&#10;The round continues with fewer dice at each throw, until the player throwing the dice is unable to add any new ones.&#10;The last person to add a die to the equation wins the round and is awarded 1 point.&#10;A new round starts with a new throw of all the dice.&#10;There is a target score to win.&#10;&#10;GAME N.4 - YAHTZEE&#10;The 5 combinations to achieve are:&#10;- Blue: the equation contains at least 3 blue dice (with 4 blue dice, you get 3 bonus points).&#10;- Green: same as Blue, but with green dice&#10;- Red: same as Blue, but with red dice&#10;- Poker: the equation contains 4 dice of the same colour&#10;- 101: there is a number greater than 100&#10;&#10;",

Some hewed to the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty; most did not.  The designs range from heavily-armored ships with 15-inch guns to unusual heavy cruisers with 8-inch main batteries.

'Unstable' (also 'Foal Play' and various other equestrian puns) was created on audience suggestions (horses, unstable relationships, mind control, area control, 'Animal Farm') and then condensed into a tabletop board game to be added to the PAX Aus Tabletop Library (and in print-and-play through BGG).&#10;&#10;In Unstable, a game for 2-4 players, players split into two teams. Each turn, players all draw one Hay, Water and Equus (Love) card. They then draw an additional card of any type matching a territory they control. Each of these card types has one of four actions on it (Breed, Attack, Gallop or &quot;Turn into Glue&quot;). After drawing, and without being allowed to speak to each other, players place up to three cards facedown in front of them and then reveal and action those cards one at a time. If teammates both reveal the same action, they get a bonus.&#10;&#10;So, you must mind-meld with your partner, control the board, and collect up to 20 horseshoes to win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

[The art was made by the students of the &lsquo;International School of Illustration&rsquo; of Sarmede (Treviso, Italy)]. It also includes 24 &lsquo;obligation cards&rsquo; and a table board with an &lsquo;inspirations path&rsquo; on it. During the game, all players will contribute to create a story that will be both personal and collective at the same time: it will talk about each one with the contribution of everyone.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a simple game in its mechanics - with a short learning time thus allowing to start playing right away - but complex enough to keep the attention and involvement - even emotional - of the players.&#10;&#10;The game consists of five phases plus the ending. Each phase corresponds to a narrative stage: beginning, purpose, hindrance, overcoming, achievement and ending.&#10;&#10;Each phase consists of several turns whose number depends on the initial choice, made by the players, between short story, novella and novel.&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;Each &lsquo;inspiration card&rsquo; shows four elements: a rule, an illustration, &lsquo;words in freedom&rsquo; and either &lsquo;hidden truths&rsquo; or &lsquo;suggestions&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;These elements will encourage the players to find inspiration in their imagination or in their everyday life, to enrich the story with episodes and anecdotes, thus making the narrative structure more fascinating to all participants.&#10;&#10;The writer's block flips one card: at the end of each turn starting from Phase 2 &quot;Purpose&quot;; when players make a mistake; if stated by the drawn obligation card; if players choose to discard an obligation card on the board.&#10;&#10;If the writer's block flips all the cards played until that moment, the game is over, the players have lost.&#10;&#10;If, instead, the players reach the final slot &quot;Ending&quot; without the writer's block reaching them, they won collectively.&#10;&#10;",

It can be played in four ways: Match Play (single pack), Tournament Play (multiple packs), Power Play (head-to-head), or Single Play (solitaire). All versions use a Master Deck of 60 original cards.&#10;&#10;There are four kinds of cards: Character Cards, Power Cards, Special Ability Cards, and Opportunity Cards. Booster Cards are also available. The object of the game is to defeat all your opponent's Character Cards by gaining powers and special abilities. Two players challenge each other to a duel with dice until no challengers are left standing.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to clear your opponent&rsquo;s battlefield of all Character Cards. A battlefield consists of one Leader and up to three Guards. When a player&rsquo;s Character Cards on the battlefield have been eliminated, that player is out of the game. The last remaining player is the winner.&#10;&#10;Play begins by shuffling the cards of the Master Deck. Deal four cards. Arrange these cards on the table so that there is one in front of three cards. Next, deal four cards to each player. The remaining cards become the Draw Pile. If the Draw Pile is empty, shuffle the Discard pile and create a new Draw pile. Turns the four cards on the table face up.&#10;&#10;On each turn, do one of the following options: place a Character Card on the board, draw a card from the Draw Pile, add a Power Card to any Character Card, add a Special Ability to any Character Card, play an Opportunity Card, initiate a Challenge, or pass.&#10;&#10;With the use of dice, players challenge each other to battles. A player is eliminated if all their Character Cards have been defeated. The last remaining player is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Austerlitz, more than perhaps any event, established the Napoleonic legend, and preserved a nascent French Empire for another decade.  It remains as important an event as any in the history of the French.&#10;&#10;The game is on six 22&rdquo; by 32&rdquo; maps. The game also features over a thousand full-color counters; a commemorative disc that has nearly a hundred pages of rules,  10 scenarios, articles and player aids; and various charts. An alternate allows you to play the entire battle by interconnected scenarios.&#10;&#10;In addition, La Bataille d&rsquo;Austerlitz 1805 developed by utilizing much more recent research regarding orders of battle; the geography of the area reflecting as it actually was in 1805; and the growth of technology providing a superior graphic product of unit counters; maps and other playing components.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Potlatch, the game, is a strategic, educational card game based on indigenous philosophies. It is designed to meet Washington's K-12 educational standards for teaching about native history, economics, culture, and government. The game was developed as a community effort with local elders and language experts. The game is written in both English and Lushootseed, the indigenous language of the Salish Pacific Northwest. Game mechanics are based on sharing resources to meet other players&rsquo; needs for food, materials, technology, and knowledge.&#10;&#10;This is a collaborative game where there is not one winner. Success is determined by whether or not all houses have their resource needs met by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is named for the Potlatch, which is a ceremonial distribution and re-distribution of resources, property, food, knowledge, and wealth with the purpose of affirming social status via the historic economic systems of subsistence, prestige, and sharing. Potlatching is practiced by indigenous peoples of the Pacific NW coast of the U.S. and Canada. Historically it supported a large socio-economic system to maintain a high level of food production and to equalize food accessibility. Individuals, families, or communities host potlatches and planning takes a year or more. Skagit elder and historian, Vi Hilbert, wrote &ldquo;Public acts of distributing valuables to guests were the ultimate confirmation of a host&rsquo;s achievements and personal high-status in their family and community.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to make the work items finish as soon as possible at the end space. A lot of set-backs will appear on cards drawn from a deck. The set-backs have names that people within the software development are familiar with.&#10;The cooperative game is won if the group manages to overcome all the trouble caused by the event cards, by choosing from the development cards and implement them in a proper order.&#10;In each turn the players make up a short-term plan for which developments to go for, and which work items to progress. There are dice used for progress during the &quot;testing phase&quot;, the middle part of the track where the work items can be stuck if the group has bad luck.&#10;&quot;Continuous Delivery - The Game&quot; is a cooperative board game for 3-5 players who together will try to transform a traditional software development way of working into a Continuous Delivery pipeline.&#10;Each player represents a department, for instance Development, Test or Operations. Together they can discuss and plan how to improve the software development process.&#10;The goal of this game is to create awareness of what implementing Continuous Delivery can be about. This game can be played by anyone and does not require any prior knowledge or experience of Continuous Delivery.&#10;&quot;Continuous Delivery - The Game&quot; is the first of its kind and unique in how it mixes the fun of a board game and the teachings&#10;of Continuous Delivery.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As described on the box, Vir Sivir's Ramayana - The Game is played to find Rama using the locations of the Ramayana epic on a map of India. The purpose of the game is to allow the player to learn and understand the Ramayana in an easier format. The game can also be played at three different difficulty levels based on the player's gaming abilities.&#10;&#10;The game play in general will have the players starting in different locations in India. They will have event cards that each represent an event that happens to Rama, and the location that they occurred in. Players will roll a special pair of dice to determine where on the board they can movie. Depending on the roll and the space they are on, they may also be able to draw special boon cards. Once a player is in one of the map locations, they may discard one event card corresponding to that location, and can play more than one event if they also discard a boon. Players who previously played an event card at the same location must pick their cards back up, but can avoid this by playing a boon. The first player to discard all of their cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;The higher levels of game play will introduce a mystery event, where players have to deduce the mystery event by noting which events other players have played. Players also may ask the other players if they have event cards corresponding to the locations they are on to place in front of themselves. Once a player has seven event cards in front of them, they may see if they've correctly deduced the card...either winning the game, or being eliminated/receiving penalties. Boon cards now also have added abilities that will allow players to block paths of movement on the board, prevent players from asking for others' cards, or blocking others' card abilities. Players must also now discard boon cards as an entry fee into the event locations.&#10;&#10;The highest level of game play also introduces the Kodanda spinner (named after Rama's legendary bow). Each player will be designated as day, night, or twilight depending on their start space. The spinner must be spun at the start of each turn, changing the balance of power for each player, allowing them to roll an extra die or collect extra boons, or causing them to roll one less die and being unable to collect boons or even reveal their mystery event deduction.&#10;&#10;",
