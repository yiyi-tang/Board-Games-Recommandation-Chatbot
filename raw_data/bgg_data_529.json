The game ends when all pieces (tiles) are placed or discarded.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game is played on an 8x8 grid. A custom deck of cards and a set of tiles both depict monuments, buildings, and locations. There is a corresponding tile for every card. A random selection of cards are placed face up and the players take turn choosing cards. Once all the cards have been chosen, the players gather the pieces corresponding to their cards and take turn placing tiles on the board.&#10;&#10;Points can be earned each time a tile is placed. The number of points depends on several factors, including the number of spaces adjacent to the tile which are occupied and whether there are plazas or causeways adjacent to the tile. Points are also earned for surrounding other tiles and filling in zones of the board.&#10;&#10;",

With this Scepter you will be able to rule the kingdom, which will stave off the boredom for a while at least. Unfortunately, some of your &quot;workmates&quot; have had the same idea (talk about coincidence), so it is a race against each other to find the keys and rule your own destiny... or at least kill a few hours in the most violent ways possible.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Winning: There are six magical keys in the artifact deck.

Spend your autumns and winters around the Mediterranean, your summers by the Baltic coast and your springs in Central Europe.&#10;&#10;Travel by your own railroads or pay the other players to use theirs. Set your ticket prices high to squeeze out profits or low to undercut competitors. If you can't find a cheap train ticket, then you can always go by airplane, in which case you might contribute to global warming. Global warming makes the Southernmost cities unattractive, while new holiday destinations pop up in the far North.&#10;&#10;Will you bet on a bright future and invest in ferry lines to the sunny islands of the South? Or will you defy the icy emptiness of the North and then keep prices high to make people fly and tilt the climate in your favor?&#10;&#10;Nice Weather is a relatively fast and family-friendly track building game with a foundation of logical thinking paired with prisoner's dilemma-like pricing diplomacy and livened up by random action cards that lets you set hilarious traps. But amidst the easy and fun, the experienced player will inhale a strong breeze of Go as the network struggle scatters among a dozen frontiers that suddenly merge to one final whole, making the player with the most well-oiled micro-macro mental elevator the winner.&#10;&#10;Dynamic land prices let you buy up cheap competing lines, allowing for a randomized yet balanced game board; for each game, 6-12 European cities out of 28 are randomly selected, making for up to 36000 different start configurations. Then there is always Essen, and this is where you start the game; in October 2008 to be exact.&#10;&#10;",

That card is called, of course, a &quot;Weapon of M*A*S Destruction&quot; (we warned you).&#10;&#10;That is a very powerful card, so before you are allowed to play it, you must announce it.  If opponent has a Search card, he gets to search some of your cards to try to find it and remove it.  The search card is called, of course, a &quot;Search for Weapon of M*A*S Destruction&quot; card. Cute.&#10;&#10;The search mechanics are interesting.  Players play to win battles and gain Respect Points.  When you find Weapons of M*A*S Destruction, you might gain respect (depending on which search card you have).  When you don't find Weapons of M*A*S Destruction (depending on the card) you could &quot;lose all your Respect.&quot;  (ok, no more puns).&#10;&#10;Players take turns attacking, choosing between 3 types of attacks.  Each  card has a &quot;weak spot&quot; on it.  During one phase of the game players try to name the weak spot of opponent's M*A*S -- If they do it is destroyed.  (These &quot;shots&quot; at opponent's cards are called &quot;long shots&quot;).   Battles are usually &quot;2 on 2&quot; with extra &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;search&quot; cards.  Cards are awarded to each player based on rules, mostly &quot;who won the attack?&quot;&#10;&#10;There is a Draw Phase, a &quot;Deploy &amp; Destroy phase&quot; a &quot;Long Shot&quot; Phase, and an&#10;&quot;Attack&quot; Phase.  After the Draw Phase, each of the 3 remaing phases provides &#10;interesting and different types of action.

A volunteer army, comprised mainly of hardened Civil War veterans, was established for the purpose of an invasion of Canada. The Fenians reasoned that territory seized from British controlled Canada could be bartered for Irish independence. Army of Ireland is a tactical level recreation of the historically significant Battle of Ridgeway, where encroaching Fenians clashed with spirited Canadian militia in what is now Ontario. Colorful counters, a detailed hexmap, and other components provide everything needed to re-fight this conflict which was to have a profound influence on Canadian history.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The White Squadron is a set-building card game similar to the children's game &quot;Fish&quot; or &quot;Go Fish.&quot;&#10;&#10;The 52 cards in the deck depict warships of the U.S. Navy around the turn of the century. It was evidently printed in many editions because at least one copy seems to date from about 1919 based on the ships depicted, even though the original copyright date is 1896.&#10;&#10;The ships are divided into &quot;fleets&quot; of four similar ships, mostly historical class sister ships ranking from &quot;A&quot; through &quot;M&quot; with each ship in the fleet numbered from &quot;1&quot; though &quot;4.&quot;&#10;&#10;For example, the &quot;A&quot; fleet comprises the battleships Oklahoma, Nevada, New York and Texas. The &quot;M&quot; fleet comprises the submarines Plunger, Porpoise, Shark and Moccasin.&#10;&#10;Each card lists its identifying number &quot;A-1, M-4&quot;; the name of the ship in larger type with the sister ships in smaller type; a photograph or drawing of the ship and a three-line description.&#10;&#10;For example, the Plunger's description reads: &quot;PLUNGER -- Submarine torpedo boat. Holland type, operated by gasoline when in the surface and electricuty when submerged. 63 feet long. Has 3 14-inch Whitehead torpedoes for sub-sea attack.&quot;&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to collect &quot;fleets&quot; of four cards with the winner being the player with the most &quot;fleets&quot; at the end of play.&#10;&#10;Five cards are dealt to each player with the surplus forming a common draw pile.&#10;&#10;The player to the dealer's left begins by asking any one player for a specific card . For example, &quot;Do you have H-3 Massachusetts?&quot; If the player has the card he must give it to the caller, who can then ask for another card from anyone around the table.&#10;&#10;If the targeted player doesn't have the card, then the caller must draw one card from the draw pile and play passes to the left.&#10;&#10;Once four cards in the same fleet are collected the player paces them down on the table face up.&#10;&#10;If a player has no cards then he is entitled to draw two cards from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;Once the draw pile is exhausted, play continues with the cards in hand only until all the fleets are formed.&#10;&#10;The rules don't say, but presumably players who have no cards and can't draw from the draw pile can still continue to play and acquire cards for a fleet, although they would be vulnerable to poaching from other players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the DG website:&#10;&#10;Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory (NEW), aka Glory, has been moved back to new status due to an exciting development. The designer has added two new elements to the game that will make this a truly unique ACW game. First, he is adding Manifest Destiny, a Mexican-American War mini-game that will serve as an introductory scenario. This short campaign will give new players an excellent place to start playing and veteran players will have a game that can be finished in an evening. The second element is Crisis &amp; Compromise, a card play oriented game of the period from the end of the Mexican-American War to the start of the Civil War. Though little combat occurs (guerrilla warfare in Kansas, etc.), the card play covers the actions inspiring events, leaders and regional positions (Border States) that affect the allegiance of states to a region and the ability of military leaders at the start of the Civil War. Crisis &amp; Compromise can be played alone or used to create alternative starting situations for Glory.&#10;&#10;Glory is a grand strategy game of the American Civil War in the style of Krieg! Maps of the Eastern and Western Theaters include terrain, Strategic Objectives, roads/rail, naval zones, navigable and non-navigable rivers, cities and locales, supply centers and other features affecting the game. Counters represent the corps and armies of the war. Cards provide the strategic-political-economic direction for each side. Strategies are many and varied but the ultimate goal is to demoralize the opposing faction's population through military, economic and political victories while sustaining your own population's will to continue the fight. The players each choose a Strategy Card and an Addendum Card before each new season and may opt to play an additional card as a diplomatic response to certain events. These cards lead to new military units, leaders, and replacement steps and result in socio-economic and political events. The events include the declaration of Emancipation, the elections of 1862 and 1864, and the possible intervention by European nations. Events are often double-edged swords, sometimes providing a military advantage while negatively affecting the popular will to fight. In addition, both sides may attempt to develop and manufacture new technologies, both historical and speculative, such as ironclads, submarines, torpedoes, observation balloons, repeating rifles and Gatling guns. Both sides can introduce espionage and even sabotage, which can have many unexpected consequences, including assassination. Three maps, 352 large counters for Glory and 280 small counters for Manifest Destiny and Crisis &amp; Compromise, 220 cards.&#10;&#10;",
