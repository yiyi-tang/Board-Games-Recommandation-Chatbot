    "Description": "In the cooperative setup, you take on the role of museum creators, working together to put together a grid of museum rooms for a museum of whatever theme you decide as a group. Picking a theme has no mechanical purpose, but the game encourages light roleplaying, so knowing whether you&rsquo;re making a bacon or donut museum helps encourage that. Rooms are things like the gift shop, special exhibit, hands-on exhibit, bathroom, etc&hellip;&#10;&#10;Then you get dealt one of 6 characters: three museum employees (Docent, Janitor, Volunteer) and 3 family members (Grandparent, Parent, Teen). The mechanic involved is age; players and NPC visitors in the museum are either Youth, Adult, or Senior. Of course there are roleplaying opportunities here too.&#10;&#10;Then you get dealt Attribute Cards, basically sets to collect by moving around collecting memory tokens (Education, Bonding, Romance, and Mischief). You&rsquo;ll get to manage your cards by drawing and discarding as the game goes on. It&rsquo;s played over 7 turns, or the 7 hours the museum is open.&#10;&#10;Each turn you have 5 Actions you can do, kept track of by cards you flip over. One Action, the Hour Action, changes each hour to keep things fresh. There are certain conditions that have to be met, involving the number of people in a room and their ages, to collect the memory tokens. The roleplaying charm comes from describing these actions, including what mischievous things you do, as you do them.&#10;&#10;At the end you complete the best sets you can with the tokens you&rsquo;ve collected and add up the points.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Silicon Saga: Wreck of the Andromeda is a sci-fi dungeon crawl/exploration game set aboard the floating wreck of a space research station. Players take on the roles of members of a crew of space marauders looking to strip the station of valuable resources. Unfortunately, the station is not quite as abandoned as they had hoped. They will be faced with lurking dangers and struggling survivors. The goal of the game is to collect a determined amount of silicon from the ship and return to the hanger with the silicon before the game ends. There are variable play modes which allow players to compete against each other or to play cooperatively.&#10;&#10;The game is played on square tiles with players drawing and placing tiles as they explore the ship. Players move and interact by playing cards. The game is broken into rounds with each player drawing a number of cards and performing a number of action during the round. Players take turns, performing actions one at a time. They have a chance to add new cards to their deck or hand each round or to gain additional actions.&#10;&#10;While exploring the Andromeda, players will find resources such as crafting components, ammo, food and their true goal, silicon. They may also find survivors, dangerous threats or face random events. Interaction with survivors or threats are handled through a chit-pull system. Each player has a bag and a set of different markers, each with a different effect. Throughout the game, the cards they play will have them add markers to their bag to form a pool. When interacting with entities, they can play cards that let them draw markers from the pool in an attempt to cause different effects. Players may face hostile encounters or peaceful encounters. Each marker type has a different effect depending on the type of encounter.&#10;&#10;In addition to interacting with entities encountered onboard, players can interact with one another. They can steal from or sabotage other players to take or force them drop any carried silicon.&#10;&#10;Silicon Saga can be played by a group or by a single player. For solo play, the game can be played using the base game mode. The rules will also include additional solo player challenges.&#10;&#10;",

The top card is turned over each round to select the winning colour for the round, and any player that plays a moon card in the matching colour gets the contents of the matching moon pool. The Sun pool is only emptied when a player goes &ldquo;Out with the Sun&rdquo;, when they also get all winnings from all other coins as well.&#10;&#10;",

Players first choose a cop to embody, wielding their unique cop deck to make use of their signature skills and abilities. Then, they&rsquo;ll choose an operation deck, detailing not only the locations where criminal activity is taking place, but also what exactly the criminals are up to and how they win. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll select a criminal deck to go up against, containing both the criminal mastermind behind the caper, as well as the minions they&rsquo;ll unleash against our officers.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The game comes with four different variants makes it a suitable match for different age groups and will work well with Sunday schools, youth groups and other Bible oriented contexts.&#10;&#10;The first edition is published in Swedish in November 2020. If there is interest it may be translated in to other languages as well.&#10;&#10;Bibellinjen is inspired by the game Time line by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Henry.&#10;&#10;Gameplay (standard rules):&#10;Players try to collect points by gaining cards. When it is your turn you deal five cards and place them face up in front of you. You should then try to rearrange the cards so they are placed in the same order that they appear in the Bible. Each card has the name of a Bible book on one side and on the other side there is a number that indicates what order that book has in the Bible. By flipping the cards you can see if the order you settled for is correct or not. If all cards are not in the right order you must remove cards from the sequence until a correct sequence remains. Once that is done you may keep any cards still in front of you. The other cards are discarded to a discard pile which is shuffled into the draw deck when it runs out. The game ends when there are not enough cards in the draw pile to finish the round. The player who collected the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Bibellinjen &auml;r ett enkelt spel som g&aring;r ut p&aring; att l&auml;ra sig ordningen p&aring; Bibelns b&ouml;cker.

Only one is chosen during the Setup.&#10;&#10;The game is divided in four phases, performed in the following order: Expansion, Intrigue, Coronation, and Assassination. During the Expansion Phase the players place Ally Tiles to create a 6x6 grid. During the Intrigue Phase, the players can swap positions of Ally Tiles to enhance the position of their Allies. In the Coronation Phase the Houses gain points, according to the Objective, and the Ruling House is the House with the most points. Then, in the Assassination Phase, the players votes to eliminate the player who they think owns the Regent House.&#10;&#10;The game ends right after the Assassination Phase and the winner is the player that represents the Ruling House, in case the assassination failed; or the player that represents the House with most points among the assassins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Our Emperor asked for new ways to spread terror through the sectors. He engaged the best scientists in the galaxy to design the definitive weapon to defeat the Rebellion: a massive Orbital Station...the Dark Star.&#10;&#10;In DSbuilders, six Koenigs have six cycles to build the station while the galaxy is on fire and a riddle of unpredictable events influences the strategy to follow. If this scenario sounds familiar and you are an agilist, this is your game. The game is based on the assumption that all players have basic knowledge of Agile and Scrum, and a facilitator, like an experienced Agile Coach (or similar), is available.&#10;&#10;In fact, DSbuilders is a team-based, co-operative, serious game on scaling agile teams across organization. The game is played by six teams, each of them with 1 to 8 players, and they have to build all systems of the Dark Star, the new weapon designed to conquer the galaxy.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over six turns, and each turn the teams have to define their work (components to build) considering all constraints (capacity, integrations and dependencies). At the end of each turn, the Emperor (facilitator) defines the short term goal on the basis of the events happening in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;If you fail to achieve any intermediate goal, game over!&#10;If you fail to achieve the final goal, game over!&#10;If you achieve the final goal, you conquer the galaxy!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As new Agile coach you are assigned to 5 squads that are in the middle of their journey to adopt agile.&#10;You have to gain their Trust and increase their Motivation by investing your Time and your Portfolio of skills and tools to create a culture of Collaboration, Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.&#10;&#10;You have 6 months (12 sprints) to make this happen, while squads are facing Antipatterns and eventually Disruptions.&#10;&#10;If the above scenario sounds familiar, this is your game. In fact Agile SyS, Support your Squads) is a solo serious game to simulate the difficulties in the journey to agility for a small team of teams and provide a list of possible solutions that could help the coach (here called &ldquo;The Agent&rdquo;, aka &ldquo;agent of change&rdquo;) to gain the trust of teams (here called &ldquo;Squads&rdquo;) he is working with.&#10;&#10;Main goal of the Agent is to achieve highest level of trusts with squads while improving skills and tools that help also to face common wrong behaviours happening in squads. Time is the &ldquo;money&rdquo; of the game: player is often in the position not to have enough time to gain skills and tools, time to spend in actions, or time to achieve results, because the game ends in 12 rounds.&#10;&#10;Agile Sys, has been designed in lockdown time for one player, however you can merge 2 or more decks and play the game with other Agents. This configuration is ideal to understand scaling in large organisation where different coaches are working together in the same program or business function.&#10;&#10;",

The game is in English and Japanese.&#10;&#10;You are in the movie theatre, but the sound effects have disappeared. So you must make the sounds yourself! Did the vase break? Did you get in the time machine? What kind of sound do you hear then?&#10;&#10;It's a game where you freely say the sounds you imagine and match up ideas! The game is in Japanese and English, with illustrations, so playing with foreigners is easy. Discover fun new expressions!&#10;&#10;There is no wrong answer for sound effects. Feel free to express your own sounds and have fun!&#10;&#10;There are themes for actions, like 'broken vase' and themes like 'falling in love' or 'riding in a time machine'. It is a fun game to show your individuality. Hitting the right card for other people's sounds is exciting too.&#10;&#10;The game has 30 cards with themes written in Japanese and English, and 30 cards with illustrations of movie scenes. A player makes the missing sound effect from the theme, and the others try to pick the matching scene card as fast as they can. The game is very simple to learn and play.

From the 12 generals available to choose, each with his own unique ability, you must manage your province well enough to provide Shingen with the troops and supplies he demands for his war effort.&#10;&#10;You can recruit Infantry and Cavalry, build more Rifles, and grow more Rice, but will it be enough for his next order? Pay your rival Hatamoto a small favor to make him more pliable, and then request help to fill Shingen's order for you this turn. But helping you gets him half your Honor reward...&#10;&#10;Players must balance their own province's production with currying favor with their rival Hatamoto to fill as many of Shingen's requests as possible. Whichever Hatamoto ends the game with the most Honor will be named Shingen's next Taisho.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The players sit with partners across from each other.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player plays a card to their team's area, either creating a new set or adding to an existing set. Sets can either be cards of the same number of cards of the same suit. If a set is ambiguous (e.g. any single card) it does not have to be declared. Once a set is unambiguous it is moved to the imaginary &quot;confrontation line&quot; between the two team's areas. A team may not have more than one of each kind of set.&#10;&#10;Once all cards have been played any ambiguous sets are discarded and the rest are compared; the team with more cards in a set of given type gets the points for that type. Number sets are worth their printed value and suit sets are worth ten.&#10;&#10;",

The card farthest from the deck costs ten, the next nine, and so on, with a minimum cost of one.

    "Description": "In this fantasy card game, the players play troll bandits competing for the most COINs.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player reveals as many cards ('TRAVELLERS') as there are players. Each traveller has an initiative score and will be assigned to each player - the player with the most SKULLs (see below)receives the highest priority card, and so on.&#10;&#10;Each TRAVELLER either gains or costs their player coins, or introduces a new mechanic into the game. The higher the priority, the higher the rewards of a TRAVELLER card, but the higher the chance the card will be negative for the player.&#10;&#10;Before each card is assigned, players can assign SKULLs to other players, themselves, or no one at all. This happens simultaneously, and after the cards to be assigned cards have been revealed. I.e. if the highest card is costing you a lot of COIN, and you have the most or are tied for the most SKULLs, you will want to give your SKULL to another player and hope you won't get any more, so the highest priority, negative TRAVELLER card doesn't go to you. On the other hand, you don't want to have much less SKULLs as anybody else, as you will constantly miss the high COIN value TRAVELLERs.&#10;&#10;There is also a randomised item shop where players can spend coin for one-time or permanent rule changes (redistributing or removing SKULLs, changing priorities, lessen the impact of negative TRAVELLERs, and so on).&#10;&#10;The game ends if one player starts and ends a turn with eight or more skulls, as they get to much attention to stay robbing people.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

They only have 15 days (rounds) left.&#10;&#10;The players gain victory points by turning in sets of resources described by their thesis cards, which are unique to each player and to be kept secret as long as possible. Each thesis emphasises three of the five available resource categories: Science, Magic, Components, Flesh and Energy.&#10;&#10;To gather resources, they have to build a laboratory which transform, splits or fuses resources or teleports them all over the place. The players vie for space and race against time to gather the right material in a chaotic card game with a modular playing field and engine-building elements.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of three phases: In the first phase a player adds a tile to or modifies a tile of their laboratory to give it more functions, like turning certain resources into others, duplicating resources or fusing certain resources into more resources of another kind. A smartly planned lab can set of chain reactions to create lots of the wanted resources from any kind of original resource.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, they can choose to either feed a new, randomly determined resource into their lab, or let resources in the lab go into the next stage of a reaction.&#10;&#10;In the third phase, they can turn in resources gathered in their lab for points or special action cards, which can help them or hinder other players through various bonuses. Turning in resources for points reveals a players thesis to other players, so they can better try to sabotage their labs.&#10;&#10;After fifteen rounds, the player who turned in the most relevant sets for their thesis wins. There are multiple strategies to build a functioning lab with their own risks and rewards, and until the last turn there can often be dramatic changes in the score.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

They draw and swap cards from an open market, looking to lay out cards of the same value (a plain tower) or of rising values in a run (a colorful tower). Players can add to existing towers, too. After building a plain tower, they receive a bonus effect (a donation) based on the rank of that tower. Players can complete towers by setting them aside as an action; they can no longer add to these towers, but each scores an additional 5 points at game's end.&#10;&#10;In the final scoring, players score for having the highest tower, for plain towers that are taller than the opponent's tallest tower in the same rank, and for their colorful towers (# of towers x # of floors total in these towers).

Players take turns filling in the board except for the center circle to set up. An extra checker is used to stack on one of your players to make an &quot;officer&quot;. The ultimate goal of the game is to eliminate all of your opponents officers, or force them to be unable to take a move. Single checkers, or &quot;guards&quot; move one space and can either jump checkers to remove them, or move onto a friendly piece to form a new officer. Officers can move any number of spaces in a single direction, but can only remove other officers.&#10;&#10;",

However, those that do are swordsmen of unparalleled skill. Though they look slight compared to most western swordsmen, that does not mean they&rsquo;re not as strong or effective on the battlefield. When joined with an officer, their skills are only enhanced, trading blow-for-blow with any foe.&#10;&#10;The Unsullied Swordsmen unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Targaryen players an effective melee unit on the field. Their melee attacks hit at the weak points in enemy armor, granting numerous bonuses when they strike. The Officer Unit Attachment adds to their strengths, trading wounds with the enemy when being attacked, making this unit able to dish out wounds both when attacking and on the defensive.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;13 Miniatures&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 Officer&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 11 Swordmasters&#10;  &#226;&#128;&#163; 1 Swordmaster Bannerman&#10;1 Unit Card&#10;1 Attachment Card&#10;1 Movement Tray&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Distrix is an award-winning game of skill in which two players, Red and Blue, battle to control a 6x6 region called The Matrix.  The number in each square of the matrix equals power, and Red and Blue are equally powerful.  During the game, players use colored tokens to group the squares into 9 districts, one square at a time.  As districts are formed, power becomes unevenly allocated.  Red controls some districts, Blue controls others.  The game ends when one token occupies each square and there are no legal moves remaining.  Whoever controls more districts is the winner.&#10;&#10;The idea is simple, but play is incredibly challenging.  To win, you must cleverly spread your power across many districts while concentrating your opponent's power into few districts.  This is how election districts are rigged, or gerrymandered, in the real world.  But, in Distrix, an opponent responds to your every move.  Each district is a tug-of-war that you want to win narrowly or lose by a lot.  But be careful...you may accidentally win it by too much or barely lose it!  Nine districts are in play, so there's a lot to keep your eye on.  Spatial awareness is critical because the shape of one district affects another.  And there's a special rule in the endgame--that allows squares to be reassigned from large districts to adjacent smaller ones--that can thwart even the best game plan, turning an expected victory into a stunning defeat.  Overall, it's a pure battle for power where basic arithmetic, spatial awareness, move timing, and move counting make all the difference.&#10;&#10;A devilishly challenging affair, Distrix has the conceptual simplicity, aesthetic elegance, and strategic sophistication typical of classic games like chess and go.  But with real-world relevance, endgame surprises, razor-thin victory margins, and a different matrix every time, Distrix is a game of skill like no other.  Are you ready for the challenge?&#10;&#10;Distrix won the Best New Abstract Game Judges Award at the 2021 UK Games Expo and a silver medal in the 2020 Serious Play Tabletop Game Competition.  It is for 2 players ages 14 and up and takes 30-60 minutes to play.  Each game set includes 36 tiles, 9 home base tokens, 99 expansion tokens, 9 scoring tokens, a scoreboard, rulebook, and rule summary sheet.&#10;&#10;Distrix Edition 3.0 was released in October 2024 and is now available at DistrixGames.com.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
