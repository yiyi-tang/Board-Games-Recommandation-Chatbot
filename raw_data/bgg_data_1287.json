The name Aquifer refers to how each player's initial group is the wellspring from which all their other groups originate. Draws are impossible in Aquifer.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Materials: Any Hex board size 10x10 or larger and an unlimited supply of stones in two colors.&#10;&#10;Objective: Connect your two designated sides, Top and Bottom for Black and Left and Right for White with an unbroken chain of pieces.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Starting with Black, on their turn players alternate either placing a stone of their own color that, if possible, must be adjacent to a like-colored stone already on the board. Or alternatively moving one or more of their stones according to the following conventions:&#10;&#10;The player selects a group (connected set of like-colored stones) to move stone/s out of. Other friendly stones within the group are sacrificed, by flipping them to the opponent's color, to give the stone/s sliding movement, each sacrifice adds a particular direction of movement to one of the stones being moved. Any number of stones can be sacrificed from the group (which aren't the moving stones of course) except for 1; the group must still exist at the end of the turn. The stones may move in any combination of their purchased directions. When moving, stones can move over friendly stones but not over enemy stones.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

One big score can change your fate forever. But it can get real messy, real fast. So carefully pick your squad, recon the objective, and shift the paradigm in your favor today!&#10;&#10;And remember, once you get on the grid you also get on the radar...&#10;&#10;GRIDWARS offers a new take on the hex-based skirmish game. Except for a smooth and satisfying combat system, you get a lot of possibilities to interact with the environment, hack your way through the battle, throw enemy and allied units, and even engineer and deploy powerful combat mechs to aid you!&#10;&#10;In a single game, you get the experience of wargaming, RGP, board game, and strategy game. Here are a few aspects that contribute to GRIDWARS unique gameplay:&#10;&#10;&#10;     RPG Scenarios. The game is scenario-based. Every time you will face a different challenge that will allow different characters to excel.&#10;     Squad Building. Before the game, you will pick your squad. Every unit has a cost and each scenario a limit of how many you can use per player. It is up to you to decide if you want to focus on brute force, hacking, or engineering!&#10;     Quick-Paced Skirmish. Players activate one of their units alternately. Each time a unit can execute actions. Move, Charge, Attack, Shoot, Use Abilities, Hack, Build, or even Throw a smaller enemy across the battlefield! Order in which you activate your units and execute actions will be the key to the winning strategy.&#10;     Custom Dice. There are custom attack and defense dice. After the roll, you will be able to improve your results depending on your unit's statistics. The combat mechanics are very intuitive. No math, just choices. You will see everything there is to know on your rolled dice!&#10;     Strategy-Affecting Terrain. The terrain creates a unique setting for each encounter on the grid. You can hide inside the buildings, lock the door, or shoot through the windows, all of which will affect the mechanics.&#10;     Powerful Hacking. The semi-virtual nature of the grid makes hacking a reality-bending feat. By using the terminals located on the battlefield, the hackers can activate the sentry guns, detonate mines, and manipulate electronic objects. By directly hacking the enemy operating systems, they can instantly inflict damage and status effects. &#10;     Versatile Engineering. Combat engineers can repair or deactivate obstacles. But what's more important, they can learn blueprints and collect materials to deploy just the right combat mechs to change the tide of the battle! &#10;     Energy System. It's up to you to decide which of your units will be reinforced each turn. At the beginning of a round, you will distribute the Energy. You can spend it to make your attacks and defense more effective or to activate powerful abilities in critical situations. Make sure to impact the battle in places where it is needed the most!&#10;     High Replayability. In every game, you will face different enemies, choose different squads and compete in different scenarios. You can find new synergies between characters in every game!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If you reduce one of them to 0 energy, deal 1 damage to Rayn, and tilt the mitt to show that it is broken. You may only deal damage to Rayn directly if both mitts are broken.&#10;&#10;On Rayn's turn, roll a die. If the result matches a number on one of her mitts, activate it. If the mitt is broken, fix it: untilt it and set the coin to 3 energy. If not broken, take the action shown on the mitt.&#10;&#10;(One roll of the dice counts as a boss' &quot;action&quot;.

The bargain was offered only to the whole coven so her sisters murdered her and accepted the bargain as three Yuta. Hikari is still powerfully linked to them so her sisters raised her as a Kairai and forced her to obey their commands but sometimes she finds the will to fight free.&#10;&#10;Hikari&rsquo;s unique connection to the Yuta means she offers even more flexibility to the Yuta box and, importantly she can use the Chaos Bolt Ki Feat and automatically win the opposed Ki test since she is Soulless. Choosing when to throw off her undead nature and assert control is key to making the best use of her profile.&#10;&#10;Blister contains one miniature supplied with a 30mm base and full colour profile card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Twin Realms is a complex dungeon crawler.&#10;&#10;Players will be controlling elemental spirits that protect the world from an army of demons. Each quest is unique and many of them have specific objectives. They are not only limited to &quot;kill all that moves&quot;.&#10;The combat is played in turns on a board (different for every quest) divided into squares and players will be able to perform actions using a deck of ability cards unique to each elemental spirit.&#10;The distinct feature of the game is hinted in its name. You will be playing in two realms. Physical, and spiritual. The playable characters as well as enemies have 2 forms with different abilities in each realm. The movement will be different in each realm. And some board elements will be different between realms (imagine walls that you can pass through as a spirit but not in physical form). The combat and gameplay will be guided by the fact that you will have to switch between realms to optimize your combat abilities, to avoid enemy attacks etc.&#10;&#10;All characters will be developed by levelling up from 1 to 10. Apart from regular upgrades to health and your ability cards you will be able to choose additional perks and choose your path in the game. You can focus on passive abilities, special system of attack modifiers, additional boosts to your cards or special rage cards. You will not be able to maximise all of the perks so every player will be able to build their character in their own way. You can build a character with a very strong set of cards less reliable on attack modifiers. You can build a character that has no upgrades on the cards but most of the attack modifiers are critical hits, burn targets, disarm them or add other status effects. You can build a character that does not focus on any of that but instead generates a ton of rage and exploits various bonuses of the rage deck.&#10;&#10;Each character will be able to fulfil a specific role in the company based on its abilities and its build. The roles are the usual set of tanks, assassins, mages and supports. However, that only applies to the physical realm.&#10;While in physical realm each character will try to fulfil their assigned role, in spirit realm all characters are the same, which means that in spirit realm you will share the responsibilities of dealing and taking damage. When you kill enemy spirits, you will be gathering their essence and taking over their actions to create interesting combat situations.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a unique world not long after its creation. There are no humans, dwarves, elves or any other races yet in it. The elementals and the demons are being led by primordial forces of good and evil. As you progress through the game you will learn more about the mythology of this world and what role you play in the history of things.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
