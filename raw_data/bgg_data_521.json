    "Description": "From the website:    &#10;The critically acclaimed game of dungeon delving, kill-stealing and cooperative - backstabbing becomes even more challenging with the inclusion of a NEW game mechanic, an Event Deck that makes even the most familiar Encounters new again. And mixed among the Events are ways to earn powerful new Relics that confer game changing abilities upon their owners.&#10;&#10;Plus, this set includes 15 of the deadliest creatures yet. Can you resist the lure of a 14-card hand? Will you succumb to the PVP inducing effects of Voodoo? Or will you become a horrific beast yourself in the final moments and turn on your companions?&#10;&#10;Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?&#10;&#10;Relics and Ruin is the second expansion to Cutthroat Caverns and what an expansion it is! First, let me highlight the fact that several of the Encounters and the inspiration for the Event Deck came from you, the fans, in our Create an Encounter Contest. Sure, we beat 'em into shape - but these amazingly compelling encounters get right at the heart of what players wanted - because players created them. And as you will see, they are deadlier than ever - with many new and unique ways to challenge players to work with and against each other.&#10;&#10;Plus, the Event Deck is an inspired way to keep the game evergreen. Sure you may have faced the Boogens countless times, but thanks to an Event card, some dark power may have them swinging for double damage or you may find yourself in close quarters with a gimped hand. Or perhaps your next run in with Fear will lead to a friendly side wager about who can swing hardest in a given turn - with added Prestige on the line.&#10;&#10;To balance the harsher environment, you will be able to earn powerful Relics. Unlike the Items in the base game, many of these items have game-long abilities to give you an edge over your companions. For example, Vampiric Bracers grants the ability to gain life for powerful attacks, while Talisman of Renown gains an additional Prestige Point every time you gain Prestige. But items of this magnitude aren't just lying around, they must be earned. Perhaps it will require a sacrifice of life to claim one or maybe playing the last action card before the creature dies is the key. It sets up an interesting situation in that you may find yourself deciding between taking action to score a kill - or a Relic.&#10;&#10;And speaking of the Relics - many of them are real items created by real artisans. Yep, you can own some of them by contacting the creators in our gallery. And of course, the gallery is full to brimming with more great art from artists around the world and we encourage you to visit their personal galleries to see more of their great works.&#10;&#10;All in all, this is an expansion that is not to be missed!&#10;&#10;&#10;Relics and Ruin will also feature some of the winners from the Create Your Own Enounter Contest including:&#10;&#10;    6 MERCURY by Claus Jensen&#10;    3 VENOM SLINGER by Greg Dapkus&#10;    2 WEREBOAR by Fred Barnard&#10;&#10;&#10;And the GRAND PRIZE Winner:&#10;GLUTTONY by Miles Armstrong&#10;&#10;",

There are different sizes of each species, and each different point/weight class card includes different information about that species.&#10;&#10;The five point cards are new world records for that species, and include thorough information about the current world record for that species.&#10;&#10;There are multiple options for play.  In tournament play, anglers can pursue victory by accumulation of points of by total weight, much like in actual tournament fishing.&#10;&#10;Additionally, specific species can be the target, i.e. largemouth bass, and all other fish would be returned to the lake when caught.&#10;&#10;In point play, there are bonuses given for catching fish of three different species or all species in the lake, excluding the carp--which warrant penalties.&#10;&#10;If one angler acquires all eight cards of one point value a bonus is earned, but if that bonus is due to acquiring all of the world record fish (5 points), then they  are deemed the &quot;Greatest Fisherman (or person) of All Time&quot; and they automatically win the game.&#10;&#10;The game was commissioned by, and features a spectrum of lures which are manufactured by Sheldons' Inc., of the Mepps line of spinners and spoons.

The manner of play is best described as both reminiscent of Go and yet markedly different. A variable number of pieces, subject to strict rules, are placed in a line on each turn. Opponents' pieces are captured by replacement when any but the first piece placed onto the board [which must be on a free space] overlies an opposing piece, but one's own pieces block new lines of pieces.&#10;&#10;",

The other is set in the Navy and landing on medal, badge of rank or targeted submarine squares are advantageous, and enemy subs, mines and torpedoes are bad.&#10;&#10;Fundamentally, the games are Snakes-and-Ladder clones, but with themes contrasting a career in the navy with working in an office.&#10;&#10;",

However, getting to the center of the board is not enough.&#10;&#10;In order to beat the Gold Clan, players must &quot;power up&quot; along the way by defending their own clan`s territory, crossing over into other clans` territories via &quot;cross-over points&quot; and Card Battling against rival clan members to collect their cards in order to increase their energy (life) points and gain much higher level &quot;Combo Attacks&quot; which they will use to defeat the Gold Clan and wipe out any of the menacing Kuragami Demons lurking about along the way.&#10;&#10;Victory is obtained only when one player enters the final arena and defeats the Gold Clan.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by 1~5 players on a single game board. Players with multiple game boards can network with each other following a special set of &ldquo;Clan Battle&rdquo; in which the primary objective is simply to eradicate the remaining 4 clans.

There are 6 birds to collect, worth different points, in descending order of value they are: Kakapo, Albatross, Kiwi, Takahe, Kokako and Blue Duck. The game is intended to educate about the conservation of these species and the threats that they face in the wild.&#10;&#10;The mechanic of the game is similar to the card game Rummy - on each turn the player picks up a card, either the top card from the deck or the top card from the discard pile, and then the player discards a card. Once a player has a complete family they must lay it down on the table.&#10;&#10;In addition there are three other types of card with various properties. These are protection measures, conservation actions and threats. These can be played at any stage of the game during a players own turn.&#10;&#10;Threats can be played against the families laid down by other players and will either destroy a whole family or only take one or more chicks depending on the type of threat. Threats include cats and dogs, rats, stoats and weasels, long line fishing, plastic waste, developers, infertility and virus. Protection measures are laid down on families on the table and they protect against some of the threats. Conservation actions allow a variety of different actions such as exchanging cards with other players, picking up an additional cards and neutralizing threats.&#10;&#10;Each round finishes when one player goes out by playing all the cards in their hand onto the table. Points are scored for going out, for each bird in the families on the table and for having protection measures in place on those families. Minus points are scored for having threat cards remaining in a players hand when the round ends. A game ends after a set number of rounds or when a player reaches a set points target.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Xeno-Terror is a co-operative &ldquo;Stationcrawl&rdquo; (sci-fi dungeoncrawl) pitting players against the &ldquo;game system&rdquo;. Players represent the last remaining, human survivors struggling to endure while caught in the crossfire of warring alien factions.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a character (miniature) with different attributes, skills, items and weapons (tracked by the use of cards). Game play takes place on a gridded (or hexed), modular board that depicts the location(s) the characters are exploring. Players attempt to complete objectives by co-operating as a squad or independently as the mission takes shape.&#10; All is not safe in the universe, as humanity has been virtually decimated. While salvaging for weapons, energy and anything useful, characters will eventually meet various Xeno&rsquo;s (Xenophobes). Upon contact, merciless Xeno&rsquo;s will quickly aim to destroy the human survivors. Luckily, bio-scanners are able to detect the location of any Threats or possible dangers. Using a combination of stealth and efficient deadly force the humans may have a chance to survive!&#10;&#10;Xeno-Terror promotes fast tactical action, exploration, character development and a sense of adventure, as the players not only interact with each other and their enemies, but with the environment that surrounds them. Characters may attempt to search or open crates, lockers, containers and other devices as well as attempt to hack computer terminals, panels or control mechanisms.&#10;&#10;The T.A.C. Engine: Xeno-Terror is the first in a series of 5 games that use the multi genre T.A.C. Engine (Tactical Adventure Card Engine) developed by Steve &quot;BLAST&quot; Lefort.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Animal Reich was included free with the program of the 1987 GamesCaucus held in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It is loosely based on the novel, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell.  One player takes on the role of the animals.  The other player takes on the role of Farmer Brown. The goal of the animals is to kill Farmer Brown, while the goal of Farmer Brown is to kill the animals.  The game was a wargame that included some role-playing elements, namely the creation of Farmer Brown allows for differential strengths and weaknesses.  For example, the player can choose to have a fast but weak farmer or a slow but powerful one.  The decision on what characteristics Farmer Brown has will have a major impact on game play and players can alter these characteristics to re-balance the game when played between opponents of differential ability.  The player using the animals, however, is stuck with the predetermined characteristics.&#10;&#10;Animal Reich attempted to bridge the gap between role-playing games and wargames, much as Steve Jackson attempted to do with Melee and Wizard some ten years earlier.&#10;&#10;",

The balls load under the pitcher's mound and are released one by one by using one of the controls. The bat works like a flipper in a pinball game. Wooden frame, glass top. 14 X 21 inches.&#10;&#10;This game from 1946 is sort of a bagatelle game but can be played by two players. One player acts as the pitcher and uses the plastic pitchers spot to dispense a round metal ball (the baseball) towards the batter who has a bat which by pushing a lever, swings at the released ball in an attempt to make contact with the ball. There are a number of slots where the ball can wind up, scoring singles, doubles, triples and home runs. Double plays are possible and any ball not winding up in a slot after it is struck 1 time is considered and out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This variant of chess was created by GM (Grand Master) Yasser Seirawan and Bruce Harper in 2007.  It is an offshoot of Capablanca Chess, using the same pieces, but on a standard 8x8 chessboard.  The game introduces the Capablanca pieces, called Elephant (Chancellor, moves like a Knight-Rook) and Hawk (Archbishop/Cardinal, moves like a Knight-Bishop) by means of a double move.  The double move is similar to a castle move in that it involves two pieces, with there being the OPTION of adding the Elephant or Hawk to the board in a newly vacated space in the back rank.  This double move is the ONLY way the Elephant and Hawk can be added to the board. There are 8 opportunities to bring Hawk and Elephant into play. When castling, the Hawk or Elephant can either be placed on the King or Rook initial squares, but no gating of both pieces is permitted.&#10;&#10;You can find valuable informations on Yasser Seirawan website:&#10;http://www.seirawanchess.com&#10;You can play online at www.musketeerchess.net&#10;&#10;Alternative site on Wikipedia:&#10;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seirawan_chess&#10;&#10;And also an entry for the game on the Chessvariants.org site:&#10;http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MLseirawanchess&#10;&#10;The pieces are available at the House of Staunton:&#10;http://www.houseofstaunton.com&#10;&#10;Pieces are also available on Amazon Europe.&#10;&#10;An alternative design of the Elephant and Hawk is Chancellor and Archbishop respectively.&#10;&#10;Take a look at a sister Chess Variant: Musketeer Chess&#10;http://www.musketeerchess.net&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Wikipedia:&#10;Capablanca Chess is a chess variant played on a 10x8 board. The game is named after its inventor, the former world chess champion, Jos&eacute; Ra&uacute;l Capablanca.  Capablanca thought that chess would be played out in a few decades, that games between chess grandmasters would always end in a draw. This danger of &quot;draw death&quot; was a main motivation for him to create a more complex and rich version of chess.&#10;&#10;Besides the usual set of chess pieces, each player has additionally two new pieces with corresponding pawns:&#10;Chancellor: a chancellor combines the moves of a Rook or a Knight; Archbishop: an archbishop combines moves of a Bishop and a Knight.&#10;&#10;The new pieces have properties that enrich the game. For example, the archbishop can checkmate a bare king by itself (king in a corner, archbishop placed diagonally with one square in between). Capablanca thought that adding these two powerful pieces would reduce the likelihood of a draw and make the game itself more interesting.&#10;&#10;You can play Capablanca Chess online on Jocly website:&#10;https://www.jocly.com/&#10;&#10;Other Sister Chess variants are: &#10;Bird's Chess, Seirawan Chess, Musketeer Chess, Carrera Chess, Gothic Chess, Janus Chess&#10;http://www.musketeerchess.net/&#10;&#10;",

In Fantasy RPG Checkers, you can pick from 6 different characters, like &quot;smart fighter&quot; or &quot;arcane mage.&quot;  Your character gives you special powers that allow you to bend or break the normal rules of checkers.&#10;&#10;Like normal checkers, your goal is to capture all of your opponent's pieces.  Since this is Fantasy RPG Checkers, you gain class levels as you play, your checkers have hit points, and you may have to make saving throws.  The mechanics keep these extra aspects rather simple.&#10;&#10;Fantasy RPG Checkers is a game for two players.  Fantasy RPG Checkers uses a standard checkers set, a six-sided die, and some pennies (or other small tokens).  A two-player game takes about 25 minutes to play. Fantasy RPG Checkers is appropriate for Ages 11 and up&#10;&#10;",

Each major has a different pay rating and is of course dependent on your level of degree. You also earn points for each semester according to GPA and there is a scale as to how much you make. To win  you have to graduate and the game ends with everyone graduating and the winner is the one with the most money. If you reach graduation first don't worry you continue to collect money each round without having to do anything. Also the game was distributed in a long tube and the game board is vinyl that rolls up nicely.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the website:&#10;&#10;Cutthroat Caverns has often been described as a diceless RPG game and that has never been closer to the truth than with this expansion. For, introducing players to the devastatingly cruel new monsters, thought provoking additions to the Event deck and even more hugely powerful Relics, are two action-packed, full-on Adventure Modules.&#10;&#10;Just living and having the most Prestige may no longer be enough to secure a win. And living is no easy matter. Ragnarok the End Bringer is aptly named. Greed allows any Attack card to be played as a Critical Miss. The Lich will turn fallen friends into fallen fiends. All that and you need to effect a rescue too.&#10;&#10;Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?&#10;&#10;Tombs and Tomes is our third expansion to Cutthroat Caverns and it takes the exciting new mechanics first introduced in Relics and Ruin and adds even more sinister fun to the mix of Events and Relic Cards. Try battling a familiar friend like the Cursed Goblin while the walls close in and your hand size shrinks every turn or have every Relic in the room suddenly come to life and attack you when the Encounter is over, where the first one to beat a Relic into submission may claim it.&#10;&#10;And they are worth claiming. Bloodstone allows you to inflict 5 damage to any player at the end of an Encounter - and should any player die, you gain 3 Prestige. Or Ring of Storing which allows you to store an Action card immediately after playing it for a future second use. Perhaps Evil Eye is more your style, punishing those who would do you harm.&#10;&#10;But what makes this set truly unique is a whole new way to play the game. Included within are two Adventure Modules, The Lady of Magtherium and Mad God's Maze. Yes, these are self guided (no gamemaster needed, you can all play) full blown adventure stories. Yes, they each have a unique plot and multiple possible endings. It is a 'choose your own path' styled module with decisions to make and consequences for your actions.&#10;&#10;There is far more to it than in the base game of completing 9 Encounters. You must solve puzzles and avoid traps between the Encounters, decide marching order or who among you will take an action (and it may matter who), and determine through the course of your actions how the story will unfold. And in classic style, a big boss battle awaits you.&#10;&#10;Moreover, there may be new winning or losing conditions. For example, in The Lady of Magtherium, you discover a noblewoman (an NPC) whom you must rescue to win. She won't fight, but can be hurt - and if she dies, you all lose.&#10;&#10;Yes, these are one-shots and you will finish a module in a single sitting, so the modules themselves do not add to replay value. BUT they add so much depth and richness to the Encounters that when you sprinkle them into the regular game, they will be far more interesting. Of course, the real fun is that they represent what can be done with the game yourself. Creating and playing your own unique dungeon module is a great new way for fans to enjoy the game and we've got guidelines to get you started right here.&#10;&#10;On another note, this set features a number of other winners in our Create an Encounter Contest. There are some major 'big bads' here folks. For those who felt that the game was &quot;too easy&quot; and that characters don't seem to die enough - well, all I can say is be careful what you wish for. There are 15 more vicious Encounters (bringing the total to 75!) and we can almost guarantee that unless you make an effort to work together, players are gonna die. A lot.&#10;&#10;The stuff in this box is a helluva lot of fun to play and opens up a whole new world of possibilities! Check it out and see for yourself.&#10;&#10;",

There are about 300 playing pieces, 123 of which are actual combat units and the rest are markers. The markers are used to show a units combat changing strength as the the units only have a movement rate printed on them. (Per Fire &amp; Movement #10, this was the first game to use this type of step-reduction system.) The rules are only 8 pages.&#10;&#10;There is a very interesting sequence of play:&#10;&#10;Impulse 1 - The Allied player moves all units as desired then conducts attacks against any adjacent Axis unit.&#10;&#10;Impulse 2 - The Axis player may move all of his units as desired but may NOT attack.&#10;&#10;Impulse 3 - The Allied player moves all units as desired. Once moved he may then conduct attacks with any unit that did not attack in impulse 1 against any adjacent Axis unit.&#10;&#10;Impulse 4 -  The Axis player moves all units as desired then conducts attacks against any adjacent Allied unit.&#10;&#10;Impulse 5 - The Allied player may move all of his units as desired but may NOT attack.&#10;&#10;Impulse 6 - The Axis player moves all units as desired. Once moved he may then conduct attacks with any unit that did not attack in impulse 1 against any adjacent Allied unit.&#10;&#10;You repeat process this three times to complete each month of time. In the campaign game taking 28 months that's 504 impulses over 84 turns!&#10;&#10;Supply as ever is important in the desert with the Axis having to keep track of &quot;Stores&quot; to supply attacks and &quot;Issues&quot; to supply movement of motorized units.&#10;&#10;",

Given that each player begins the game with the exact same cards, a battle of wits and nerves is sure to follow!&#10;&#10;After the first preliminary visit to each state, the aspiring candidate must decide which States to pursue and which to leave for their opponent.  Sometimes it will prove to be good strategy to play a weaker card and save the real muscle for other States!&#10;&#10;After two trips around the country, the electoral votes are counted.

    "Description": "Knockouts and Tapouts: The Mixed Martial Arts Card Game allows players to each customize a fighter in mere moments and then use strategies and tactics of their own design to engage in a fast-paced, easy-to-play, mixed martial arts contest.&#10;&#10;Each player gets to quickly and easily choose and customize the kind of fighter that they want to be. You can make a striker, grappler or a balance of both, then choose your special styles and abilities and you're ready to go. You play through 3 quick phases. Each player rolls a die and adds any bonus they have to determine which of them is the most mobile on the current turn, then the player that wins mobility moves a marker to show the posture and range between the fighters. (Short Range, Long Range, Full Guard, Half Guard etc...) He then plays a card vs his opponent. The card could be a punch, a kick, an elbow, a neck hold, or any number of various special moves. You roll dice and use your fighter's strengths combined with his position to instantly determine the success level of the attack. Your opponent then does the same to you. You each then refill your hand and attempt to recover from any damage you may currently have. You keep repeating the process until the round ends (the draw deck is empty).&#10;&#10;The really exciting thing is that the game can end at any moment, just like in a real mixed martial arts match. If you catch your opponent with a devastating strike or lock in a powerful hold, the match ends instantly in a knockout or a tapout. Both players are on the edge of their seats throughout the whole game knowing that it could be all over at any second. You can also wear down your foe until the ref stops the fight because one fighter is unable to intelligently defend himself (He's taken too much damage). Another way to win is that successful attack cards set aside during each round count as points from the &quot;judges&quot; to determine a winner if the fight &quot;Goes the distance.&quot;&#10;&#10;You can play the game over and over again because you can design a unique fighter every time you play. There are so many different cards that no two matches are ever the same. Most matches between experienced players are finished within about 10 or 15 minutes, so you get to play multiple matches per game session. Alot of attention was put into writing the instructions. Only one person really needs to read them. The game comes with a Quick Reference Card that you can use to teach somebody how to play quickly. The game is designed to fit into a pocket. You can fit the whole game into a little plastic sandwich bag or one of those little plastic boxes that you buy to hold sports trading cards.&#10;&#10;Each match is decided between 2 players, but the game is ideal for multi-player tournaments. Having multiple copies of the game (One for each pair of players) is recommended but not absolutely necessary because of the short playing time and the game's rare quality of being so exciting to watch even if your not in the current match being played.&#10;&#10;What you get...&#10;The game is simply a 90 card deck. 2 cards are not used for playing. 8 of the cards create a full color easy-to-use play chart. 1 card contains cutout counters (but you can use anything for counters). 8 of the cards (along with the counters) are used to create your fighter. 8 cards contain the instructions (English only). 2 cards provide a quick reference of the instructions for each player during play. 61 cards make up a playing deck packed with exciting B&amp;W photos of all your favourite MMA techniques. You need 6 regular six-sided dice (not normally included).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "THE SETTING.&#10;The decimating wars of the early 21st century have destroyed the great civilizations of the world, and humanity survives in pockets around the globe, living in barbarism and ignorance.  By the end of the 25th century the world has largely healed from the holocaust, and the great religions of old, long surviving in their ancient strongholds, now dare to venture out once more to reconvert the lost.&#10;&#10;THE PLAYERS.&#10;Judaism&#10;Buddhism&#10;Orthodoxy &#10;Hinduism&#10;Roman Catholicism&#10;Islam&#10;Zen-Shinto&#10;Protestantism&#10;Taoism&#10;&#10;Each tradition has its own special skills, its advantages and disadvantages in play.&#10;&#10;VICTORY CONDITIONS&#10;Your task is to control the spread of your religion by sending out missionaries, converting unbelievers, building new holy places, and bring at least a million souls into &ldquo;Salvation!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game contains variants for 2,3,4,5, players and the full game, non variant, can be played with 5--9 players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Author; &quot;Brandub is a Celtic board game, a re-creation based on pieces and playing boards found in runs and digs in Ireland and  Wales. The rules had been lost for over ten centuries, but now have been restored by a combination of game theory and historical extrapolation.&#10;The game itself is a fast, enjoyable tactical challenge that leaves you wanting to play again and again. Simple rules but engagingly complex play for all skill levels.&quot;&#10;&#10;Addendum: Brandub is one of the oldest known 2-player games that falls into the genre of &quot;unequal forces&quot; games.  While 1 player is given 8 pieces (called &quot;Barons&quot;), the other player is given 5 pieces (4 &quot;princes&quot; and 1 &quot;king&quot;).  The different pieces have different abilities, perhaps the most notable being the fact that the king cannot be removed from play by any means.  For fuller rules, see the &quot;files&quot; section.&#10;&#10;",
