Actions include placing a marker on a pot, moving a marker, looking at the cards in a pot, adding a face card to a pot, or re-rolling the die placed next to each pot, which will later subtract from its value.&#10;&#10;Play continues until two players have each used all five of their markers, at which point the pots are scored. The player with the most markers on a pot gets the full value, the player with the second most gets half value. The value of a pot is based on the die, the number of markers, and the cards in it.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn a player can draw a card from the deck, add a card to a column, or discard a card allowing them to take one or more columns: columns with a total exactly matching the discarded card and/or any combination of columns matching this may be taken.&#10;&#10;For each column taken the player places a marker in the top box of an area on the events board (or five markers if they manage to take all four columns at once). There is a marker moving from area to area with each placement, so a player placing multiple markers places them in different areas.&#10;&#10;Once all the spaces on the board are full the game ends. Players each one point per marker, except that markers on blue spaces are worth two. A player having the majority of the spaces in an area doubles their points for it. Players lose points for cards in hand. If there is a tie for overall points the lowest player is dropped and the board is re-assessed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The player manages the Ancient Kushan Empire of India and Central Asia in the years 50-220 CE.&#10;&#10;Using a deckbuilding system, each player has a deck of advisors including generals, governors, diplomats, artists, architects, philosophers and secret agents. Each type allows distinct types of actions. The player can accept the initial card draw, or push their luck by spending precious influence hoping to draw a card the empire needs more.&#10;&#10;After determining the action, the player allocates funds (talents) and determines the result via random draw of a result counter. But in the case of invasion, a more elaborate sequence plays out on the Battle Board using a brand new combat resolution system.&#10;&#10;Based on how well the turn went, the emperor gains or loses an unknown number of popularity points, the player keeps or loses influence points, and gains or loses an advisor.&#10;&#10;Finally, players draw one of the momentous Fate cards, which can even lead to the death of the emperor. When this occurs, popularity converts to influence and cards enter and leave the deck based on the differing interests of the new emperor. When the last emperor dies, the game ends and the player scores points based on the empire's achievements at that time, conquests, but also cultural achievements and economic development.&#10;&#10;Features named emperors with historical stats and descriptions, a wide array of army types, army maintenance, unrest, rebellion, nonplayer barbarians, civil wars, heresy, pandemic, trade, temples, monuments, aqueducts, roads, rules to control a nonplayer in combat, and more.&#10;&#10;This is the first in a series of games to eventually include the ancient Roman, Parthian and Han Chinese empires, each player having to cope with the game system as well as each other.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Discards are shuffled when the deck runs out.&#10;&#10;When a player has four cards of the same rank they take a piece of candy. All other players may then also take a piece.

Artillery figures are not involved in this version of the game, so one player controls one type of troops. The game takes turns (for example, the first move of player &#226;&#132;&#150;1 for the Moscow infantry, the second move of player &#226;&#132;&#150;2 for the Lithuanian infantry, the third move of player &#226;&#132;&#150;3 for the Moscow cavalry, the fourth move of player &#226;&#132;&#150;4 for the Lithuanian cavalry).&#10;     6 : the players are divided into two camps - the Moscovite army and the Lithuanian army. Each player controls one kind of troops. The game takes place alternately (for example, the first move of player &#226;&#132;&#150;1 for the Moscow infantry, the second move of player &#226;&#132;&#150;2 for the Lithuanian infantry, the third move of player &#226;&#132;&#150;3 for the Moscow cavalry, the fourth move of player &#226;&#132;&#150;4 for the Lithuanian cavalry, the fifth move of player &#226;&#132;&#150; 5 for the Moscow artillery, the sixth move - player &#226;&#132;&#150;6 for the Lithuanian artillery).&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;In your turn, roll the dice and move your figure to the number of points received. Subsequent game actions depend on where you are on the field. &#10;Troops of one army can stand on one space. &#10;If, after throwing the dice, your figure ends in a space with an enemy troops, a &quot;Battle&quot; begins.&#10;When on the red or black box, take a card of the appropriate color and follow the steps described in it. If, as a result of the orders executed on the card, you are again on the red or black field, you do not need to take the card a second time.&#10;&#10;Combat:&#10;If you receive a &quot;Fight!&quot; Card, then your moving figure and the nearest (on either side) opponent's figure start the fight. You and your opponent roll the dice at once - who gets more points wins. The defeated army that took part in the battle goes as many steps back as the points thrown by the winner during the battle. In case of a tie the combat is held again, until victory.&#10;&#10;Victory:&#10;The winner is the one who first brings to the enemy's camp his entire army, of figures of infantry, cavalry and artillery.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s an action selection/area influence game, with 4 simple actions which interact with the various fields in ever surprising ways. The players move clouds with water droplets, and then rain those droplets onto specific fields, to make sure they have the right amount of water for the Harvest. During a Harvest, crops that have been watered enough are scored! Players are able to influence when, and how often the harvest happens. Players need to strike a fine balance between maintaining control of the different fields as well as influencing Harvest, to make sure the two come together at the optimal time.&#10;&#10;This Collector's Edition comes with a new Artwork and includes the Flower, Honeybee, Greener Pasture Expansion.&#10;&#10;",

Second, there are 6 Joker Cards which may change the scoring.&#10;&#10;Every player receives 3 minorities cards and a joker. The starting player defines a category and &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot;. All players choose a card simultaneously. The player with the highest score chooses 2 of the played cards and puts them on his victory pile. All other players except the last one choose one card. Players then restock their hand to three cards. The game ends when one player has 4 cards of the same minority in his victory pile. This player wins.&#10;A variant suggests to find the most discriminated person by discussion.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you look to see if you can match one of your tiles with one of the tiles in the middle of the table. The tiles can only be placed at the two open ends of the domino queue. Only identical motifs may be placed, for example, locomotive to locomotive or concrete mixer to concrete mixer.&#10;&#10;If you have a matching tile, you may place it. Then it's the next player's turn.&#10;If you don't, you must take a tile from the draw pile. If this tile you just took is a match, then you may place it on the table immediately.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has played all tiles. The game also ends when none of the players can place a card. The winner is the player who has the fewest cards left.&#10;&#10;",

The players also agree on the number of letters that will end the game and the minimum word length.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player may add as many connections as they want between existing letters that aren't already connected, as long as none of the lines cross existing lines. Also, each connection must result in at least one new word, which the player claims (they may claim more than one). Words are spelled by following the connections - a connection can be traversed more than once, and each letter has an implicit connection to itself.&#10;&#10;After adding as many connections as desired a player ends a turn by adding a new letter with a single connection to an existing letter. This need not result in any new words.&#10;&#10;Claimed words score their length minus the minimum word length. However, there are some additional rules on claiming longer forms of earlier words and so forth, which affect the scoring.&#10;&#10;After the last letter has been added players may examine the network to find additional words to claim.&#10;&#10;",

Players do not need to know anything about LARP, The Empire or runes to enjoy the games.&#10;&#10;Runes Way comes with rules for three quick and simple real-time mini-games designed by The Guild of Good Games called The Way of The Runes, The Runes of The Way and Runic Skein'.  There is a further turn-based solo or cooperative game challenge called Paragon's Path.  The cards can also be combined together into The Runes Way Labyrinth puzzle that forms an elaborate structure with hidden meanings for those who seek its secrets. Finally, the cards may also be used for divination purposes using the Wheel of Meaning method of Rune-Reading.&#10;&#10;The Runes Way cards each feature six runes from the world of Empire. One of the runes on each card will match exactly one other rune on any other card - this is a similar feature to that used in the game of Dobble where one symbol on every card matches a symbol on any other card. The Runes Way cards may be placed adjacent to each other to connect matching runes along adjoining edges, enabling cards to be connected into a line - this has similarities to how pieces connect in dominoes.  Since the shapes of many of the runes are very similar, it can be challenging to quickly spot which runes match correctly.&#10;&#10;There are 2 similar but slightly different standard editions of the Runes Way deck (the Blood Red Runes Edition and the Empress Lisabetta Memorial Edition).  These may be combined together to increase the number of players who can play the different games, and to add variety and additional challenge to the gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Each scenario typically involves a combination of exploration, puzzle solving, storytelling, and combat in a classic sword and sorcery setting.&#10;&#10;Games of Taelmoor begin with players selecting an archetypal class (i.e wizard or rogue), and forming a party by joining the host's game with their smartphone or mobile device. Players then take turns exploring and interacting with the game world. New rooms are laid out tile by tile as they are explored, and each may include unique elements like NPCs to talk to, puzzles to solve, or combat. The story is relayed simultaneously to all players via the app, though players are encouraged to read new passages aloud as they are discovered.&#10;&#10;Combat features simplified deck construction elements. Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, and can build a custom combat deck as they level up throughout a scenario. Strategy between players is emphasized as many attacks become more powerful when combined with others. Attacks are played by scanning the physical card and then discarding.&#10;&#10;Scenarios typically take 60-90 minutes to complete. Some are broken into multiple parts and are meant to be played across separate sessions.&#10;&#10;",

But when the sunshine comes again they come back more plentiful than ever before.&rdquo; &ndash;Little Turtle&rsquo;s remarks, August 14, 1794.&#10;&#10;Following defeats in 1790 and 1791 in the Northwest Territory the US Government authorized the creation of a standing army to invade and subdue the area. Appointed in overall command of the force was Revolutionary War here, General Anthony Wayne. Nicknamed &ldquo;Mad&rdquo; for his impetuous and daring attacks against the British in that war, General Wayne instead elected for a methodical and remorseless campaign against the Native Americans. Dubbing this new US army a &ldquo;Legion&rdquo;, it was divided into for &ldquo;sub-legions&rdquo;, each of which was a combined-arms force of regular as well as militia infantry, dragoons, artillery and engineers.&#10;&#10;The Legion drilled extensively after forming near Pittsburgh. The force then traveled down the Ohio River and after disembarking in Cincinnati began its march north into the heart of the Native American territory.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well, or better?

If the kite is in the required position and orientation on their grid, they can perform a trick earning them points.  Players can plan to do more tricks but must be careful to not get caught with unperformed tricks at the end of the game as those result in penalties.&#10;&#10;When there are no Trick cards left in the Trick deck, the Final Trick is revealed.  When either player lands that trick, they claim it and the game ends immediately.

The goal is to place six city defense cards around your city for the win.&#10;&#10;Players begin by choosing a monster body, and hero body and a city to defend. Then they are dealt five cards and play begins. On their turn players can place a monster power on a monster body, a hero power on a hero body, or a city defense card on a city card, and they can play one special card. When they have a few monster powers on their monster they can instead choose to attack another player's city. They can also take their turn to discard up to their whole hand and pick new cards.&#10;&#10;Attacking another city is called &quot;combat&quot; and when that happens both the attacker and defender roll a die, then add the role to their either their monster score (for the attacker) or hero score (for the defender). Then both players can start throwing combat cards which modify the numerical results for either side making the fight go back-and-forth until one player comes out on top with the highest score. If the attacker wins they add the city defense card to their city. If the hero wins they get a bonus to their next defense. There are many combat cards and also special cards which add to the teeter-totter effect that keeps the game neck-and-neck to the end. The game ends when one player manages to place a 6th city defense card around their city, making it impregnable.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

From the Badlands of North America to the icy realm of Antarctica, the world of the Dystopian Age is a wild and dangerous place.&#10;&#10;This box set not only provides everything you need for two players to start playing Dystopian Wars, but it also contains a campaign that details the theft of the prototype Hypatia Class Generator ship by the Russian double agent Helsinki Markov.&#10;&#10;The Commonwealth Intelligence Service (known as the Okhrana) have seen a chance to acquire Enlightened secrets and add new technology to their arsenal in order to better defend the Commonwealth. They risk reprisals from the Enlightened but as long as the technology is theirs it would be worth the consequence. The Covenant guard their secrets jealously and losing the Generator ship will cost them years of research and development.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;    30 Highly Detailed Plastic &amp; Resin Miniatures&#10;        1x 14 Ship Covenant of the Enlightened Fleet&#10;            1x Descartes Class Control Ship&#10;            1x Hypatia Class Generator Ship&#10;            3x Copernicus Class Heavy Cruisers&#10;                Each Cruiser can alternatively be built as either Antarctica, Chatelet, Lovelace, Stiletto or Ulysses Class&#10;            9x Merian Class Drone Frigates&#10;                Each Frigate can alternatively be built as Germain Class&#10;        1x 16 Ship Commonwealth Fleet&#10;            1x Borodino Class Battleship&#10;            5x Kutsov Class Cruisers&#10;                Each Cruiser can alternatively be built as either Norilsk, Oleg or Sineus Class&#10;            10x Rurik Class Frigates&#10;    1x Rule Book&#10;    1x Campaign Book&#10;    2x Victory &amp; Valour card Decks&#10;        60 Cards in each deck&#10;    1x Template Set&#10;    40x Action Dice&#10;    12x Critical Dice&#10;    2x Condition token sets&#10;    1x Iceberg &amp; Physeter Construction Token Set&#10;    3x Medium Bases&#10;&#10;",

You can also improve your monorail, increasing your package capacity per trip, or making it faster, which gives you more actions per turn.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;- The board game is setup randomly out of different track tiles. Cargo packages are set on 9 stations around the board.&#10;- Each player has an action allowance, based on their monorail's speed. This can increase or decrease in later turns, as players buy more engines or more cargo space for their monorails.&#10;- Routes can be improved (or hindered) by using track improvements, which allow players replace the track tiles on the board.&#10;- New contracts are created randomly from cargo + destination decks.&#10;- The game ends when all &ldquo;golden&rdquo; packages are delivered. The player that successfully delivered the most valuable packages is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game can be played from 2 to 5 players.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The servants are our lead suspects and it's up to you to unearth the evidence, seek out the suspects and catch the culprit in order to scupper the other sleuths, and win this game of murder! There's more than one way to catch a killer though. So what's it gonna be? Good Cop or Bad Cop? These two game versions come with their own set of rules and tactics to crack the case and finger your suspect, but will you use fair play or FOUL PLAY?&#10;&#10;The Game is Afoot! Playing as detective, you&rsquo;ll need to find the three evidence cards that point to a specific suspect in order to catch a killer in this crazy criminal caper. Will you uncover them in the crime scene? Could the other detectives be willing to collaborate and share their findings? Or will you resort to more tricky tactics, and plunder the proof you need to solve this crime?&#10;&#10;Detectives (players) have to deduce information from the Evidence Locker and Crime Scene to solve the murder.&#10;&#10;The game has Two Playing Variants:&#10;&#10;Good Cop (Catch A Killer) - set-up by placing the Evidence cards face down according to color and shuffle each pile. The remaining cards form the Evidence Locker. Add one card from each Evidence pile into the Evidence Locker and discard the rest. Shuffle the Evidence Locker and 9 cards into a 3x3 grid (The Crime Scene) in the center of the playing area. Deal 5 cards face down to each player. Then place the remaining Evidence Locker, face down, to one side of the Crime Scene.&#10;&#10;Bad Cop (Frame a suspect) All cards are in play - so shuffle the full deck and then follow the same set up as Good Cop, deal 7 cards to each player and you're ready to go.&#10;&#10;Detectives play the game by discarding or playing cards on their turn, choosing between fair and foul play cards. The winner is the Detective who determines who the murderer is and has the killer in their hand when making an accusation.&#10;&#10;",
