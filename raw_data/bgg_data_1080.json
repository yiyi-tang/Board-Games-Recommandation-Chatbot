    "Description": "The Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was a puppet state of Germany and Italy created out of territories in occupied Yugoslavia. The territory comprised modern-day Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and part of Serbia. Welcome to Fascist Croatia at War (CRO)! This expansion will bring a new dimensions to occupied Yugoslavia.&#10;&#10;Many atrocities were committed by the NDH, not the least of which was the establishment of a large extermination camp at Jasenovac. These atrocities spurred the Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Communists, and many ordinary citizens to join the pan-Yugoslavian partisan movement lead by Josip Tito.&#10;&#10;The Chetniks were Yugoslavian army units that both engaged in resistance activities and, at times, collaborated with occupation forces. In the end, the Chetnik agenda appears to have been a self-motivated attempt at creating their own self-styled Serbian state. Their racial ideals and terror tactics put them add odds with partisans.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this expansion we explore Antarctica, the great Southern continent, and its (albeit hypothetical) role in World War II. In reality the Germans did have an interest in Antarctica. In 1937 Germany sent an expedition aboard the MS Schwabenland, primarily for the purposes of establishing a whaling station. The German venture to Antarctica is fraught with myth and so for the purpose of making an interesting expansion (NEU), we are going to write a bit of alternative history:&#10;&#10;The German exploration of 1937 was surprised to find a high volume of low-salinity water flowing from a wide opening in the glacial ice on the Prince Martha Coast. Miles of navigable passageways in the Antarctic interior lead to an enormous geothermal heated lake. The Germans quickly established a submarine base and fortress in Antarctica and mapped passages all through the south polar ice cap. Antarctica quickly became a base for submarine operations against South Africa and Australia. Later in the war the German &ldquo;Base 211&rdquo; served as a research laboratory for top-secret projects and a redoubt from which the last vestiges of the Nazi empire could hold out.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The Universal Fighting System (UFS) is a collectible card game originally designed by Sabertooth Games. The themes of the cards are drawn from a multitude of licensed gaming universes, especially fighting game licenses.&#10;&#10;A game in the Universal Fighting System represents a battle between two adversaries. Each player controls one of the two characters, with the objective being to defeat the opponent, typically through loss of vitality. The two characters need not be from the same universe; for example, Chun-Li from Street Fighter could battle Cassandra from Soul Calibur or Tycho from Penny Arcade.&#10;&#10;Players take turns, with each turn consisting of multiple actions. With each additional action a player takes in a turn, the difficulty of successfully completing that action increases. Players can continue to take actions until they choose to stop or until they fail an attempt. The game structure typically involve players building up foundations over successive turns, which then allows a greater number of actions before failure. Management of these becomes crucial, as players must strike a balance between using their resources for offense and defense; going &quot;all out&quot; for a series of attacks can leave one vulnerable to retaliation during the opponent's turn. The system relies heavily on card combinations, where one card enhances the effect of another. The game is an advanced or expert level product (owing in large part to the fact that every card has at least one special ability), primarily aimed at older or more experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;In July 2023, publisher Jasco Games announced that UFS would be renamed UniVersus, with the publisher simultaneously changing its name to UVS Games, with &quot;UVS&quot; being short for UniVersus.&#10;&#10;",

It is a testament to the horrific effects of these weapons that they considered too brutal for use in the Second World War. However, these weapons were at times used clandestinely by the Axis. The Japanese used them against China and the Italians used gas against the Abyssinians.&#10;&#10;On the eve of World War II the production capacity of many nations far outstripped its World War I capabilities.  Germany, which could produce about 40,000 tons of gas per year in World War I had the capacity to create 184,000  tons by 1939.  Germany had also excelled in the development of new gases such as Tabun and Sarin gas with near 10 time the toxic potential of Mustard Gas (which itself was responsible for a quarter of all US casualties in WW I).&#10;&#10;In these set we will explore the use of weapons in select theatres as well as the grim possibility of their full-scale use.   In researching this set, I can&rsquo;t begin to describe the abject horror and brutality of these weapons and the experiments used to test them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Progressively, they began to contest the established monopoly of drug dealers in their cities, and soon emerged as some of the major players of drug trafficking in the continent. The Hells Dogs are a collegiate organization; meaning that their president is not omnipotent and that all the important decisions need to be voted unanimously by the inner circle.&#10;&#10;These nomadic riders are present in all of North America; thus allowing the Hells Dogs to start their operations from Illinois, California as well as British Columbia.&#10;&#10;",

We experience this by dealing with the effects of violent weather phenomena such as: drought, storm or heavy rainfall. We have no direct influence on them, but we can predict the effects they cause and try to prevent them. We can counteract some of these changes, others need to be adapted to.  The way we manage water and how we protect forests against fires is crucial in adapting forests to climate changes.  Keeping forests in good condition is your task now.&#10;It is your decisions and your actions that determine whether you manage the elements of fire and water.&#10;&quot;&#197;&#187;ywio&#197;&#130;y Lasu&quot; is an original board game designed to be played individually among several people. The game balances the aspect of luck and the impact of player's decisions on the course of the game. Clear and intuitive rules allow you to quickly feel the vibe of the game regardless of age or experience with board games. Protect your forest from the effects of the forces of the elements, be ready for possible disasters and make sure the forest lasts longer for the benefit of people and nature.&#10;&#10;In each round, players simultaneously pick the card with action which they will perform on the board and then pass the cards to the next player. The action is to place their marker in one of the forest zones: red, blue or neutral respectively.  At the end of the game, after an appropriate number of rounds, the players gain points for the advantages in the regions or the proper arrangement of their markers in relation to each other and the selected cards during the game. The winner is the player who collects the most points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "RATH&#10;Race Against The Horde&#10;&#10;Goal: To be the first survivor of the zombie outbreak to complete 3 Survival Missions.&#10; Premise: You are one of the few surviving humans in a zombie infested world.  Your town, once full of beautiful trees and parks is now decaying and run down. There are a few groups of fellow survivors with base camps set up around the town.  Through your walkie-talkie a distress call is heard requesting that a supply run be done as soon as possible. You accept the task and start off on your journey. Along the way you come across floods, fires, zombie hordes, and military fall out.  At the end of the journey, you are the hero that helped save mankind from annihilation.&#10;     &#10;Game Board: Movement can only be done on spaces that have grid lines. Players cannot move through bushes and trees or walk on water. The buildings can be accessed by any space surrounding the border.  &#10;Daily Update Cards:  The Daily Update cards effect game play in different areas of the board.  Hazards in this zombie infested city slow down a players&rsquo; travel time, move them back to their home base, or force detours from their original path.  Multiple grids on the map can be effected at once and each player must comply.&#10;Survival Mission Cards:  Each player will have one Survival Mission at a time to fulfill.  Each player has a separate base camp of survivors they are trying to keep alive.  By completing the missions on the cards, each player saves human lives by delivering life sustaining goods such as food, water, weapons, or building supplies to repair dilapidated structures.&#10;To Start: Shuffle Survival Missions cards and place on corresponding space on board. Shuffle the Daily Update cards and place on the corresponding space on board. Place each colored playing piece on the corresponding colored home base buildings on the map. This means each player will have a different starting position based on the color of their piece. &#10;Each player picks a random Survival Mission at the beginning of the game. The mission does not start until the player reaches the first building to pick up supplies and the mission does not end until the player reaches the destination to drop off supplies. Once complete, the player turns the card over and picks another Survival Mission to start on the next day/turn.  Once a player has completed 3 successful Survival Missions, they are the winner of the game.&#10;Player Movement: Each player can move a maximum of 5 spaces per day (turn) unless specified on the Daily Update card.  Players can move horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. &#10;Game Play: One (1) Daily Update card is drawn per day (turn) and effects each player on the board for that day/turn only.   &#10;The youngest player at the board is the first to draw a Daily Update card.  Each player moves based on the Daily Update card in a clockwise manner, starting with the card drawer first.  For example, player one reads the Daily Update card and is slowed from maximum movement of 5 spaces to 2 spaces. Their turn is over and now player two reads the same Daily Update card and makes their move.&#10;&#10;",

Then, pick your spell cards to assemble your deck. Take turns to gain mana, cast spells (paying that mana) and pick up new spells (unrestricted) to add to your deck. The first wizard to remove the last white &quot;life&quot; mana from another wizard's pool (effectively killing them), is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this set collection programming card game, your old mentor has invited you to the unveiling of his masterpiece, a modular perpetual motion machine, only to disappear just as the event is about to begin! It is up to you, his former apprentices, to save the day and demonstrate this strange machine in his absence. Wow the audience, earn Prestige for your mentor, and discover the bizarre secrets of Doctor Smuglfreud's Marvelous Machine!&#10;&#10;The premise is simple: module cards can interact with each other to generate a perpetual cycle of movements. There are many ways to get it right...but even more for things to go horribly awry! As you experiment with the temperamental machine, you will learn how to assemble sets of cards to make sensational combinations.&#10;&#10;Three modes vary gameplay and win conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rival Mode: compete with your rival to earn the most Prestige within the round limit.&#10;     Demo Mode: work together or alone to earn the goal amount of Prestige (or more!) as quickly as possible.&#10;     Puzzle Mode: work together or alone to create one spectacular design.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game was first developed as an entry in the 2018 9-Card Nanogame Print and Play Design Contest, where it won several awards:&#10;&#10;&#10;     #1 Most Innovative Mechanic&#10;     #2 Most Thematic Game (Steampunk)&#10;     #3 Best Artwork (Giampiero Randazzo)&#10;     and more...&#10;&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;&#10;     Award-winning print-and-play game&#10;     Art from the MARVELOUS Giampiero Randazzo&#10;     Three game modes with distinct flavors and playstyles (competitive timed, cooperative/solo timed, cooperative/solo untimed)&#10;     Ultra-portable components, including an optional custom tuck box&#10;     Design codes for sharing configurations or asynchronous play&#10;     Top hat not included&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hitler&rsquo;s fascination of New York City in flames drove Germany&rsquo;s leading aircraft engineers to begin development of several options for bombers that could strike targets on American soil from European air bases. In 1942, the Amerika Bomber Project was born which produced several contenders vying for the chance to make Hitler&rsquo;s dream come true. In Amerika, not only was the project very successful, but by 1946 heavily funded to aid in the air supremacy war over the Atlantic. The Horten XVIII B-2 (from the base game) became the best all-around platform of the project, and was the mainstay of Nazi bomber supremacy. The Arado E-555 and Messerschmitt Me-264 (from the expansion Bring In The Heavies) were both very competent designs as well, helping to soften defenses and destroy Allied installations.&#10;But several other designs from the project were also produced in limited numbers to round out the air force and provide mission flexibility. When the decision was made to invade North America, every resource available had to be called upon for a chance at success to even be possible. Help turn the tide of war in Germany&rsquo;s favor using these Amerika Bomber Project aircraft in AMERIKA!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The S&auml;nger Silbervogel &ldquo;Silverbird&rdquo; bomber developed from the idea of an intercontinental bomber that would glide around the world on the fringes of space and the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Launched from a base in Nazi Occupied Europe, it would travel down an approximately three-mile long monorail track, launched initially by V-2 rocket engines into space at a speed so fast, it would circle the earth in only a few hours. Its payload was to be a single composite bomb containing nuclear particles in a fashion similar to &ldquo;chaff&rdquo;, with an initial detonation in the higher atmosphere above a city to ensure complete coverage of the nuclear material.&#10;The bomb itself was a 5,000-pound high explosive warhead wrapped in special insulated blankets of radioactive silicone, detonating at about 2,000-3,000 feet above the target city. The end result would be radioactive sickness and death for those on the receiving end.&#10;After mission completion, the bomber would glide back to Germany reentering the atmosphere gradually and landing at a specially designated airfield. The cost of producing the bomb and the bomber itself though would render this weapon as a relatively expensive endeavor suited mostly for preemptive strikes against heavily fortified cities with the aim to wipe them out quickly.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

They move (are fired) during movement, and the effects of these attacks are resolved before units are moved to the battle board during the combat resolution phase. To purchase and build these rockets, the German player must have built the previous iteration at least one turn prior. For example, to build the A-12, the Germans must have already built at least one A-11 on a previous turn, one A-10 before that, and so on. If using the V-1 rules, V-2s and A-4s are considered beginning technology and do not require V-1s to be built the prior turn. V-1, V-2 and A-4 are all available during the initial buy purchase and on Turn 1. Rockets are placed in the air support box during the Place Reinforcements phase and can be stockpiled and used as the player wishes.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
