In order to win, you don&rsquo;t need to be the fastest player&mdash;you just need to be faster than the slowest player!&#10;&#10;Stay alive each round by being as quick as possible. The higher the point total in your hand each round, the faster you will be! Each player starts with three cards and three life chips. The game is played in rounds, with players taking turns picking up and discarding cards to try to achieve the best hand possible. Cards represent escape variables, ranging from -2 to +7. Once a player believes he has a winning hand, he hits the table and yells &ldquo;RUN!&rdquo;&mdash;at which point the remaining players take one last turn to try to improve their hands before concluding the round. Players then reveal their cards and use any Sabotage Cards or other Specialty Cards in their hand to trip up the other players and/or boost their own chances of survival. The player with the lowest (slowest) hand must feed a life chip to the hungry bear. Play continues in rounds until just one player is left standing and is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Or will the African heat, merciless pirate raiders, and the Ifrit, a creature of Arabic legend, see your dreams of glory sinking into the sea of sand forever?&#10;&#10;The Destinies: Sea of Sand expansion comes with three scenarios that form a campaign that should be played in the suggested order. We recommend playing the whole campaign with the same group of players, but this is not mandatory. Scenarios are linked together, and each unveils the next steps of a bigger plot, but each scenario is a separate story, and knowing previous scenarios should not give a player any unfair advantage.&#10;&#10;Sea of Sand also adds new dungeon and maze mechanisms, alongside the use of &quot;sub-maps&quot; to represent the vast distances of the Saharan desert and the locations players will visit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game about fencing with a long sword according to the teachings of Johann Lichtenauer (kunst der Fechten or KdF).&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game you will need to create your deck with fencing techniques, choose the characteristics of a fighter and your sword. Then you start your battle.&#10;&#10;First, at the Zufechten distance - you select a hat card and you can strengthen it with another card to increase the strike speed. When planning your action, you will see part of the opponent&rsquo;s cards, and he will see part of your cards. Therefore, you can predict his actions or try to confuse him and bluff. Players plan all actions at the same time.&#10;When a hit card is selected, players reveal their cards and compare the speed. Anyone who turns out to be faster becomes an attacking player (in terms of Kdf - he has a Vorschlag).&#10;&#10;Further, the battle continues at a distance of Krieg. Players also choose a hit and its speed. When choosing, you need to consider the position of your sword and the position of the opponent&rsquo;s sword, as well as how much the opponent puts pressure on the sword (Fullen, in KdF).&#10;&#10;Further, the fighters find themselves in the Ringen distance and apply deadly wrestling techniques.&#10;&#10;During the battle, the player may get wound or injured. Wounds limit the choice of cards and the player&rsquo;s overall stamina. Injuries reduce the number of cards in the hand. The game goes up to 5 wounds or 3 injuries.&#10;&#10;Also in the game there is a campaign mode with light legacy elements. Throughout the campaign you will take part in tournaments (fechtschule) in different cities. Between battles, you can upgrade your fighter, buy swords and heal wounds. The winner of the campaign receives the title of master of fencing and can use special &quot;master&rsquo;s&quot; techniques.&#10;&#10;The game is available in PNP version and is distributed free of charge. You can also play at Tabletopia and Tabletop Simulator.&#10;&#10;So far, only Russian version available, sorry.&#10;&#10;&#208;&#154;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#128;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#135;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#143;

    "Description": "Camp Out is a family-friendly, camping-themed, card game for ages 8 and over.&#10;&#10;Camp Out consists of 84 playing cards. The object of the game is to collect 3 sets of non-identical camping item &amp; activity cards, from the same category, in order to &ldquo;Camp Out.&rdquo; The camping items and activities span six categories, which include the campsite itself, food &amp; drink, wildlife, hiking &amp; fishing, things at the beach, and play and relaxation.&#10;&#10;As you play Camp Out, Match Cards help your hand, and a set of six &lsquo;game-changer&rsquo; cards called &ldquo;Trail Mix.&rdquo; Trail Mix cards can help or hinder your game play, depending who plays them, and how and when they are played. For instance, the &ldquo;Avalanche&rdquo; Trail Mix card can be used to make all players shift three of their cards to their left, or the player holding the card can choose to not enforce it. With another Trail Mix card called &ldquo;Cherry Picking,&rdquo; a player gets to dig into the discard pile for the right card, which will help their hand. With another Trail Mix card, &ldquo;Leap Frog&rdquo; makes the players to either side of the one holding the card exchange two cards simultaneously.&#10;&#10;The way in which this &ldquo;pickup &amp; discard&rdquo; game plays out, includes a playing feature both near the end, and at the end of a round, which gives Camp Out its name. When a player is one turn from possibly going out, they signal the other players by announcing their status with the word &ldquo;Camp.&rdquo; They do this not only to alert others, but also in order to garner 3 &ldquo;Camp&rdquo; points, which they would not get if they go out, or &ldquo;Camp Out,&rdquo; on their following turn.&#10;&#10;The final playing feature, which can actually give the remaining players an edge over the winner of the round, is the choice of a final card draw, which they are not allowed to discard.&#10;&#10;Final card hands are scored in various ways, depending on their makeup.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Art snippets will appear in due course in our Blog!&#10;&#10;The various modules and scenarios will commence with small learning ones designed to ease your way into the TSWW system with minimal fuss, and will progress through smaller modules handling the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), the Gothic Line, and Anzio, then into France via Overlord and Neptune, Avalanche (the invasion of the South of France) finally concluding with the Wacht am Rhein and the final breakouts into the depths of Nazi Germany for the land aficionados out there, along with the strategic bombing campaign undertaken by the RAF and USAAF against the Reich for those of you who must fly everywhere!&#10;&#10;Major campaigns will include Italy, North West Europe and of course the usual massive Grand Campaign module handling the entire Western Allied liberation of Europe.  &#10;You too can be Patton or Montgomery on the one hand, or Von Rundsted or Kesselring on the other.&#10;&#10;Space permitting Liberation will also include a major what if campaign designed to explore Winston Churchill&rsquo;s desired approach to Germany&hellip; through the Ljubljana gap and into Southern Germany, heading off the Soviet advance from the East, and fulfilling the promise made by Chamberlain to defend Poland&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

Commencing with the Japanese attacks on the US forces in the Philippines in December of 1941, I Shall Return ends with the Japanese Surrender in August of 1945.&#10;&#10;With 10 maps at 15 miles to the hex, as well as strategic mapping as necessary, 12 countersheets and a very pretty box showing General Douglas MacArthur striding ashore as he returned to the Islands as promised, I Shall Return fills in the gap between Day of Infamy and Singapore in the game mapping, and concludes the early war period in the Pacific Theatre (excepting China of course).&#10;&#10;As ever, within the box will be a slew of learning scenarios, game modules and the Grand Campaign, with everything from the fall of Corregidor to the mammoth naval battles surrounding the Leyte Gulf Landings, I Shall Return provides a one box solution to the the Philippines campaign.&#10;&#10;Dennis has also asked us (which we have agreed with alacrity) to include the projected US invasion of Formosa (Taiwan) in the game box&hellip; as usual the what ifs just keep coming with TSWW!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is likely that additional Strategic Mapping will enhance your play further &ndash; watch the updates on the blog for more as the game moves towards completion!&#10;&#10;Orders of Battle will include the usual TSWW refinements, including modules for the major land and naval battles, a variety of what if options and so forth.&#10;&#10;Rules and charts will be to the normal TSWW standard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These include:&#10;&#10;     25 maps [Note that TSWW maps are smaller than standard size] covering most of Mainland China, bits of Machuria &lt;sic&gt; and the Eastern USSR, plus parts of Korea and areas of the Japanese home Islands.&#10;     20 counter sheets. On these will be a full Nationalist, Communist and Warlord Chinese OB with the best research into these forces we can assemble, plus snap shots into the Soviet OB up to 1941, and then a full Soviet PTO OB to fit in with Barbarossa and Vengeance. Western Allied forces are likely to be limited at least in the first instance during research to the assets deployed to China &ndash; so the flying tigers, USAAF assets for the most part. &#10;&#10;&#10;We will also put together the 1944-49 or 50 US intervention OB for ground forces and if space permits may impose upon the team to concoct a what if USA Invades China optional OB. Space will be at a premium with 5-700 Chinese &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; to contend with! Optional Chinese forces will be provided to illustrate the difference in capability ownership of a land route &ndash; preferably from a port with a rail line would have made to the Chinese forces in the field.&#10;&#10;     TSWW System rules &ndash; including the rapidly to become infamous &ldquo;you are a drug dealer&rdquo; rule&hellip;.

Children love to play with these but unfortunately, a group of trolls has settled into a glade there. They love the glimstones too and have been snatching the children for lunch. A wizard recruits Esmeralda, from the Hoard game, as he knows of her reputation stealing treasure from a dragon and hopes to put her skills to use to benefit the community.&#10;The wizard and Esmeralda set off in opposite directions, collecting glimstones which can be used to ransom snatched children and buy time. When they meet again, if they have the right combination of glimstones, they can perform a spell to banish a troll. They must banish all the trolls to win, but if a player ends their turn and all children have been taken, the players lose.&#10;Players use movement cards to move the characters between the gems; it is possible to plan sequences of movements to get the characters to align again. Before each player's turn, an event card reveals if a child has been snatched or other forest inhabitants, some friend and some foe to the players, have been active that turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Roaster responsible for the best burn must point their finger at the Honoree and say, &ldquo;Boom!

    "Description": "Will you be the most skilled castle builder in the kingdom?&#10;Place room cards to grow your castle, but be careful!&#10;The other builders could use dragons to block your construction!!!&#10;&#10;PURPOSE OF THE GAME &#10;Be the most skilled castle builder in the kingdom. You will have to place the room cards of the castle by matching the stairs and the corridors of entry with those of exit of the previous card placed on the left.&#10;The player who manages to put 10 room cards in a row wins first.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION AND DEVELOPMENT &#10;For 4 players you have to use all 64 cards&#10;For 2-3 players you have to remove 2 Dragons and 2 Knights of your choice&#10;&#10;Shuffle the cards and deal 2 face down to each player, the remaining cards are placed in the center of the playing area to create the draw deck.&#10;The player who last visited a castle begins the game and continues clockwise. During his turn, each&#3;player draws 2 cards to add to his hand and creates his own row or row of room cards in front of him starting from the left and adding other cards only to the right of the previous one. Each player can play as many cards as he wants from his hand, the important thing is that to pass the turn he does not have &#3;more than 2 cards in his hand. If you have 3 or more cards in your hand you cannot pass the turn but &#3;you will have to play them until you remain with 2 cards or less. &#3;WARNING: if you have 3 or more DRAGON or KNIGHT cards in your hand and you cannot use them, they will be discarded until you have 2 cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;CREATING A ROW OF ROOMS&#10;The rows of rooms are created starting from the first card on the left and adding the other cards always to the right of the previous one, by matching the stairs and the entrance corridors with those of exit of &#3;the previous card, it is not possible to add cards to the left of the row. All room cards have two identical symbols, positioned on the top and bottom sides and are an HELMET and a couple of CROSSED SWORDS. &#3;When building a row of rooms, it is mandatory that all symbols face the same direction, therefore, if you start a row with the HELMET facing up, all the cards that make up the row must have the HELMETS facing up. If you have no cards in your hand that can be added to a row that you are building and you &#3;have more than 2 cards in your hand, then you cannot pass the turn, you will have to start a new row, always matching HELMETS and CROSSED SWORDS, therefore, if your first row has the HELMET symbol facing upwards, the row that you will build must have the same symbol facing downwards. There is no limit to the number of rows of rooms you can build.&#10;&#10;USING DRAGON CARDS AND KNIGHT CARDS&#10;DRAGON cards can be used against an opponent, during your turn they can be placed to the right of a row of rooms to block the construction, because from this moment the opponent cannot add ROOM CARDS on his own row. The KNIGHT cards instead must be used on their own row of rooms where a &#3;DRAGON card has been placed to remove it and be able to continue building on that row. Once played it must be discarded together with the removed DRAGON card, these cards can no longer be used.&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME&#10;The player who first creates a row of 10 ROOM cards wins the game. If the cards in the draw deck finish,&#3;and no one had made a 10-card row, in this case the player who made the longest row of rooms wins, if there is an equal merit, whoever has made the second longest row, if there is still a tie, will check the third and so on.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In each round, a different player plays the president.&#10;&#10;The president wins by eliminating any assassin (or surviving by the end of the round).&#10;The assassins win if they kill the president.&#10;The bodyguard wins by rescuing the president.&#10;&#10;The president deals the role cards to the other players, with one card remaining unassigned. Also, each player holds six hand cards. On a turn, a player can either play an action or a hit card. A player who has four different hit cards in front of them, is eliminated from the round (typically meaning the end of the round, unless the bodyguard is eliminated first). If the president receives the fourth hit card, the bodyguard can play three different hit cards to rescue the president. Afterwards, points are awarded and another round start, until each player has played the president once. Highest overall score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives a character card. The poem tells about the characters' death, and the goal of the game is to manipulate the poem and escape death 4 times.&#10;&#10;Each character card shows four combinations of verse card symbols, one combinatino on each side. Whenever each of these appears in the poem, all turned to the red card side, the player has escaped once, and then they turn their character card by 90 degrees to achieve the next sequence.&#10;&#10;On a turn, can do three actions: they may move one of the last two poem cards to the first position in the poem, or flip the first card of the poem to the other side (which results in certain other cards to be flipped as well), or escape death by having the three necessary cards flipped to the red side.&#10;&#10;The first player to escape death four times is the winner - everybody else dies.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the novel O R&eacute;quiem do P&aacute;ssaro da Morte by Andrio Santos.

(thinking about rainbows)&#10;     All players then say &quot;HAPPY!&quot; and reveal their cards simultaneously.&#10;     A player wins the round and furthers their secret agenda by having the highest numeric value of all cards played.

    "Description": "Coin Rugby is a dexterity game popular in Australia and New Zealand combining elements of Penny Hockey (aka Penny Football) and Shove Ha'penny. It is played on a rectangular table between two players with a single round coin (usually a 20 cent piece).&#10;&#10;The table represents the field of play in a Rugby match, with the ends furthest from each other representing the try-lines. Players attempt to flick or shove the coin from one end of the table to the other in three moves. They begin their turn by placing the coin so that part of it overhangs the table at the end closest to them. They then hit it with the palm of their hand for their first move. If they shove the coin completely off the table, their opponent receives the coin and begins their turn as described. If the coin is still completely on the table after three moves their opponent begins their turn from wherever the coin ended up on the table. If however, the coin is shoved into a position where it partly overhangs the opposite end of the table, they may attempt to score a try. &#10;To successfully score a try, a player must flick the overhanging coin into the air and catch it with one hand. Doing so will score 5 or 4 points (as per Rugby Union or Rugby League). The player may then attempt to kick a conversion, which is worth 3 or 2 points respectively. Their opponent must form the shape of a rugby goal with thumbs and forefingers. This may be done in the air or with their fists on the edge of the table, at the behest of the scoring player, but this must be done fairly and without moving once set. Then the player attempting the conversion spins the coin on the table. To attempt the &quot;kick&quot; they must place both fists on the table beyond the spinning coin and then catch it between their thumbs. With the coin between their thumbs they must then propel it over the goal made by their opponent. Regardless of outcome the opponent then receives the coin and begins their turn. &#10;Play can be timed, end when a certain score is reached by one player, or end with a &quot;mercy rule&quot;, i.e., an agreed points differential.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

At the start of a round, there is a market phase in which players can trade with others by calling out color offers or requests, trading one card against one other card. Trading happens simultaneously. When one player has either only cards of one color in their hand, or a set of all three cards of a kind (in all three different colors), they win the round. The winner can hand out two of the cards they used to win the round to two other players as challenge cards. The challenges are written on the card and can either require the receiver to perform an action immediately, or to continue playing the game while speaking in a certain way, or other such handicaps. &#10;The winner of a round also claims tokens from the center of the table. When these run out, the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

When a player has placed all their pieces on the board, there is a scoring round, and pieces on certain fields score positive (village fields) or negative (war fields) points. After the second such scoring round, the game ends and the player with most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s part riddle, part trivia and part just sound logical reasoning.&#10;&#10;We love this trivia game because it stimulates more conversation than (dare we say) any game ever!&#10;&#10;Clues come one at a time - the first team to guess correctly earns points. Use wild cards to pull a fast one on a leader who thinks they&rsquo;re cruising to victory. With for ways to play ranging from fast-paced to highly collaborative, it&rsquo;s a great addition to any dinner party, getaway, family evening or long car ride.&#10;&#10;Our family created this game over 10 years ago after we couldn&rsquo;t find a simple, fun and stimulating game to play in the evenings. We love it because it stimulates conversation, stories and all sorts of goodness that contributes rather than detracts from a great evening. We intentionally made the game play simple. We eliminated the need for game pieces, a game board, die and, of course, complicated instructions that bewilder and frustrate.&#10;&#10;The clue cards are loaded with astonishing facts about everyday people, places and things that are certain to entertain. Our rule of thumb was: the clues needed to make the folks playing the game excited about guessing and learning the answer. Did you know, for example, that Harry Houdini died one week after being buried alive?&#10;&#10;",
