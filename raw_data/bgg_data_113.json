As you live them out, you will cross a giant ape protected by fierce guardians, try to take back a princess captures by Zanzibari slavers, and cross rivers teeming with crocodiles... Thanks to sheer perseverance, you may even discover the source of the Congo river itself.&#10;&#10;Congo is, however, a hostile environment in which wild animals and witchcraft abound... Not to mention many other surprises.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Royal Golf Association are running their annual competition to judge the best new nine hole course of the year. Will you finish all nine holes before the judges carry out their inspection?  If not will stunning scenery and design excellence be enough to beat off the opposition?&#10;&#10;The Front Nine is a card game where players compete to build the best nine hole golf course with a balance of challenging par, scenery and facilities. The course cards depict each hole (pars 3, 4 and 5)and after paying the land and resource cost for trees, water and sand, they are laid on the table to depict the actual layout of the course. Each player develops a course from club house to 1st tee and from green to following tee etc. Each hole has a differing topography which constrains tee access and green exits which results in each player's course snaking across the table. Players must manage their finances carefully to enable their course to generate an income to ensure they can afford the ever increasing land costs and resources required to design and build each hole. The winner is the player whose course design best links back to the club house, has the best design, bunkers, woodland and water hazards and optimizes the use of the natural environment.&#10;&#10;The Front Nine has direct player interaction and competition and an economic engine with an interesting spatial aspect where careful thought is needed for card purchase and placement.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flanx is an action-paced card game for two players that lasts for about one minute. Both players play simultaneously, attacking and defending at the same time by placing square cards (with forms and colors, so they only match following certain rules) in an attempt to encircle the opponent. As the table is your battleground, Flanx is a different experience wherever you play it.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the goal of Flanx is to either place a card behind an opponent's card or build a path up to the other side of the table. Set-up is to put two matching cards at the center of the table. Both players draw three cards and at the same time start to look at them and try to place them to the cards already placed while minding the three placement rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Form and color of your card must match with adjacent cards.  &#10;    The card must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one of your cards.&#10;    The card must be diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to at least one of the opponents cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player who manages to place a card &quot;behind&quot; any card of the opponent wins the game.&#10;&#10;Omiga contains special rules for play with children as well as solitaire rules called &quot;Zen Mode&quot;.&#10;&#10;This game is called &quot;Omiga&quot; in some other countries.&#10;&#10;",

The game mechanics are mainly diplomacy and negotiations.  Each player represents a &quot;Political Current&quot; (or simply a Current), because at this time, there was no permanent political party, but only shifting groups of politicians.  Each Current acts to strengthen its position and increase its fame.  The game uses also elements under no player's control, but which react to the players' actions.&#10;&#10;A game can end in several ways, depending on the current political regime, and depending on each player's victory points.  In the real world, the end was the installation of the Directorate in September 1795.&#10;&#10;One interesting feature of the game is the strict seating arrangement: Players are seated from left to right depending on the political stance of their &quot;Current&quot; (Sans-Culottes on the left, Royalists on the right, and everyone else in between).  One cannot leave the room to conduct negotiations, but one can whisper--thus it's easier to secretly negotiate with one's neighbor than with someone on the &quot;other side of the aisle&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a lightweight strategy game for 2 to 4 people which also includes a number of challenging puzzles for 1 player. The theme of the game is the migration of people down the Indonesian archipelago into New Guinea and Australia. The games is based on a set of 136 laser cut wooden jigsaw like tiles which go together in a multitude of ways to form a set of islands.&#10;&#10;The game starts with all of the tiles face up on the playing surface and one tile in a cleared space in the center of the playing surface to start play. Players select a tile from the pool of upturned tiles and try to join tiles to it to extend the islands of an archipelago, 'discovering' a different set of islands each time they play the game. Each player has a number of tokens for his clan or totem. The aim of the game is to claim nodes (points on the land of the islands where the corners of a number of tiles come together). The player who places the last tile at a node may claim that node for his clan. If an island is completed then all of the tokens on the island double in value. There is therefore an incentive for players who have tokens on an island to cooperate to complete the island, but of course each is trying to get more out of the cooperation than the others. The game ends when one player has used all of his tokens or when no further tiles can be placed, or when the players agree to finish.&#10;&#10;The game can be played either as a race game with all players working simultaneously or as a turns based game. The race game takes about 30-45 minutes to play, while the turns based games takes 60-90 minutes to play. There are a number of optional game elements that can be added once players are comfortable with the basic game: fresh water rights (for water surrounded by land), tribes (clan tokens in a tribe are worth more than on their own), challenges (where a player can try to convert a token to their clan), and resources (owned by the player with the most tokens on the island at the end of the game). Some of these game elements result in a more cooperative styled game while some result in more conflict. Players can mix and match the game elements to produce a style of game that suits their mood or style of play.&#10;&#10;The publisher's website http://sagacity.aires.com.au formerly had more information but appears to be defunct as of mid-2010.&#10;&#10;",

They will be tasked with completing missions for various factions from smuggling and collecting bounties to destroying formidable battle space stations or taking part in massive space battles.&#10;&#10;In Ironclad players collectively control the battleship through its vital Sections (Bridge, Weapons and Hangar) by assigning Heroes and follow a campaign of 10+ scenarios.

    "Description": "Heroes: Write &amp; Conquer is a comprehensive strategy game in a handheld format. Explore territories, build castles, gather troops and search for powerful artifacts.&#10;&#10;In Heroes, each player chooses their own player board of a certain faction.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for 16 rounds.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a round, the first player chooses four actions out of five that all players in that round will perform. The first player writes the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the boxes of the selected actions &mdash; one number per box. The number determines the order in which the action is performed and its level. The higher the number, the later the action is played and the higher its level.&#10;There are 3 types of actions in the game:&#10;&#10;Wood, iron and gold gathering allow you to add as much of that resource to your inventory, as the level of the action is. Resources are needed for building and recruitment.&#10;&#10;Building and recruitment action allows you to build structures and hire units of a corresponding level. Structures give you unique effects, while units are needed to fight with other players, monsters, or to be able to claim fortresses and artifacts.&#10;&#10;Finally, movement allows you to move to other sectors based on the amount of movements points you have in this round. After all players finished their movement, different types of fights can be triggered. Players can fight each other if they happened to be at the same sector, or they can claim a fortress or an artifact of that sector. They can also fight monsters for reward. In order to do that, they&rsquo;ll be spending combat units and compare their strength.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players will count their victory points for the structures built, fortresses and artifacts claimed, resources gathered and monsters defeated.&#10;The player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Millions of poor immigrants were arriving from Europe, and the population of cities on the East Coast swelled enormously. Endless plains and huge mountain ranges &ndash; thinly populated by Native Americans and rich in game, farmland and minerals - started luring large numbers of them. Settlers traveled in wagon trains, and established themselves ever further west until they finally reached California and the Pacific coast.&#10;&#10;The players represent shrewd businessmen who benefit from passing wagon trains, continuously moving westward across the North American continent. It is divided into huge vertical tracts of land: New England, the East Coast, the Great Plains, the Midwest, the West and finally, California.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife were shot dead in Sarajevo, by Gavrilo Princip, member of the Black Hand, a political organization seeking for a merging of the Balkan area into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia.&#10;&#10;Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum against Serbia. As the ultimatum was rejected, Austria-Hungary then declared war, marking the outbreak of the war.&#10;&#10;While France and Russia immediately sided with Serbia, Germany joined the Austria-Hungary and started a surprise offensive in the west with the objective of quickly defeating the French, to then turn east and knock the Tzarist Russia out of the war.&#10;&#10;&#10;1914 is a game of World War I conflict simulation at the strategic level. It recalls the most decisive battles fought by Germany on the Western Front in 1914. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War I.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for two or three players, but has a good solitaire suitability.&#10;&#10;Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over a 64x86 cm multicolor mapboard, with more than 200 wooden components painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into two major sections which can be learned one at a time:&#10;&#10;&bull; The Game Rules introduce the basic concepts and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.&#10;&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Surprise Attack, Retreat, Marne Offensive, British Fusiliers and more.&#10;&#10;In 1914, 1 cm is approximately 27 km, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation, normally corps size with some divisions.&#10;&#10;The game must be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "White Eagle Defiant, the follow-up game to the bestselling Brave Little Belgium, recreates the German, Slovak and Soviet invasion of Poland in September and October 1939 that marked the beginning of the Second World War.  Germany and its Slovakian ally began the invasion on September 1, 1939; the Soviet Union followed suit on the 17th.  Known in Poland as the September Campaign and in Germany by the codename Fall Weiss (Case White), the campaign ended on October 6, 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union splitting the country in two.&#10;  &#10;In White Eagle Defiant, one player controls the Germans, Slovaks and Soviets (simplified as the Germans in the game) while the other player commands the Poles.  The German objective is to gain control of Warsaw and other designated Victory cities while preventing Polish forces from destroying their forts in East Prussia and recapturing Victory cities.  If the German player does so in less time than the historical campaign, they win the game.  Anything less is a draw or a win for the Polish player.&#10;&#10;This quick-playing wargame employs very similar mechanics as Brave Little Belgium, but with a modest increase in complexity. The game uses a point-to-point map and a chit pull mechanism to simulate the campaign, with each turn representing four days. Random event chits are included to add variety and excitement to the game, reflecting the weapons (such as armored trains and aerial bombardment) used at the beginning of World War II.  The combat system, while still simple, is enhanced to better simulate mechanized warfare, as well as the use of combined forces (players can bring forces from adjacent spaces into an attack, creating primary and secondary combat groups).&#10;&#10;Other new features in White Eagle Defiant include Panzers for the Germans (which can roll two dice instead of one) and cavalry for the Poles (which can roll a &ldquo;first shot&rdquo; at the beginning of a combat round). A Victory Point track allows for variable entry of Soviet forces (depending on the success of the German player in capturing Victory cities), as well as the possibility of the Allies launching an attack in the West (if the German player fails to do well in capturing Victory cities). Finally, a &ldquo;blitzkrieg breakdown&rdquo; track is used by the German player; if the turn ends before both German army group chits are pulled, the German player may elect to activate a group, but possibly suffer a &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; while doing so &ndash; and if five such breakdowns occur, the German player automatically loses the game.&#10;&#10;Players who enjoyed Brave Little Belgium will find that White Eagle Defiant offers the same tense play for both sides, while presenting new challenges that reflect the dawn of the blitzkrieg era.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Isekai is a popular genre in Japanese culture, where characters travel to a different world. The game runs in just such a fantasy world that is set on 'an another world where persons of real world reincarnate to', and is full of the flavor text typical of the genre.&#10;&#10;The mechanism of the game focuses on how much players can play by expanding reproduction without stress.&#10;&#10;There is no direct attack with cards but the main interactions between players are through area control and quick taking of certain actions.&#10;&#10;Each game play will go on differently due to each of the event cards are all unique (no duplicated cards in 105 cards total) and the other characters (who have unique ability) is dispatched to another player.&#10;&#10;The game is inspired closely by the game Terraforming Mars, a favourite game of the designer.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#142;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#230;&#157;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#134;&#146;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#130;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#231;&#181;&#140;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#229;&#174;&#159;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#187;&#162;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#232;&#166;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#133;&#229;&#174;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#139;&#161;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#134;&#141;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#231;&#148;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#232;&#166;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#230;&#142;&#165;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#136;105&#231;&#168;&#174;105&#230;&#158;&#154;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#143;&#151;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#229;&#172;&#162;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#229;&#184;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#175;&#142;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#177;&#149;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Shiloh was an important American Civil War battle fought in April 1862. A surprise Confederate attack, led by Albert Sydney Johnston, nearly swept encamped Union defenders into the Tennessee River. The next day, a reinforced Union army counter-attacked and drove the CSA line back in confusion and retreat. A CSA victory might have ruined the career of General Ulysses S. Grant. Instead, the battle ended with a Union victory, the death of Johnston, and the eventual demise of Confederate hopes in the West. Days 1 and 2 can be played separately or together.&#10;&#10;Shiloh was initially developed from the Gettysburg: Badges of Courage game system. However, the game mechanics have been completely overhauled. The map is divided into large areas and combat is resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division or corps. The game plays smoothly and quickly; each player gets to play one day on offense and one day on defense for a great gaming experience. Game time is 2-4 hours for both days of Shiloh.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The city of Gads Hill was founded in 1872, and it gained popularity through the first train robbery in Missouri committed by the James Younger gang. Today, there is hardly anything that remains of Gads Hill &mdash; only a sign at the place where the gang stopped the train gives evidence of the earlier existence of the city. How did Gads Hill look like 140 years ago? Where did the duels take place? Where was the hotel located where the Pinkerton detectives spent the night? Where had the Younger brothers been seen?&#10;&#10;Take your part on reconstructing the city in Gads Hill 1874. The player who brings the most relevant information to this reconstruction project wins the game.&#10;&#10;Gads Hill 1874 is based on the concept of the award-winning game Old Town.&#10;&#10;",

Place the rooster on the &quot;move a figure&quot; action space on your side of the 3x3 game board, leaving your two &quot;add a figure&quot; actions exposed.&#10;&#10;On a turn, move your rooster to an open action space on your side of the board. If you choose &quot;add&quot;, then place one of your figures on the board by following the placement rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a donkey only on an empty space.&#10;    Place a dog on an empty space or on an unencumbered donkey.&#10;    Place a cat on an empty space or on an unencumbered dog.&#10;&#10;&#10;For a &quot;move&quot; action, choose an animal on the game board and move it to a new location while following the placement rules. You can move a portion of a stack; you cannot reverse the opponent's previous move.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player creates an orthogonal or diagonal row with three of the same animals on top, that player wins. If a player is forced to add an animal (because their rooster occupies the lone &quot;move&quot; action) but cannot, they lose.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dinosaur Table Battles is a game about dinosaurs fighting each other for some reason. As in the original Table Battles game &mdash; which apparently is going to be called &quot;Human Table Battles&quot; from now on &mdash; players roll dice, then assign them to cards representing their fighting forces. Removing the dice triggers an attack, but that attack might be reacted to &mdash; whether absorbed, blocked, or countered &mdash; if the opposing player removes dice from a card with a reaction. The trick is that if you can react, you must react, and if you do react, you don't get to attack on your next turn. Mastering tempo is key to your success.&#10;&#10;The thing about this game, though, is that it has dinosaurs, and dinosaurs are pretty big guys and gals &mdash; so big, in fact, that each dino spans two or three cards, giving them an assortment of attacks, reactions, and rule-breaking special abilities. During set-up, players draft a team of dinosaurs, creating unique synergies to be exploited and disadvantages to be mitigated. There are over 900,000 different matches possible, and while that might not be enough to keep you occupied for 200 million years, it's probably close enough.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When the salmon leap up the waterfalls as they hike upriver, the Grizzly family is overjoyed!&#10;&#10;Players play bears whose role is to catch more salmon than your fellow players. There are most of them at the edge of the waterfall. But beware: That's where it is the slipperiest!&#10;&#10;How to play Grizzly:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each player starts with his bear on the Bear Rock. There are already salmon in the gullies. &#10;     At the start of each turn, the starting player rolls all dice. Depending on the result, the water moves in the river or salmon jump up the waterfall.&#10;     Afterwards, all players, beginning with the starting player in turn, move their bears. If you land on a field with salmon, collect it under your bear. &#10;     When the players and their bear return to the Bear Rock, secure the salmon they collect before heading back to the river. &#10;     If a bear is too close to the edge of the waterfall and the water moves in the gutter, the bear slides down and loses its collected salmon, which he has not yet brought back to Bear Rock. He starts again from the bear rock. &#10;     The game ends when enough water has flowed down the river or all salmon have been collected down the waterfall. Whoever has collected the most salmon wins. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

These are given point values depending on their size or importance, ranging between 1 and 3. The castles are linked to numerous movement areas by tracks meaning that some of the castles are in powerful positions (especially those providing or guarding a river bridge) and others are stuck out on a limb. At the start of the game, the castles aren't owned by anyone and the winner of the game is the one with the most points of captured castles at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from AP website:)&#10;&#10;Panzer Grenadier finally moves to the Pacific with this game of the intense fighting between U.S. Marines and Japanese soldiers and marines in the tense weeks of 1942. Twenty-four scenarios are included. Guadalcanal is a stand-alone game; no other game from the series is required to play any of the 24 scenarios.&#10;&#10;Guadalcanal introduces several types of Marine units: Marine rifle, parachute and Raider units plus scouts. The Marines usually have very good morale, and have excellent leadership and strong firepower. Where they&rsquo;re at time lacking is in support weapons: The Army gets first call on tanks and artillery, and the Marine versions on Guadalcanal are not up to the high quality of the riflemen.&#10;&#10;Japan counters with Army and navy units of low firepower but fanatically high morale. Japanese artillery isn&rsquo;t very good, their handful of tanks will barely keep out rifle bullets, and there are few direct support weapons. The key to Japanese success will be to enter close combat with the Marines, where the Japanese warrior spirit can be used to full advantage.&#10;&#10;Scenarios cover a wide variety of actions. The maps, thought by many to be the most beautiful in the Panzer Grenadier series, cover &ldquo;historical&rdquo; terrain rather than the generic coverage of most other games in the series.&#10;&#10;",

The game features a random activation mechanism that makes it always compelling and different, creating chaos and uncertainty, in a realistic and tense simulation.&#10;&#10;The heart of the system is the command: simply check how many points you have in the turn, choose the formations you will activate, put them inside a mug;  your opponent does the same, then mix and draw.&#10;&#10;GAME SCALE&#10;- Complexity: 2 out of 5 &#10;- Solitaire Suitability: 4 out of 5 &#10;- Time Scale: Three hours turn&#10;- Map Scale: 1km/hex &#10;- Unit Scale: Regiments with their guns, battalions, two squadrons of cavalry&#10;- Players: one or two &#10;- Playing Time: two to six hours&#10;&#10;WHAT'S IN THE BOX?&#10;- One 22 x 34 inch map (55,8 x 86,5 cm)&#10;- 216 counters  &#10;- Two player aid, colored cardboard (Terrain effect chart and Fast placement sheet) &#10;- Rule Booklet (with complete order of battle, game tips, campaign history and sources) &#10;- One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Included scenarios  - In addition to the basic game, there are some scenarios and variants that allow for shorter games and explore other strategies:&#10;- Mortara and the Sforzesca, the Piedmontese attempt to stop the Austrian advance &#10;- Novara, the bloody final battle &#10;- Ramorino obeys orders; this scenario allows the Piedmontese to deploy the V division at the beginning of the game&#10;&#10;",

Wooden blocks are used for fog of war.  This campaign involves point to point land and water zone movement.  Group movement can only be done with commanders and some commanders can move faster than others. The British win by capturing Washington or reducing his army and holding New York City at the end of the game.  The Americans win by avoiding British victory or reducing the British army to less than 20 strength points.  Quick playing, deep strategy, and battles that show the weakness of militia facing trained professionals.&#10;&#10;The New York 1776 campaign of the American Revolution  pitted a newly formed American army, comprised of Continentals and militia, facing a large, highly disciplined British army that included a significant number of Hessian soldiers. This campaign involved the largest number of troops of the war. An inexperienced army faced a very experienced one. It unfolded with an intricate set of maneuvers around New York City and its waterways involving a large British fleet executing numerous amphibious landings in an effort to trap the Colonials. It was truly the best opportunity the British had for capturing Washington and America&rsquo;s entire army. Historically, the Americans just barely escaped to live and fight another day. Can you, as the British player, defeat the American army and end their revolution in its infancy? Or as the American player can you, like Washington, defend your country while avoiding disaster?  The decisions are yours&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

Each is broken down into 5 phases, as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a Constraint card,&#10;     Start the sandtimer,&#10;     Arrange the garden,&#10;     Check the garden,&#10;     Prepare for the next round.&#10;&#10;&#10;During the game, players cannot communicate in any way about what to do or not to do to make the garden.&#10;&#10;Will you satisfy the King's whimsical desires?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Though a Corsair enters the Expanse with but a single old ship and a handful of loyal crew, they may eventually command up to three customized ships, a trio of cargo shuttles, and more than a dozen squads of seasoned soldiers. Ships can be upgraded, territory claimed, and rivals fought both in space and on the ground. Conflict with other Corsairs is likely as each attempts to increase his or her reputation by demonstrating political influence, technical savvy, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to secure the Expanse.&#10;&#10;During his or her turn a player will move their ships and choose actions from one of four categories (Technology, Politics, Personnel, or Finance), - deploying troops to hold territory and positioning resources where they are most needed.

    "Description": "Final Fantasy VIII contained a sub game called &quot;Triple Triad.&quot;  This game was actually sold in card form.  Boosters only.  10 cards per booster.  5 game cards, 5 visual art cards.  No modifications made.  Now internet play has been fan-made.  Only published in Japan to my knowledge.&#10;&#10;Basically, this is a modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe.  Play is on a 3x3 grid.  Each player has 5 cards he does not show the other player.  Cards are two-sided, one pink, one blue.  Cards are based on characters and monsters from the game.  There are &quot;levels&quot; of cards, each level containing monsters, guardian forces (summon monsters), or player characters (highest level).  Each player chooses a color.  Randomly determine who goes first.  Place a card on the grid.  Each card has a &quot;compass rose&quot; of 4 different numbers, 1-9, and then A representing 10.  Higher levels contain higher numbers.  If I place a card with the number 4 at it's north, and you place a card with a number 5 at it's south directly above mine, you &quot;flip&quot; mine, and both are now your color.  You are trying to get the most cards to your color.  You can &quot;chain&quot; cards too.  If you flip a card, it can flip other cards.  Each card is only flipped once per turn.  Some cards have an elemental symbol on them, giving a +1 number bonus against anything not of that element.&#10;&#10;The nice thing is you only need 5 cards.  In FFVIII, you could actually take one of your opponent's cards they played with if you won.  House rules for this type of play vary.&#10;&#10;",

But be careful, as he is so much whimsical that he changes his mind so often; the thing he loved to play with may not be his kind anymore a minute after!&#10;&#10;&#10;    In this game, Alex is represented in a tile, and it is two-sided; one side is red colored and the other is blue colored.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Catchy! players play ordinary trick-taking game in which the latter player must follow the suit, if possible. Two players take turn to play one card for one trick, and if both two players play &ldquo;odd&rdquo; numbers, Alex flips to the other side; red side being up, it flips to the blue, and vice versa.&#10;Then, he moves towards one of the players by one step according to the rule following: if its red side is up, he moves to the player who took the trick, and if its blue side is up, he moves to the other, s/he who did not take the trick.&#10;After players&rsquo; hands have been exhausted, or Alex has moved into one players field, arms, one round ends and the player who has Alex closer to him/her scores points.&#10;Rounds are played on and on until one player gains 7 points, then s/he who has 7 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;As you may see, in this game, even in one round, you sometimes have to become eager to take tricks and sometimes you do not. This tricky twist is the core of Catchy!&#10;&#10;This game is small (only 17 cards used), but needing its players to think strategically and concentrate on making most of their hand.&#10;This portable game surely takes you to a cute but strategical &ldquo;catchy&rdquo; world anytime, anywhere, and anywhere you are with.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As gamers, many of us grew up building armies for their favorite wargame, and many hours were spent in epic pitched battles, straining our tactical and strategical skills. A lot has changed since then, but we believe we can keep the same magical feeling, providing a faster and more adrenaline-filled game experience.&#10;&#10;Warstones is a tactical army-building game, with a dexterity mechanism at its core. Choose your units, deploy them on the battlefield, then flick... eh... lead them! Control key areas to gain victory points, defeat enemy units or just push away the strongest. Dexterity is just one of the countless features of Warstones. Army building provides a lot of options and flexibility, so even if you don't believe in your flicking skills, don't worry! There are different kind of armies, and plenty of room for customization; you will find the army that works for you!&#10;&#10;&quot;Low profile, don't lose control!&quot; thought Bramhun while crossing an unknown tavern's door. Wildlife sought shelter from an unnatural cold in the southernmost regions of the kingdom that year. That's why many dwarven hunters like him found themselves lost in such hostile lands.&#10;&#10;&quot;Adapt to the situation, even if it means compromising with the enemy.&quot; Facing the long journey back to home would have put himself and that big load of skin in danger. Mokgul, an orc all covered in blood and tannin, suddenly turned his head and sized up the unwelcome guest, like many other inn patrons did. He closed the door. The curious barrel on his back couldn't be ignored. A complex, twisted rod made of wood and iron &mdash; a ridiculous dwarven hunting tool, indeed.&#10;&#10;Brahmun spoke to the orc behind an heavy wooden counter. &quot;Where's the tanner?&quot; The innkeeper pointed at a table by the fireplace with a nod. The light of the fire shone off Mokgul's face. On his table, there was a pelt with a map carved into it. You might have seen three rudimentary towers lying on it, and many rounded and flat stones, painted with stylized warriors, too.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you want from me, dwarf?&quot; said Mokgul, while he was just staring at the table.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't like doing business with you just as much as you don't like doing business with me, but I got a considerable amount of skins, precious as...gold.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sure, but I think I could smash your dwarven head and take your stuff instead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Be my guest, but I'm not that naive. They are hidden far away from here, mate. If I die, you won't find them, ever, and you will lose your share.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mokgul suddenly stood up, then raised his voice to get attention: &quot;And what if me and my mates force you to tell us where all your goods are, in exchange for the opportunity to see sunrise tomorrow and to walk out of here on your two feet?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fine! Here's the deal: I'm gonna give you all my goods and all my money, but you have to defeat me. On the other hand, if I win, you will pay me twice their value!&quot;&#10;&#10;After that statement everyone in the room gathered round the table yelling &quot;Warstones! Warstones!&quot; Bramhun came up to the table and collected a handful of painted stones. With a quick movement of his fingers he flicked a stone right behind one of the towers: The war of stones had just begun!&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to place a set of three equal cards on each square, including # and *. At the beginning, each player starts with three cards. As soon as the hourglass is turned over, gameplay becomes fast-paced: Players can draw or discard cards. In order to win the game, however, an exchange of cards with their neighbors is indispensable. The cards may not be passed on freely, however. Each card shows an arrow that indicates whether the right or left neighbor can be traded with and they must be ready to return a suitable card. Jokers allow you to replace missing cards. Once a player has a set of three equal cards in hand, they can place it on the appropriate space, either cracking part of the code or earning extra time. Storing time cards allows you to turn the hourglass over and earn valuable seconds. If the code can be cracked so that all fields are filled with the appropriate cards, the players have won together and can compete in another level.&#10;&#10;",

You need to discover a way to stop the tragedies from occurring, but there is a Mastermind whose sole purpose is to make sure they unfold. Can you stop the tragedies before the last loop?!&#10;&#10;In Tragedy Looper: New Tragedies, 1-3 players are Protagonists attempting to escape a time loop engineered by one player acting as the Mastermind. The Mastermind player selects a script, either one of the 13 scripts included or one created themselves, and sets up the game accordingly. The Protagonist players don't yet know the details of the tragic events about to unfold.&#10;&#10;Protagonists and the Mastermind will play cards, activate abilities, and trigger incidents to uncover (or hide!) information and move the events forward. Players will interact with different characters and build relationships with them in order to unlock and activate those characters' helpful special abilities, but of course the Mastermind is attempting to trick and mislead the Protagonists. At the end of each loop, if the Protagonists haven't guessed correctly, they rewind all game components back to the start and try again with more information. If they don't guess correctly on the final loop, the Mastermind wins!&#10;&#10;The Tragedy Looper system creates a unique game of deduction in which players begin each new loop better prepared, but the Mastermind player will know what they've learned and can alter their strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Tragedy Looper: New Tragedies is a standalone game that brings content from original publisher BakaFire into English for the first time, collecting 13 scripts and 30 characters. This game includes a teaching guide for the Mastermind and a &quot;First Steps&quot; tragedy set for the first two scripts to help players get more comfortable with the gameplay loop. Experienced masterminds can also create their own scripts.&#10;&#10;",

I remember fondly two incidents:&#10;&#10;In the first, a knight met a Dwarf on a horse. Deciding to approach and meet him (instead of avoiding or charging), the dwarf turned out to be a knight in disguise&mdash;but not just any knight! It was Lancelot, the foremost knight of the realm! We had a sudden vision of the hollowed-out horse necessary to hide Lancelot's bulk&hellip;&#10;&#10;In another incident, a player led a charmed life and pulled ahead of the others in their quest for the Holy Grail. He met Merlin repeatedly and ended up with a special charger, magic lance, and magic shield&mdash;the works! England wasn't much of a challenge for him any more, so he decided to cross the Channel to France. Bad move! His ship sank in a storm so he washed up on the shore minus all his equipment and followers. Dejected, he trudged to the nearest castle to ask for help&mdash;but a giant jumped out of the moat and killed him in one blow!&#10;&#10;The game has heavy role-playing elements to it; articles in Dragon Magazine, Issue# 58 explained how one could play knaves (bad knights), and GMs have been known to use the game as an adventure generator for RPGs.&#10;&#10;",

There are no combat results tables. Combat and all checks are resolved using six-sided dice, in which results of 5-6 mark success, and 1-4 failure. Brigades activate via chit pull, with their constituent units moving and fighting individually. Stacking is limited to two units per hex. Massive 1.5&rdquo; hexes allow two 3/4&rdquo; units to fit side by side&hellip; no information is obscured!&#10;&#10;Distinctions are made between formed and unformed infantry, deployed and limbered artillery, mounted and dismounted cavalry. Unit facing is not an element of play. Instead, unit deployment in adjacent hexes can trigger pass-through fire, which simulates flanking fire, or fire on compressed lines (both dangerous situations for civil war units).&#10;&#10;Battle Cards introduce an element of uncertainty and excitement to play. Unique off-map displays track every brigade's reserves and casualties. Once a unit's reserves are used up, it becomes exhausted and liable to break.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 100 yards / 91 meters&#10;Units: Regiments and Batteries&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Four 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets (1.5&quot;/38mm hex size)&#10;Four dual-side printed countersheets (520 .75&quot;/19mm counters)&#10;One  dual-side printed countersheet  (228 .5&quot;/12.7mm counters)&#10;One  24-page full color rulebook&#10;One  36-page full color scenario book&#10;Five dual-side printed brigade display player aid cards&#10;Two  dual-side printed activation track display player aid cards&#10;Two  dual-side printed sequence of play/terrain effects/combat chart player aid cards&#10;One  deck of 52 battle playing cards&#10;Two  save rolls playing cards&#10;Six  off-board artillery playing cards&#10;Six 6-sided dice (3 blue/3 gray)&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-high&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-4 hours&#10;&#10;",

To collect seed cards, take all cards from the five-card display that share a color or share the number of seeds; if you end up with more than seven cards, discard to seven, losing 1 point for each wasted card. Planting flowers requires you to match the seed requirements of the different flowers in the display. Orchids are harder to match, but earn the most points. Once one player has at least seven flowers, everyone else has one more turn to plant, then you tally your points, earning a bonus if you have at least four types of flowers. Whoever has the most flower points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stellar Drift: Pull &amp; Write is a roll-and-write game about repairing your broken spaceship for 1 to 5 players. Each player is the captain of their own heavily damaged ship, drifting in orbit around an unstable white dwarf star. The captains must quickly conduct emergency repairs to their ships using whatever materials they can find, before the star decides to go nova and wipe them all out.&#10;&#10;Stellar Drift is played over seven rounds. At the beginning of each round, the players draw random colored cubes out of a shared central bag. These cubes represent the resources the players have that round. Each player may then spend those cubes to move around their ship, conducting repairs as they go. Each player has their own separate game sheet with a spaceship-shaped grid on it, and squares in this grid are marked off as the players move through them. Play is simultaneous, players are all pulling cubes from the bag and marking off their sheets at the same time. Each ship grid square costs some cubes of specific color(s), and gives the player rewards in the form of movement on their 'ship status' tracks, which gives various benefits such as more resources, special abilities, and victory points.&#10;&#10;At the end of the seven rounds, players tally up the victory points they scored for successfully restoring the various ship systems. Most points wins! A game of Stellar Drift typically takes between 30 to 45 minutes, regardless of the number of players. Stellar Drift is intended for players ages 14 and up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publiser&#10;&#10;",

There's no time to lose; your help is required, and you must lead an evacuation operation to get your people to safety. Rescue them in time!&#10;&#10;The game board in Meltdown 2020 is composed of twelve tiles, each consisting of seven hexes. Seven nuclear reactors and two airfields are scattered amongst the landscape hexes that make up the remainder of the country. At the start of the game, your color-coded twenty people and three vehicles (car, bus, helicopter) are placed on their designated hexes. You need to get them to the airfields to save them, preferably before they absorb too much radiation. You can airlift a vehicle out of an airfield, too, to save the driver, but then you have fewer opportunities to save more people.&#10;&#10;Each turn proceeds as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Radiation outburst &ndash; Roll the eight-sided die and place a radiation counter on the numbered reactor (or nowhere if an 8 is rolled).&#10;    Move buses &ndash; In player order, move a bus up to two spaces, with a maximum of four passengers at any one time. You can pick up and drop your color-coded passengers as you wish. Vehicles can't enter a reactor hex and can't end the turn in the same space as another player's vehicle (except the airfield, which holds any number of vehicles).&#10;    Radiation outburst &ndash; Same as above.&#10;    Move cars &ndash; Same movement rules, but cars can move up to three spaces while holding at most three passengers.&#10;    Radiation reparation &ndash; Roll the eight-sided die, then remove a radiation counter (if present) from the numbered reactor.&#10;    Move helicopters &ndash; Same movement rules, but helicopters can move up to four spaces while holding at most two passengers.&#10;    Radiation sickness &ndash; People next to a reactor absorb 1 Sievert radiation (1 Sv) for each counter on a reactor. People one space away absorb that many Sv minus one; people two spaces away absorb that many minus two; and so on. A person can absorb radiation from more than one reactor.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a person's token absorbs 1 Sv, lay it on its side to show that it's ill; when it absorbs 2 Sv, lay it on its back (very ill); a person absorbing 3 Sv or more dies and is removed. Radiation sickness is cumulative. People stay in their positions even after being evacuated. Vehicle drivers die only if they absorb 3 Sv or more from a single reactor in a single turn.&#10;&#10;The start player position rotates each round. The game ends immediately when one reactor receives a fifth counter or a 16th counter is to be placed on the game board. The player who has rescued the most people wins. In case of a tie, the player with more healthy people wins, with subsequent ties being broken by the number of ill vs. very ill people.&#10;&#10;",
