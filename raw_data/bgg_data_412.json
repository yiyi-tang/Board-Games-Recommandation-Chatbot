    "Description": "From the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;You are the captain of an oil supertanker. Your objective is to outmaneuver the other captains and be the first to collect and deliver your cargo of crude oil to the refinery. Chart your course to navigate the environmentally sensitive waters and the hazards of the savage seas. Be prepared to face the consequences of human error. Each roll of the dice presents new obstacles and calls for different strategies. You will be rewarded for your environmental foresight. Reefs, Ice Floes and Oil Pirates make this an exciting adventure, challenging all captains.&#10;&#10;Bon Voyage!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;[i]On March 24, 1989 the tanker Exxon Valdez crashed into Bligh Reef and spilled nearly eleven million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. The environmental effects were catastrophic.&#10;&#10;It was not the first Oil Spill.&#10;It was not the last Oil Spill.&#10;&#10;Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned.&#10;This game will help people become more aware of oil transportation and methods of preparation for and prevention of oil spills.&quot;&#10;&#10;Incredibly over-produced, and apparently incredibly random roll-and-move game, with tons of chance cards, most of which punish the player for lack of environmental foresight...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Another late sixties Ideal game released in a deep square box.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a plastic circular arena with four handles evenly spaced around the circumference.  There is a hole in the center of the arena which leads to a lower collecting area; this lower structure also serves to support the game and it must not leave the playing surface during gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each player selects &amp; holds 3 marbles of a particular color and grips a 'wrestling handle' with their other hand.  Marbles are simultaneously entered into the arena.  Players use the handles to manipulate the arena, trying to force opponents' marbles into the central hole while keeping their own marbles active.&#10;&#10;The player owning the last remaining marble in the arena is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike common trivia games, there are no question and answers, instead the terms non-question and non-answer are used. A specific song along with the first part of a lyric contained in that song, the year the song became popular, and the name of the performing artist is read to the player. The player then must complete the rest of the lyric from that song in order to advance his playing piece.&#10;&#10;&lt;The categories are: Beginning of rock and roll and popular music (1950-1963); British invasion music (1964-1979); Music from movies, TV, musicals, seasonal songs and all time favorites; Progressive rock and roll and popular music (1964-1969); New rock and roll and popular music (1970-1979); Beginning lyrics from any previously mentioned category&#10;&#10;Includes gameboard, 90 discs containing 2,160 different non-question &amp; non-answer lyrics in a black storage box, 6 disc holders for rotating discs, a fold able rack to display and hold disc holders during play, plastic storage bag for 6 plastic record holders, 30 plastic records, 12 scoring tokens, 1 6 sided die, and instructions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At the beginning of the game, each player places a randomly selected sign/label on their head that only the other players can see. This sign/label either says &quot;I'm supposed to be stupid&quot;, &quot;I'm supposed to be smart&quot;, &quot;I can't win&quot; or &quot;I can't lose&quot;. Each player in turn moves one of their three playing pieces from a start position around a dartboard-shaped board. &#10;The playing field has various colored and uncolored spaces on it. Movement is done by using dice rolls and following arrows on the board. &#10;Every time the player lands on a colored space they must claim that space by performing a &quot;Stupid Stunt&quot; from the rule book. Failure to perform the stunts means the player must start over.&#10;Each player is trying to land on either three spaces of the same color if they think they have a smart sign/label on their head or three different colored spaces if they think they have a stupid sign/label on their head. Once they get the three spaces they want they stand up and shout they are smart or stupid. If they are correct in their guess they win, if not they get a new label and start over.&#10;&#10;",

This is primarily achieved by income received from producing oil wells. The winner is the first player to collect $20 million dollars, or the one with the most money after time runs out.&#10;&#10;The board is divided into 4 areas; Knife River, Apache Run, Big Muddy &amp; Black Basin. Players roll the dice and travel around the board clockwise. As the player moves around the board, they collect oil lease cards and begin drilling for oil.&#10;&#10;As play continues, the players collect pay day, which grows based on the amount of producing oil wells. They also can experience wells running dry, leases expiring, and they can purchase insurance. New years begin, they can face windfall profit taxes, receive golden oil drop cards, refinery bonuses, go bankrupt, and they may make deals amongst each other.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;TOKTONG PASS&mdash;ESCAPE FROM CHOSIN is a detailed new ATS system game that tells the story of the Korean War from the perspective of the men of the 1st Marine Division, retreating from the Chosin Reservoir in the face of a massive onslaught by Chinese Communist troops. The Marines knew there was only one way out from Chosin, and that was to fight their way out, outnumbered and amidst some of the most hostile terrain on earth&mdash;harsh, hilly and frozen. The Marines could only bring their superior elan and small arms to bear against an enemy determined to annihilate every American soldier north of the 38th Parallel. Frostbite was an indiscriminate enemy while every hilltop captured by the Chinese had to be re-taken, every breach in the Marine perimeter repaired by force, without delay.&#10;&#10;TOKTONG PASS&mdash;ESCAPE FROM CHOSIN delivers unheralded action and suspense at the scale and level of detail true tactical-level enthusiasts demand&mdash;individual squads, weapons and tanks. All the subtle nuances of small unit actions are provided by the acclaimed ATS system: gun duels; separate pivoting turrets; AFV indirect fire; coaxial machine-guns; melee; smoke; armor penetration; morale; AFV overruns; and much more. And it is all accomplished using a detailed yet intuitive system that models tanks using discrete armor values at turret, superstructure, lower hull and track aspects and front, side and rear facings. The ATS system provides for the realistic use of High Explosive and Armor Piercing ammunition. All this without the need for side notes or plotting moves and in a solitaire-friendly presentation.&#10;&#10;BEGIN PLAY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY using the provided BASIC GAME RULES and TRAINING MAPSHEET that take moments to read and allows you to get your units down on the game map within minutes.&#10;&#10;IN EACH GAME YOU GET:&#10;&#10;* A complete collection of color die-cut counters in 1/2&rdquo;, 5/8&rdquo; and 3/4&rdquo; sizes, representing the tanks, guns, and infantry that fought in the Korean War.&#10;      providing the tanks, guns, and men that fought in the battle depicted;&#10;    * A two part game box&#10;    * A colorful and accurate game map on heavyweight stock.&#10;    * The latest edition of the ATS rules of play;&#10;    * Scenarios and Play Aids printed on separate heavyweight cards;&#10;    * Two ten-sided dice.&#10;&#10;",

So the fort has the size of a large 4 x 4 square enclosing 4 squares like a court.&#10;From the two sides of the boards opposing the fort two players start from given starting points with four &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; to reach the fort. &#10;The &ldquo;tourists move in a kind of three-dimensional &ldquo;knight-move&rdquo;, so, after two steps on the same level it can jump one step vertically, or even after one step on the same level two steps vertically. This means that on the flat &ldquo;desert&rdquo; they have to cross first on their way to the fort, the figures are quite lame. For this there are four &ldquo;helping stones&rdquo;, which can be used as a stair. But you can not just put them wherever you want, but on the imaginary cross-points constituted by two movable strategic bars on the side of the board. Each of these bars contains three marks, so there are nine cross points where you can build &ldquo;helping stones&rdquo;.&#10;In each turn a player can move one of his &ldquo;tourists&rdquo;, one &ldquo;helping stone&rdquo; or one bar to constitute new points.&#10;The player who first enters the fort with three of his figures, one of them on a tower, is winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

It is, rather, a playable game... a framework around which you can build as elaborate set of rules as you wish.&quot;...&quot;The game is extremely bloody.&quot;&#10;The game is intended for 1:1200 miniatures on a table top of at least 3' by 5'.  Each turn represents 5 minutes of real time, and ships move 1&quot; (100 yards) for every knot of speed.  Each ship gets a card with hit boxes for armor, speed, midships, stacks, draft, guns, and battering ram.  A ship is sunk when all draft boxes are gone.  Forts get similar cards.&#10;The rules are only about 12 pages, plus a couple more for charts, pictures and background data.  There are charts for penetrating and non-penetrating gunfire, critical hits, lucky hits, ramming, minefields, and loss of stack.  There are also three different turning circles.&#10;&#10;",

Enclosed you'll find 150 questions in each of five categories - Geography, History, Media, People and Variety - all related to Richmond.  We hope that this game will serve several purposes.  First, it is a game... a competition to see who knows Richmond best.  Second, it is a hometown keepsake...  a collection of Richmond where's, when's, and what's.&#10;&#10;The questions in the game are a little outdated, having been made in 1985.&#10;&#10;",

It combines magnetic poetry with the concept of poetry slams and a 12x24 (magnetic) gameboard.&#10;&#10;The game's word tiles will be familiar to anyone who knows magnetic poetry. There are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and endings. A miscellaneous category includes adverbs, conjunctions, pronouns, and prepositions. A rating assigned to each word reflects the difficulty of using that word in the magnetic poetry slam (1=easy; 8=obscure word) and doubles as the scoring mechanism.&#10;&#10;Each player creates a line or a poem up to six words in length each turn. Second and subsequent lines/poems must include at least one word from those already on the board. The sum of the difficulty rating determines the score for the line or poem. The magnetic grid includes bonus cells, which add points to the play.&#10;&#10;",

Lee lead the Army of Northern Virginia deep into Union territory in hopes of capturing vital northern supply cities and forcing an early end to the American Civil War. The Union army, finding itself in the middle of yet another high level reorganization and command change after the debacle at Chancellorsville, was slow to respond. What followed was the largest and most important single battle of the war, and in American history.&#10;&#10;But things could have been different. Find out how in this exciting new game from Deer Valley Game Company. Not another re-make of the Battle of Gettysburg; this game re-creates the entire Gettysburg Campaign - Lee's 1863 Summer Offensive. Now you are in charge!&#10;&#10;This operational level game uses the block unit system to re-create the limited intelligance of the actual campaign. Players maneuver their forces without adequate knowledge of their opponents strengths or even location. The game board portrays the eastern part of the country, from southern Pennsylvania to northern Virginia, with a point to point movement system on a 30 x 22 playing map. Limited command abilities and critical supply wagons are key to managing your armies and achieving victory.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike programmed electronic games, no two games will ever be alike.&#10;&#10;Take your favorite team to the FINAL FOUR!!!!&#10;&#10;It's great fun!!!&#10;&#10;Game includes: Team Rosters, Scoresheet Pads, Game Instructions, Scoresheet Instructions, Game Scoring Pads, Dice, Dice Cup&#10;&#10;- - - - - -&#10;&#10;Now, after reading the instructions, here's how the game works.&#10;&#10;Coaches choose their starting lineup and allocate the players to a position (two forwards, two guards, and a center).  Then, they roll dice and confer with a standard results table (same table used for any team that plays--ie, there are no considerations for team or individual player talent level).  Repeat this until game is over.&#10;&#10;Hence, the game is not realistic in the sense that Clemson can beat UNC just as easily as UNC can beat Georgia Tech.&#10;&#10;The box cover shows the logos of the then-eight teams in the ACC.  Inside the box are all-star rosters for each of those teams (that is, players from different years play together), plus eight other teams (Georgetown, Indiana, Louisville, Marquette, UNLV, Notre Dame, St. Johns, and UCLA).  For whatever reason, Abdul-Jabbar/Alcindor is not included on the all-time UCLA team.&#10;&#10;That's about it.  A basketball simulation with specified rosters, but you can list your own buddies names and get the same results when you take on the all-time all-star UNC Tarheels.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seems to be a variation of Yahtzee, themed for the track &amp; field event--the Decathlon.  Each player rolls four blue dice and two red dice five times in succession, locking in only 1 red die and any number of blue dice each turn.&#10;&#10;The blue dice constitute the event (e.g. if you can get three 1s out of your 4 blue dice, you have qualified for the first event, the 100-meter run; if you can get two 3s and two 4s out of your 4 blue dice, you have qualified for the 8th event, the pole vault).  Fail to qualify for one of the first 9 events (not matching one of the necessary patterns with the blue dice) and you can use your rolls as one leg of the 10th event, the 1500-meter run.  In essence, these are free failure rolls.&#10;&#10;The red dice, summed together, are your score for the particular event.  So, if you lock in three 1s and any other blue die, after four rolls, you have rolled all 5 red dice.  If your red dice are 6, 5, 5, 3, and 4 then you score 23 for the 100-meter dash.  Any event with a score of less than 15 means you aren't Olympic caliber, so you don't even get to peg your score on the board...&#10;&#10;Speaking of which, that's the &quot;peg&quot; part of the name.  There is a cribbage-like board where players peg their event tallies.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Although the Milton Bradley logo appears prominently on the box, this is apparently a self-published or prototype game.  No copyright or authorship information is included with the game.&#10;&#10;The materials are hand-made.  The box looks like a standard gift box with artwork pasted on.  The box insert and game base are constructed of foam board; the building pieces are thin, hand-painted wood or fiberboard.  There are three kinds of slats, all parallelograms.  Large red slats are notched at the end, large green slats at the ends and sides, and smaller yellow slats are notched at the corners.&#10;&#10;Per the instructions, three slats are inserted in slots in the foam base and then the players take turns building a structure, adding slats by mating the notches.  If the structure falls or bends enough to touch the table anywhere but the base, the last player loses.&#10;&#10;The notches are inconsistently cut, so it's nearly impossible to play - sometimes you can't get the pieces together, and sometimes they fit too loose.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Turm &amp; W&auml;chter (Tower &amp; Guard) is a simple abstract 2-player game that is played on a 7x7 grid. Each player starts with 7 Tower-stones and 1 Guard-stone. The aim of the game is to use these stones to capture your opponent's all important Guard-stone, or to occupy the starting position of this stone with your own Guard.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player can move one stone, or one stack of stones. How far (forwards, backwards or sideways, but never diagonal) is determined by the height of the stack. It is possible to move only a part of a stack if you don't want to move the full possible distance, but it is not allowed to jump over any other stones in this path. A move can end on a friendly Tower-stone or -stack, but Guard-stones can never become part of a stack.&#10;&#10;It is possible to capture enemy stones by landing on them, under certain conditions. Guard-stones can always land on any enemy stone or stack and likewise, anything can land on the enemy Guard-stone. A tower-stone or stack can capture enemy stones or stacks only when it at least matches the height of the opposing stack. All Tower-stones that are captured are removed from play and as stated before, taking the enemy Guard-stone is one way of two ways to win the game.&#10;&#10;",
