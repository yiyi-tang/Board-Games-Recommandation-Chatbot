    "Description": "A small card game featuring a supermarket theme and a Can't Stop-like element to gameplay. Each turn, players may either draw a card or score their hand and begin collecting groceries anew. Hands are scored by multiplying the values of one type of grocery (milk, canned corn, etc. - the player decides which type will score) by the total number of cards in a players hand. The risk: If a player draws one of the 6 Fiasko cards, all cards in his hand are forfeit (apparently the grocery display had grown too tall and toppled over, based on the graphics). The deck also contains two Catastrophe cards, which cause all but the player who draws them to discard their hands. Players may score each type of grocery only once per game. The game ends when one player has scored all five types of merchandise. Player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Spring on a String uses laces and an unusual textile board made of felt which can be rolled up and worn in a pocket, making it a perfect travel game. Although it may look like a simple children's game with all those flowers and cute meadow animals, it offers a tense and thinky experience for two to four players of all ages.&#10;&#10;The board represents a meadow full of flowers. The flowers have a hole in the center in order to thread the lace through them. Players alternate between threading with their lace and trying to collect flowers with as many leaves as possible. They can collect any unoccupied flower on the board but the farther it is, the more lace it requires and they play only as long as the length of the lace allows them.&#10;&#10;The rules can be explained within a minute, but the game offers quite a lot of strategic depth and thanks to more than thirty animal cards also a huge replayability. At the start of the game, players agree on the amount of animals they want to use, setting up the complexity of the game. Each animal gets its favorite color and adds a special rule to all flowers of that color.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Perfect scores are possible, but rare.&#10;&#10;LetterTricks Competitive is a 3-5 player competitive trick taking game in which winning tricks earns letters from the trick; depending on the player count there are other ways to earn letters as well. At the end of a round, players take the letters they've received from the tricks and use them to form words.&#10;&#10;A team version of the game is also included in Version 2.0 of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Demonslayer: The Siege of Mt. Kunlun is what is called a 'deck-building game,' for up to four players. The game is based on the story &ldquo;Warriors of Magic Mountain.&rdquo; Each player takes control of one Sect of the Kunlun Immortals, and they must compete with each other in defeating the dread forces of the Heart-Eaters. By defeating the Heart-Eaters, each player accumulates Cultivation. At the end of the game, once all the Heart-Eaters are defeated, the player with the most Cultivation is the winner.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players play a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of cards, building up the player&rsquo;s &ldquo;ready deck&rdquo; and attacking the demon enemies. In each turn, players can &quot;obtain&quot; a card once, and attack once. Players can obtain spells as well as obtain &quot;meditation&quot; cards which are used to obtain more, stronger cards.  Players may also &quot;obtain&quot; Immortal warriors from their Immortal Roster area; Immortals are the foot-soldiers in the war against the Heart-Eaters.&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game is strategically important; one wrongly played hand can mean the difference between first and last place.&#10;&#10;There are four Sects of Immortals in Demonslayer, and each plays differently from each other. The Kunlun Sect excels at bringing high-powered Immortal warriors out quickly, each building on the other&rsquo;s strength. The Qicheng sect is good at calling on reserve Immortals to join the battle. The Kongtong Sect is proficient at Alchemy; creating powerful artifacts which help the Sect in it&rsquo;s battle&rsquo;s against the Heart Eaters. The noble Wuyi Sect Immortal Warriors sacrifice themselves for devastating combo attacks. Every sect also has 1 Sect Leader Immortal, who provides special powers which serve to define how the sect plays.&#10;&#10;The enemy of the game are the &ldquo;Heart-Eaters;&rdquo; demonic warriors who have attained immortality by reveling in lustful destruction and excess. Many of the heart eaters have spiritual parasites &ndash; called &ldquo;Miasma&rdquo; which infect the players after slaying. However, players also sometimes attack &ldquo;Treasure Beasts&rdquo; which can grant players special abilities once they are won.&#10;&#10;In one &quot;wave&quot; of Demonslayer, there are 8 Heart Eaters and one &quot;Overlord;&quot; a leader of that wave of Heart-Eaters. Demonslayer: Siege of Mt. Kunlun is not, strictly speaking, a game of inter-player competition. Players compete with each other to have the honor of being the most successful at protecting the heavens and Earth from the demon hoards. Yet, players are are essentially cooperating to defeat the enemy.&#10;&#10;This English-language version of the game already incorporates one expansion, called The Alchemist's Fortune. In time, we will release new expansions for you to enjoy, incorporating more players, more cards, more options, more strategy, and most of all &ndash; more fun.&#10;&#10;",

You can use precious Royals (your victory points) to acquire Dragon Havocs, which empower you to do anything from getting extra cash, to stealing things from your opponents.  The Havocs tend to be one-shot little guys, however, and are always discarded to the bottom of the discard deck, as far out of reach as possible from those cards that pilfer the discard pile.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you accumulate the Geld and Royals that your acquisitions generate for your clan.

These initially included supplements for Modern Military Small Arms (1946-1960), Civilian &amp; Police Weapons (1946-1990), Military Weapons of WWII (1919-1945), and Military Weapons of WWI (1890-1918).&#10;&#10;More detail description of all book published can be found on RPG Geek.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A fast paced 2-player dice game with cocks, bulls and monkeys on the faces of the dice. Players try to place six 2-sided chips on a wooden game board that has an antique feel. When you roll pairs of monkeys, cocks or bulls, you place down or flip over a chip in the appropriate spot on the board. Strategy comes in when you roll a cock &amp; bull, you can either score one point on the pegboard, or remove one of your opponents chips. Bonus points are scored on the pegboard after you capture an area on the board with chips. When you roll 1 monkey your turn is over. There are two ways to win, either get all six chips on the game board, or move your wooden peg from start to finish.&#10;&#10;The original edition of this game was hand made and self-published by F. M. Smith beginning in 2009. The heavy wooden game boards are all signed and numbered personally by the creator. The game pieces fit inside a small cloth game bag included with the boards.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition, published by Blue Panther, has a two-piece game board with wooden cubes to mark the scores, replacing the wooden pegboard of the original 2009 First Edition. This edition is easily identified by its smaller sized tan colored box with black lettering.&#10;&#10;The 2018 classic edition, also published by Blue Panther, has a one-piece game board with peg holes like the original. The box also includes a piece of felt in the bottom converting it into a dice tray. This edition comes in a 9 x 12 black box with white lettering.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player in New York Kings plays the role of a wiseguy who will participate in the most memorable night in the history of the mafia. The New York King's throne is vacant. Rather than collapsing into fights between families, each family will send his or her best wiseguy into the city and its suburbs to find out who has more moxie, and in turn which family will rise. Money talks in this world, so the only goal in this game is to prove your wiseguy's worth by making the most money you can in one night. In simpler game terms, the player with the most money at the end of the game will be the new King of New York.&#10;&#10;The game board represents the connected districts of the city of Manhattan. During the game, missions will be available to different players. These mission smartphone cards show how many characters are necessary for its implementation, the location where the mission may be accepted and where it must be completed, whether or not it is a dangerous mission (NYPD watch!), and of course the amount of money you can make.&#10;&#10;During your turn you will begin a phase of corruption. Each player secretly tries to buy the first position player AND the right to control the police. Then players pick &quot;resources&quot; cards, which will be used to generate events or increase movements. Next, each player moves his characters &mdash; his wiseguy and his henchmen &mdash; then plays the actions he choose. Players can accept a mission, complete a mission, provoke opposing characters, or try to recruit new henchmen.&#10;&#10;Provocation is a kind of &quot;Texas Hold'em&quot; poker duel with die. You first bet, then throw three dice (the &quot;flop&quot;). Either one folds and loses his bet down or the provocation goes on until the shootout (fifth dice). Just like in poker, the weaker hand loses the pot and one of his characters.&#10;&#10;When a character or characters are stopped by the police during a dangerous mission, these situations are also managed through die rolls.&#10;&#10;",

GoCaine uses area control mechanics from the ancient game of surrounding stones known as Weiqi in China, Baduk in Korea, and Go in Japan.&#10;&#10;GoCaine is a game of both area control and of logistical and economic efficiency.  Deploy multipurpose security cells to gain control of territory.  Use your territories to buy, ship, or sell your product.  Build smuggling pipeline infrastructure so you can move more product more quickly to more locations.  Buy political influence to help protect your shipments from interdiction operations and to utilize law enforcement to disrupt your opponents&rsquo; supply lines. Whoever can move the most product the most efficiently and the most profitably will be victorious.  Alliances can be made and broken throughout the game, making for lively player interactions.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you:&#10;- Choose 1 action (either: buy/build, transport product, or sell product).&#10;- Then deploys 1 cell (i.e. 1 Go stone)&#10;- at any point during your turn or during an opponent's turn, a player may launch a Task Force Interdiction action to seize an opponent's product.&#10;&#10;Territory is gained or lost using Go mechanics.  In this regard, the game is an abstract game of strategic skill.  Players who are able to control territory in more zones typically are able to then build a better economic engine to make money faster than their opponents.  The first player to reach $1 billion wins.  Typically this happens at some point between 30 to 40 turns.&#10;&#10;",

For the first turn, the player takes any two cards, swaps them, then sums these numbers (summing the numbers again if the sum is larger than nine). For example, if the player swaps cards 6 and 8, their sum is 14, and the sum of those numbers is 5. For the next swap, the player must swap card 5 with some other card. If the player places the cards in descending order from 9-1, she wins.&#10;&#10;The cards in Flip 9 are double-sided, though, and should you become at ease with the basic game, you can advance to the harder one. To start, flip half the cards to show the other side, then lay them out in a row. Each turn you'll still swap two cards, with every swap after the first having one of the cards being determined by the sum of the previous swap &mdash; but now you must also flip over the two cards being swapped. To win, you must place the cards in descending order from 9-1 and have the same side face up on all of the cards.&#10;&#10;",

Different dragons have different patience levels, expressed by a number. One player checks the dragon card, makes a statement about it which can be as vague or outright false as s/he wants, and then plays a brushing card with a number. The other players play their cards face-down and reveal simultaneously then. Starting with the smallest number, then counting up, the players check who was successful, who was bitten (whose card was counted when the dragon ran out of patience) and who didn't get his/her turn at all. Successful players get their card values in points, bitten players get negative points, and the others get nothing.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the player with the highest total wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Is a fast paced game of driving through a forest and swerving to miss the wildlife.&#10; The game consists of a small rubber squeaky car and 112 cards each with an animal in a particular color on it.

Beep! your horn and get them out of the way.&#10; The player who avoids the most animals wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher blurb:&#10;&#10;Save the animals from the squeaky red car! Collect matching animals or colors, and be quick, because you all act at the same time! But take care to see whether in the middle of the table there are three identical animals or colors - then quickly squeeze the red car and win bonus points. Who can save the most animals and squeeze the most bonus points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 2018, German publisher AMIGO released a special edition of the Bohnanza base game in a marketing partnership with the food production company &uuml;ltje that contains six bonus peanut cards. (&quot;Peanut&quot; in German is &quot;Erdnuss&quot;.)&#10;&#10;The game plays as traditional Bohnanza, with players trading cards and planting beans in fields in order to score points. While normally each type of bean must stand on its own in a field, the peanut card can be played on any other type of bean. If a field is harvested with a peanut on top of it, the entire field is worthless (as the peanut thief has been caught in the act). If, however, the peanut is buried between two other beans in that field, then the field is worth one more taler than normal.&#10;&#10;AMIGO notes that it produced 10,000 copies of this special edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The goal of the game is always to be the first to get rid of his cards to score victory points and the theme of the game resumes the rivalry between Brutus and his father-in-law Caesar.&#10;&#10;The first player is called Imperator and after the cards are dealt by the Slave player, he decides how many cards (1, 2 or 3) will be exchanged during the forum phase. Each player discards this number of cards and in the order of play, players take the cards of their choice. The slave discards the remaining cards.&#10;&#10;The Imperator then plays a combination of cards (one or more cards of the same value, the cards being numbered from 1 to 13). The next player may pass or play the same number of cards but of higher value. This is played until no one wants (or can) beat the current combination. The player who placed this combination starts the next round.&#10;&#10;Brutus is the weakest card in the game but it is the only card that can beat the strongest card that is ... Caesar. And we can play any card on Brutus, which can only be played on Caesar.&#10;&#10;If the winning combination has a value between 9 and 13, it triggers an effect in favor of the player who asked it (discard cards, give cards to his opponents, earn points ...).&#10;&#10;When a player no longer has a card in hand, he scores points of glory that vary according to the number of players and takes the Position card corresponding to his place (from the first Imperator to the last Slave).&#10;&#10;When only one player remains with cards (who becomes the new slave), the round is over. After several rounds (to be defined at the beginning of the game), the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Not the same game as Brutus: The Board Game&#10;&#10;",

The judge decides who's story was funniest, most realistic, or most plausible. That player wins the round. &#10;6.  The winning player keeps the hypothetical card to track their score.&#10;7.  After a player collects 5 Hypothetical Cards, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is inspired by an improv warm up exercise the creators play before performances, but has been fine tuned and workshopped to be EXTREMELY approachable.&#10;&#10;What connects the creators most though is spite.

    "Description": "In Rolling Dice, the interior of the game box becomes a dice arena, with a cardboard ice floe stuck in place to give you a spot upon which to land your dice and one side of the box removed to make it easier to roll your dice.&#10;&#10;Each round in the game, you roll three or four dice onto the ice floe. If you rolled four dice, then you choose one die to leave on the floe, removing the other three dice from play. If you rolled three dice &mdash; because one of your dice was on the ice floe from a previous round &mdash; then you must choose a just-rolled die that has a higher number than your previously-placed die or a just-rolled die that has gone farther on the ice floe than your previously-placed die. If you throw all your dice too hard and land in the &quot;water&quot; around the ice floe or you fail to roll higher or farther than a previously-placed die, then you place one die as a penalty on an ice block to the side of the board.&#10;&#10;Once all players have rolled in a round, whether with three dice or four, players score. Whoever has a die on the ice floe scores points equal to the sum of the pips showing on their die AND all the pips showing on dice that didn't go as far on the ice floe AND all the pips showing on dice out of play on ice blocks. Score bonus points if you're on a fish net and lose points if you're on an ice hole. (If you have a die on an ice block, you do not score this round.) Thus, the farther you roll on the ice floe, the greater your scoring potential &mdash; not to mention the potential of landing in the water.&#10;&#10;After scoring, start a new round beginning with whoever was first to place a die on an ice block, with all players once again rolling either three or four dice. The game ends the round that a player reaches or exceeds a certain point threshold, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The frog jumps an orthogonally adjacent token, the firefly pulls a creature in the same orthogonal line adjacent to the firefly, the beetle pushes an orthogonally adjacent token one space, and so on. If a token leaves the board, it's permanently removed from play.

    "Description": "Primate Fear is set in the same world as Gigantoskop's Spank the Monkey and is compatible with that game and its expansions, but this time when you start monkeying around in a junkyard, you'll find it a much darker experience as this junkyard was built on an old haunted cemetery.&#10;&#10;As in Spank the Monkey, players scrounge around trying to find junk to build towers and locate parts for reinforcements to make the towers stronger, but they're not trying to reach the monkey and spank it this time. Oh, no. On the contrary, they are trying to get as far away from it as possible because this monkey is not a mischievous nuisance but rather a reanimated zombie monstrosity of an ape. Once the players have stumbled over all the monkey parts and the monkey awakes, it will climb after the players, eating the brains of the ones it catches until only one player remains &ndash; the winner.&#10;&#10;In game terms, each player starts with a hand of five cards. On a turn, a player draws 1-2 cards, then plays at most one Junk card to start or continue building his tower and at most one Reinforcement card to strengthen his highest Junk card. He can also play one or more Attack cards on opponents to try to demolish their towers, lowering them within reach of Frankenmonkey. Players can use Defense cards to try to ward off attacks, with the active player rolling a die to see whether an attack succeeds. If it does, that player's tower might further crumble as the junk collapses on top of other junk.&#10;&#10;Each time a player uses a card with a monkey claw on it, a new part is added to Frankenmonkey on the assembly board; if the monkey is complete, then the claw raises the monkey up one level on the height board. At the end of each player's turn, the monkey (if still complete) rises one level, eliminating players at that same height.&#10;&#10;Players can use Primate Fear cards with Spank the Monkey rules and vice versa, or they can combine the games, with the goal being to spank the monkey before anyone else while still having your brain intact.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Spank the Monkey&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;The profound influence of sea commerce upon the wealth and strength of countries was clearly seen long before the true principles which governed its growth and prosperity were detected. To secure to one's own people a disproportionate share of such benefits, every effort was made to exclude others, either by the peaceful legislative methods of monopoly or prohibitory regulations, or, when these failed, by direct violence. The clash of interests, the angry feelings roused by conflicting attempts thus to appropriate the larger share, if not the whole, of the advantages of commerce, and of distant unsettled commercial regions, led to wars.&rdquo;&#10; - Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Influence Of Sea Power Upon History, 1660 - 1783&#10;&#10;Although advertised as purely commercial ventures, China&rsquo;s &ldquo;String of Pearls&rdquo; (a series of key ports) across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) gives her the option to assert sea control of that theater, and for good reason.  About 80% of the PRC&rsquo;s oil transits the IOR before bottlenecking at the Strait of Malacca and then going on to terminate at ports in the PRC.  Even a Gwadar-Kashgar oil pipeline, designed to bypass the full-length IOR route, would still require some initial sea transport, followed by a vulnerable off load, and couldn&rsquo;t carry the full load anyway.&#10;&#10;Therefore, in a modern interpretation of Mahan&rsquo;s observations, China has used &ldquo;legislative methods&hellip;monopoly&hellip;(and) prohibitory regulations&rdquo; all via diplomacy to secure its oil-toting sea lanes throughout the IOR.  Patient cultivation of relations with Pakistan over decades has delivered access to the updated, modern port at Gwadar, Pakistan.  Buoyed by Chinese land leases and development projects, Maldivian President Yameen has drifted closer to China while his opposition looks to India.  In Sri Lanka, China may have used &ldquo;debt trap diplomacy&rdquo; by forgiving debt to obtain certain rights to the port at Hambantota for 99-years.  How ironic, after regaining Hong Kong, China is now using tactics reminiscent of Imperial British mercantilists to gain Ceylon!  The confidential nature of certain aspects of these deals along with the close association of many Chinese firms to their military and government opens up the possibility of &ldquo;dual use&rdquo; facilities that might quickly transition from commercial to military applications.&#10;&#10;Thus, as China secures its sea lanes other powers perceive corresponding threats to their own.  India can&rsquo;t help but feel surrounded.  The United States has strategic incentive to preserve India as a counterbalance to Chinese expansion.  And, any nation drawing oil from the Persian Gulf or Africa must wonder about the possible negative consequences of unrestrained Chinese power.  The increasing presence of Chinese naval vessels in the region only strengthens these concerns.  So, the IOR is not only a point of potential geopolitical friction, but also a critical theater in any larger global power conflict that erupts over friction elsewhere.&#10;&#10;The game Indian Ocean Region enables participants to play out possible future conflicts, circa 2025, from their political beginnings to military endings with the same game mechanics as used in the South China Sea game.  Players assume the roles of nations or groups of nations and deal cards in multiple rounds of play each representing three to seven weeks to advance their separate agendas.  Each card play might trigger armed conflict.  If violence comes to pass, the time scale compresses to three to seven hours per turn and players deploy their military units to resolve matters by force.  Those forces include: individual capital ships, pairs or triples of smaller vessels, squadrons of aircraft, and battalions of ground troops all waging war at the far end of logistical shoestrings.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;    &bull; Complexity: 7 out of 10&#10;    &bull; Solitaire Suitability: 6 out of 10&#10;    &bull; Time Scale: 1 turn = between 3 and 7 hours&#10;    &bull; Map Scale: 1 hex = 45 nautical miles&#10;    &bull; Unit Scale: aircraft squadrons, pairs of ships/subs, land battalions&#10;    &bull; Players: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 3 players, or solitaire&#10;    &bull; Playing Time: 2-4 hours depending on scenario&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;    &bull; Three 22x 34&rdquo; map sheets&#10;    &bull; Three Countersheets totaling 390 3/4&quot; counters&#10;    &bull; Deck of 39 political cards&#10;    &bull; Two player aid cards&#10;    &bull; Rule/scenario book&#10;    &bull; Two Dice&#10;    &bull; Box and Lid&#10;&#10;Game Credits:&#10;    &bull; Designer: John Gorkowski&#10;    &bull; Artist: Christopher Moeller&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BCT (Brigade Combat Team): Kandahar is an operational level wargame of operations in Afghanistan during the War on Terror. One player takes the role of a Coalition Force commander, the other the role of an Insurgent Force commander. Each player must accomplish objectives within a particular region, using a range of regular and irregular forces.&#10;&#10;Player decisions reflect actual Task Force Group level command via a Military Staff System. Each turn, players allocate operational capabilities, represented by Joint Operations Cards. How well a player conducts his joint operations often determines the outcome of battles. But combat is not simply attrition of enemy forces. It also includes the effects of both military and political operations, as well as intelligence play. Consequently, players must think along several fronts of modern conflict.&#10;&#10;A critical note: BCT Command: Kandahar uses many procedures similar to those currently utilized by U.S. and other Coalition forces. However, a number of abstractions were made to provide a playable game in a reasonable format.&#10;&#10;Objective Cards are a quantification of political determination as well as the goals for which players are fighting. A player can use Objective Cards to guide their game strategy as well as to gain certain advantages. Much of the game is in determining the enemy Objective, and then taking appropriate counteraction. Often, your Objectives will conflict with your military operations, and it is up to you, the player, to determine the advantages or disadvantages of certain courses of action.&#10;&#10;",

Players use the cards in their hand and those they buy from the shared market to acquire new pieces for the board and to manipulate the board state.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Park Life: Hedgehog is a trick taking game about careful timing, profiting from opportunity, and adapting to other player's strategies.&#10;&#10;It was a beautiful day in Hawthorn Heath. Hedgehogs were dancing, reading, playing. Suddenly the weather changed. No one was ready&hellip; Except for you, a clever merchant. Sell umbrellas when it rains, ice cream when it&rsquo;s hot, tea and coffee when it&rsquo;s cold, kites when it's windy, and lanterns when it's foggy. Park Life has 5 weather-based suits.&#10;&#10;But customers are savvy, so only the merchant with the lowest price will make the sale. The lowest value card on suit wins the trick, but it is also is worth fewer points in the end. Additionally, every sale drains your supplies, so you discard extra cards face down when you win a trick.&#10;&#10;You can quickly make many small sales, but you&rsquo;ll go home before others, giving them the opportunity to make dramatic comebacks! But wait too long and others will make some solid sales, ensuring their lead. The player with the most points after everyone is cardless wins the round and flips their bonus point card to a lower value (another catch up mechanism). Win two rounds to win the game.&#10;&#10;For solo and co-op, there are set point goals needed to win, or play against the automa with rules in the deluxe rule book (you can download the deluxe rules for free below).&#10;&#10;As a may-follow trick taking game, you have agency to choose what strategy you want based on the cards dealt to you and the choices of others. This well-balanced hand management and action economy game avoids perfect information and fills Park Life with rich choices.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Although very similar to Park Life: People, this design isn't different in aesthetics but also by its deck composition (5 suits numbered 1-10) by its scoring (done after every round), by the reset of the cards after each round, by its winning condition (2 round wins to win the game). It is considered more family-friendly.&#10;&#10;",

With 3 or 4 players luck also becomes a factor to take into account.&#10;&#10;EDIT (November, 2nd 2011): There's a new supplementary rule (approved of by Winning Moves):&#10;Players are allowed to remove their own pawn from the board as a separate move (and re-enter it on the ground level at some later point of the game as a separate move).&#10;&#10;",

Your hand of numbered cards may have some of your own color, and certainly some of other players' colors, and both low and high cards are useful as we shall see. In the manner of Carry On Doctor, the hapless victim patient is wheeled in before the arrayed quacks. Every patient is different, but your aim is to cure him (by having the largest combined total of cards in your color) without killing him (ditto, but exceeding the patient's specified limit). Your typical private patient is pretty weedy, so expires on a total higher than 14. You might play your own 8 card hoping to get close to the total, but your rivals will be only too pleased to play a 5 and a 3 to kill him off. The body goes into your mortuary (minus points) hopefully to be offset by cured patients (positive points). And that is it.&#10;&#10;",

The rules accommodate both 15mm and 25mm figures.&#10;&#10;From publisher (Nov 2009):&#10;Armies of Arcana 5th Edition Softcover Rule book (Published by Terrain Warehouse)&#10;&#10;Armies of Arcana, fifth edition is a major revamp of the fourth and is in full colour. It contains 132 pages including templates and reference charts.&#10;&#10;Though this is a new edition it has not reworked the original rules only reorganised the layout for better reading. Most sections have been rewritten with the purpose of clarity.&#10;&#10;The fourth edition was published in 2002 and as such was not a true fourth version of the rules more of a combining of the three separate editions. The fifth edition brings the publication up to today&rsquo;s high standards.&#10;&#10;So what&rsquo;s different or new, what have we done? Well the main thing we have done is to combined the last few years of work on the forum with the existing edition and to expand the scope of the concept which is Arcana.&#10;&#10;The fifth edition will not come alone it now comes complete with a new Armies of Acrana website.&#10; The Book&#10;&#10;First it&rsquo;s now all colour with a new foreword and introduction in which we expanded the background of Arcana to give it some extra meaning. Then the book is divided into sections, the first is the basics principles with a new learn to play section for those who are new to wargaming.&#10;&#10;The second section contains all the turn sequences reworked to follow the actual turn sequence. Again some sections have been updated to follow what has been developed for the forum, especially the flying section.&#10;&#10;The next section is &lsquo;To Battle&rsquo; - this has had a major reworking. We have added terrain generators, a new scenario - Attrition, tournament rules. In the army building section we have revamped the vehicle, war machine and creature creation parts all now carry example of how to make them and are much easier to read and use.&#10;&#10;The spells have had little done to them other than some realigning by Thane.&#10;&#10;The last section contains the army lists and templates. There are now 23 official army lists plus the monsters list.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You and your fellow player are curators who want to create the best set-up for a new water-themed exhibit at your art museum. One of you believes very strongly in the power of vertical alignment, while the other argues that the focus should be on horizontal structure. You each take turns placing the paintings in the exhibit, and once you've finished, you earn presentation points for the horizontal or vertical groupings of the artwork. When the exhibition ends, the curator with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;In more detail, in Aqua, players take turns placing painting cards in the museum, with cards being placed face down when they're adjacent to face-up cards, and vice versa. When a face-down card is surrounded, flip it face up. When someone plays a face-up boat, each player moves a visitor token up to three spaces from that card, with each visitor token adding 1 point to the card on which it stands. Players score points by strategically aligning cards with matching icons and numbers in each row or column, with one player scoring the columns at game's end and the other scoring the rows &mdash; but these lines score only if they're valued from 10-20 points, so don't concentrate too much artistic power in one line!&#10;&#10;",

This split scale of wargaming pieces used is purely for the convenience of the gamers . . . Each pilot flies his personal aircraft as a mode, and, using the described movement stands, 'flies' the aircraft.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ground scale: 1:787, 1 inch = 20 meters or 65.6 feet.

    "Description": "Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #255&#10;&#10;First Battle of Britain (1BoB) is a two-player wargame of intermediate complexity covering the 1917-18 German bomber offensive against England. The objective is to score more morale points than your opponent. Historically the bombing inflicted little real damage on British cities in general or industry in particular. The attacks' psychological impact, however, was enormous: the campaign demonstrated Britain was vulnerable to outside invaders for the first time in a millennium. Victory is therefore determined based on the German player's ability to panic the British populace.&#10;&#10;Each air unit represents a flight or squadron of aircraft. Each hexagon represents five miles from side to opposite side. Each &quot;operational turn&quot; represents one month. Each &quot;flying turn&quot; represents 20 minutes of flying time.&#10;&#10;1BoB has three scenarios. Scenario 1 covers the situation in 1917, with both sides racing to build up their airpower. Scenario 2 covers 1918, with both sides at full strength. Scenario 3 covers the entire campaign from 1917 through 1918. Players who want to get right into a head-to-head contest of strength in the skies over England are advised to begin with Scenario 2. Experienced players will need about four hours to finish one of the yearly scenarios, while the campaign game will take about eight hours to finish.&#10;&#10;Units include bombers and fighters, both carrier and land based, as well as Zeppelins, Royal Navy seaplane tenders and aircraft carriers, anti-aircraft artillery, aerodromes, civil defense and early warning. German formations and aircraft types included in the large-size iconic counter-mix (176 total), by famed artist Larry Hoffman, include the following: Albatross D-I, Fokker D-VII and Pfalz D-III fighters; the elite &quot;England&quot; and &quot;Kagohl 3&quot; bomber squadrons; along with plenty of Gotha and Riesen bombers. On the British side there are: Avro 504, Be-2, Be-12, Fe-2, Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Pup and Se5A fighters; along with DH-4, Handley Page and Strutter bombers. All planes are rated for air-to-air combat, pursuit, bombardment and speed.&#10;&#10;",

Then to earn nuggets and fame every bartender must slide-launch the mug on the bar counter and land it in the correct zone to serve customers; but if too many beers land on the floor a fight may start.&#10;&#10;During the brawl phase if the dwarfs started fighting a bartender must sacrifice tables, barrels and dancers (based on how many beers are lost in the previous phase) to save his tavern.&#10;&#10;In the end of the nigh if the tavern is still standing the bartender gains a nugget for every beer that was served, if the taver has been destroyed, the bartender restarts his career from the beginning.&#10;&#10;",
