All cards start with the orange animals toward the top. Each player receives a hand of twelve cards, with the remaining cards placed in a deck.&#10;&#10;During the game, players lay down cards to tricks as singles, in sets, in runs, or in formations (two consecutive pairs, two consecutive triples, etc.) If you're the first player in a trick, lead what you wish other than a bomb, that is, four or more cards of the same value. In turn, players must play a higher matching set of cards, e.g. a higher three-of-a-kind on a three-of-a-kind, or pass, after which they can no longer play in a trick. (A bomb cannot be lead, but can be played on any card combination.)&#10;&#10;When you pass, if you've played cards and all of those cards have orange animals at the top, flip the cards so that the blue animals are at top. Each time you flip a card, you change its value depending on its suit: e.g., the water 4 becomes a pair of Qs, the wood 6 becomes a A+bamboo (and each time you play a card with bamboo, you take a bamboo token from the reserve), the earth 8 becomes a Q+panda (with you stealing a bamboo from an opponent for each panda you play), the fire 3 becomes a 10+fire, with the fire being a value of your choice when played.&#10;&#10;If you pass and the cards you've played have at least one blue animal, you discard all of those played cards. The winner of the trick always discards all of their played cards, then they lead to the next trick. When you play an element card &mdash; Water, for example, beats any bid with3+ values &mdash; you immediately win the trick, and draw two cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards &mdash; that is, they &quot;show out&quot; &mdash; they score bamboo equal to how many cards are held by the player with the largest hand. When all but one player have shown out, the round ends, then you shuffle all the cards (including the winds) and deal everyone a new hand. The game ends, when, at the end of a round,a player has amassed 15 or more points. The player with the most bambbo points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The last player in the game wins the war.&#10;&#10;In January 2008, the license for Warlord changed hands: For the 4th edition, available July 31st 2008, PHOENIX Interactive GmbH in Germany is responsible for Warlord. For this major changes were instituted: The format was changed to a customizable card game, where all cards are available in fixed starters, and a new faction was introduced, The Chosen.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A nearby solar system has been obliterated by a supernova. Now is your time to move in and extract the valuable resources from its unstable planets &mdash; but these jobs are too dangerous to do alone, so send in teams of Hired Paws and form uneasy truces with your rivals to come away with the best loot.&#10;&#10;Afternova is a strategic negotiation game for 3-6 players. Score victory points by collecting fragments shown on your blueprints to build ship upgrades. When a player completes 6 of blueprints, the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may either take 3 cards from the market or extract fragments from a planet. When performing a Market action, you can take any combination of Blueprint and Hired Paw cards. Blueprints are needed to score points, but they also grant special abilities. Hired Paws have different skill sets, so you'll need a variety of Hired Paws to Extract, or help other players Extract. The core of the game is negotiating during an Extract action. When performing an Extract action, you often don't have all the Hired Paws needed to meet the planet's requirement, so you'll likely need to team up with other players to split the work and the rewards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flickwerk is a neat little competitive puzzle game, similar in feel to Ricochet Robot. With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for.&#10;&#10;The updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house.&#10;&#10;This game can also be played solo as you try to complete a grid in the least amount of time.&#10;&#10;The contents of Turbo Taxi is:&#10;&#10;1 rulebook (the number may vary for multilanguage editions)&#10;1 city board&#10;&#10;60 cardboard tiles:&#10;&#10;     12 green player&#10;     12 yellow player&#10;     12 blue player&#10;     12 orange player&#10;     12 neutral (with a medal in its back)&#10;&#10;&#10;4 wooden pawns&#10;&#10;     2 black pawns&#10;     2 yellow pawns&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This chief of spies will coincide with five out of five possible clues, and his aides will match four out of those five. Whoever accuses the chief of spies on time gets the most points. Players who accuse the aides will also earn some points, while the other players might not receive any points at all &mdash; or even negative rewards. The game includes two optional rules that add more strategy to the gameplay.&#10;&#10;Checkpoint Charlie is set during the cold war, and the subject of detectives and spies is applied using cartoon-stylized dogs and cats.&#10;&#10;",

The swamps and ice caps of the Permian are replaced by the blistering deserts of the Triassic. On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.&#10;&#10;In the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted &quot;one-shot&quot; teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.&#10;&#10;Clearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.&#10;&#10;American Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.&#10;&#10;This is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed. For auction &quot;currency,&quot; players use  gene coins from a &quot;gene pool.&quot; DNA cards allow players to create strange animals, from cud-chewing crocodiles with antlers, to  saber-tooth meat-eating camels.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version, the continent of Laurentia is occasionally flooded or glaciated; greenhouse levels change; and the three Milankovich cycles are handled by cards that occur with historical probabilities. Biome cards, including cicada prairies, mountains, ice sheets, and mangrove swamps, appear on the map in succession according to &quot;climax&quot; ratings.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    American Megafauna  (Second Edition): Expansion Set&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Bios: Megafauna&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Illusions of Glory takes this game system to a new and exciting level by applying its focus to the Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;The Allied Powers bring massive forces to bear against Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey while trying to prevent a game-changing revolution in Russia.  The Central Powers must defeat Russia, hold off Italy, and win the upper hand in the Balkans or face demoralization and rebellion at home.  Players test their generalship and strategic abilities as Illusions of Glory lets you recreate the dramatic events of World War I&rsquo;s Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;Your hand of strategy cards present you with a rich array of strategic and operational choices.  You must decide whether to use each card for its historic event, unit movement, combat, or troop replacements. You must commit your forces to a variety of objectives: winning the dynamic war of maneuver between German-led and Russian armies; seizing the Balkans and its vital objectives; or prevailing in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Italy.&#10;&#10;Illusions of Glory offers complete campaigns and shorter playing scenarios.&#10;&#10;GAME SCENARIOS:&#10;    Campaign Game&#10;    Mobilization&#10;    Limited War&#10;    Total War&#10;    Italian Front Mini Game&#10;&#10;GAME SCALE:&#10;    Historical Duration:  1914 to 1918&#10;    Units:  Corps and Divisions&#10;    Time:  Three months per turn&#10;    Map:  Point to Point&#10;    Players: 2-4&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Yak, the village elder has given you (and others) the task of constructing a great stone tower to guide the merchants and their yaks in the Himalayas. Each turn, a yak pulls its cart into your village. Will you find stones for your tower, or food for your reserves? Or will you need to visit the market to find what you need?&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, each player builds their own stone tower by acquiring stones from visiting merchants. You start the game with one good of each type (meat, milk, bread) and three cards in hand: build, restock, and market. Three or four carts being pulled by yaks start on the game board, with each player having one cart in front of them and each cart containing three stones and some food. Each cart has a restriction on it, e.g., &quot;no bread&quot; because its yak is gluten intolerant.&#10;&#10;On a turn, all players choose a card in hand simultaneously and place it face-down. Starting with whoever holds the baby yak token, players then take their turns in order by revealing their card. If you played:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build: Spend 1-5 food tokens, placing them in the cart in front of you, to buy 1-3 stones from that cart. You must follow the restriction on that cart. (No meat for the vegetarian yak, please!) If you acquire crystal stones, you must pay one extra food for each such stone. Place the stones in your tower, with all stones after your first needing to touch. Your tower is at most five stones wide.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Restock: Take all the food of one type from the cart in front of you and add it to your reserves up to your limit of eight items of food. Then draw a stone from the quarry bag and place it in the cart. (A cart can hold at most four stones.)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Market: Take two food items of your choice from the market, which starts with two foods of each type and which is refilled only when a cart exceeds its nine-food limit during a build action. Then draw three stones from the bag, place one in a cart of your choice, then return the other two to the bag.&#10;&#10;&#10;Stones come in eight colors, with eight of each in the bag. Eight crystal stones are also in the bag, along with five fog stones. Whenever fog stones are drawn, all players reverse the direction of all the carts, then the active player sets the fog aside and draws replacement stones, with carts reversing again should fog be drawn anew. Once the right number of non-fog stones have been drawn, place the fog stones on the mountain track. This track will be filled twice during the game, after which only a single fog will remain in the bag.&#10;&#10;To end a round, return your chosen card to your hand, move the yak carts one space in the direction they face, then pass the baby yak clockwise. Continue playing rounds until someone completes the fourth level of their tower. Complete that round, play one additional round, then score the towers. A crystal stone can be a color of your choice, but each crystal in your tower must be a different color. You score points (1) for each group of two or more stones (e.g., a group of six is worth 16 points), (2) for the number of groups of at least two or more stones, (3) for individual stones (only 1 point each), (4) for triggering the end of the game, and (5) for having the most remaining food.&#10;&#10;For an additional challenge, play Yak with the &quot;master builder&quot; variant. Reveal three of the eight objective cards at the start of play. By having the most non-crystal stones of a color or placing them in certain locations in your tower, you score additional points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the twelfth century, thanks to the Holy Crusades and to the development of new merchant routes, a few cities in Europe had grown so powerful that they had become city-states &mdash; called &quot;maritime republics&quot; &mdash; and their influence extended throughout the Mediterranean Sea.&#10;&#10;In Citt&agrave;-Stato, you represent a maritime republic with unique characteristics, and you must make it stand out by gaining greater commercial, war, and political prestige, while also striving to develop and maintain Republican values. A great score alone might not be enough to win if you can't preserve the Republican nature!&#10;&#10;The mechanism at the core of the game is bag building: You can acquire cubes and place them in your bag. Each round, you draw several cubes, and depending on their number and color, they will enable different actions. The game lasts seven rounds, and each round players may keep playing actions until everyone has passed. Action cards increase the choices available, and players may discover many interesting combos if they have planned well!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe, September 1944 - April 1945, begins with the German Army reeling from a string of near-fatal defeats, and in full retreat to the safety of the West Wall where it hopes to make a stand. The Allies, flush with victory, believe one more push will bring them home for Christmas.&#10;&#10;The expected walk-over was not to be, and players will find either army a challenge to command. Allied material superiority is (mostly) balanced by German tenacity, rugged terrain, and lousy weather. Defensive-minded players will be happiest playing the Germans, but players of all temperaments will discover that there is still plenty of torque left in the Axis even at this late stage of the war. The Allies will not cross the Rhine without a tough fight!&#10;&#10;Beyond the Rhine is a big game, with 3.5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. At this scale the various Western Front battles&mdash;Market-Garden, H&uuml;rtgen, Bulge, Nordwind, Remagen, etc.&mdash;have an operational ebb and flow, but can also be viewed in relation to the whole front. A comprehensive game like this one, covering the entire Western Front, was long overdue.&#10;&#10;Special rules in this 14th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this fascinating campaign. They include:&#10;&#10;Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning DAK. These cover things like Fuel Shortages, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, Lost Couriers, Railway Strikes, and Dambuster Raids. The 58 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.&#10;The importance and difficulty of the Rhine crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and pontoons to be emplaced.&#10;Background effects of Allied air interdiction are simple and elegant (built into the Terrain Effects Chart and Weather), but the player does have the option to switch some of these planes to normal barrages and sweeps.&#10;The strategic significance of the Ruhr and the Saar, of clearing the left bank of the Rhine, and of major ports such as Antwerp are reflected by simple economic effects and the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broadfront&rdquo; restrictions on US supply placement and usage.&#10;The Wacht am Rhein counter-offensive is recreated by simple mechanics for off-map buildup and operational surprise.&#10;Many options are included for players wanting even more realism. For instance, there are rules for German Kampfgruppen and extra restrictions on the plethora of Allied independent units.&#10;Beyond the Rhine features three monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,000 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including a 9-turn Bulge game played on a special map (otherwise, portions of all four maps would be needed).&#10;&#10;Grand Campaign: 4 maps, 70 turns&#10;Fall of &lsquo;44 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 26 turns&#10;Fall of &lsquo;44 (Bradley): 2 maps, 26 turns&#10;Operation Queen: 1 map, 9 turns&#10;Bulge Campaign: 4 maps, 40 turns&#10;A Time for Trumpets: 1 map, 9 turns&#10;Nordwind: 1 map, 13 turns&#10;Endkampf Campaign: 4 maps, 24 turns&#10;Spring of &lsquo;45 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 24 turns&#10;Spring of &lsquo;45 (Bradley): 2 maps, 24 turns.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 Week&#10;Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km &#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Five 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets&#10;Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 48 page OCS rules booklet&#10;One 64 page Beyond the Rhine game rules booklet&#10;Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders&#10;Two 8 page Beyond the Rhine Charts &amp; Tables folders (one each for Allied &amp; Axis)&#10;Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

This race is not linear, and spaceships can pass checkpoints on the planets and comet in any order. Once a ship lands, the player claims the appropriate planet/comet token; the earlier you arrive, the more victory points (VPs) that token is worth. Each game turn is divided into four phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Events: The active player chooses one of three available events, which then affects all players. Events won't necessarily affect everyone the same way, though, depending on where they are in space and what they're doing.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Orders: All players present their movement orders simultaneously using a direction rose with six possible directions. Each turn, a player can place up to three units of fuel in any of those six directions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Flying: Each ship flies one cell for each unit of fuel spent on movement in a particular direction; if a player fueled multiple directions, the ship moves in all directions fueled. Fuel units are not removed after each turn &ndash; there's no friction in space, right? &ndash; so each turn allows a captain to further increase speed (by adding fuel to units already in place) or slow down his ship (by accelerating in the opposite direction).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Planet Movement: The active player moves all planets, then passes the active player token to the player on his right.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone returns to Earth after visiting all but one planet. Players receive VPs for their landing tokens and completed missions, and whoever has the most VPs wins!&#10;&#10;",

Certain steps on the path also contain events that can alter construction of the pyramids. The person who completes their pyramid first gets extra steps along the path. The round ends when a player has completed his pyramid, has only one or zero cards left in hand or when either player cannot legally play a card. After each round the top card of the draw deck is revealed - if the number on the card is lower than the position of the explorer that won the last round than that explorer has won, if not another round is played.&#10;&#10;Die Pyramiden des Jaguar is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "No Retreat! is a two-player wargame that retells the story of the titanic struggle between the invading armies of Nazi Germany versus Communist Russia during WW2 at a player-friendly and manageable level in scope and difficulty. Each turn is alight with intriguing on-board challenges plus the surprise of card hand Events as players vie to win in one of three different ways.&#10;&#10;In a skillfully blended collation of classic hex-based wargaming and modern card-driven simulations, No Retreat! stays truly story-centric, providing the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia. With a simple-yet-innovative economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Russian&rsquo;s Red Army, and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht, over the epic four year sweep of time that this merciless campaign was fought.&#10;&#10;Neither side can afford the disgrace of yielding an inch of ground to their hated foe, so your orders are: &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&bull; 8 page color Rules booklet&#10;&bull; 4 page Reference booklet&#10;&bull; 4 page Scenarios booklet&#10;&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color map&#10;&bull; Three Player Aid Sheets&#10;&bull; 40 color, die-cut two-sided 5/8&rdquo; mounted game pieces&#10;&bull; 11 round game markers&#10;&bull; 24 Event cards&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 army or front, each hex is 100 kilometers, and each turn is 2 months.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of the game, players must answer several questions: Each correct answer is worth points.

A card can be played face up on the table only if its value is equal to or less than the current number of cards in the archive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

During insane rounds, players collect ancient runes and work to build gates to release the monstrosities that their sane selves have been trying so hard to understand and prevent.

A tactical scale board-game opposing two players and two armies, with the Germans on one side and the Americans on the other. Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff. While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies.

Each player secretly &quot;owns&quot; two of the twelve characters in the house, and each character starts in a different room of the house. On a turn, a player either moves any character that is alone in a room into an adjacent room or starts a fight in a room that contains at least two characters. Well, it's not much of a fight really, as the player removes one character from the room and places it in a line with other removed characters. Once a single character remains, the round ends. The first two characters removed are worth zero points, while the third through eleventh characters are worth 1-9 points; the character that remains in the house is worth ten points. Each player collects points only for his most valuable character.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;    Rumble in the Dungeon&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dead Drop is a game that involves elements of memory, deduction, and crafty maneuvering. As secret agents working for different organizations, players scour the globe seeking information that will help them find the location of a hidden explosive device. Agents must trade information and sell secrets in order to learn the location of the device and grab it before it falls into the hands of another agency! On a player's turn, you must choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Share Info: Trade one card from your hand with one card from any other agent. The target agent must trade and may not look at the card she is being given before handing over her card to the active agent.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hack the Cache: Trade one card from your hand with one card in the cache. The card from your hand becomes a part of the cache and should be face up.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Sell Secrets: Reveal two cards from your hand to another agent, who must then answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to reveal whether or not she has a card equal to the sum of those cards. If she says &quot;yes&quot;, she must hand a card of that value to the active agent in exchange for one of the cards shown. The active agent chooses which card to hand over.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, after performing a regular action, the active agent may choose to Grab The Drop: Place two cards from your hand face up next to the card in the middle of the table. Then, secretly look at the card in the middle to determine whether this card is equal to the sum of the two face-up cards. If you guessed correctly, you win the round; if you're wrong, you're out of the round. (In a three- or four-player game, if an agent is eliminated, she must place her cards face up in front of her. Other agents may trade with an eliminated agent's cards by placing the card traded from their hand face up in place of the card they take.) The first player to win three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Dead Drop includes three sets of cards with different artwork (Spies, Monsters, and Kids). Dead Drop Deluxe features the same gameplay as Dead Drop, but it includes eight decks of cards instead of three, each illustrated by a different artist with a different theme. These extra sets are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Vikings (by Naomi Robinson)&#10;    Outlaws (by Oliver Meinerding)&#10;    Birds (by Ashley Davis)&#10;    Rogues (by Rob Lundy)&#10;    Robots (by Sean Dove)&#10;&#10;&#10;Dead Drop Deluxe contains a cloth travel bag and silkscreened wooden tokens instead of plain cubes, and it comes packaged in a UV coated box sleeve.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Saboteur: The Lost Mines is a board game inspired by the famous Saboteur card game. While it uses ideas of the basic game, the expansion, and the two-player game, it is also very different.&#10;&#10;In this game, players are divided in two clans; each clan contains loyal dwarves, selfish dwarves, and a saboteur, secretly working for the opposite clan. Players have their own pawn, and the dwarves must move over the paths in order to physically reach the four goal cards, one of which contains a sleeping dragon that you don't want to wake, so try to avoid that one, if possible. The (non-dragon) goal cards yield a variable number of points, depending on the displayed, but secret, treasure cards.&#10;&#10;Sabotage isn't performed against a specific player, but directly on the board by playing blocking path cards or adding tokens. In this way, the sabotage affects always all players, including yourself. As opposed to Saboteur: The Duel, path cards you play don't have to be linked to your own start card, which offers many more sabotage options. Even so, no player is ever out of the game, either temporarily or permanently.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Fighting had broken out early that morning. Meade had shifted the assorted corps of the Army of the Potomac northward to that town. General Reynolds was reported down. Hancock had the field in hand (he hoped) and Meade was now moving his headquarters to that fateful field. In the few days since being thrust into command of the Army of the Potomac, Meade had gained full control and would now direct it toward what was to be its single most important battle.&#10;&#10;Turning back R.E. Lee's second invasion of the North, Meade would end the Southern general's significant offensive capabilities. For the North. it was the beginning of the march which would eventually win the war.&#10;&#10;David Powell has completely revised his earlier Thunder at the Crossroads.

In Duuuszki: Edycja limitowana, five items sit on the table waiting to be caught. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way.

In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue barrel.&#10;The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected. Once the card deck runs out, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;The new key feature is now the fez. Fez is used to cover one of the other elements. When the players are obliged the catch the fez they instead say the name of an item under the fez. When the players are obliged the catch the item under the fez, they instead catch the fez to show the item that was covered.

    "Description": "GMT's fifth epic game in its award-winning series of east front games, Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov. This is a two-player, or two-team, operational level game depicting the battles of the southern wing of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during 1941. This game picks up where an earlier game in this series, Barbarossa: Army Group South, left off. It begins in mid-August and ends in December 1941, historically near the cities Kharkov and Rostov.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;&#10;     Three 22 x 34 inch maps&#10;     One 24 x 34 inch map&#10;     1120 counters&#10;     Series rule book plus a scenarios book&#10;     Various player aid cards for charts and tables&#10;     Set up cards for each scenario&#10;&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, NKVD, Stormtroopers, militia, base units, and more. You can tailor your army to fight a lengthy campaign over variable conditions.&#10;&#10;Despite its size we have kept the overall rules within the context of other games in this series thereby leaving nearly all mechanics familiar to veteran East Front Series (EFS) players. Such familiar mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away. For those who are new to the series, many examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.&#10;&#10;Note that all games of the Barbarossa, or EFS, series are built to fit together. If space is at a premium for you, please note that four of the eight scenarios here in this game alone require only one map or less.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?&#10;&#10;THE SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;&#10;     Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.&#10;     Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.&#10;     Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?&#10;     Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.&#10;     To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game). German 6th Army, a true hard-luck formation, gets the honor of leading the advance and they now experience their first starvation of the war, similar to that they will suffer at Stalingrad a year later, although without the desperation of that later battle. Even so, the 6th Army is formidable; so will the arrival of mud be the only thing saving the Soviet's behind? Or, will he have finally mastered the art of war against the Nazis?&#10;     To Rostov. The most dramatic moment of the late drive to the east was the drive to Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus where lay the oilfields the Germans so vitally needed to run their war machine. The Germans have won victory after victory for nearly six months even though the Soviets have set successive armies in their path. Is this perhaps the Soviet last ditch and their last army? Are the Germans truly at the end of their supply line? Will winter stop the Germans? Historically in this near even contest, the panzers actually got into the streets of Rostov; can you?&#10;     Kiev to Rostov. This is the full campaign, mid-August through December, a very full 57 turns over vast distances. The Germans begin in supply difficulty and will have to pick a pause to advance their main bases. The Soviet player will have to take care he does not expend all his effort too far to the west, thereby leaving nothing for the final battles. Neither player has resources to do it all but it can be fun trying. The East Front experience is not complete without playing this full-size scenario. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bobby Lee covers the eastern theater of the American Civil War around the Virginia area from 1861-1865.  It comes with a beautiful card-stock map of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Eastern Virginia and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Sam Grant so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;All artwork and graphics in the game Bobby Lee was created by RPG/Historical artist, Eric Hotz.&#10;&#10;",

But watch out, any patients left in the city who have not been tended to, neglect in value and the player(s) who picked up the healthiest patients that round gain fatality tokens, if the worst happens to the patients! This expansion also includes a helicopter miniature (used to pickup patients from anywhere in the city grid for whoever is the first player that round) in the kickstarter edition.&#10;&#10;The Maternity Expansion&#10;This expansion includes normal sized pink mother dice and smaller pink baby dice! This expansion also increases interaction by making players compete for objective cards set by the &quot;city&quot; to ensure a good amount of mother and baby dice are discharged (with often other colour combinations) by the end of the game. This also includes a new spatial element to the game in which mothers only neglect when untreated and in a ward with other dice. Players also roll the birthing die to see whether they receive single or twin babies!&#10;&#10;The Improvements expansion&#10;This expansion allows for almost unlimited customisation! Players will be given a free to visit worker placement board where they can pick up room improvements specific to a colour of their choice. This expansion vastly increases the crunchiness of the game and is for players who have played the original game &quot;wanting more&quot;.&#10;&#10;Note: The Kickstarter edition of Community Care included components for a 5th player and may be found here: Dice Hospital: Community Care (Kickstarter Edition).&#10;&#10;",

Everyone starts out as healthy as possible, with some money ($1) in the pocket, too. Each round, a number of event cards equal to one more than the number of players is revealed. In turn, each player will choose an event card and suffer the effects of that card, moving her health indicators as needed. Did you run out of gas? Or have a bout of diarrhea? Man, life sucks.&#10;&#10;Players then simultaneously deploy three action markers to indicate where they plan to go that day: the supermarket, the office, a pharmacy, a flea market, the gym, and so on. In turn order, players then execute all three of their actions in whatever order they desire. Maybe you'll hit the office to earn money, but at the cost of having your depression grow more intense. A trip to the supermarket will let you buy food, which you can then eat later at home or give to your neighbors who come to the party you throw. Force them to eat cake and get fat! If you have extra money on hand, you might want to visit the pharmacy to buy drugs; you never know what the pharmacist will give you, but if you don't like it (or the food you've acquired), you can hit the flea market to swap food and drugs &ndash; and maybe pick up some change in the bargain.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, you check your health levels to see whether your body is deteriorating without you even knowing. Get too depressed, for example, and the depression only gets worse; high blood pressure can affect your blood cholesterol level, and vice versa. If a health indicator rises to the tombstone at the top of the column, you've partied your last and are now out of the game. (Everyone else has to chip in for the funeral, suffering depression if they can't afford to pony up for a decent burial for a good friend like you.) The last player alive in the game wins and dances on the graves of everyone else!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "M.U.L.E. was first published as a computer game in 1983. Inspired by board games, it became a breakthrough, then a classic. Now this warm-hearted game of cut-throat capitalism is finally available as a board game!&#10;&#10;In M.U.L.E. The Board Game, you are one of the pioneering and industrious species of a Galactic Federation. Together with your fellow colonists, you attempt to settle the distant Planet Irata with the so-called help of a mule-like machine you all learn to hate. But for now, he's all you've got. Well, him and your fellow colonists. I wouldn't count on their help, though &mdash; not unless there's profit. Good luck. You'll need it.&#10;&#10;In M.U.L.E. (abbreviated from &ldquo;Multiple Use Labor Element&rdquo;), players claim plots of land and install mechanical robots (M.U.L.E.s) to work on them. M.U.L.E.s produce goods that colonists can use, sell for profit, or stockpile for (hopefully) even more profit:&#10;- Smithore is a metal that cannot be used by players directly, but can be sold to The Store. The Store uses Smithore to manufacture M.U.L.E.s. Since players need M.U.L.E.s to produce their Goods, they must sell Smithore to increase their production.&#10;- Crystite is a luxury mineral with a highly volatile price. It is not needed for anything on Planet Irata, but can be exported to other worlds for great profits (unless stolen by Pirates &ndash; you have been warned!)&#10;- Food is needed by players to take Development Actions, such as Assaying Lands or Installing/Refitting M.U.L.E.s.&#10;- Energy is needed to power M.U.L.E.s. You'll know the value of Energy when you lack it.&#10;&#10;There will be unexpected surpluses and shortages of different goods, causing market prices to fluctuate. Players must plan ahead while maintaining flexibility to change their plans as all kinds of &rdquo;fun&rdquo; planetary disasters hit them. Interaction between colonists is highly opportunistic: they will gladly help you if there's profit in it for them. Or maybe not. You'll get to see the true colors of your friends by playing M.U.L.E. with them. The most cunning settler and trader receives fame, fortune, and the honorary title of First Founder! There is also an overall Colony Retirement score, describing how your colony succeeded (or failed) as a whole.&#10;&#10;",

The Pope and the Empire, the two universal powers that dominated the previous centuries, were breaking apart. Science and technology were beginning to flourish again. Society was rapidly changing, as cities revived and gained autonomy while the feudal system was starting to crumble. &#10;In Medioevo Universale, you have to lead one of the great kingdoms of those times, while taking control of trade, diplomacy, infrastructure development, scientific progress, and military strategy. Build forts and fortifications, bring war to your enemies, conquer new lands, discover new technologies, expand your commerce, repel the barbarians on the frontiers, recruit armies and fleets, forge alliances, and defeat your opponents in battle!&#10;&#10;Medioevo Universale is a game full of components (more than 1700!) with many aspects to manage, deep interactions with other players, and the ability to give you an immersive experience in the medieval era.&#10;&#10;In addition of the normal game rules, the box contains also the original prototype rulebook of Nicola Iannone and the elements to play his experimental game version.&#10;&#10;",

Lord-Castellant Arvios Sunhelm, his Gryph-hound Archimaine and Cogsmith Golnir Coalbeard are joined by Loremaster Alnaryn and Fleetmaster Vizrin Kyre, as they quest to uncover the Chaos Sorcerer Lord Redomir and put a halt to the vile corruption of the First City of Order.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest: Shadows Over Hammerhal is a boxed game for 2-5 players, set in &ndash; and below &ndash; the splendid city of Order, Hammerhal. Up to 4 players can quest in the catacombs and dungeons below the city, while another acts as gamemaster, setting fiendish obstacles, controlling the antagonists and setting the story &ndash; it&rsquo;s up to this player to take charge of revealing the secrets each dungeon has to offer.&#10;&#10;After each adventure, the heroes can spend time in the Cinderfall district of the city, visiting shops, resting and taking part in the various shadowy delights Hammerhal has to offer! Your characters level up and increase their skills as you play, and Warhammer Quest: Shadows Over Hammerhal is completely compatible with the Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower Hero Cards &ndash; any miniatures or rules you already own for that game can be used here.&#10;&#10;Speaking of miniatures, Warhammer Quest: Shadows Over Hammerhal includes an impressive 31:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a Lord-Castellant;&#10;     a Gryph-hound;&#10;     a Cogsmith;&#10;     a Black Ark Fleetmaster;&#10;     a Loremaster;&#10;     a Chaos Sorcerer Lord;&#10;     5 Putrid Blightkings;&#10;     10 Kairic Acolytes;&#10;     10 Bloodreavers.&#10;&#10;&#10;As well as this, the box includes a 72-page guidebook, a 32-page adventure book for the gamemaster to use, 18 double-sided board sections, 55 cards, 12 dice and a variety of counters and markers for tracking your heroes as they gain experience and skills under the city of Hammerhal.&#10;&#10;",

Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract.  In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility.  Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle.&#10;&#10;The original version of this game, Palmyra, was based around three trade routes which were represented by wooden amphoras.&#10;&#10;Note to reviewer: There is no difference, except for colour, between the 3 different commodities in the original 1996 Palmyra.  Because the 3 stocks are very different in game play in the newer Buy Low Sell High game, the newer game should have a separate listing from Palmyra.  It is effectively a different edition 2 game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the time of the 20th century, a century of skyrocketing technological development, a century of new economic and political relations, a century of two World Wars, a century of revolutions. For the first time in history, the creation of a single world government became possible. You command a subdivision at &quot;The Committee&quot; &mdash; a secret organization working towards becoming that government.&#10;&#10;During the game, you dispatch your network of agents to infiltrate political, financial, and research institutions. You make treaties with prominent organizations, both well-known and secret, and carry out covert operations. You head up history-shaping projects, including Comintern and Unified Nations. Most importantly, you compete with other subdivision heads to become the only puppet master of the world!&#10;&#10;All you do is shrouded in secrecy. The world knows nothing of you, and it will stay that way. Even as you stand at the head of The Committee and become the ruler of the world!&#10;&#10;Deep State: New World Order is a dystopian game of world domination and global conspiracies. The game takes place over several rounds, and in the course of a round, players begin with the action phase, which is followed by the takeover phase. Those two phases repeat, then at the end of the round comes the treaty phase.&#10;&#10;During the action phase, each player performs one action, the most important of which is to send your agents to infiltrate political, financial, and research institutions represented by objective cards in the Infiltration Zone. You must race for objective cards as other players can send more agents to intercept the card they need. Players can also advance toward World Domination projects, including Comintern, Unified Nations, Spyware, and Deep State itself, which gives players tangible advantages in the game. They may also choose to carry out covert operations that provide a lot of influence while requiring the sacrifice of agents.&#10;&#10;During the takeover phase, players take their captured cards and return some of their agents from them.&#10;&#10;The treaty phase begins when all objective cards in the Infiltration Zone have been captured. Each player can then make one treaty that gets them working with mighty organizations, some known the world over, while others hide in secret.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players calculate their influence (victory points) that are generated by their objective cards, by participation in global projects, and by their treaty cards. Many cards interact with each other, generating even more influence. The player with the most influence wins the game, becoming master of the world we know.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This island holds ancient relics. It&rsquo;s too hard to dig them out without an expedition. Luckily for you, there are many expedition members lined up in the south who are willing to aid your expedition...for a bit of coin of course. No coin? No problem. Just a little exploring can get you enough coins to hire expedition members. Direct your expedition north and dig out the hidden relic! But do it before your competition...&#10;&#10;In more detail, players will use the cards in their deck to move their meeples over a grid of tiles. When they move on a tile they flip it. There can be immediate rewards, dig sites which require additional cards or the relics needed to win.&#10;Players can choose to return to the base camp to buy more cards to add to their deck.&#10;&#10;Dig up the relics first to win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chancellorsville 1863 is a card-driven game on the American Civil War Battle of Chancellorsville. Playable by 1 to 2 players in 1 hour, the game comes with a card-driven solitaire engine.  Designed by Maurice Suckling (designer of Freeman's Farm 1777), the game uses many of the concepts from that game.  However, added hidden movement, much more maneuver, and other design tweaks make this a truly unique game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players will play 1 of their 3 in-hand formation cards to maneuver or attack enemy forces, gaining momentum cubes based on the formation activated.  Each formation is a Confederate division or Union corps.  Each formation card will allow a major and possibly an additional minor activation, major allowing two moves for a formation while the minor allows one move.  After each formation moves combat can occur if a move ends in a location with an enemy formation.  Tactic cards may be played during the formation's activation giving it movement or combat bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the end of the formation card activation players may spend their momentum cubes to buy tactics cards which may give them benefits in combat or movement in future turns.&#10;&#10;Players then draw a new formation card refilling their hands to 3.  Hooker, Lee, and Jackson have bonuses that can be played once a game, adding to movement and combat.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by destroying enemy formations through morale/strength loss, or the Union occupying the three victory locations which represent cutting off the Confederate army from Richmond.&#10;&#10;Additional rules allow for fixed defensive positions, Jackson's Flank March -- and even his death.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Iberian Rails is a share-holding train game in which players employ services of characters, some more reputable than others.&#10;&#10;Each round, the players select their characters using an original character-row mechanism, then the railway companies take their turns. The player with the most share/s in a railway company (the CEO) controls said company, directing the company to do one of the following on its turn: build track/s; openly sell a share, and then trigger its dividend payout; and secretly sell a share, and then trigger its dividend payout.&#10;&#10;Each of the railway companies has a limited number of shares (ranging from 3 to 6), limiting its potential number of  dividend payouts during the game. If a company prematurely triggers a dividend payout before exhausting its coffer to maximize city connections, then said company and its shareholders get paid less but sooner. This compromises the long term growth of the company, but may assist an investor in having enough cash in hand to invest in another company. However, things aren&rsquo;t so simple; the characters may have something to say about these well-defined plans!&#10;&#10;The six railway companies have different strengths and weaknesses. Some start next to many cities. Some start next to tourist cities. Invest in a company with fewer shares and get return on one&rsquo;s investment faster. However, companies with more shares generally grow for longer. But the Engineer, the Mafia, the Bureaucrat, the Inspector, the Banker, the Ghost, the Construction Mech, the Hotelier, and the Venture Capitalist might make this generality less exact. By the way, the CEO of Ride with Cervantes selects his character first in the first round of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is set in Spain. The map has 42 cities, fourteen of which are tourist cities.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, a double dividend is paid out for all the shares, and the investor with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

They play their cards to share information, discard cards that they think will lead them the wrong way, discuss the clues they find with the other players, make hypotheses and deductions to find the solution! At the end of the game, players must answer several questions: Each correct answer is worth points. The more points they get, the better their outcome.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players either play a card from their hand and put it face up on the table, sharing the information on it or they discard a card from their hand face down to the archive and are not allowed to talk about the information on it, until the end of the investigation. Each card has a value from 1 to 10 in the upper left corner. A card can be played face up on the table only if its value is equal to or less than the current number of cards in the archive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Some orders are easy, like the Cowabunga. One Cow Meat, one Bun. Some are a little harder, like the Chickabunga Conga: same as a Chickabunga (Bird Meat plus Bun), plus Fries and a Drink. Sound easy? Now try your hand at a Lord of the Fries, a Meat Munch, or the infamous Patriarch (Fish Meat, Cheese, Bun, Fries, Drink, and the oft-maligned Strawberry Pie).&#10;&#10;",
