Each card contains three symbols and can be placed overlapping the last card in order to reach a better score. Some symbols score points, some only in certain combinations. When the third curse is flipped open, the player loses all their points. When a player decides to stop, they note their score up to this point. First player to reach 50 points triggers the last round, the player with the highest score wins. &#10;While one player is laying out their track, the other players can bet on when the next curse symbol will appear.

Fourteen pieces (two sets of 7) marked with a number between 1 ~ 7 and and two pieces marked with an X.  The X marked pieces are called the Dukes.  All pieces are free to move in Queen style movements.  Their imprinted numbers define their step limitations.  Dukes also move freely, but only one step at a time.  The goal of the game is for each player to eliminate both opponent Dukes.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the above three simple rules, plus one optional rule for advanced players. This optional rule limits the movement of a piece, after it crosses the middle line, and requires it to stay at the opponent side of the board until the end of the game. Draw cases are possible and described in the games ruleset.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game idea was designed in cocreation sessions with scientists, journalists, teachers, and various citizens. Then it was developed by the authors in collaboration with the science communication team in the CRG.&#10;&#10;Saca la Lengua / Treu la Llengua is a cooperative game in which players represent members of the general population with certain characteristics of their microbiome (represented in game by 8 genera of bacteria, whose population is represented by the value of 8 dice). The goal is to keep the oral microbiome of the players as close as possible as the ideal equilibrium values (obtained in real life thanks to the research project).&#10;&#10;During 5 rounds, the players do the following actions:&#10;a) Each player with 2 or more genera in equilibrium draws an action card, with which he/she can improve the microbiome of other players.&#10;b) Each player draws a &quot;Life is tough&quot; card and applies its effects on himself. Then a common &quot;Life is tough&quot; card is drawn and it must be applied to one of the players (cooperatively chosen).&#10;&#10;Some cards add some additional &quot;infection&quot; dice or &quot;severe condition&quot; markers. When the players exceed a certain threshold of infection dice or severe condition markers, they lose the game. Otherwise, if they reach the end of the 5th round, they won and calculate points to know the degree of equilibrium of their oral microbiota.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A selection of audience cards are placed in the centre of the table for the players to see, which are flipped before the game starts so players have to try and remember where the best of these cards are.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to draw a card from a central draw pile; there are five different suits of cards that players are trying to collect to generate enough money to meet their funding goal. The suits are: pledges, stretch goals, add-ons, videos and buzz! Each campaign card depending on its type will provide the player with either coins or backers, multiplying the number of each together gives the player their funding total.&#10;&#10;Mixed with these campaign cards there are also special action cards that allow players to interact with other players and the game further to help them get the cards they need.&#10;&#10;Once a player has collected a set of the required cards, they are able to launch their project, declaring this to the other players as everyone tries to grab an audience card from the centre of the table to help them meet their goal.&#10;&#10;Once a player has successfully funded projects worth 40 coins, they are declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a limited amount of time to build a criminal empire and build up their cash reserves so that they can out bid their opponents for the coveted diamonds. &#10;Each player will take on the role of Kingpin, Fence, Pickpocket, and Corrupt Politician to prove that they the are the best at being bad.&#10;&#10;Game play &#10;As soon as the dealer is ready, they start the timer. They do not have to wait for the rest of the players to be ready. As soon as the timer is started the dealer begins drawing cards one at a time from the Crime Card deck and either giving it to the player to their left or adding it to their hand and giving the player to their left a card from their hand. This continues with cards being passed around the circle this way until time runs out. &#10;Once time runs out, starting with the dealer each player takes a turn biding for one of the diamonds. One at a time each player states the value of their bid and places the cards that they are using for their bid face down in front of them. Each bid must consist of only one type of Crime Card. You cannot have a mix of cards with different values. Once all the players have bid, the player with the highest remaining bid wins and takes a diamond from the middle pile. The first player to accumulate five diamonds wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All changes required for the play of the 1939 scenario are identified as such in each specific case.&#10;&#10;Each full game turn of the 1940 scenario represents 3.5 days.

    "Description": "The Universal Tabletop Strategy Game of Gods, Monsters, and Machines&#10;&#10;From the mountains of Olympus to the depths of the darkest oceans, they awoke from their long slumber. Gods, demi-gods, titans, demons and other-worldly beings from your nightmares came from myth and became reality. Alliances formed and the stage was set for war like never before seen on Earth, or even beneath it.&#10;&#10;Mankind has found itself between colossal forces of legendary power. C&rsquo;thulean terrors rise from the oceans as gods ride winged beasts into battle. Meanwhile, the armies of humanity fight simply to survive. With the awakening of the gods, long dormant demi-gods, mutants, and freaks, have unleashed chaos on the world.&#10;&#10;This new world disorder has left many cities burning husks while the people flee to the remaining bastions of safety and security.&#10;&#10;The Immortal Wars is a table-top strategy game mixing fantasy, modern, science-fiction, and superhero genres. Do battle with tanks, infantry, hovercraft, jet fighters, giant mecha, mutants, superhumans, and abominations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;The Immortal Wars is played on a flat surface (a minimum of 4' x 6' is recommended) with distances measured in inches (the game uses the curiously mixed ratio of 1 inch to 7.5 meters).  Combatants are represented by miniature figures (representing single units) with an associated &quot;unit card&quot; providing data and tracking damage, etc.  Combat and movement occur in rounds, each round representing about six seconds.  Random results are generated using only twelve-sided dice (d12).  Several dice in different colors are recommended.&#10;&#10;The game assumes two &quot;sides&quot; in each combat, each controlled by one (optionally more) player.  Each player builds their force by purchasing units with points.  One player is the defender; the other player is the attacker.  Setup follows a pre-determined &quot;scenario&quot; (setup guide).&#10;&#10;During each round, initiative is determined.  The losing player moves 1/2 of their units; the winning player moves 1/2 of their units; the losing player move the remainder of their units; the winning player moves the remainder of their units.  Most units can move vertically as well as horizontally.  Units utilize a somewhat simplified method of two-dimensional facing.  Attacks are resolved at the end of a movement, if legal - this means the player that loses initiative will perform the first attacks of the round.&#10;&#10;The game supports a wide range of combatant types, from mecha to armor to monsters.  Many units have special abilities that invoke special rules.  A variety of terrain and status situations may apply.  The game also provides a wide variety of optional rules (including adjustments to 25mm scale).&#10;&#10;Play persists until one player achieves pre-determined victory results or eliminates the other player.&#10;&#10;The game document includes a large number of print-and-play tokens to mark various effects on the battlefield.  Also included are blank, print-and-play unit cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Explore the city of Bagan, ancient home of Myanmar kings. Players collect memories, curios, items, and vehicles as they discover the region&rsquo;s vivid history and culture, and the player with the most discoveries at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;On their turn, player roll the dice, and move on the board in the direction they choose. They explore the location they land on. Some give Discovery Points (DP) and advance you towards victory. Some allow you to draw cards. There are different types of cards: Events to be resolved immediately, vehicles to equip, souvenirs and experiences, or tricks for the other players! Some can be kept in hand, some are played immediately, and others played when you want to.&#10;&#10;The 10 main temples of Bagan are represented on the board. They are a good source of DP. You came to Bagn to visit temples after all! The first player to land on one gets 5 points and the &quot;temple card&quot; that features interesting facts about the building. If another player lands on the same temple, he only gets 3DP (there's more tourists on the site!) but gets the card from the previous player. Some effects in the game reward the player with the most temples cards.&#10;&#10;But there's other ways to rack in many points, such as getting a hot air balloon ticket for the trip of a lifetime and getting on the location with luck or cards! (10 DP!). Or mounting an elephant and wearing the traditional Tanaka and visiting villages and markets are all locals will cheer with you! (3DP per visit)&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player reach 30 DP (50DP in the Advanced rules)&#10;&#10;Recommend to anyone: Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to play a game about going on holiday?&#10;&#10;",

As the prisoner, you plan your moves to avoid the guards and reach freedom.

I was intrigued by the solo player action and the use of a six-side die to move pieces across hexagons. This format allows for &quot;autonomous&quot; movement by the prison guards at random, adding an element of suspense to the game.&#10;&#10;For Gamers and Non-Gamers Alike&#10;&#10;I've been intimidated by many strategy and role-playing board games. This game is designed to be easy to play, yet the degree of &quot;luck&quot; involved can make it interesting to gamers who like the thrill of risk-taking. Moving across the board more quickly toward &quot;freedom&quot; increases the risk of being captured, but so does moving too slowly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

By creasing the bills, you communicate to your partner. However, if the opponents finds out the meaning of your secret crease, the strategy is a failure. Let's make a clever crease that deceives the opponent&rsquo;s eyes and transmits info to your partner.&#10;&#10;Additionally, don't forget that creases accumulate as the game progresses!&#10;&#10;The game is played in partnerships. Each pair of players secretly agree between themselves what marks they will use. One player draws five bills, and marks them to indicate which animal is the minority. The bills are laid out with the animals hidden. The opposing team places chips to show which bills are chickens or llamas. If they get it correct, they score points.

They play tunes both weird and wonderful, with many a twang and bang from their array of amazing musical implements.

Players try to match these sequences from their hand of 2 cards.&#10;&#10;There are also 24 cards that form a draw deck, containing 16 sequence cards which are matched and banked to score points. There are also 8 &ldquo;special&rdquo; cards which allow players to make special actions.&#10;&#10;The game is customisable with several sets of special cards, which can be swapped into the deck to radically change the way the game plays. One set allows players to take cards from each other&rsquo;s bank. Another allows extra turns to be taken, or to interrupt other player&rsquo;s turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Choose from 6 factions, Lawmen, Outlaws, Mexicans, Natives, 7th Cavalry or Undead. We also produce a range of female gunfighters to be used within an existing faction or on their own.&#10;&#10;Games can be played as a one off or as part of a campaign system detailed within the book. Gangs can improve skills, stats, buy new weapons and recruits and also sustain injuries or die.&#10;&#10;The game is for use with miniatures in the 28-40mm sizes. We recently launched a succesful kickstarter for the book and over 100 new miniatures which will all be released in the coming months, faction by faction. It's also completely compatible with our extensive existing range.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The world&rsquo;s most vicious dictators raise from their graves to decide who is the ultimate bad ass. Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Saddam and Kim, joined by Putin, Trump, THE HONEY BADGER and others face one another in a final showdown. However, Mother Nature realizes that such a huge war will be the end of our planet, so she sends to the rescue THE RAINBOW VOMITING UNICORNS. According to an old prophesy, if a rainbow touches you, your gender changes. Thus, the evil dictators turn into nice old ladies, who instead of waging war, gift each other worm knit socks and go pony riding together.&#10;&#10;Dictators vs. Unicorns is a fighting card game in which you take control of up to 3 character cards, that have an evil dictator on one side, and a nice old lady on the other. Your goal is to destroy your opponents&rsquo; characters before they destroy yours.&#10;&#10;To deal damage to your opponents&rsquo; characters, you throw different action cards at them. There are 2 types of action cards &ndash; evil cards, that can be played only by the dictators and good cards, that can be played only by the old ladies. They all deal different amounts of damage:&#10;Evil cards deal normal damage to dictators and severe damage to the helpless old ladies.&#10;Good cards deal high damage to the dictators, because they hurt their ego and heal the other old ladies, instead of hurting them.&#10;&#10;All dictators and old ladies have unique special skills they can use, by sacrificing health points. You can use the unicorn cards to turn your or your opponents&rsquo; dictators into old ladies or vice versa. You do that in order to use a specific skill, play a good or an evil action card, or deal a specific damage to a specific character. &#10;During your turn, you can do any of the following actions: &#10;Use a dictator to play an evil action card from your hand and deal damage to other dictators or old ladies. &#10;Use an old lady to play a good action card from your hand and either deal damage to other dictators or heal an old lady.&#10;Use any of your character's special skills.&#10;&#10;You can use the unicorn cards in your hand at any single moment of the game &ndash; during your turn or during your opponent&rsquo;s turn &ndash; in order to affect the gameplay in endless unexpected ways.&#10;&#10;Will you be Saddam, or Miss Husain? Will you send Nazi zombies to eat your opponent&rsquo;s brains or defeat them by giving them cute puppy presents which will destroy their evil dignity Witness a Third World War like no other, fought with poo mines and cotton candy, and rainbow vomit all over the place.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns placing their blocks on the 5x5 grid. Once all the pieces are used, the players count how many squares of their colour can be seen from above, looking down on the board. The player with the most visible squares in their colour, wins.&#10;&#10;The first edition is hand-made with wooden cubes joined in shapes up of to four cubes (the game comes with JP and ENG rules). Each player has shapes in their draw bag, one set being light, the other dark. But some of the shapes are painted with the other player's colour (including a 50% piece), so the player might be helping the opponent unwillingly depending on how they place the piece.&#10;&#10;Each player has 10 pieces to place on the small starting grid. The player's take turns and may not play the same piece in succession. Each piece must be off-set against existing pieces, so player's cannot simple block over like with like. Gaps must not be left under pieces, so the construction must be snug.

    "Description": "The relationship between the Egyptian and Hittite Kingdoms was never a secure one, and in 1274 war broke out once again, this time most likely over the control of the border province of Amurru (modern day Canaan province in Lebanon).  Leading a large army north Pharaoh Ramses II divided his army into several combined-armed divisions each composed of chariots, heavy and light infantry, and archers. To oppose them Hittite King Muwatalli gathered an army composed of similarly armed and equipped troops and charioteers from throughout the empire (mostly from modern day Anatolia, Lebanon and Syria).&#10;&#10;The fortress of Kadesh, near the Orontes river, was the first major obstacle the Egyptians faced, but their spies assured them only the Hittite garrison and a few scattered local troops were located there. Pharaoh had divided his army on the approach march to use multiple wells along the frontier, and to save his men from the effects of marching through clouds of dust such a huge host would raise. Pharaoh and his vanguard division reached the plain beneath Kadesh and encamped to await the rest of the army&rsquo;s arrival. Unfortunately, the Hittites were already massed at Kadesh, with the bulk of their chariots concealed by camouflage along the banks of the river. When the first Egyptian reinforcement division approached from the south along the Orontes river, the Hittites launched a devastating surprise attack that virtually annihilated the Egyptian Division in minutes, sending the survivors fleeing towards Pharaoh&rsquo;s encampment. Pharaoh was faced with his greatest challenge, one that would result either in the total collapse of the Egyptian kingdom if the Hittite onslaught was not checked, or snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;Components: Each copy of A Clash of Chariots is composed of the following:&#10;&bull; One 11 by 17 inch map with Turn Record Track. &#10;&bull; 100 double-sided counters. &#10;&bull; Eight pages of full color rules.&#10;&#10;Players need a standard card deck, including 2 jokers and 1 six-sided die (1D6) to play the game. A Clash of Chariots is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Darius Baruczewski.&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to the world of Fistful of Lead: Galactic Heroes!&#10;&#10;In Galactic Heroes, or GH for short, you&rsquo;ll take on the role of a Hero or Villain, leading a scruffy pirate crew looking for adventure, or maybe a troop of faceless soldiers of the Empire in search of bringing order to the galaxy. It&rsquo;s really up to you!&#10;&#10;Galactic Heroes allows you to play a small-scale wargame in the far-flung future, a galaxy, far, far away, a grim, dark future 40,000 years from now, or a certain Red Planet where swords and ray guns reign supreme. Whatever YOU think Sci-Fi looks like, from your favorite Space Opera to gritty Pulp epic.&#10;&#10;Like all the Fistful of Lead games, you&rsquo;ll only need 5 or 6 miniatures per player. You can play 1-on-1 games or larger skirmishes with up to 6 or 8 players. Galactic Heroes can be played with whatever miniatures you already have in your lead pile.&#10;&#10;These rules contain all the information you need to play a game, including rules for building your forces and how to set up the table for different scenarios. Most players will pick up the game mechanics quickly, even people who haven&rsquo;t played a wargame before. The rules can be learned in a couple of turns, and the fast-paced game play keeps everyone engaged. If you&rsquo;ve played Fistful of Lead before, a lot of this will be familiar.&#10;&#10;What separates Galactic Heroes from most tabletop miniature games on the market, is the unique card driven turn mechanism. This leads to snap decisions and tense moments where all the players are involved. The play is fast and furious, with a Hollywood flair, while record keeping is kept to a minimum.&#10;&#10;The original Fistful of Lead has been around for a decade with a small, but loyal fan base. Galactic Heroes expands the line of western gunfight rules into outer space, because what else is a good sci-fi movie other than a western set in space?&#10;&#10;-description from the Kickstarter page&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Sith operate in the shadows. As they unfold their dark machinations across the galaxy, they need a ship that matches their nefarious purposes. Casting a menacing shadow as it cuts across the skies, the Sith Infiltrator is the perfect choice to carry the agents of Darth Sidious on their dark missions and into the battles of X-Wing.&#10;&#10;With the Sith Infiltrator Expansion Pack, you can use the experimental cloaking device, devastating firepower, and advanced systems of one of these ships to deliver vicious surgical strikes before vanishing into the void. In addition to the finely detailed and fully painted Sith Infiltrator miniature, you&rsquo;ll find a collection of five ship cards, including Darth Maul himself, twenty upgrade cards that help you fully utilize the ship&rsquo;s systems, and all the tokens and maneuver dials you need to launch your own secret missions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1950 is the second game of Conflict Simulation LLC's 2140 series, and the first of their Procedural Combat Series of games, historically accurate, sophisticated, playable within 2 hours and no more than 140 counters.&#10;&#10;1950 recreates the Titanic and volatile struggle for the Korean peninsula in the first major land conflict of the post-WW2 world. Over 100 Random variations of combat chits provide a unique experience with each play-through and cut down dramatically on analysis paralysis. Rules are included for multiple interventions, air-power, and UN supply.&#10;&#10;Activations go back and forth with a fixed initiative, creating a unique go-like simulation that recreates the ebbs and flows of the front without railroading players into a foregone conclusion.&#10;&#10;Players each action phase can choose to move, strategic move, conduct a meeting engagement, amphibious invasions, or prepared attacks. The main scenario covers the mobile part of the war and with the combat chits, no 2 games can be alike.&#10;&#10;Players can spend VPs during combat to absorb losses as well as supplies, or deciding to give up ground or rout.&#10;&#10;Players win by driving the VP threshold further towards their side by the end of the game or win automatically by reaching their maximums. Win conditions are based on cities, Pusan Perimeter, and performing historic actions like reaching the Yalu river for the UN or Pusan Perimiter for the Communists.&#10;&#10;No two games of 1950 will ever be alike and plays just as well solo as it does with an opponent.&#10;&#10;Designed by Ray Weiss&#10;Developed by Matt Ward&#10;Box Art by Ivan Caceres&#10;Counter Art by Ray Weiss&#10;Map Art by Ilya Kudriashov&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 6/10&#10;SOLITAIRE: 8/10&#10;PLAYERS: 1-2&#10;&#10;",
