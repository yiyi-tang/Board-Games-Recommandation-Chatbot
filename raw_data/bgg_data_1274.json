    "Description": "In Tiki-Taka: a card game, two players take on the role of opposing football managers, using player and action cards to dominate the pitch and outscore their opponent. By carefully devising a strategy around their goalie, captain, tactical style, and players, a savvy manager can outwit and overwhelm the opposition. But every great manager must also monitor the flow of the match. Play too cautiously and you risk ceding goals before your team is at full strength; play too aggressively and you risk losing momentum just as the match reaches its climax.&#10;&#10;Over four rounds of intense competition, players will go head-to-head, seeking to score more points than their opponent in each third of the pitch. Win a majority of these zones and you score a goal; win a majority and shut out the opposition completely, and you score two goals! The player with more goals at the end of the regulation 90' match (four rounds) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Players win zones via points obtained by player cards and action cards. Player cards are drawn and drafted at match start and halftime, and are placed on the field for the duration of the match. Building a team with similar nationalities and complementary strengths is the foundation to success. Action cards are drawn and drafted at the start of every round and can be played only once for their points or other effects. But crucially, these cards may also be saved between rounds, forcing smart managers to carefully conserve their strength.&#10;&#10;Just as in real football, the very best managers must blend the strengths and weaknesses of their squad, the tactical styles of both teams, and a keen sense of momentum to exploit the opposition and lead their side to victory. Are you up to the task?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The residents are all white-collar and well-to-do, and any of the homes could be featured on the front of any picture postcard... except the one on Bradford Street. That house has been tied up in probate court after the previous resident passed away and has been vacant for the last three years. The house, understandably, has fallen into disarray and been vandalised on occasion by some of the neighborhood teenagers. When a family is finally able to purchase the home, the first thing they do is begin extensive renovations to return the place to its former glory. As demolition and construction are both underway, the owners are shocked when the remains of a reporter that has been missing for the past year are discovered behind one of the walls. Even more chilling is the fact that she seems to have been interred while alive which is confirmed by one final message she wrote that begins: &ldquo;To whoever finds me, the Fairmont residents all have secrets. One of them did this to me...&rdquo; .&#10;&#10;",

The person that comes back to their home town is never going to be the same person that left.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Tables covering ill fortunes such as physical injuries, gruesome deaths, mental trauma and sanity loss.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Follower and henchmen rules, including loyalty, morale, recruitment.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    NPC's and monsters will fit on an index card.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Random NPC generator, including motivations and relationships.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    World builder with random generators for world history, city factions, quests, terrain and dungeon themes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Travel and random encounter tables.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Tables to conduct a living, unpredictable campaign with random events and outcomes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Adventure system that adjudicates the progress of the heroes when fighting to bring down an enemy, overthrow a system or change the world.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Random monster and magic item tables.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Narrative magic system.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Random deities with an active interest in their followers.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Lead armies into battle, treating each unit as a character in its own right.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rule a domain.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Be eaten by a monster.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     * * * *&#10;&#10;&#10;The random generators are of value to players of any roleplaying game, even if they do not use the Usurper rules and are made to be as generic as possible, permitting their use in a wide variety of fantasy adventure games.&#10;&#10;Likewise, this is well suited for cooperative and solo players due to the wide range of randomly generated content that can be generated.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BeerHex is a game with bluffing elements using bottle caps as pieces. You can play it casually (even while drinking beer). The players take turns to place a bottle cap face down on the board. Under each cap, a disk with a faction symbol is attached by magnet. The faction may be that of you or your opponent. Since the bottle caps are placed face down, the players do not know which symbols their opponents have placed. The object of this game is to connect the opposite sides of your color with your symbols. There are two ways to obstruct your opponent's moves. One is to place your symbol on your opponent's route to block it. The other is to &quot;attack&quot;. To attack, choose and reveal 3 facedown bottle caps, and if all three have the same symbols, remove them from the board. Thus, it is highly risky to simply place caps with your symbol in a straight line to connect your sides, because the caps may be attacked and removed by your opponent!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's the 1920s, and before these new airlines people are talking about can start flying around the world, the routes the aeroplanes will fly have to be mapped out and tested. As a daring pilot, you want to be the first, you want to set the record for the fastest flight between two cities, to be known as the Route-Finder &mdash; and the most challenging flights are intercontinentals: London to Melbourne, London to Wellington, or Tokyo to Rome.&#10;&#10;But, if you're going to win fame and (perhaps) fortune, you need to be a careful planner and a dedicated engineer. Your aeroplane will have limited performance, so your route must be carefully chosen, and your aeroplane design well thought out to complete the route as quickly as possible. Before getting stuck into the fun stuff, you need to find the funding to support your flight &ndash; you think it&rsquo;s a great idea, but how many others do? Luckily, it&rsquo;s a time of great interest in flight and pilots, so finding some funding shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Finding enough funding, though &ndash; that&rsquo;s tricky. And then, Mother Nature awaits. Will she look kindly on your route-finding flight?&#10;&#10;Game play in Route-Finder: Intercontinental involves using 2D6 and look up tables to find your sponsors and Finance, which allows you to buy the parts for your aeroplane. Choosing these depends on the route you intend to fly - will it be land or water based, short or long hops? But you need to track how much Finance you've used - you'll need a lot during the flight for refuelling, repairs, etc. Once your aeroplane's ready to go, your flight is a series of flight legs and city stopovers, with your aeroplanes technologies and 2D6 rolls and look up tables determining what happens during each. If you manage your Finance right, keep your aeroplane in good order, and choose your Route wisely, you might just find your Route.&#10;&#10;Multi-player mode can be co-operative or competitive. Several players can play as different members of the same crew, each bringing different strengths to the challenge, and sharing in the decision making. Or each player could fly their own aeroplane, the pilot who arrives in the least number of Days being the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Felicitas Fogg is a point-to-point movement bidding game with augmented reality (AR) support, where players have to select vehicles from their hand to move the character Felicitas Fogg on her trip around the world or discard them from their hand to restore energy and draw two new cards. The vehicles have different values for range, energy consumption and data traces. The values are modified by events like weather effects and individual player abilities. Felicitas always chooses the vehicle with the highest maximal range and the player winning the bid gains victory points depending on the number of fields she travelled. However, a hacker from F1X collective chases her, so the players are forced to leave as few traces of data as possible. At each location switch, the chaser makes an attractive offer and players may individually choose to help him. But whenever he catches Felicitas, all players lose the game.&#10;&#10;Felicitas Fogg has been published by the organization Deutschland sicher im Netz (Germany safe in on the Internet) and is sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.&#10;&#10;",

Skirmish wargames focus on individual models and their abilities, rather than large units of soldiers. &#10;In this game, each unit moves, acts, and fights on its own.&#10;&#10;Dark fantasy is a type of fantasy where horror trumps the majestic. &#10;Where fire spells burn their casters and getting sliced by a sword causes more injury than just a few hit points. &#10;So, frame your mind around the darkest parts of fantasy, where life is horrific, knights do not always save the day, and princesses may be monsters in disguise.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is what the Germans had to attack in 1942 in order to capture Sevastopol and ultimately the whole of Crimea.&#10;&#10;As a module, it is not a complete game in itself but requires ownership of the Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rulebook and Beyond Valor module as a minimum.  However, it is a very distinctive module with rules for previously-omitted areas such as fighting in the underground bunker complexes and with a map that makes you understand the size of the challenge to take on a well-prepared defence - these go beyond what is normally seen in ASL.&#10;&#10;There are 12 scenarios ranging from small engagements to larger battles which will enable players to experience the struggle whilst attempting to capture (or defend) a significant fortification.&#10;&#10;",

That is, if you manage to survive...&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;&#10;Escape from Site 19 (EFS19) offers a unique playing experience.

As survivors of the containment breach at Site 19, the base of the international clandestine organization, the &ldquo;SCP Foundation&rdquo;, each team member must move along the game board to complete his escape. This ultimately leads to an encounter with SCP-0001, the most significant anomaly of them all.&#10;&#10;Along the way, the team draws cards featuring the escaped anomalous objects, the SCPs. The cards reveal physical and mental tasks. At first, the tasks are relatively straightforward, but as the game progresses, they become increasingly difficult, requiring trust and teamwork.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, every team member will face challenges and share his stories, making Escape from Site 19 a meaningful and memorable experience.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#184;&#143;&#226;&#154;&#160;&#239;&#184;&#143;&#226;&#154;&#160;&#239;&#184;&#143; This game may be difficult to play for squeamish gamers.

    "Description": "POT SMUGGLIN' BLUES consists of a board map of the Caribbean, a spinner that drives the game, four HOT WHEELS that locate weather conditions and police hot spots, and four sets of CARDS that determine weather conditions, mechanical difficulties and other fortunes &amp; (Mis)Fortunes. Your goal is to sail your load of marijuana to a North American port and payola.&#10;&#10;Except when you are safely in a North American port, every move begins by spinning the spinner. Each number on the spinner also contains 6 colors.&#10;&#10;When a player spins, the number and color landed on not only select the load amount offered and country of origin, they also rotate one of the Hot Wheels. The number spun tells you how far to move your sailboat or determines when you've encountered Mechanical Difficulties or a (Mis)Fortune. The compass direction you've spun sets the wind direction.&#10;&#10;&gt;- Decide who goes first and have each player select a colored boat stand.&#10;&gt;- Everyone's first spin determines their load's quantity, quality, and country origin. The number spun is the number of thousands of pounds you are smuggling (2 on the spinner means 2,000 pounds). When you decide to take a load, borrow your stake, and place the appropriate sail, depicting the country of origin and the quantity of pot, onto your boat.&#10;&#10;You will face challenges with rough weather, mechanical difficulties, avoiding the US Coast Guard, getting through US Customs, and the Bermuda Triangle.&#10;&#10;The Pot Smugglin' Blues board game is drawn from true-life experiences of a bygone era. Will Berger&rsquo;s true-life experiences. Practically everything that can happen playing the game actually did happen to Will Berger while sailing the Caribbean back in the 1980's. In those precartel, pre-terrorist days, smuggling marijuana was considered romantic adventure, not to mention a fantastic way to create great stacks of fast cash, and in the process encounter informers and snitches, get busted, lose all your money and go to jail with the blues. All of which conspires to make the Pot Smugglin' Blues game suspenseful, emotion-filled escapism.&#10;&#10;So what are you waiting for? Load your sailboat with the good herb, plot your course north for a safe passage, hoist sails and find your wind, get out the star charts and see the Southern Cross for the first time, deliver the weed to the promised land and reap millions of dollars for your success. Do it now-- when they legalize pot, the thrill will be gone. Smooth sailing!&#10;&#10;",

Be prepared to use all sheeps and sizes to claim victory.&#10;&#10;All Sheeps and Sizes is a strategic card game about sheep. You want to get high scoring sheep into your sheep pen to give you points. The game ends when all the cards in the deck run out. If you have the most points at the end of the game, you win!&#10;&#10;Your sheep pen is like your hand because it is where you keep and play all your cards from. But all the cards in your sheep pen are placed face down and you can't look at them so you will have to remember which card is which so that you can play the right cards.&#10;&#10;Some of the cards in the game give you points. But the Wolf card reduces your points, so you want to make sure you don't have the wolf at the end of the game. The other cards have special effects to be used during the game, like viewing, swapping, stealing and destroying other cards. Use your cards effectively to win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is an expansion booklet for The Deluge, 1940: The Fall France, and Fire in the Steppe (all three needed to play).&#10;&#10;We look at the tanks that the Poles tried to acquire or produce before the German invasion. Polish industry wasn&rsquo;t capable of putting the new tanks into series production in time, and the Poles failed in their quest to purchase the Somua S35.&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s not the case in Bron Pancerni. The Poles get their S35&rsquo;s, and they also get the 25TP medium tank with a long-barreled 75mm gun, the 14TP cavalry tank with a long-barreled 47mm gun, and the 10TP and 9TP light tanks: the armor you need to stomp the szkopy.&#10;&#10;These are very good tanks for 1939; they&rsquo;re still pretty good in 1941, too. You get 24 new die-cut and silky-smooth playing pieces and new scenarios to use them in battle. The Germans can get the T34 shock two years early; the 25TP is just as capable a fighting machine as the legendary Hammer of the Proletariat (and it&rsquo;s crewed by Poles).&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the near future, humanity renews itself. Economies revive and nations look again to the stars as humanity rediscovers the urge to reach beyond the confines of planet Earth. Collectively, Earth&rsquo;s nations and people set a course for the exploration of the solar system and exploitation of the resources it has to offer. Together, they set forth the Edict. The Edict is a demand and a licence for the most capable to venture into space under the mandate of harvesting extra-terrestrial resources for the enrichment of the people of Earth. Five organisations race out into the solar system to discover and capitalise on the raw materials buried within the planets, moons, asteroids, and debris beyond Earth&rsquo;s heavens. Who among them will gain ascendency in a race to establish a commercial empire in answer to the Edict?&#10;&#10;You control one of these powerful organisations. Your aim is to explore, exploit and expand your influence into the solar system and export back resources essential to Earth. Your organisation&rsquo;s capabilities and options are dependent on the executives you recruit to manage your Mission Control.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player with the most Victory Points at the close of Earth&rsquo;s final Edict. Victory Points are earned through the accumulation of Solar Credits as well as achievements in scientific brilliance, political might and supremacy of exploration. By colonising new worlds, investing in ground-breaking technologies and recruiting the most distinguished minds in space exploration you will drive your organisation to control the stars and pave the way for new frontiers of humanity.&#10;&#10;The game is advanced by fulfilling the demands of Earth as displayed on the Edict card, which are met by returning resources to Earth. Players take turns clockwise to use one of the four Mission Control departments that lists available actions dependent on the associated executive. Departments are improved by recruiting new executives. The recruitment round starts after each Edict is complete and gives all players an opportunity to bring in new talent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is a cooperative/competitive Medieval Fantasy Strategy Game of my creation.&#10;In the base game two to four players take on the roles of Noble Houses fighting for the King, gaining favor by winning battles and proving themselves worthy administrators in the midst of a Civil War. Players work together to overcome the rebels while competing with your allies to earn the most favor from the throne.&#10;&#10;Key Features:&#10;&#10;     Factions:  Pick from one of four houses to play as during the campaign (House Kel, Lotan, Shobal, or the 7th Corps). Each Noble House has their own individual and unique strategy.&#10;     Base Building:  increase your power and prestige by constructing military, defensive and economical buildings that can gain access to greater resources and higher quality troop types as they are upgraded.&#10;     Resources:  As you expand influence and improve your land, you gain access to more resources. These need to be properly handled in order to bolster your power, help you grow and gain favor with the King.&#10;     Army Recruiting:  Create your own army from core loyalist warriors and elite house troops.  Customize your army according to your vision. Train units to meet battlefield demands. Cooperate by sharing units through alliances to defeat the rebels and unite the loyalist factions.&#10;     Political intrigue:  Internal and External events can quickly change the fortune for you and your fellow loyalists.  Manipulate these events to further your own goals while hindering those of your rivals.&#10;     Battles:  Wage war against the rebels in skirmishes as small as five units or up to a massive battle of forty units.  Gather your allies to form large armies to bring the battle to the doorstep of the rebels.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Tu'x Rebellion is a card-based strategy game similar to other customizable trading card games with battle tactics similar to tabletop miniature games. Players take turns simultaneously.  Each round is divided into phases; draw, build, conflict and discard.  Simultaneous play means the game is exciting for everyone and no one is left waiting to take action.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved in the conflict phase. One round of battle is split into the: Set up, Draw, Infantry, Ranged, Cavalry, Movement and Discard phases.  Action continues for allied players and the player controlling the Rebel Army during the battle.&#10;&#10;You win by reaching a certain threshold of favor with the King.  However, everyone loses if the loyalists are defeated twice in battle or any player loses all the troops under their command.  Players must constantly balance the competitive and cooperative aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players are students of magic, having taken up a 4 week internship at a magical research company. Their goal is to improve their grades and hopefully gain full-time magic work.&#10;&#10;Each week they complete a magical research on a particular. A spell is formed from a combination of two word cards (English included). Players use agreed symbols to represent the components of the spell (water, fire and so on). Each player draws a version of the spell from the symbols required.&#10;&#10;At the end of the course, each player studies the spells drawn by the other students, and casts a secret vote on how well they have been drawn. Players are looking for how easily the drawing is to read, and how well it matches the requirements of the spell.&#10;&#10;Once all the votes are cast, the scores are revealed and totalled up. The best score wins the game and a new job.&#10;&#10;Players must try to draw out on paper a spell, decoratively and cleverly. But it must be recognisable as the spell, and not too difficult to read and interpret correctly. A spell that is too easy, or too obscure, should score lower marks than a more finely crafted work.&#10;&#10;The game has been presented as a Print'n'Play, with the black &amp; white files online under a password, being released for the low price of &yen; 500.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Charley Horse Derby is a strategic horse-racing game.&#10;&#10;Players choose their jockey card and are dealt two strategy cards. The players race around the around the track for 1 1/4 mile. You can play strategy cards on your turn. You can also pick up cards off the track by landing on a &quot;charley&quot; which are played right away. Use the tools the track gives you to send other opponents back or propel yourself forward.&#10;&#10;Ride the rails on the bends for a shorter race or take the longer outside tracks to grab cards to jeopardize your opponent.&#10;&#10;During the race players will encounter bears, deer, goats, snakes, and murder hornets while dealing with collusion, elbowing, impeding and broken legs. Then there's those nasty &quot;trade places&quot; which you have to use before someone crosses the finish line.&#10;&#10;You collect cards by rolling doubles or by landing on an opponent and some cards allow you to steal a card from a player. If you can steal an opponent's jockey card, they can't cross the finish line without one. Crossing first doesn't guarantee a win since all players get to finish their turn. Horses unfortunately die on the track so we added one death card. You have be careful using it because if the opponent neighs it, you're dead. Neigh cards are used to block actions of an opponent or have them miss a turn or to save your own hide.&#10;&#10;The cards coupled with the track makes for a hilarious game where the horses are all over the place. You won't know who wins until the last player goes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The players arrange the &quot;food chains&quot; from the cards in accordance with the rules of nature - predators eat herbivores, and those, as vegetarians, eat plant food.  The game is enriched by action cards, which, for example, undo the player's movement, or the order of placing cards.  The person who gets rid of all cards in their hand wins.
