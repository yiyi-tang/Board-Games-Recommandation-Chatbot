Each road along the board has a posted speed limit.  If on your turn, you exceed the speed limit, you have to roll another dice and move that many spaces backwards as a penalty for speeding.  There are a few different routes you may take (each with different speeds) as well as various spaces on the board where you must stop.&#10;&#10;Overall the game is very simple and there is little strategy.&#10;&#10;",

The face, however, is slightly different on each card and there are eight sets of different expressions with six cards of each expression.  The cards are dealt to all players face down to make a deck.  Each turn all players simultaneously reveal the top card of their deck.  If a player notices three identical faces he yells out &quot;Flip Flap Flop&quot;.  If correct, that player takes the three identical cards. Unclaimed cards are left on the table. A player who makes an incorrect call may not call on the following round but must play a card as usual.  When one player has six sets of FLIP FLAP FLOP cards, the game ends.  Players count their cards and the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

Luck is just a small factor in the game. The character of the Dark Master is an important new feature in the game, in fact introducing an extra player in the game. Each player becomes a chance to support the dark side or the good side. Investing in dark power increases the attractiveness of the Dark Master. New playing pieces as Watchtowers allow players to defend themselves against the attacks of the Dark Master. Giving money to the church improves the power of the good forces and gives some protection against the Dark forces. New castle cards and income blocks are a valuable new asset to the game, because the players are able to monitor their income in each category.&#10;&#10;As the Citadel is prosperous and the number of citizens grows, rumor has it that a dark character will come inside the Citadel's walls. The Dark Master must be countered by the five Grand Masters to save The Citadel from destruction. But which of the Grand Masters are strong enough to withstand the attraction of the dark side. Since each one of them would like to increase their influence in the Citadel, one or more traitors are more likely to reveal their real character when the game draws to a thrilling finale.&#10;&#10;",

If played in teams the teams are either 2 or 3 person teams. Deal 7 cards to each player. The top card, called the Providence is then turned over. This determines trumps for that round. if the trump does not suit the person to the left of the dealer that person may say &quot;NOLO&quot; in which case two more cards are dealt to each player and a second Providence card is turned over which must remain trumps for the round, if the card does suit the player he calls &quot;VOLO&quot; and the hand begins. The cards have names on them that relate to their rank in the  suit. Names like Benevolence, Christian, Industry, Press, Villain, Education, Intemperance, Virtues, Man in Home, Woman in home, Debt etc. These cards have value which determines which card wins the trick. Some cards reduce the value of a trick and therefore wind up resulting in a negative valued trick. Virtue cards are positive and vice cards are negatively valued, neutrals are just that and are worth zero. Object is to be the first to get to 7 points.&#10;&#10;",

'Schley at Santiago Bay' celebrated war hero Winfield Scott Schley while teaching players facts about the recent war. Schley, hardly a household name today, was the U.S. Navy commodore in command of the Flying Squadron during the victorious battle at Santiago. An investigation conducted 2 years after the publication of the game found Schley guilty of negligence and misconduct during the battle.&#10;&#10;",

Because of this, it's a game which generations will enjoy for decades.&#10;&#10;",

It is played on a 4&times;4 board, and has a few other aspects in common with Plateau.&#10;&#10;Players' pieces and stacks move according to the number of pieces in the stack:  A single piece moves one space orthogonally; a double, up to two orthogonally; a triple, up to three orthogonally or diagonally.  Moves may only be through empty spaces.  Pieces and stacks may merge or split as part of their move.  Each player also has one activator, that rides parasitically on the opponent's pieces.  It moves up to four spaces orthogonally, from one opposing piece to another, and it is not considered a piece.&#10;&#10;A player's activator empowers her pieces/stacks in the same rank or file to capture opposing an opposing piece/stack when they move.  Additionally, any pieces/stacks in the two spaces where the activation lines of the players' activators cross are immobilized.&#10;&#10;You can win the game one of two ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Occupy your opponent's home space with one of your pieces/stacks for an entire round.&#10;     Reduce your opponent's forces to one piece/stack to win immediately.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players can work on getting demerits by getting caught having enough forged absentee passes to skip half or more of a school day (pair through four-of-a-kind), or to dodge homework by missing three or more days in a row of the same class (runs of three or more).&#10;&#10;Players acquire these forged passes by moving to an adjacent classroom of the desired subject, and then either dealing with the non-player student in that room, or forcing a trade with another player.  The types of trades you can make depend on the sort of pass you have for your current classroom.&#10;&#10;Once a player gets herself &quot;caught&quot; with a demerit-worthy set of passes, she receives more demerits for a strongly incriminating set of passes.&#10;&#10;The first player to 20 demerits wins, and is free from the hard military life!&#10;&#10;",

This game uses an updated, and slightly expanded, version of the Bitter Victory game system: no CRT, buckets o&rsquo; dice, and cards...a totally new approach to gaming battles that can be learned in five minutes and played in 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. BSO Games, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons). No CRTs, no siree!&#10;&#10;The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in Reinforcements. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&#10;&#10;The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.&#10;&#10;Playing time for Blackshirthas averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 6 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.&#10;&#10;Each game of Blackshirt includes Rules, one sheet of Mike Lemick&rsquo;s colorful cut-and-paste counters, two small decks of cards, and a snappy Pascal da Silva map (in one piece!)&quot;&#10;&#10;Available in English or French&#10;1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)&#10;1 A3 map of Lybia and Egypt - 20 colored Opportunity Cards - 140 counters (NATO Symbols) -&#10;The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva&#10;&#10;Uses the Same System As:&#10;&#10;    Bitter Victory&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplimented by: Blood & Sand published by Worthington Games&#10;&#10;",

A game is divided into nine innings.  Each team is allowed a turn at bat per inning until three outs are recorded.  With the third out a team's 'at bat' ends.  The 'Visiting' team is up first each inning - considered the 'top' of inning.  The 'Home' team always bats last or the 'bottom' of the inning.  The team not 'at bat' is the defense.  The team with the greatest number  of runs after nine innings wins.  If the score is tied at the end of regulation play, 'extra innings' are played until at the end of an inning one team leads.  Runs are scored when a runner touches 'Home Plate' preceeded by tagging first base, second base, and third base.  Not more than one player is allowed per base at a time.  Runs, innings, outs, strike and balls are recorded by their respective markers.  Strike outs are noted by the enclosed &quot;K's&quot; and are to be hung over the backboard when a strike out occurs.&#10;&#10;",

Each of the 81 squares contains random numbers from 1 to 12, not including 2 or 7.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players roll two dice, add up the numbers and mark a corresponding number with their color. If a 2 is rolled the the player loses the turn. If a 7 is rolled the player may place a marker on any spot on the board (this is the only way to mark a 1).&#10;&#10;If a player marks his or her color on three numbers in a row&mdash;either vertically, diagonally or horizontally then they score! Most points wins.&#10;&#10;Each player gets one point for each chip on the board, three points for each tic-tac-toe in a mini 3x3 grid, and five points for each grand tic-tac-toe (Three mini tic-tac-toes in a row&mdash;horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was created by David Jisa, a Wisconsin teacher who uses games in his classroom to help motivate students. Roll-It Tic-Tac-Toe lets students practice their addition skills and develop problem-solving strategies.&#10;&#10;Roll-It Tic-Tac-Toe comes in two versions&mdash;one with colored chips and 8 game boards and another with colored markers and game sheets. The game is for 2 to 6 players ages 7 and up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You start off by picking one of the Character cards to determine what type of person you will be. Each Character starts off with items that have different strengths and weaknesses. You must use your items to your advantage in knowing who to attack and who not to attack when and where. This is a game of strategy and the player who is experienced will have a definite advantage over a beginner. It was made so that luck is not as important as skill and strategy. You can bribe the different people in the game to attack your opponents and take their items from them. You may battle opponents when you land on the same square as them deciding which items to use in each different situation. You may warp to different areas of the board using the tunnel either to attack an opponent or strategically move into a position which is more beneficial. Receive money when passing the Castle to be able to buy items when you land on the store squares. Pick up Destainia cards and follow the instructions of the card which may be to your advantage or to your peril. The object of the game is to move along the board purchasing different items from stores along the way. Each item you buy has points, and once you have achieved enough points you will be able to challenge and defeat the Sorcerer. Instead of like other games where you have to be the last player alive, this is a race to the finish where everyone is trying to defeat the Sorcerer and claim the Medallion. The action is fast paced and there is never a dull moment. Destainia the game includes 100% cotton canvas material for the board, 6 different color pawns, 2 dice, 60 plastic coins, a drawstring pouch, instructions, 143 playing cards, and a convenient clear plastic tube to put everything in, which is easy to store.&#10;&#10;Home Page:  www.destainia.com&#10;&#10;",

It's all three games in one.&#10;&#10;When you play Loose Lips, you'll give clues by talking in some rounds and acting or drawing in other rounds. Your goal is to get your teammates to guess the answer without letting forbidden similar words slip off their lips. If they guess the right word, your team scores. But if your team has loose lips and says the forbidden words, the other team scores.&#10;&#10;Here's an example: If the answer is Hawk and the forbidden Lip Slips are Bird and Buzzard, you'll have to give clues to get your team to say Hawk without saying the similar forbidden words&mdash;Bird or Buzzard. And you only have 60 seconds! This fast-paced party game will keep your teammates' lips moving while you talk, act or draw your way through each word.&#10;&#10;Loose Lips is played with 4 or more players in 2 teams, ages 12 to adult&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Silly'ables is a hilarious word game for 2 to 8 teams, ages 12 to adult. Each team when it&rsquo;s their turn rolls a die, and by that roll, they&rsquo;ll know whether they&rsquo;re trying to solve a one, two, or three syllable word.&#10;&#10;There are 500 playing cards in the game, each with a die representation from one to six. If a team tosses a 1 or 4 they will try to solve a one syllable word, toss a 2 or 5 they will try to solve a two syllable word, and finally if they toss a 3 or 6 they will try to solve a three syllable word. On each card there are random pictures of a red die, which are (all play) cards and the remaining picture of dies are in white (for that team only) cards.&#10;&#10;Each team will choose their partner to either be the giver or receiver of clues, and will alternate roles each time. No team member can be a giver or receiver more than once in a row. The giver of the clues can draw, do gestures, or give one word clues to get their partner to guess the target word. NO talking other than one word clues!&#10;&#10;There are three special symbols that might be on the cards. One that lets your partner know that a word sounds like another. Second, a symbol that indicates that you&rsquo;re looking for a word opposite of the word given as a clue. Finally third, a hand that shows either one, two, or three fingers which lets your partner know your looking for the first, second, or third syllable of a word to use with other syllables to eventually solve the target word.&#10;&#10;",

A Company of Special Troops will be arriving with a large shipment of Nazi gold coins. It is their job to hide and guard the gold. To ensure the loyalty of the troops, they are to be paid with that gold.&quot; The Colonel stops reading and looks our way. &quot;It seems the Nazis know the war is going badly, and that their Marks will soon be worthless. Your mission will be to relieve the Nazis of as much gold as possible. Unfortunately you will be parachuting into an area that makes extraction quite impossible. You should use whatever resources you have or can find to continue your mission. You may use the gold coins to buy supplies, as long as you keep it from the Nazis. We have contacts in the French Resistance, and that will be how we communicate future missions.&rdquo;&#10;And So It Begins.....&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www3.sympatico.ca/shadowcraft/Flipww2.html&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An extraordinarily rare game I recall playing as a child, Winflation' is little more than a fond memory for me now.  It belonged to a childhood friend--a gift from the designer, if I recall correctly--and I've never seen it in a store.&#10;&#10;To the best of my recollection, there were similarities to roll 'n' move games such as PayDay or Life:  The board was a simple figure-eight track around which the playing pieces would move, and each space had some sort of action or consequence for the player; there were also free spaces that required no activity.  In addition, there were stock certificates that could be purchased and/or traded as well as cards to be drawn at certain points; the cards also had ramifications for the player, similar to the Chance/Community Chest cards in Monopoly.&#10;&#10;I'm afraid I don't recall the specific mechanics--obviously the notion of inflation was part of the game--but the essential goal was to remain solvent and earn more money than your opponent(s).  My recollection is that the game ended when a certain period of time had passed, most likely defined by a set number of laps around the board.  I enjoyed the game quite a bit when I was a kid:  It seemed more sophisticated and complex than its roll 'n' move cousins, and I recall there being a number of potential activities to be undertaken with each turn.&#10;&#10;I would love to hear from anyone else who has played this rare gem.  It was published by a company called Zany Eights Productions, Inc., in Pottstown, PA; I suspect that the first-and-only print run was very limited, and Zany Eights never published any other games, as far as I know.&#10;&#10;edit:&#10;From the Rules:&#10;The object of the game is to be the last remaining played on the board who has survived week after week of spiraling inflation.  As inflation becomes worse and the cost of living increases, each player must meet his daily expenses, while making sure his salary keeps pace with current prices. Most Importantly, each player must keep his job in order to avoid certain financial disaster. Although provisions have been made for only six players, any number may participate. The amount of time required for each game varies with the rate of inflation.&#10;&#10;",
