A sled below this speed takes 1 dent card for each point of speed below 5.&#10;Furthermore, if a sled ends its movement on a crevasse square, the player doesn&acute;t refill his hand (as if colliding with another sled).&#10;&#10;Of course, the effects described above can be cumulative.&#10;Example: a player whose sled passes the purple line at speed 3 and ends its move on the crevasse takes 2 dent cards and doesn&acute;t refill his hand. Best of luck for the rest of the race!&#10;&#10;Enjoy the leap of death...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Matchup Cards is a card game made up of 26 pairs of matched cards plus one odd card. Decks of cards have different themes and the matched cards feature pictures that fit the theme.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt eight cards each. The remaining cards are placed face down to form a stock and players take turns drawing a card from the stock. If a player forms a matched pair of cards, the pair is displayed face up in front of the player. When the stock is exhausted, players continue to play by drawing a card from the next player in the sequence of play. When a player runs out of cards, that player drops out of play. In the end, one player is left with the odd card - this player loses regardless of how many pairs he or she has formed. Of the other players, the player with the most pairs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Eight pairs of matched cards are also designated as Command Cards. After a player forms a pair of of such cards, they can use the pair once (instead of drawing a card) to execute a special action. There are four different Command Cards:&#10;1) Reverse - these reverse the direction of play&#10;2) Take Two - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to select another player from which to draw two cards&#10;3) Give One - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to give a card to another player of their choice&#10;4) Miss Turn - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to miss their turn&#10;&#10;Players must use up their Command Cards before they run out of cards. If they still have unused Command Cards when they run out of cards in hand, they receive one card from every other player for every unused Command Card.&#10;&#10;Some themes that have been used for MatchUp Cards:&#10;Australian MatchUps&#10;Guo Nian MatchUps (Chinese New Year MatchUps)&#10;Asian Civilisations - Our Cultures Within&#10;World War II - Remembering Bukit Chandu &amp; Old Ford Factory&#10;Halloween MatchUps&#10;The Peranakans - Vignettes of a Proud Culture&#10;&#10;",

Your pieces will not always be able to move exactly as you want them to. The game requires a certain amount of strategic and tactical skill, combined with an ability to play the odds and to adjust your plans rapidly to a situation that can swiftly change if you don't have the numbers you need. Sometimes the dice will go against you and it becomes a&#10;case of simply trying to consolidate your men into a strong enough position to survive, sometimes they will go your way and allow you to do precisely what you want. In short, in this game you must learn to make do with what you have, and work with it to succeed.&#10;&#10;The game is also particularly suited for variation, using new board layouts, playing with dominoes instead of dice, or many other possible variations.&#10;&#10;The game is freely available to anyone who wants to play it and you are entirely free to make your own sets.&#10;Tied To A Kite Games make wooden sets, which will be released at the UK Games Expo 2009.&#10;&#10;The rules and board may be downloaded from the publisher's website.

Four scenarios including:&#10;1)   In an attempt to unify the country, the government of Pakistan launches an attack on India.&#10;2)      Fearing Islamic extremists will get their hands on a nuclear weapon India launches a pre-emptive strike.&#10;3)      Pakistan dissolves into Civil War. (This one is maybe not so theorhetical.)&#10;4)      The government of Pakistan falls. Armed with atomic weapons, the Taliban then launches an all-out attack on infidel India.&#10;&#10;The game includes complete rules, including the possibility of Chinese and US intervention, three cardstock sheets of playing pieces, two player aid cards, a card with charts and tables, and an 11x17&rdquo; unmounted mapboard. For two players ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;Some Assembly required. Dice, poster board, glue, and some pennies are required to play.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The game comes with several plastic pill bottles with substances that look like real life drugs.&#10;&#10;The game has a simple roll-and-move mechanic. Players can land on 3 different kinds of spaces. Yellow spaces make the player measure out a certain amount of a drug. If you land on blue, you get go on an adventure of do a fun activity. Red means you have to do a challenge that would be hard for someone who is under the effects of a certain drug.&#10;&#10;If you are unable to complete a challenge, you have to move back 3 spaces.&#10;&#10;Only one copy of this game was ever created. It was featured at the University of Southern California Fisher Gallery. If you want to buy this piece of art, you can.
