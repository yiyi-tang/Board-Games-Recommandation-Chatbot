The game ends when the bandit is either captured or becomes trapped (by certain spaces on the board).&#10;&#10;Star of India is also roll-and-move, with players this time attempting to secure the precious &quot;Star of India&quot; ruby from the House of Gems and return it to the Maharaja.  The game features a cardboard ring that the player can hang around their pawn's neck to show ring ownership - the winner is the first player to return home with the ring.  Alarm spaces and thefts from other players add some complications.&#10;&#10;",

The interesting part is that there is no central &quot;bank&quot; - every province has its own bank. So you pay money for the troops into the bank where you are hiring them and you get money for taxes from the bank where you tax your people (only in provinces you control). The results are richer and poorer provinces - with usually the richer provinces closer to the front lines (since that's where you want to hire troops).&#10;&#10;Troops come in different types, with different movement ranges and fighting strengths.&#10;&#10;Two German grade-school designers invented this game, which was chosen by the Deutsche Kinderhilfswerk to receive a grant, and G&uuml;nter Cornett at Bambus Spieleverlag has been helping the two develop the game over the past 2+ years.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, players have the opportunity to learn about some historical and touristic aspects of the city and its shops. On each turn a six-sided dice is rolled to determine how many spaces the player&rsquo;s pawn may move along a game-board depicting a simplified map of M&uuml;nster. At certain spaces, cards of the shops can be acquired or the player can go sightseeing by following the instructions written on the back of a card. Such instructions can be only a mere historical/touristic information, sometimes you need to pay or you may earn some money. The game ends when the last player reaches the final space and the winner is who has acquired the most sightseeing and/or shop cards.&#10;Since the game idea was developed by an advertisement agency, other German cities were focused in other similar games (for example, the game related to the city of Paderborn can be found at http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/25735)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the box lid:&#10;&#10;&quot;Captain your team to victory using all the tactical skill of a professional cricketer.&#10;&#10;Unique card and dice combination provide all the excitement of a fast moving one day cricket match.&#10;&#10;Easy to play - family fun.&quot;&#10;&#10;This game is themed around the one-day cricket phenomenon that became popular in the late 70s, although the board game lasts for 10 overs instead of 50 like the real game.&#10;&#10;Although the rules say that the game can be played by any number of players, in reality it seems to be designed for two people to oppose each other as the two team captains. Each captain has to make the same type of decisions that a cricket captain would normally make during a game, namely:&#10;&#10;&#10;     In what order to use his batsmen (four &quot;top&quot; batsmen, four &quot;medium&quot;, and three &quot;tail&quot;); typically you would use your best batsmen first, as they have no individual characteristics such as skill against a certain type of bowling.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     When to use his bowlers (two &quot;strike&quot; bowlers with one over each, two &quot;medium&quot; bowlers with two overs each, and two &quot;spin&quot; bowlers with two overs each). The rules suggest using your strike bowlers first to get the best batsmen out.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Where to place his fieldsmen; the bowler and wicket keeper have to be in their designated positions on the board, but the other nine can be placed in any one of 21 other named positions (mid-off, mid-on, extra cover, etc.). This seems to be where most of the decision-making takes place.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once the batsmen, bowler, and fieldsmen are in place and ready, a bowler/batsman matchup table is consulted to determine which of three coloured dice is rolled:&#10;&#10;&#10;     the black die (1,1,2,3,3,4), which favours neither batsman nor bowler&#10;     the blue die (1,2,3,4,4,6), which favours the batsman&#10;     the red die (1,1,1,2,2,4), which favours the bowler&#10;&#10;&#10;The indicated die is rolled. On a six, the batsman simply scores six runs (the maximum). On a 1 to 4, a card is drawn from the relevant deck, there being four named &quot;Card One&quot; to &quot;Card Four&quot;). Each card has three possible outcomes, one for each type of bowler. The relevant outcome is evaluated based on the positions of the fieldsmen. For example, one of the &quot;Card Three&quot; cards says this for the &quot;strike&quot; bowler:&#10;&#10;&quot;Driven in the air for some distance but a bad bounce beats mid-off who stumbles after it for 2 runs. No mid-off, 3 runs. No long-off, 4 runs.&quot;&#10;&#10;Some cards call for the red die to be rolled, in which case the batsman must roll a 1 NOT to be given out (50% chance).&#10;&#10;The innings is over once ten batsmen are out or ten overs have been completed. Each team has one innings, after which the team with the higher score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Imperial Rome is the fourth expansion for Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients.&#10; By now, all of you that own this game have already discovered that Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients is an expandable game system. A game system that allows players to effectively portray stylized Ancient historical battles that play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&#10;&#10;In this expansion we have taken the opportunity to present a number of battles that we just did not have room to include in prior expansions. The Romans fight in Britain at Medway 43AD, against Boudica at Watling Street 61 AD, and later at Mons Graupius 84AD. Antony and Octavian of the Second Triumvirate battle it out twice with Cassius and Brutus at Philippi 42BC. But the main focus of this expansion is Rome's conflicts against the Parthian Empire, Teutonic Barbarians and internal turmoil of civil wars until Constantine becomes the undisputed Roman Emperor around 325AD.&#10;&#10;Imperial Rome is packed full of unique and interesting play concepts and new units: cataphracted cavalry, wagon laager forts, massed units of horse archers, light infantry tossing caltrops and more. Each of these concepts operates within the confines of the original system rules, with only slight modifications to reflect historical abilities and importance. So, rules-wise, if you own Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble learning the few new special rules.&#10;&#10;Important: In order to play the scenarios in the Imperial Rome expansion, you will need a copy of the basic Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients game and copies of Expansion Nr. 1 Greek vs The Eastern Kingdoms and Expansion Nr. 2 Rome vs The Barbarians.  You can substitute &quot;other&quot; armies for some of the scenarios, but others have specific force requirements (like lots of horse archers) which may make that hard to do.&#10;&#10;",

The Pacific 1942 SunRise extension cannot be played without the basic version of the game.&#10;&#10;It adds new elements to the basic game and thus makes the game more varied.&#10;&#10;To play the Pacific 1942 SunRise extension, it is necessary to know the rules of the basic version.&#10;&#10;Contents of the extension: &#10;- Five randomly selected hexagon sextets (i.e. tiles)&#10;- Three extra battalions of the marines, three bomber squadrons and three fighter squadrons&#10;- Six extra prisms, which, in the Pacific 1942 Admiral game, stand for the power and speed of ships. In Pacific 1942 SunRise extension, you will have also another use for them.&#10;- Eight completely new island tiles&#10;- 21 risk cards&#10;- A typhoon triplet consisting of three tiles&#10;- A night card&#10;&#10;What does Pacific 1942 SunRise change?&#10;&#10;Firstly, there is a new goal. To win the basic version, you had to seize four islands in the Pacific. Now, the task becomes even more demanding: You have to push your enemy out of all islands.&#10;In the basic version, a player could seize an island and that was it. In Pacific 1942 SunRise, some islands can be turned into powerful bases. (See more below.)&#10;Apart from the new island tiles, the risk cards represent another extremely important novelty. At the end of his or her turn, every player can decide to take a risk card instead of producing a new battle unit. (The use of these cards is specified below.)&#10;&#10;Eight new island tiles&#10;&#10;Eight new island tiles comprise two sets of four tiles. Every player receives a set of four tiles. The new island tiles are of the following types:&#10;- A tile with a trench.&#10;- A tile with an airfield.&#10;- A tile with a harbour.&#10;- A tile with a fortress.&#10;&#10;Risk cards&#10;There are 16 types of risk cards in the game. Before every game, they have to be thoroughly shuffled and placed with their face down. At the end of each turn, instead of production, a player can take one risk card. You can encounter the following risk cards:&#10;1.Minesweeper&#10;2.Rudder hit&#10;3.Typhoon&#10;4.Submarine&#10;5.Paratroopers&#10;6.False token&#10;7.Extra production&#10;8.New ship&#10;9.Lifeboat&#10;10.Reconnaissance&#10;11.Fleet&#10;12.SunRise&#10;13.Open Card&#10;14.Waves&#10;15.Night&#10;16.Last moment&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Pacific 1942 Admiral&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Cupidoian parents receive government subsidies to help offset their phone bills.&#10;&#10;Out of necessity, Cupidoians have a more hard-boiled view of romance than earthlings do. When they reach adolescence, they decide on exactly what they are willing to settle for in a relationship. They do not accept anything less or hold out for anything more. Most earthlings behave in the opposite manner.&#10;&#10;While one God of Love is generally enough for Earth, Cupido requires several. Each player of the game is an invisible cupid, hovering around a small town that contains 100 single Cupidoians, ten of each sex. The first player who can get ten Cupidoians of different sexes to marry each other is the winner.&#10;&#10;Cupido is a game for two to six players that takes about a half-hour for experienced players to play. The game requires a deck of 100 cards and a &quot;love dart&quot; prop [such as a matchstick or a coin] for each player. Each player will also need a long space on the table to spread out ten cards.&#10;&#10;You will have to construct the card deck from images available on this web site. When the deck is completed, look at the cards. Each card represents a Cupidoian. It shows the Cupidoian's name and picture, and three pieces of information about it: it's sex, it's attributes, and it's desire.&#10;&#10;",

Play alternates between share dealing rounds, in which players buy and sell stock in railroads, and operating rounds, in which players build track, run trains and ferries, and manage the assets of the companies in which they own controlling interest.&#10; 1865: Midwest uses 8 major railroads, 4 minor railroads, and 8 private companies to simulate the rich railroad history of the region. As the game progresses, the 4 minor railroads will pair off, each pair forming a larger railroad, or system. Later, two of the major railroads are destined to merge into a third system.&#10; The game is designed, from the ground up, to give each player an equal opportunity to succeed in amassing great wealth during the game. In 1865: Midwest there is more than one path to victory, so don't be afraid of losing the game in the first few rounds. You have more control than ever before of the operations of your railroads, but be mindful: so do your opponents!&#10; 1865: Midwest should be a challenging, and engaging gaming experience for the seasoned 18xx gamer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Polar Quizz is trivia-type game about the polar environment, both arctic and antarctic: fauna, polar explorers, geography, indigenous people, etc.&#10;&#10;No particular knowledge on the subject is required to play. Players just need to use their memory, as the facts are given along the game. Thus, kids can easily win against adults, and learn valuable information at the same time.&#10;&#10;The game is made of 100 square cards. Each card displays the picture of an animal, a polar explorer, a map, etc... All the questions and answers are gathered in a booklet. Each card has a number referring to a set of questions and their answers in the booklet. This feature allows the games to be easily translated in many different languages. Currently, each box contains 4 languages: English, French, German and Norwegian.&#10;&#10;Players try to win cards by answering their questions. Each card yields points and the winner is the first to score 7 points. If a player gives the wrong answers to a card, the right answers are given to all the participants. Hence, later in the game, this card becomes easier to be won, but only if  you could memorize these answers.&#10;&#10;",
