    "Description": "This is a non-partnership precise-bid trick-taking game with a few twists.&#10;&#10;The deck has five suits (1-King), with  Mardi-Gras  - related symbols: Masks, Crowns, Doubloon, Fleur de Lis, and Beads -- Masks are always trump.  Plus there is one Mardi Gras card, which counts as the highest trump; and two FATuesday cards, which can always be played and count as the lowest cards (if led, a suit is declared).  The 68 cards deal evenly with 4 players; with other numbers, leave out enough &quot;1&quot; cards so it goes evenly.&#10;&#10;Each player bids the number of tricks he'll take -- the goal is to take exactly that many.  If you make your bid you get 10 points per trick (a successful bid of 0 earns 10).  If you go over, you get 1 point per trick taken; if under, you lose 10 points times your bid.  Play until a pre-assigned total, such as 200 point.&#10;&#10;The advanced Challenge game has extra rules: The Mardi Gras card can be declared when played as the highest or lowest trump; when led, each player must play their highest trump in hand.  Bids are in secret, written down and revealed simultaneously.  A Nil bid goes for 0 tricks and earns or loses 50 points.  Finally, after the bids each player has a chance to double their own bid, to double the points at stake, except you also lose if you go over your bid.&#10;&#10;",

There is a card for each state, with the value of their electoral vote total (as in 1976); they are split into two suits so the votes are split evenly.  (The cards also have common info about each state: capitol, population, area, state bird/tree/flower, etc.)  There is also a card for D.C., and 3 cards for territories.&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt, players bid the number of votes they think they can win, winner declares trump suit, and trick-taking play commences, the vote for the cards acting as their rank.  The DC card is wild and captures its trick automatically; the territory cards void the tricks they are played on.  The declarer adds or subtracts their bid depending on if they won.  Winner is the first one to make 270 total votes.&#10;&#10;",

Corresponding game pieces are then strategically placed on the playing board.&#10;&#10;Because Roll &rsquo;n Multiply encourages cooperative play, opponents assist each other in multiplying the numbers, and the enclosed multiplication table confirms the answer. Four in a row wins the game- but watch out! Your playing piece may be captured and then flipped to the opponent&rsquo;s side! For beginning players, winning depends on luck and strategy, not on multiplication ability. Advanced students challenge their opponent&rsquo;s multiplication and strategy skills or assist novice players with multiplication.&#10;&#10;",

WARLANDS pits the last human survivors against each other and the unnatural horrors that breed in the wastelands and dead cities. Strap yourself in for high octane action from small scale skirmishes to epic battles, The WARLANDS sing with the screams of the dying and the roar of machines&hellip;&#10;&#10;WARLANDS is a turbo-charged miniature game of cinematic combat set in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic earth. Where the last remnants of Man battle for supremacy and resources against mutants, the dead and each other! Where the warriors of the &#10;wastelands want but one thing, the black gold, the guzzoline.&quot;&#10;&#10;Warlands is a miniatures wargame involving vehicular combat in a post-apocalyptic (Road Warrior, Deathrace, Doomsday, etc. inspired) setting.  Players can build forces of weaponized cars, trucks, dune-buggies, bikes, walkers, as well as foot infantry.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is quick and is alternating activation.  Players roll for initiative, and each activates a model, based on speed, where they move, shoot, accelerate, decelerate and perform special actions (emergency braking, bootlegger reverse, un-jam weapon, etc).  Once all activations have been performed the turn ends.&#10;&#10;Each vehicle type (Car, Truck, Buggie, Semi, Walker, etc) has their own special abilities and base attributes.  These include their speed and maneuverability, ability to absorb damage, and off-road capabilities.&#10;&#10;Shooting involves die rolling, where shooter must roll higher than a fixed target value, based on the target's current speed (the faster it's going, the harder it is to hit).  Models in very close range get extra bonuses to hit.  Shooting has critical success / failure mechanisms, where a success would be an auto hit and a failure results in a weapons jam.&#10;&#10;Damage is modified by the target's armor and the weapons armor penetration value.  This will determine the target value for the dice rolled to damage the target.  Each target has a number of hit points.  Critical damage rolls result in special damage to a vehicle that can range from degrading its performance to outright destroying it in a ball of fire.&#10;&#10;Movement has compulsory movement to simulate momentum, and varies by the model type and current speed.  Each model has a number of 45 degree turns it's allowed within a turn and how far it must move in a straight line before it can turn again.  Special Maneuvers require a die roll to beat a target value, the roll is modified by the driver's skill, current vehicle speed and available turns the vehicle has.  Success generally means the vehicle can turn or maneuver any way it wants, failure results in random movement or total wipe-out of vehicle.&#10;&#10;The scale is 20mm and is compatible with most die-cast toy cars (Matchbox, Hotwheels, etc.).  The line will include not only vehicles but blister packs of weapons and customization bitz to upgrade existing toy cars.  At first this seems odd for a miniatures wargaming scale, but the movement works well within a 4x4 table and being able to customize toy cars will be a hobby in itself.&#10;&#10;",

Successful experiment? You call it!&#10;&#10;The playing area is made up of a 6 x 6 area of tiles (the extra 36 tiles are placed in 6 piles of 6 tiles each at the top of the paying area, which represent the tide.) Each player controls 4 pawns, representing friends who are collecting shells &amp; cleaning up trash at a beach. On his turn, each player can do one of the following: move one of his friends, collect ONE seashell, or collect one OR MORE pieces of rubbish. Each time a tile is removed, it is replaced by a tile from the tide.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met: one of the players reaches 10 points: that player is the winner, OR one of the column runs out of tiles (no tiles in the column, no tiles in the relevant pile); the winner is the player with the most points. In case of a tie, the winner among tied players is the one with the most tiles&#10;&#10;(Note: the link on the game's website to the pieces is broken.

    "Description": "On the heels of the very successful Battlestations Adventure Game, comes a new stand alone game in the Battlestations Universe. Instead of controlling one crew member in adventure style missions you&rsquo;ll be able to play Battlestations: Fleet Actions taking charge of multiple ships and crews. No referee is needed as players battle each other for mission objectives, all the while gaining prestige, leveling up their crews with new ship wide special abilities.&#10;&#10;Featured is a new sleek rule set that has all the familiar Battlestations feel, but built for quicker and faster resolution on a massive scale. The familiar power levels in the ships are there with a few minor tweaks. For starters, all ships have unlimited helm power allowing them to perform a number of actions a phase only limited by the number of pilots. As a drawback however, any ship that fails in a piloting maneuver loses the rest of it&rsquo;s actions! Make sure those pilots go last! If you have to turn the ship to fire weapons make sure you make your skill check! Guns and shields work a little differently. The size of your ship determines the power that both guns and shields can have combined. It&rsquo;s up to the player to decide how that power is split. So a size 9 ship has 9 points of power to split between guns and shields. Unlike Battlestations energy levels never drop and there&rsquo;s no more power generation before a round begins. This means there&rsquo;s only ever two times during the course of the game that you have to adjust power levels; if your engines go down or if you transfer power. No more power booking keeping between rounds.&#10;&#10;Another new game mechanic is automatic actions. By activating crew some actions happen automatically.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;A fun and exciting card game for kids and adults.  Over 100 cards that will keep memories of the 20th Century alive forever.&quot;&#10;&#10;This unique deck has one card for each year from 1900 to 1998, with 5 events that happened that year, of all types: politics, sports, arts, inventions, etc.  There are also two 1999 cards, which act like wild cards, and four 2000 &quot;Millenium Bug&quot; cards, that are penalty cards.  The events each have an icon next to them to show a specific type: e.g. car, tennis player, Olympic rings, airplane, dollar sign, national flag, anchor, skull, etc.&#10;&#10;There are rules to three games included.  In all of them, 10 cards are dealt to each player.&#10;&#10;Century Classic is rummy-like: during their turn players draw, lay down melds, and discard.  Acceptable melds are: chains, 3 or more consecutive years; and matches: 3 or more that have the same event icon.  Players can also add to their previous melds, but not to others'.  When a player goes out, the others receive penalty points for what's left in their hand.  1999 cards are wild, and each player may use their birth year as a personal wild.  If you have a 2000 card may play it to the table and draw a replacement, taking up your whole turn; 2000's in your hand at the end add to your penalties.&#10;&#10;Century Chain is Uno-like.  Players may play a card to the discard pile if it matches one of its icons, or is adjacent in year.  You may continue playing until you have nothing left.  If you have nothing to start, you may draw one card instead.  (1999s and 2000s are not included in this game.)  First player out of cards wins.&#10;&#10;Century Face Off is a quasi-trick-taking game.  Players take turns playing a card to the center, and the one who played highest year takes the trick and leads to the next.  After the  10 cards are out, another 10 each (or however many are left) are dealt out.  Winner is the one who takes the most tricks.&#10;&#10;",

There is also a card that just says &quot;Flax&quot;.  And, two rules cards, and a title card that advertises the other versions: Flax Dinosaurs, and Flax Creatures of the Sea.&#10;&#10;The Flax basic game is War-like.  All the cards are dealt out, and everyone looks at their top card.  The leading player picks one attribute and reads it out loud (&quot;Okapi, Max Speed 35 mph&quot;.)  Everyone lays their card down and the card with the highest value in that attribute takes the lot; they go to the bottom of the winner's pile and he leads to the next trick.  The &quot;Flax&quot; card wins any trick but only may be used once.  The ultimate winner is the one who gets all the cards.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, players may look at their whole hand.  The leader chooses a card and a category, and only players who can beat it play to the middle.  The one who takes the trick leads next; but the game is won by the player who gets rid of all their cards first.&#10;&#10;",

In truth, it has been several days, each intervening day filled with frantic activity as the crew prepared for the forthcoming battle. Now that battle was upon them. On the plot, two fleets could be seen closing in on one another. As the captain of the Horan watched, flanking forces detached themselves first from the European fleet, quickly followed by matching elements from the Union fleet. These elements would attempt to get around the heavy screens to the key units the escorts were protecting, the flagship and carriers. Soon the battle would truly be joined...&#10;__________________________________________________________&#10;What you hold in your hands is the Master Rules to the Fleet Action 2 combat system as well as the introductory information to the epic Turning Point Universe. These rules will allow you to fight massive battles involving potentially dozens of ships and even more fighters. If that's not enough, a highly robust and flexible design system will allow you to create the fleet of your dreams, whether it be from your favourite sci-fi epic or concocted from the deepest realms of your imagination.&#10;&#10;Highlights of the Fleet Action 2 combat system...&#10;&#10;     Modular design allows for easier expansion&#10;     Combined arms mechanics encouraging the use of speciality ships such as escorts and carriers&#10;     A myriad of types of weapons, each with their own strengths &amp; weaknesses&#10;     Streamlines combat rules allowing for large numbers of warships&#10;     Simple but flexible fighter rules make large numbers of fighters simple to wield&#10;     Powerful and robust custom design rules allow for the design of new weapons, ships, ammunition types and fighters&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Notes: This was published as a loose-leaf rulebook, pre-drilled for 4-ring binders. Originally intended to update Fleet Action in the Babylon 5 universe, Agents of Gaming lost the franchise during development, and so developed a setting of near-space settlement with various Earth nations and coalitions as the factions. An extensive line of miniatures was planned , but only the first few released before AoG ceased trading and closed it's doors for the final time.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a twist on the classic game Othello/Reversi. The player playing the black pieces (that is the black side of the pieces) is called Black. The other player plays the white pieces and is called White. In Reviser the players play different roles. One player will play the 'Setter,' the other will play the 'Jumper.' Setter and Jumper keep their role during the whole game. At his turn, the Setter places one of his pieces on the board. That piece must be in line with one of his pieces so that one or more opponents pieces are between them (without any empty fields between them). These opponents pieces are flipped. This is the same mechanism as in Reversi. At his turn the Jumper must jump with one of his pieces (on the board) over any number of his opponents pieces in a straight line. The opponents pieces he jumped over are flipped. He may continue to jump with that piece if possible. He must not jump over his own pieces or over empty fields.&#10;&#10;The game ends if one player is unable to make a legal move. The player with the greater number of his pieces on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;An entry into the About.com: 2002 Unequal Forces Game Design Competition.&#10;&#10;",

Most tasks have a certain psychological background. But this psychological element is rather only an additional dimension of tasks and it isn't necessary for players to mark it. Players draw one task card in each round, they read a setting and a certain numbers of players will be able to register to the task. If the task is carried out he/she will get a number of votes (this number of supposed votes is chosen by each player himself/herself before carrying out the task). Players can carry out about 16 tasks in each game.&#10;&#10;",

(They are in opposite corners, but in each corner you see one letter, its value, and the letter in the opposite corner.)  Of the 105 cards, 8 of them have a are wild cards in one corner, and four are wild on both ends.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 8 cards, and the top card of the draw pile is used to start the discard pile.  In a turn, a player makes a word starting with either letter of the top discard, and using cards from his hand for the rest.  The letters' values -- ranging from 2 to 20 -- are added for the word's score, which is added to the player's total.  The word is then discarded, the player fills out their hand back to 8 from the draw pile, and the next player takes a turn, using the new top discard to start a word.&#10;&#10;Players pass if they cannot make a word from their hand.  The game ends when every player passes in turn, typically after the draw pile is exhausted.  The lower value of each card in hand is subtracted from the players' scores, and the highest total wins.  Optional rules allow bonus points for long words.&#10;&#10;",

In ROLL DICE KILL MONSTERS HAVE FUN DUNGEON CRAWLER there are two kinds of mazes. The first is to successfully reach the finish from a set start point. The second is to successfully meet and defeat a boss type character. ROLL DICE KILL MONSTERS HAVE FUN DUNGEON CRAWLER is the groundbreaking amalgamation of a board game and an analog role playing game, without any of the convoluted aspects of analog role playing games.&#10;&#10;",

Forces can be created in one of three ways: using a simple random force generation system to get you playing quickly, a more advanced system for experienced players, and a detailed points system for the ultimate in flexibility. Though the system is easy to learn and play, this doesn&rsquo;t mean the game is lacking details.&#10;&#10;In fact, there are actually three levels of play. First you will learn the Basic Game, which provides all the core rules necessary to head off into battle. Then, as you become familiar with the system, you might want to consider using some of the Advanced Rules, which will add more depth to your gaming experience. Finally, there are a number of Optional Rules which you can incorporate into your games to add even greater detail. The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;Fast and Dirty is a generic system, specifically designed to work with a wide array of settings and miniatures. Feel free to devise your own worlds and forces, based upon the miniatures in your collection.&#10;&#10;",

Over 650 individually rated players representing all 30 teams are yours to command.&#10;&#10;Fast Action Hockey plays quickly because it focuses on the &quot;fun stuff&quot;--shooting and scoring--while eliminating time-consuming elements that add little or nothing to the excitement such as face-offs, puck passing, penalties, line changes, time-clock tracking, etc. What makes FAH even better is the ease and quickness of play. You won&rsquo;t have to spend an hour or two playing a single game. Instead, once you are familiar with the play sequence and the charts, you can play a game in 20 minutes or less, and easily replay the entire Stanley Cup finals in one evening!&#10;&#10;Basic Sequence of Play&#10;&#10;There are three phases to FAH:&#10;&#10;1) Select 18 players and 1 goaltender from each team and list them on the score sheet.&#10;&#10;2) Determine the number of shots each player will take during the game and write down in the &quot;SOG&quot; column of the scoresheet.  To do this, check for the player&rsquo;s shots grade (&quot;Sh&quot; on the roster sheet), roll all 3 dice and consult the &quot;Player Shots&quot; chart.&#10;&#10;3) Resolve the shots for each player (i.e., determine the outcome of each player&rsquo;s shots on goal.) and assign assists (the number of assists for each goal is indicated on the goal scoring chart).&#10;&#10;Fast Action Hockey will produce lifelike statistical performances over the course of an entire replay season when playing schedules similar to the actual.&#10;&#10;(Game was marketed on a limited scale in 2001 only, and sold primarily through Ebay).&#10;&#10;",
