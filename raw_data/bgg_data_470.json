He/She then challenges the Word Defender(W.D.) by calling out a word. The W.D. then has to form the word by using the Letter Cube Cards.

If the W.C. gets more points he/she can add them to his/her score.&#10;&#10;In the next round the W.C. becomes the W.D. and The W.D. becomes the W.C. The game continues like that until the 10th round is reached. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;During the round the W.C. keeps score.&#10;&#10;",

The words are similarly colour coded so that a child shouldn't be put off finding a letter in a particular word if you show them that they just need to look at the colour of the letter first. Then they only have to search for the correct letter out of a small group of letters all the same colour instead of the whole alphabet. Children will be keen to show they can do it by just finding the letter rather than the colour. Level 1 just starts spelling words like 'cat' whilst higher levels move onto 'pear' and bean' showing different sounds made by 'ea'.&#10;&#10;",

At sea, several battleships and the first aircraft carrier provided cover.

Rather than swallow their pride and try to bum a ride home, they decide to pick themselves up by the bootstraps, working odd jobs until they get enough money to buy a plane ticket home.&#10;&#10;The game board is a little bit reminiscent of Monopoly in that there is a &quot;Go&quot; that must be passed regularly, but this is where the similarity ends. The board is further divided into three parts by two other &quot;one-way&quot; arrows and while movement can normally be back and forth, once passing these arrows they may not be passed in the wrong direction again. The board is not a single track either; there are branches that may be explored in search of opportunities. Bus stops allow the players to cover distance quickly (which of course costs money, though) and there are two kiosks where they can buy newspapers with job ads, or raffle tickets in the hope of some quick cash winnings. And then the most important places; the jobs. If a player holds a paper with the correct job ad they're hired automatically, if not they can try to roll for a 5 or 6. Whether or not the player is hired they can only apply for the same job once per board round, and can only work a total of 2 different jobs before passing &quot;Go&quot; again. (Interestingly, while an out-of-cash tourist in a strange town - possibly in a foreign country - the player can still work pretty demanding jobs such as policeman, fireman etc.) And of course, there is the occasional event space to brighten or darken the players' day with some funny escapades or swings of luck.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect 3000 money (currency not specified in the game) and then get to the airport - on an exact roll, mind you - wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is dealt thirteen cards.&#10;&#10;The auction process is more simple than bridge. Each player counts the number of high card points he has (4 for an Ace, 3 for a King, 2 for a Queen and 1 for a Jack) and states the number of high card points. The partnership with the more high card points then has to play the hand. (If both partnerships have the same number of high card points, the hand is thrown in.) Of this partnership, the partner with the more high card points becomes the declarer. The partner with the fewer high card points becomes the dummy and lays out his hand. (If both partners have the same number of high card points, the one who states his high card point count first is the declarer.)&#10;&#10;The declarer then looks at his partner's hand and decides what suit he wants to be trumps (if any), and whether to be in game or to take part score. In part score he must make 7 tricks, and in game he must make 6 tricks (assumed) plus 3 for no trumps, 4 for a major suit or 5 for a minor suit.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Trumps&#10;&#10;         Partscore&#10;&#10;         Game&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Clubs&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         5&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Diamonds&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         5&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Hearts&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Spades&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         No trumps&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The game then continues per bridge with 13 rounds of cards.&#10;&#10;The scoring system is also simplified.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North, Lee learned of a threatening Federal advance East of Hagerstown, Maryland. Because Stonewall Jackson was besieging Harper' Ferry, he instructed Daniel Harvey Hill to hold the South Mountain passes in the rugged Blue Ridge, just East of Boonsboro. It was essential to delay McClellan&rsquo;s progress so Jackson would have time to take Harper's Ferry and reunite his scattered divisions before the Army of the Potomac caught him unprepared.&#10;&#10;Despite strong defensive features the numerically superior Federal forces should have overwhelmed the rebels but the inaction of Pleasonton and Burnside squandered their advantage. In the end Lee's defense of the South Mountain passes cost him 2800 casualties as opposed to the Federal losses of 2300 and led directly to the fearful slaughter at Antietam.&#10;&#10;Fire on the Mountain concentrates on the action around Turner's Gap and Fox Gap, emphasizing the difficulty of mountainous terrain and the seesaw nature of the battle into which reinforcements continue to trickle and the effects of officer casualties. The game uses simple mechanics to simulate movement, artillery, cavalry, leaders, and difficult terrain, with a unique combat system that allows the game to move quickly while still simulating the tense nature of the battle.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game scale&#10;Unit size: Brigades&#10;Game Turn: represents 1 hour&#10;Hex Scale:300 yds per hex&#10;Playtime: 2 and 1/2 to 3 hours&#10;Complexity: Low to Moderate&#10;&#10;",

Grant on the orders given to General Phillip Sheridan, August 7th, 1864.&#10; &ldquo;&hellip;as [the 23rd Ohio] rose from the bank, away went my boys as though ten thousand devils were after them.&rdquo;  --Confederate General John B. Gordon, following the battle of Opequon Creek.&#10; Devil Takes All! is a simulation of the battle fought on September 19th, 1864, at Opequon Creek (also called the Third Battle of Winchester) between the Confederate Army of the Valley under General Jubal Early and the Union Army of the Shenandoah under General Phillip Sheridan.  The battle was one of the last fought in the Shenandoah Valley.  Former Vice-President of the United States, John C. Breckinridge, was in titular command of the Confederate forces, while two future presidents, Rutherford B. Hayes and William McKinley, figured prominently in the battle&rsquo;s outcome.&#10; Devil Takes All! uses an interactive sequence of play that activates formations, and their subordinate units, by the types of orders (Attack, Advance, Stand, Reserve) they have been issued. Combat is of two types, fire and melee, and both individual unit and larger formation morale figure prominently in the game&rsquo;s outcome. Rules include ones for leaders, variable reinforcements, and possible Confederate withdrawal. Scenarios cover the morning&rsquo;s &ldquo;opening round&rdquo; in which both sides were surprised to discover a fight would occur here, the afternoon&rsquo;s bloody, climatic slugfest in which the remnants of the Stonewall Brigade made their final appearance, as well as the comprehensive day-long battle.&#10; Terrain scale is about 500 meters per hex&#10;Infantry units and cavalry units are brigades, artillery units are battalions. &#10;Each strength point represents 250 men.&#10;Each turn is about 45 minutes. &#10; Playing time is about 2.5 to 3 hours for the AM and PM scenarios, about 6+ hours for the day-long battle scenario. Although designed for two players, Devil Takes All! can easily be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s only a scouting probe!&rdquo; &#10;--General Howe, a little before 7:00 AM upon seeing, out of the fog, the headlong retreat of the 2nd Light Infantry pickets. Moments later he and his staff came under sustained American artillery fire.&#10; A Barbarous Ground is a simulation of the battle fought on October 4th, 1777, at the crossroads village of Germantown between the Continental Army under General George Washington and the British Army under Lord Cornwallis.  The British had split their Army after occupying Philadelphia, and Washington believed he was presented with an excellent opportunity with defeating the invaders in detail. While the initial American attack succeeded splendidly, the morning fog, smoke, a determined stand by the British 40th Regiment at Chew House, and greater British experience in battle allowed the defending forces time to regroup and counter-attack; snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Can you do better?&#10; A Barbarous Ground uses an interactive sequence of play that activates formations, and their subordinate units, by the types of orders (Attack, Advance, Stand, Reserve) they have been issued.

    "Description": " &#10;Corregidor  is a simulation of the two battles fought for Corregidor and the fortefied islands at the entrance to Manila Bay during World War II.  The first battles began with the bombing of the island in ealry 1942 and ended in May of that year with it's surrender.&#10; After General Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines, Corregidor once again became a target of invasion, both to avenge the loss three years before and to clear the mouth of Manila Bay to Allied shipping.&#10; Corregidor: Fall of a Fortress 1942/1945, includes two games. The first game recreates the Japanese bombardment and invasion in 1942 and the second simulates the American airborne invasion and reconquest in 1945.&#10;&#10;&#10;EXTENDED GAME DESCRIPTION:&#10;&#10;CORREGIDOR is played in successive game turns composed of alternate player turns during which the phasing player maneuvers his units and resolves combat in sequence. Turns consist of the Administrative Phases (reinforcement arrival, disruption removal, Fired marker removal), the Air Attack Phase (which includes airborne assault), first Player Turn (AA fire, bombardment, invasion, ground movement, and combat), and then the second Player Turn.&#10;&#10;Some detail features of the game are tracking Japanese landing craft losses, American communications disruption, U.S. air and naval support points, unit disruption levels, and which artillery units have fired.&#10;&#10;The six hexes adjacent to an undisrupted land unit constitute that unit&rsquo;s Zone of Control. Disrupted land units DO NOT have ZOCs, and therefore judicious use of support to disrupt enemy units allows the attacker to infiltrate through weak positions and to launch flanking attacks against defending units. This is critical because defending units are doubled and sometimes tripled by the rugged and the unique features on the maps, such as rough terrain, cliffs, elevation changes, tunnels, towns, and coast defense artillery emplacements.&#10;&#10;In the 1942 scenarios, there is a cat-and-mouse game which develops between the Japanese artillery and air units versus the American artillery and anti-aircraft defenses. Aircraft need to designate the altitude at which they conduct bombing &ndash; the lower the attack level the more accurate the bombing, but also the more accurate the AA fire. Similarly, artillery which fires is more vulnerable to counter-battery fire and so making a bombardment attack must be weighed against the possibility of return fire.&#10;&#10;In 1945, in addition to banzai options, the Japanese have the option to make suicide demolitions, which destroy the attacking unit but also damage adjacent units. There is a mechanism to occasionally compel such attacks, which not only forces some historicity but it also models the uncoordinated local Japanese command structure in 1945.&#10;&#10;Some optional rules included:&#10;&#10;Spike Rule - U.S. Batteries must be spiked when Japanese units come within two hexes to prevent them from being captured in usable condition. They may not be voluntarily destroyed until after a Japanese unit has landed on their island. Flip the battery over after the following U.S. Bombardment Phase. The unit may then move and fight normally.&#10;&#10;Restored Batteries - Roll one die on the turn of the American invasion in 1945 for the surviving former U.S. batteries:&#10; 1 &ndash; Battery may fire normally.&#10; 2 &ndash; Battery sabotaged by POWs, gun crew fights as infantry.&#10;3-6 &ndash; Battery was never manned; remove from map.&#10;&#10;Additional U.S. Batteries - Three 240mm howitzer batteries which were to be installed in 1922 actually arrive. One battery is deployed anywhere on Fort Frank, one on Fort Hughes, and one on Fort Mills (Corregidor).&#10;&#10;Philippine Division Transferred - The 31st, 45th, and 57th Regiments are transferred to Corregidor prior to the fall of Bataan. Add them to the available U.S. forces in Scenario 11.1. Due to the effects of fighting on Bataan, plus short rations and disease, these units are deployed at reduced strength. As an additional option, they may be deployed at full strength to simulate these units being in better condition historically.&#10;&#10;Itagaki Rule - Japanese defense commander Capt. Itagaki did not believe an airborne assault could be made on Corregidor. He was killed on Topside during the initial paradrop, while waiting to observe the amphibious assault for which he had prepared. Additionally, his central communications station was overrun very quickly by the paratroops. In this rule, he is killed and no Japanese unit may move until the first night turn.&#10;&#10;U.S. Roving Batteries - During the campaign for Bataan and Corregidor, the U.S. created a number of &ldquo;roving batteries&rdquo; of 155mm guns by removing them from their emplacements and mounting them such that they could be moved about Corregidor.&#10;&#10;U.S. Searchlights - The U.S. had several searchlight batteries on the Fortified Islands. This option forces the Japanese to actually expend the effort to destroy them and if they are not, they provide some advantage to the U.S. Player.&#10;&#10;If a Japanese invasion or evacuation is occurring in a night turn and there is an active U.S. searchlight unit on the map, the U.S. Player receives a +2 die modifier (cumulative with any other DRMs) when firing on Japanese units in water hexes.&#10;&#10;If a Japanese air bombardment is conducted at night, U.S. Anti-aircraft fire receives an additional +1 modifier to any other DRMs which apply; Japanese Bombardment rolls receive an additional -1 modifier to any other DRMs which apply.&#10;&#10;Battery Way - Battery Way did not have a crew and was not operational until April 28. The U.S. might have activated this battery sooner. Roll at the beginning of the 0300 daily turn. The battery is active at full strength on a roll of 2 or 12. The battery becomes active automatically on Turn 65 if not activated sooner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game scale&#10;Unit size: Generally artillery batteries and infantry platoons, with some company- and section-size units. Some individual naval units are depicted; air units are generally three aircraft per step.&#10;&#10;Game turn: Movement and combat on the Fortified Islands maps is in three-hour turns in 1942, and two-hour daylight turns in 1945, with night turns representing five hours each. There are also daily turns to keep track of reinforcements as well as to frame the complete campaigns. By mutual agreement, players may skip any daily or hourly turn in which neither player plans to execute any movement, combat, or bombardment.&#10;&#10;Hex scale: The scale of the Fortified Islands map is roughly 250 yards per hex; the scale of the Bataan map is roughly 1.25 miles per hex.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Senterej is the form of chess played in and around Ethiopia.  It is sometimes simply called Ethiopian chess.  As in international chess, Senterej is played on an 8x8 (but non-checkered) board, and each player has an army of 16 pieces:  8 Medeq (pawns), 1 Nagus (king), 1 Fers (counselor), 2 Saba (elephants), 2 Ferese (horses), and 2 Der (castles).  Except for the Fers and Saba, all pieces move and capture as in international chess.  The Fers moves one square diagonally; the Saba jumps two squares diagonally.  In addition, pawns do not make initial two-square moves, castling is permitted only on the right side, and promotion is limited to previously captured pieces.  Ethiopian chess has a unique Ta'biyat (mobilization) phase, in which players simultaneously make moves at high speed until the first capture.  After the first capture, the mobilization phase ends, and players begin to move alternately.&#10;&#10;",

Two or three players control the opposing armies in any of four scenarios. The game shows central and eastern Ukraine at 32 kilometers/20 miles per hex and 7-8 days per turn, and the armies involved at about 2,000 combat troops per unit, with additional logistical bases, armored trains, river gunboats, and arms stockpiles.&#10;&#10;The design has been trimmed to focus on two key campaigns. *Fall of the Directory* shows the three-sided conflict at the end of 1918 and the first few months of 1919, where the Bolsheviks overthrew the Directory. *Revolt Against the Volunteer Army* shows the decisive campaigns in the last few months of 1919 and the beginning of 1920. *The Road to Freedom?* and *The Bolshevik Advance* present shorter parts of *Revolt.* *The Road to Freedom?* shows the Makhnovist campaign toward their home ground and into the Volunteer Army's rear areas, and the renewed uprising. *The Bolshevik Advance* shows the Volunteer Army retreating onto the map, and the Red Army chasing after them, with all sides scrambling to control key areas.&#10;&#10;These scenarios represent campaigns which could have changed the course of the Ukrainian Civil War. In *Fall of the Directory,* the Directory could have defeated the Bolsheviks and quite possibly have retained independence. In *Revolt Against the Volunteer Army,* the Makhnovists could have won a stronger position and quite possibly have gained autonomy.&#10;&#10;Note: The early drafts used larger hexes, larger units, and a smaller map than the current design. The design notes sometimes refer to &quot;Revolt Against the Volunteer Army&quot; as &quot;Makhno's Return.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "One of many local variations on the boardgame Monopoly, Sonopoly is based on Sonoma County, California.  Produced by Santa Rosa-based Trinity Productions in 1985, it was assembled by Rapid Mounting and Finishing Co. of Burlingame, California.&#10;&#10;The mechanics, most rules, board, and themes are mostly the same as Monopoly, but there are some significant differences.&#10;&#10;Board and Properties: The properties are all businesses in Sonoma County; there are no railroads or utilities; there are no jail, free-parking, or go-to-jail spaces; there are chance cards, but no community chest or equivalent; all four corners are properties which players can buy and on which they must pay rent; the purchase prices and rent are all different.&#10;&#10;Rules: There are coloured monopolies essentially the same as in Monopoly, but in addition, the four corners together make up one monopoly just like properties of one colour.  Players build &quot;investments&quot; instead of houses and can build up to 2 on each property.  The few non-coloured properties not at the corners are stand-alone properties on which one can build an investment without owning any other properties.  Finally, players collect $2,000 not for passing &quot;go&quot; but for passing the West America Bank space (at the location of the go-to-jail space in Monopoly).&#10;&#10;Pieces:  Money is in demoninations of $20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000.  Each amount has a different business and picture on it.  The player pieces are coloured plastic pawns. The investment pieces are not houses and hotels, but coloured wooden cylinders called &quot;barrels&quot; in the rules.&#10;&#10;",

Gear Shift has a unique and in many ways quite realistic take on F1 racing, where the movements are generally dictated not by dice, but by on-track position.&#10;&#10;So - unusually for a car-racing board game - this is very much a strategy game, with the element of chance coming in the form of hazard squares which require a roll from the 36-item hazard list on the inside of the box lid.&#10;&#10;Only one track comes with the game - Brands Hatch - but the rule book claims that Actiongable were going to make further tracks available. One can only assume that disappointing sales scuppered those plans.&#10;&#10;A hidden gem of the genre.&#10;&#10;",

A player can not move into or pass a square where another player is on.&#10;When a player lands on either a point-field (white circle with red numbers) the player takes the point on the board, if it have not been taken before. If a player lands on one of the red fields on each continent, the player can take the matching number from the pool if (s)he do not have this number yet. The red &quot;proof tokens&quot; are put infront of the player, visible for everone.&#10;Each time you pass Equator you get 10 points from the pool, as long as there are still points left to take.&#10;&#10;When you have at least fice (5) of the six (6) &quot;proof tokens&quot;, you can move back to the &quot;S&quot; , and this will give you 100 points.&#10;Second one back to base get's 50, third gets 25 and the last don't get any points for returnin. When everyone is back you add the points (Home-coming, red tokens (75 points each) and blue tokens (10-50 points each). The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "POD stands for &quot;Power Of Direction.&quot;&#10;&#10;A chess-like game, in that there are pieces with different movement rules moving around a square-grid board.  Each player has a &quot;king&quot; (the Communication and Command Pod, or C.C.P.) that must be captured for the opponent to win.  The board is 15-by-15 squares, divided into 9 5x5 sections.  And there is a repeating pattern of walls that restrict movement.  The basic movement mechanic is that each piece (individually called &quot;Pods&quot;) moves a given number of segments, called &quot;Direction Changes&quot; or D.C.'s.  For example, a piece with 3 D.C.'s could move forward as many spaces as it wants (subject to walls of course), then left as many spaces as it wants, and then forward again.  Pods must move their entire number of D.C.'s without backtracking.&#10;&#10;In addition to the basic movement mechanic of D.C.'s, many of the pieces  have additional movement abilities, such as the Jump Pod (J.P.) that can jump over one piece during its movement, or the Variable Direction Change Pod (V.D.C.P.) which has a choice as to how many D.C.'s it may make when it moves.&#10;&#10;There is a basic game (nine pods), and an advanced version which adds four more pods.  They give an even more advanced version (which they call &quot;POD Pinnacle&quot;) in which the nine board parts are set up in a non-standard way.  You can also combine two sets together for a four-player game (assuming the pieces are of four different colors), and presumably, you could combine even more sets together for as many players as you want, as long as you have some means of distinguishing each player's pieces from the others.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slahal (pronounced sle -`hal) is an indigenous very old, Pacific Coast Indian Gambling Game. The game is also called the &quot;bone game&quot;, &quot;stick game&quot; or &quot;hand game&quot; and is still played today by many in the Northwest. It is played, either as a two player game or as a team game. It originally used small pieces of animal bone as game pieces but now many kinds of substances have replaced those bones. Pieces of antler having both a rounded side and a flat side were used while a grouping of separate sticks serve as the score keeping method. Each team begins with a set number of scoring sticks. The two game pieces (acting almost like dice) are picked up by a player and secretly arranged on a flat surface. This is done to the accompaniment of Native Music. The object of the game is to correctly guess where certain game bones are located in the opponents hand. During the playing of the music the pieces are arranged in different patterns, either both flat pieces down, both round pieces down or 1 going each way so that there are 4 possible combinations that can be accomplished. The opponent or the leader of the opposing team will motion to the other leader that they are ready to guess the direction of the unmarked bones. He uses a set of hand signals to make his guess. Each time he guesses incorrectly, he must throw one of his score keeping sticks to the opposing team. The team that eventually wins all of the opponents score keeping sticks wins the match&#10;&#10;Nothing in this description was intentionally taken from the Elliott Avedon Museum &amp; Archive of Games, a public funded Museum in Canada who would not give permission for the Museum's description of the game to be used. This compilation is taken from numerous other sources found.&#10;&#10;This game was re-created by Bill Kuhnely in 1981.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game uses 24 checkers with 12 in each color and a checker board or a 6 by 6 grid as the game only uses the middle 36 squares of a typical 8 by 8 checker board.  Each player places his checkers in the back row of his side of the board.  The game turns alternate between the two players.  The number of checkers in a stack determines the distance that a stack may move.  Moves can be made in any of the eight corresponding directions and cannot be blocked by stacks situated in the path of the move.  All moves are done in a straight line unless the move would extend through 6 by 6 grid formation, in which case the move is reflected by the edge of the 6 by 6 grid like a mirror.  A stack belongs to the player whose piece is on top.  It might be noted that the arrangement and order of the pieces within a stack can never be altered except by continued stacking.  Captured stacks always remain on the board and become part of the stack must be included in the count for the new movement distance.  A player may use his turn to place a stack on top of another one of his own stacks.  During a turn a player has the option of moving one of his stacks or only its top portion which may include any number of pieces and may leave behind a stack also composed of any number of pieces.  The height of the new divided stack determines the new movement distance.&#10;&#10;In 2005, the &quot;Too-Tall Rule&quot; or variant was introduced.  This rule states that at the beginning of a turn that any player's stacks taller than four pieces must be divided.  Failure to comply with this rule causes a player to lose a turn.&#10;&#10;The game can be classified as a variant of Sid Sackson's Focus.&#10;&#10;http://www.stevecobb.com/Death%20Stacks%20--%20game%20instructions.htm&#10;&#10;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Stacks&#10;&#10;",

This game reconfigured a map of Europe to provide a game rather than a reference.  It's a straightforward track game.  The game uses a teetotum, a spinning top with numbered sides, as dice were viewed as gambling instruments that would not be permitted in respectable households.  The players begin and end in London, and many spaces advance players or transport them to other portions of the board.  For example, a playing piece that lands on Hanover &quot;shall by order of Ye King of Great Britain who is Elector, be conducted to ... Gibraltar to visit his countrymen who keep garrison there&quot; while the playing piece that lands on &quot;Rome for kissing ye Pope's Toe shall be banished for his folly to ... the cold island of Iceland and miss three turns&quot;.&#10;&#10;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/42/13&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is based around placing symbol cards so that either their colour or shape match their neighbours. The game area is restricted to an 8 by 8 card limit.&#10;&#10;Symbotica can be played in four different ways: the Standard Game, the Simple Game, Five Card Symbotica and the one player Symbotica Challenge.&#10;&#10;The aim of the Standard, Simple and Five Card Symbotica games is to score the maximum number of points. Points are scored based on the placing of the cards. In order to cater for different age groups, the scoring is either based on addition or multiplication.&#10;&#10;The one player Symbotica Challenge consists of trying to get as close as possible to the full grid of 64 cards using the same placement rules as the other games but without any scoring.&#10;&#10;The game appeals to a wide range of ages from children learning simple pattern matching, addition or multiplication right up to those adults who want to keep their mind fit.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.symbotica.com/&#10;&#10;",

The game has all the familiar cartoon characters.  When a playing piece stops on a space, the player draws a card.  If the card matches the character on the space, the player keeps the card.  If the playing piece lands on one of the bright yellow Underdog spaces, the player takes a card from each player.  The game comes with a gameboard, four wooden playing pieces, die, and 24 cards.&#10;&#10;",

Where the die lands determines the extra scoring.
