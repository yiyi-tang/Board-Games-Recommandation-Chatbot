The active player rolls the dice and has to combine all 5 dice using the basic arithmetic methods (addition / subtraction / multiplication / division) to reach a number that has not been calculated by any other player before. He then can mark this number (e.g. circle, cross out, box ). The player can, but does not have to, use all types of calculations methods. He can e.g. use only addition or e.g. once addition, once subtraction and twice multiplication. He can use brackets to work with the dot-before-dash calculation. Only whole numbers are allowed in the calculation process.&#10;&#10;End of game:&#10;&#10;The players play alternately. The game ends as soon as the numbers in 3 rows or columns (or a combination thereof) are circled.&#10;&#10;Valuation:&#10;&#10;The rows and the columns then are evaluated one after the other:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever has the majority in a row receives  5 points&#10;     Whoever has the majority in a row where the numbers are completely circled/marked receives 10 points&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     If several players have circled the same amount of numbers, nobody gets points&#10;&#10;&#10;The backside shows the game Kn&uuml;ller, which also can be played.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "heXentafl is an asymmetric abstract strategy game that is sort of the hexagonal version of Hnefatafl. One side (white) plays the attackers, and one side (black) plays the defenders.&#10;&#10;heXentafl can be played on a 4x4 or 5x5 hex grid.&#10;&#10;The King sits on the central space, the throne, surrounded by three defenders. Six attackers sit on the outer corners of the grid.&#10;&#10;The attackers must capture the King in order to win. The defenders must escort the King to any of the six corners of the board in order to win. The defenders usually move first, but either works.&#10;&#10;It is recommended that players play in sets of two games, alternating who is the attacker and who is the defender.&#10;&#10;All pieces except the King move in a straight line, as many spaces as they like to an unoccupied space (like a rook in Chess). Only one piece at a time can occupy a space. A piece cannot jump over another piece.&#10;&#10;The King can move into any vacant adjacent space, moving one space at a time (similar to the king in Chess).&#10;Pieces are captured by surrounding them on two sides.  In the image shown, white moves into position to surround the King and capture it, winning the game.&#10;&#10;The corners present an interesting challenge, as they can't be surrounded in the normal manner. Pieces can be captured on a corner by surrounding them in the manner shown.&#10;&#10;You cannot &quot;capture&quot; your own piece by moving between two enemy pieces.&#10;&#10;The Throne&#10;&#10;The central space of the board is the throne.  Only the King may occupy the throne.  When the King is on the throne, he is harder to capture.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Strange lights burning within. One final effort and then no more. One final no more.&#10;&#10;Tower of Silence is a dark and brutal game of abandoned hope and apocalyptic prophecy. Players take on the roles of shipwrecked souls washing ashore at the base of a mountainous tower slowly crumbling away into the icy seas. Drawn like moths to the flame that burns high above, they begin a long and harrowing climb which will either see them lost in the shadows of death or transformed in the fires of prophecy.&#10;&#10;Each turn players take control of a new soul (up to a maximum of three souls per player) and roll their starting hope and location. As souls crawl about and make various efforts, their hope dwindles, and once it is all gone, they become shadows of death further draining the hope of those who follow after them. If a soul manages to reach the top of the tower, the player controlling it burns the corresponding standee in a black candle and draws a prophetic uttering. Once all souls have either abandoned hope or been consigned to the flames, the utterings are lined up to produce a unique prophecy for that game only.&#10;&#10;Tower of Silence is the first installment in the Trilogy of Lost Hope which continues with Iron Mountain and Pesta. It comes with a dedicated soundtrack (Stilhedens T&aring;rn) recorded and released by dungeon synth artist Offermose. Players are encouraged to listen to the album as they play. A streaming link is provided in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It is volume 2 in the Trial Series by Green Feet Games (previous Volume includes Unforgiven: The Lincoln Assassination Trial).&#10;&#10;America was built by people like Mitchell who questioned the status quo and believed that there was always a better way...that would fundamentally change how a nation secures its interests and projects military power.&#10;   &#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player in turn rolls the die and moves the pawn accordingly.&#10;&#10;The other component in the game is a diamond. When a player causes the pawn to land on a green space they take the diamond. When a player causes the pawn to land on a red space the diamond is placed back on the board.&#10;&#10;The player possessing the diamond at the moment when the die roll would enable the pawn to escape the maze wins.&#10;&#10;",

Landing on an opposing piece sends it back to the start.&#10;&#10;When a piece lands on a symbol which is covered by a piece on a different space, this forms a &quot;pair&quot; and entitled the moving piece to move inwards to the next circle.

Of both players agree to exchange they each discard some cards and draw replacements.

Warriors are different, and some of them possess unique powers to form combos during the war! And the artifacts are gifts from the gods with fierce powers. As players, you also have the chance to buy new artifacts during gameplay. Your aim is to win the battle and earn more resources as tributes paid from other players. The player with the most VPs &mdash; a sum of tributes collected and warrior power rank &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;Village War: The Calamity is the first of a five-game series that exposes the Igbo culture more than any other game in history. The game story (12 pages) narrates the inspirations behind the artwork and the story, and the game features masquerades, Priest(ess), and other creatures with Igbo origin in mind. The pulisher also had a live studio record for the game to create the right melody creating a 65-minutes &quot;Igbo War music&quot; instrumental for that extra experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

And then it is important to stage the enemy images with the right media campaign in such a way that the anger of your own target group begins to boil. And that's about it. Isn't it nice when card games can be explained so easily?&#10;&#10;As enemy images there are the bad Russians, the classic terrorists, the scruffy social parasite, the greedy pharmaceutical industry and the corrupt European politician. And of course many more. The target groups are the conservatives, the left and the right and of course the totally confused aluminum hat wearers. And as campaigns there is the regulars' table, the focus on television and the daily press. And of course the satirical portals themselves. That closes the circle.&#10;&#10;As is usual with card games, you have to spend money on &quot;Feindbild&quot; in order to play it. Yes, we live in evil capitalism. Another enemy image. The game consists of 106 cards, which consist of 18 enemy images, 8 target groups and 80 campaigns. And there are also instructions for use.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sydney, Australia in the 1920s is a hotbed of crime and vice. The inner city suburbs of Darlinghurst and Surrey Hills are a battleground between warring gangs led by prostitute Tilly Devine and sly grog queen Kate Leigh. And in the middle of it all is you, a detective for the New South Wales Police, just trying to solve the crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice.&#10;&#10;Razorhurst is a story-driven detective game similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. You will interview suspects, follow leads, and use your abilities for observation, persuasion and force. Razorhurst introduces a unique clock mechanic for affecting the player's abilities. But the main difference with other detective games is that in Razorhurst everything is real. You will be investigating actual crimes, tracking down historical evidence, and bringing actual killers to justice. Based on exhaustive research, Razorhurst allows the player to step back in time to one of the most heady and deadly places in history.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Ambush seeks to provide the perfect blend of thrilling action and intense strategy in a game where the tide of battle can be turned in the blink of an eye! Take control of your personal castle and craft the perfect army of goblins, wizards, and knights to attack your opponents and defend your own walls from harm. The goal of the game is to be the last castle standing at the end of the hectic free-for-all.&#10;&#10;To do this, players will need to plan and strategize for the Ambush phase, where any card played in the game so far is up for grabs in a mad scramble that has a chance to be triggered at the start of every player&rsquo;s turn. Having the speed and reflexes to grab the best cards first, as well as remembering where the best cards are on the field will be critical in obtaining the upper hand over other players.&#10;&#10;Ambush was created as a project for a USC Games class in the fall of 2019 by Michael Ford, Brendan Tighe, Masato Lin, and Tongwei Dai. The team saw some incredible potential in the game, and in the Spring of 2020,a portion of the group reformed and set out to publish and sell the game with the help of USC faculty and developers from other board game start-ups.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

While exploring a nearby dungeon, you found a horde of monsters planning something big for your nearby village. You were attacked and fell off a ledge in to the void. Left for dead by the monsters, you now have to make your way out of the dungeon and back to your village. You have no ideas where you are or how to get out but you have to escape and your are running out of time. Each corridor you take could lead you closer to the exit or directly into a dead end. Keep running and if you hit a dead end turn around and continue running. You can't stop and you must escape.  Each turn presents new dangers and possible treasures.  If you can survive long enough to make it through four stairs up you escape the dungeon alive.    Take too long or hit too many dead ends and you may never make it out alive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player has 16 Discs that are arranged on their second and third rows, respectively.&#10;&#10;A Disc moves by taking a single step in any direction to an empty space. A Disc may also hop over a single, friendly piece to the empty space just beyond. But it may not hop over an enemy piece.&#10;&#10;A Disc captures enemy pieces by withdrawal. This means if a Disc begins its turn with an enemy Disc adjacent, it may take a single step backwards, in the opposite direction, to the empty space just behind it. The enemy Disc is then removed from the board.&#10;&#10;For its first turn, White makes one move, followed by Blue making two moves; White then makes three moves, and so on &ndash; creating a &ldquo;Snowball Effect&rdquo; of moves.&#10;&#10;The player who eliminates all of his opponent&rsquo;s pieces wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

A team based party game where players must describe the characters without using any of the words on the card. Followed by rounds using a single word description, and then acting&#10;Game 3: Throwdown. A race to get rid of your cards, by matching one of the categories on your card to one of the piles on the table. Getting a double category match freezes your competitors in place for 5 seconds whilst you continue to play.  &#10;Game 4: Ransack.

Get ready for the buzz of your life!&#10;&#10;In HoneyScouts, you place hex tiles to match colors (essentially building the hive), and every time you match a color, you draft a card that gives the location of a flower, with the number indicating the distance between you (the bee) and the flower. When you match colors on the hive to create a complete hexagon of one color, you attract a bee to your swarm.&#10;&#10;Why do the numbers on the cards matter? Because the game contains a trick-taking mechanism in which you can win bee battles and attract all the bees from an opponent, poaching them to your side. Special tiles and event cards can throw you off balance or be used to your advantage.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who attracts the most bees wins.&#10;&#10;",

Roach Party was sold in head shops when they began popping up in the 80&rsquo;s. It had great success, sold thousands of copies and was even featured in High Times Magazine. All was good until feds started raiding the shops and merchandise was seized, thus resulting in the disappearance of this really awesome stoner game.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to accumulate a COMPLETE STASH. This is done by collecting all four of the ROACH CARDS. These include the BAGGIE, PAPERS, FIRE, and SUPPLIER cards.&#10;Lastly you must acquire the funds to pay your supplier. Once you have all four cards and the funds required pay your supplier, you are the winner of Roach Party.&#10;&#10;",

Only by slowing down, noticing our minds have distracted us and letting go can we truly experience life in its purest form.&#10;&#10;Nevermind The Distraction is a short, fast-paced, yet surprisingly relaxing abstract solitaire card game inspired by the principles of mindfulness and beginning meditation. Take on the role of The Watcher and engage your own mind in a contest of wills to determine the ultimate fate of your wandering thoughts. Breathe, and try not to get too distracted!&#10;&#10;Setup begins by preparing the meditating consciousness using small decks called Distraction Packs. These themed packs contain beautiful and evocative imagery depicting various occurring thoughts. Three packs are combined each game based on your mood, thoughts, or plans for the day, creating a unique visual tableau every session.&#10;&#10;Each round starts with the Mind revealing a new thought - or intensifying an existing one - ultimately trying to turn them into Distractions. Distractions cause time to pass more quickly, and when the Timer deck is empty, the mediation is over!  The Mind&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to waste time keeping us distracted as long as possible.&#10;&#10;During the Watcher phase, players choose one of these thoughts and take an action to calm or quiet it, pulling it one step back from becoming a Distraction. Do this enough times and a thought is eventually Let Go, releasing it completely and blocking the Mind&rsquo;s ability to manipulate it. The player&rsquo;s goal is to Let Go of as many thoughts as possible before the Timer deck runs out.&#10;&#10;What follows is an engaging, fast-paced yet relaxing 8-way Tug of War that, when combined with the beautiful minimalist aesthetic, create the perfect conditions for the player to enter a flow state, not unlike that of meditation.&#10;&#10;Regular practice will eventually result in a perfect score. These &ldquo;Zen Master&rdquo; wins unlock additional levels of game play and introduce new challenges, mechanics and strategies letting the game grow with you.&#10;&#10;The short play time, small box and limited table space needed make this an excellent addition to any daily self-care routine regardless of whether or not you practice meditation!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game is usually full of good (and bad ) emotions, as two main key aspects are timing and, as the name suggests, bluffing.&#10;&#10;Each round, players fight each other for one of the many different magical treasures. During one's turn, the player has two choices: either play a card with a symbol of the treasure of the round, or skip the turn, waiting for better opportunities, or simply missing the necessary card to play. Players take turns clockwise, deciding on the best strategy to win the treasure. Once a player holds a treasure for an entire turn, he gets to take it back to his ship and gains its special effect. The game is over, once a player collects 4 different treasures.&#10;&#10;The best part of the game is when you feel like a mastermind, like you've outsmarted all of your friends.  While everyone was fighting for the treasure, you were waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Just when one of your friends was about to take the treasure back to his ship, you laugh at his face and curb his expectations, by taking the treasure into your own hands. You feel ecstatic, you are about to win the game. And just at the moment when you think that you had it in the bag... One of your friends starts laughing at your face and you very well know, what's about to come.&#10;&#10;",

The game series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III, when the Warsaw Pact armies storm across the border of East Germany in a powerful attempt to seize West Germany and the whole of Free Europe.&#10;&#10;Covering even more battles on the North German Plain as well as parts of southern West Germany, We Shall Hold includes playing pieces for NATO nationalities forward-deployed toward the border between East and West Germany, or in the second line in southern Germany. NATO units are included representing the Belgian, Dutch, Canadian, and West German armies. Opposing them are units of two of the nations of the Warsaw PACT: the East Germans and the Soviet juggernaut, both deploying vast numbers of tanks and infantry in an attempt to overwhelm NATO&rsquo;s lines.&#10;Fight hypothetical battles using the stalwart Leopard-C1s and Scimitars of the 4th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. Deploy and maneuver Leopard-1s, Scimitars, and Milan-2 armed Jeeps of the Belgian Army. Fiercely defend against hordes of Warsaw PACT armor on the North German Plain using the deadly Leopard-2s of the Dutch Army. Assault the line with long-ranged East Germans T-72 tanks, supported by BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, armed with deadly Spandrel anti-tank guided missiles. Mass your Soviet attacking forces for a breakthrough using T-80 main battle tanks, more BMP-2s, Engineers for assault, and self-propelled 120mm mortars.&#10;&#10;The World At War 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units. Die rolls are compared and hits are applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, random formation activation and turn length; direct, indirect, opportunity and anti-aircraft fire; fire and movement, assault, and close air support; all are integrated into a fast, easy to play system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game can be played by 2-5 people (depending on the map used). Finishing it requires playing through a certain number of rounds (also determined by the map used), during which we gain Victory Points. The player with the most Victory Points at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s mechanics revolve around the &lsquo;pick up and deliver&rsquo; core - you plan your movement across the hexagonal map board, determine the cargo you want to pick up (originating from both private and public sector), and deliver it to the chosen city or port. The more you deliver, the more you can pick up for future transports. By buying the &lsquo;port stock tiles&rsquo; you increase your chance of gaining more Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Apart from the map boards (each depicting the real country with the original names on it, but  adapted to the game&rsquo;s mechanics), the game also features: &#10;- the game board (used for determining the players&rsquo; actions, monitoring the opponent&rsquo;s development, and upgrading our train), &#10;- the player&rsquo;s board (used for monitoring player's progress and the improvements made to the train). &#10;The train&rsquo;s upgrades are divided into 4 categories (engine, hopper wagon, additional wagons, and hiring a specialist), with each upgrade creating new opportunities for the player. Pair it up with the special cards, allowing you to break some of the rules, and you can be sure that each playthrough will differ and require the players to change their tactics and stay vigilant for the opponents&rsquo; moves.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hike the famous 46 peaks of the Adirondack Mountains in this fast, unique flip-and-write.&#10;&#10;On your turn, choose a shape to add to your path as you move from a randomly-selected entry point to an exit, the same as everyone else. Your turns are simultaneous, but each shape is randomly paired with another activity- birdwatching, foraging, and more. Move past and around mountains to hike them, and gather up symbols as you combo your way to success. Show off your hiking gear through special challenges and explore specific mountains as you achieve personal goals. Along the way, use your extra water to power through extra stretches and modify your turns. The game ends on the 10th, 11th, or 12th turn, depending on if someone exits the park first. Oh, and be sure to check out Mt. Marcy for bonus points! Unique set-ups make each play different as you race to solve this pathing puzzle.&#10;&#10;46 is a free-to-play printable game designed during the COVID-19 crisis, and will remain available here and through the publisher's website forever, with continued support.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Necrons are a deathless race of alien androids, rulers of the galaxy in a long-forgotten era. Now, having slumbered in stasis for millennia, they are rising up to conquer it again. Clad in self-repairing bodies of living metal and wielding weapons that harness the most devastating energies of the cosmos, the Necrons are a terrifying enemy. Fearless, relentless, and utterly without mercy, they advance in serried ranks and lay down withering storms of fire fit to annihilate even the mightiest of foes. The hyper-resilient Necron soldiery are supported by murderous specialist units, techno-sorcerous war machines, mindless Canoptek constructs, and shards of shattered star gods. They are led to war by undying nobles wielding weapons of devastating power, driven by the absolute conviction that they are the rightful rulers of the stars. And if the long sleep has reduced many Necrons to mindless monsters, or ravaged their sanity and transformed them into murderous demigods? Such madness only makes them an even greater and more terrible threat.&#10;&#10;Codex: Necrons is your essential guide to one of the 41st Millennium's greatest threats &ndash; a millennia-old alliance of ancient androids who long ago sacrificed their very essence for greater power. In this book, you'll discover the history of the Necrons, from the very earliest days of the universe, to the War in Heaven, and their awakening, all illustrated with stunning art. Once you've read the lore, you can build your army using a vast suite of rules that bring the Necrons to life, with rules for the dynasties (including ones of your own creation!), datasheets, Stratagems, and much, much more.&#10;&#10;This 120-page hardback book contains:&#10;&#10;     The history of the Necrons &ndash; from their ancient origins to the Era Indomitus&#10;     Stunning art that brings the lore to life&#10;     A showcase of incredibly painted miniatures to inspire your own collection and colour schemes&#10;     Crusade rules that let you develop your Necron army in thrilling narrative campaigns&#10;     Special abilities and bonuses like Command Protocols for your Necron forces&#10;     Datasheets for Necrons units for your reference&#10;     Stratagems, Powers of the C'tan, and more!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It can be described simply as a cross between Scrabble and Dominoes but with words.&#10;&#10;The game contains 140 cards with 560 English words. Each card has four family-friendly words (one per edge) and a point value between 1 and 5. 1-point cards have words with the most connections (some with over 30), while 5-point cards have words with fewer connections. But don't worry, as well over 12,000 connections are known to be available!&#10;&#10;There are a half a dozen ways to play the game.&#10;&#10;Players compete to get the highest score by connecting related words. For example, TEACHER can be connected with STUDENT, SCHOOL, RESPECT, LEARNING, JOB as well as a dozen other words.&#10;&#10;Hilarious dialog begins when someone attempts a dubious connection and has to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; it to the group. This makes it a game about connecting people.&#10;&#10;Other ways to play include Match, Memory, Grid, Airplane Mode, Secret Connections and Team Secrets.&#10;&#10;This family and party game is for use at home and school as well as corporate office team building.&#10;&#10;SideLinks is the next version of the Connections card game, renamed for worldwide distribution as we only had the Canadian trademark for &quot;Connections&quot;. It's a new standalone game with more cards, larger cards, some new rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
