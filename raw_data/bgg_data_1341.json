About half the cards cover history, including Leif Ericsson, Columbus, the Mayflower, Declaration of Independence, first railroads, etc.  The rest of the cards cover the geographic range of America: the cities Washington D. C., Chicago and New York; the Statue of Liberty, steamboats, Niagara Falls, cotton plantations, wheat fields, orange groves, farms, cattle ranches, etc. It also includes an American Flag wild card, and a rules card. The cards are bridge size, measuring 88mm x 57mm.&#10;&#10;It has rules for two games. &quot;America&quot; plays like Gin Rummy, with players drawing and discarding until someone goes out by playing a 7-letter word. At that point, everyone scores a word from their hand with bonus points for longer words, and for names of American cities or states. The largest point total is awarded if the 7-letter word is &quot;America&quot;. &quot;Alphabet Rhummy&quot; plays like normal rummy, letting you play words to the table once you have them, as well as add letters to existing words to make new words. The first player out of cards gets one point per card in everyone else's hands.&#10;&#10;",

Dice can be used to acquire cards from a common market to your hand or to generate resources in three different types (gold, influence, and magic). Resources and dice together can be used to play cards from your hand into your tableau, or to build a legendary card. Resources can be used on their own to refresh the market or be converted into the other resource types. And cards in your tableau can be used to generate special effects. Use a combination of luck and strategy to build an engine that will push you ahead of the other players in the game in order to bring the most renown to yourself and the kingdom.&#10;&#10;Cards are Chimera size (58x90mm).&#10;&#10;",

Once during their turn, players may pay the cost shown on a Station to take the corresponding Wagon.&#10;&#10;There are two kinds of Railcars: blue-bordered Railcards stay in play until discarded, and take effect immediately; while green-bordered Railcars stay in play but have no effect until the owner decides to discard them during their turn.

As soon as the first Railcar behind the Locomotive goes past the last Station, the Locomotive card&rsquo;s special effect triggers for all players.

Whether it involves matching colours and collecting birds or putting down bird cards on ones that have already been set out &ndash; both game variants promise loads of fun and develop children&rsquo;s matching abilities.&#10;&#10;Game 1: Feeding the birds &#10; At the moment the birds can&rsquo;t find anything to eat around them and need help from humans. Attract the  birds with food so that they don&rsquo;t have to go hungry. The 25 bird cards are shuffled and then spread out on  the table face down. Three arbitrary cards are left face up so they are visible to all players, and the dice are &#10;placed nearby.&#10; The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. He then chooses one of the 3 face-up cards and tries to attract the selected bird by rolling the matching colours. The player has a total of 3 attempts, and can set aside any matching dice with each attempt &ndash; and continue to roll the dice/die the remaining times. The picture of a birdhouse functions as a joker and can stand for any colour. The X on the die is a &bdquo;Lame Duck&ldquo;, and can&rsquo;t be placed anywhere. If the player manages to cover all colours after rolling the dice (a maximum of) three times, he can keep the card &ndash; otherwise, he has to put the card back. It is then the next player&rsquo;s turn. If the previous player was able to collect a bird, then a new card is turned face up, so that there are 3 cards face up again. The object of the game is to attract 3 of the same kind of bird.&#10;The game ends when one player has attracted 3 of the same birds. That player wins the round. If none of the players succeeds, the one who has collected the most birds wins.&#10;&#10;Game 2: Bird dominoes&#10;&#10;Can you link all of the birds onto the long chain of birds? Try to be the first player to attach all of your birds to the long row of birds. The 25 bird cards are shuffled thoroughly and spread out face down on the table &ndash; one card in the middle is turned face up, and one die is placed nearby. Then each player is given 4 bird cards to start with.&#10;&#10;The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. He rolls with one die, and there are the following possibilities:&#10;&#10;     Rolls a colour: The colour that is rolled matches a &ldquo;free colour point&rdquo; on the card in the middle and one of the bird cards that the active player has shows the same colour &ndash; very good, the bird  card can be placed&#10;     Rolls a colour: The colour that is rolled is not a &ldquo;free colour point&rdquo; or the active player doesn&rsquo;t have a bird card that shows the colour &ndash; too bad, it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn&#10;     Rolls a &ldquo;Lame Duck&rdquo;: The active player draws a &ldquo;penalty card&rdquo;&#10;     Rolls a joker: The active player can place an arbitrary card on a free and matching colour point&#10;&#10;&#10;The player who is first to place all of his bird cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A story driven adventure game for 1 to 4 players set in fantasy Britain some 20 years after the death of King Arthur Pendragon.&#10;&#10;Each separate game session, or &ldquo;quest&rdquo; as it is called in the game, takes about 1 hour to play. Each quest can be won, lost, or even forfeited. The game is over when you have played through all quests listed in a separate questbook.&#10;&#10;Each one of the players controls a &ldquo;hero&rdquo;. There are four heroes to the so called &ldquo;party&rdquo;. The players win the game if they manage to complete the goals of all the quests of the game.&#10;&#10;The players will take turns reading aloud from the questbook. At regular intervals the players are allowed to make decisions on where to go and what to do. This affects the outcome of the game session. Whenever a fight occurs, it is played out on a game board made of separate modular tiles. The combat system is quick and focused on tactics and using the hero&rsquo;s abilities to survive.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game the players will be able to improve their heroes abilities, and also her equipment and retinue.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Mega Box includes the original The Quacks of Quedlinburg, The Herb Witches expansion and The Alchemists expansion, all in one box!&#10;&#10;In The Quacks of Quedlinburg, players are charlatans &mdash; or quack doctors &mdash; each making their own secret brew by adding ingredients one at a time. Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!&#10;&#10;Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips and add them to their pot. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the swirling pattern, increasing how much your potion is worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot explodes!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients to add to their bags, depending on the strength of the ingredients in their pots. But players with exploded pots must choose points or coins &mdash; not both! The player with the most victory points at the end of nine rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Included in this box are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: the base game&#10;     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Herb Witches: the first expansion, adding Witches that grant powers once per game as well as more ingredient books.&#10;     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Alchemists: the second expansion introduces nightmares, obsession, hysteria and a new laboratory player board.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the early 19th century. The Industrial Revolution is underway, and the demand for cotton is soaring. As a British entrepreneur, you see an opportunity to profit from this booming market. You will send your ships all over the world in search of the best prices for cotton. Will you keep up with the expanding market and become the most successful merchant?&#10;&#10;The game is played over 9 rounds in 3 stages. At the start of each round, players compare the wealth of their companies to determine turn order. Then, they rent ships, send ships to regions where cotton is harvested, buy cotton, and return to the United Kingdom to sell cotton at a profit. At the end of each round, players pay a ship maintenance cost and clear the board for the next round. Players can also benefit from transporting passengers and exporting small amounts of goods from the United Kingdom.&#10;&#10;The game uses a deck of 24 ship cards with different properties, including maximum capacity. Cotton can be purchased from contract cards of different quantities and prices in four historical regions where cotton was harvested. Droughts and local wars can interrupt players' plans and, along with the order of cards being drawn from the decks, are the main random factor of the game.&#10;&#10;Ships are rented when only limited information about cotton harvests is available, adding to the difficulty of managing trading companies. Players can sell shares of their company to obtain additional funding, but they are required to repurchase all of their assets at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There are no victory points in this game. The player who owns the wealthiest company at the end wins.&#10;&#10;Relative cotton prices and amounts of cotton harvested in different regions were based on real-world economic data. In order to simulate the exponential growth of the market, the game rescales itself between stages. This allows players to keep up with the cotton boom without having to handle large amounts of coins and tokens.&#10;&#10;Advanced game rules introduce the possibility of buying other players' shares, among other options. This way, players can invest in and profit from their competitors' success.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There are many secrets hidden in this big old city. But the main one is vampires. A hundred years ago there were so many of them here, and they behaved so openly and brazenly that people declared a hunt for them. The angry crowd caught all the bloodsuckers and buried them with aspen stakes in their chests. And this was forgotten for many years. But a small group of vampires managed to escape. For a hundred years they wandered around the world, and it's time to return to their hometown to resurrect their deceased relatives.&#10;&#10;In the game Family Affairs, players will take on the role of the heads of vampire families. Their task is to resurrect as many of their blood-sucking relatives as possible in six nights. To do this, you need to find as many tombstones as possible. Then dig up the bodies and give the poor fellows fresh blood to drink.&#10;Capturing cemeteries will help your family complete the mission faster, but you should be wary of fanatical Vampire Hunters.&#10;&#10;Family Affairs is a roll and write game. In it, you will take on the role of vampire families who are looking for their long-dead relatives. There are eight vampire families to choose from in the game, each of which gives you a unique gaming experience. The main task of the game is to paint over as many graves with vampires as possible, resurrecting them. To do this, you will need to find the tombstones first.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: throw dice and try to throw &quot;6&quot; on them - i.e. resurrect a vampire and not throw &quot;1&quot; - i.e. stumble upon a Vampire Hunter.&#10;&#10;Each turn you will capture a new cemetery. Each captured cemetery will give you new opportunities for the rest of the game. For example, to throw more dice or resurrect vampires not only by &quot;6&quot;, but also by &quot;5&quot;. The head of the vampire family must skillfully decide which cemetery to capture first and which to leave for later. The opportunity to make Sorties brings more excitement. You can double all the resurrected vampires, but at the same time reduce the number of Vampire Hunters from whom your family can hide.&#10;&#10;You have only six moves to assemble a well-functioning game engine and win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Individual units represented are the battalion and regiment and players can do sub-unit actions such as company and squadron actions.&#10;&#10;The complexity of the game is moderate, and would appeal to a player who enjoys small unit tactics and a wide latitude of unit options (within historical parameters) on the table.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Russian Front witnessed the biggest tank battles in history.  But for the crews of those vehicles, within each moment, each split second, there was only ever one target in their sights, or the one muzzle that remained unaccounted for. Commander, loader, driver&hellip;they served in a cramped world, where the events of four bloody years became nothing but an endless succession of fights for a bridge, a village, or a way out. This is Panzerkampf.&#10;&#10;Panzerkampf pitches you into the fight via a short set of rules that have colour and detail where it matters.  Your ace crew, veterans of many such engagements, may conquer all, live to fight another day, or be killed outright by that next unseen muzzle flash. Protection, hitting power, speed, and crew experience are fundamental to the game.  But no one survives without luck, representative of which are a number of random events that can help sway the balance one way or another.  Engines stall; turrets jam; and from out of the sky come Stukas and Sturmoviks.  Their cannon are deadly, but can they always tell friend from foe?&#10;&#10;You fight on any flat surface, manoeuvring your force of realistic miniatures and making use of the battlefield terrain supplied with the package.&#10;To get you started, the basic set of Panzerkampf offers 3 T34/41 tank models and 3 Panzer IVf1 models, as well as a supply of scenery.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is for 2 players and follows the basic rules of the original Black Rose Wars game with minor adjustments. It is a cut-out game contained within the Fourth edition of the LMS magazine called Ashes. It contains a folded board with a smaller Lodge that has 2 mage sheets printed near the edges. It comes with 1 new school of magic 'Agony' and 3 forgotten spells.  There are no events or quest cards, instead those are printed on the game board and events are followed over the 3 turns of the game. The players control 2 new mages and can summon a new evocation called a succubus to inflict damage to others and pain upon themselves. This is a great way to introduce new players to the world of Black Rose Wars. Games are estimated at 30-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

Wherever the war effort took him, Skywalker was a symbol of hope to his fellow Rebels and soon Star Wars&trade;: Legion players will get the chance to experience him like never before.&#10;&#10;Fantasy Flight Games is happy to announce the Limited Edition Luke Skywalker Commander Expansion, available soon at your local retailer!&#10;&#10;Ready for Action&#10;Whether leading the fabled Rogue Squadron or a small strike team, Luke Skywalker earned his reputation as one of the Rebellion&rsquo;s most enduring heroes through countless battles and this Limited Edition expansion depicts him as he appeared during one of the most iconic clashes in the Star Wars saga: the Battle of Hoth. Wearing his Rebel flight suit and perched atop the wreckage of his T-47 airspeeder, this version of Luke Skywalker is ready to continue the fight on the ground.&#10;&#10;Not only does the miniature included here bring a totally new sculpt of Luke Skywalker to your Star Wars: Legion battles, you have the freedom to customize it to fit your personal taste. The miniature can be assembled carrying either Luke&rsquo;s lightsaber or his DL-44 blaster and with or without his flight helmet. Additionally, if you decide to include the flight helmet, you can also choose whether Luke enters battle with its visor up or down.&#10;&#10;However you decide to assemble your miniature, Luke Skywalker is as skilled as ever on the battlefield. This expansion also contains a unit card with abilities identical to the Hero of the Rebellion version of Luke Skywalker found in the Star Wars: Legion Core Set, but now featuring updated artwork matching his new appearance. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll also find copies of Luke Skywalker&rsquo;s command cards My Ally is the Force, Return of the Jedi, and Son of Skywalker featuring this updated artwork alongside the unit card. Finally, to ensure Luke Skywalker is fully prepared for battle, this expansion also contains reprints of four upgrade cards: Emergency Stims, Environmental Gear, Force Push, and Hope.&#10;&#10;The Limited Edition Luke Skywalker Commander Expansion will only be available for a limited time. In the Unites States, this expansion will be available through local game stores, each of which will be eligible to receive a small amount.

    "Description": "In the 17th century, significant advancements were made in the field of science owing to the establishment of academic societies across Europe. As the leader of a faction within one such academic society, you must strive to earn prestige through your studies so that your faction can grow.&#10;Myriad matters compete for your attention as you endeavor to maintain your influence in each of the sciences. Contributing to the kingdom&rsquo;s growth by completing royal commissions, presenting your findings at conferences, and taking sabbaticals to gather knowledge in foreign lands are just a few of the tasks laid before you.&#10;Will your quest for knowledge earn you prestige within your academic society and allow you to expand your faction?&#10;c Society, you&rsquo;ll compete to earn the most Prestige through the game&rsquo;s three primary systems.&#10;&#10;The first system involves the society board&rsquo;s action spaces. Each round, you&rsquo;ll place your scholars on various action spaces and perform the corresponding main actions.&#10;Some action spaces allow you to perform a bonus action in addition to a main action; however, since there aren&rsquo;t many of these special action spaces, you&rsquo;ll have to anticipate what the other players will do and act accordingly.&#10;&#10;The second system involves the management board&rsquo;s influence track. At the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll earn Prestige from the spaces occupied by your scholars on this track.&#10;You can also choose to remove your scholars from the influence track and use them to perform actions starting from the next round.&#10;Once removed, scholars cannot be returned to the influence track, forcing you to choose between earning extra Prestige at the end of the game or having more scholars on hand to perform actions with.&#10;&#10;The third system involves the sabbatical tracks on your player board. Advancing your scholars along these tracks will earn you permanent bonuses.&#10;However, scholars assigned to a sabbatical track stay there for the rest of the game, which means you&rsquo;ll have fewer scholars available to perform actions.&#10;Deciding if and when to assign your scholars to these tracks will require careful consideration.&#10;&#10;As each of these systems involves your scholars, you&rsquo;ll have to manage them wisely if you hope to emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;",
