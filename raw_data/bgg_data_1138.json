    "Description": "You are the representative of one of 6 Corporations, currently on a Satellite in orbit around Mars, tasked with the job of exploration and conquest of Mars for the profit of your employer over a maximum of 6 years. Uncontaminated water on Earth is scarce and so it is the chosen commodity and the benchmark used to evaluate your success in competition with the 5 other Corporations.&#10; Your Earth Corp is sending you, on a yearly basis, a diminishing amount of water from Earth for your use on your satellite. You utilize this water to activate &quot;Squishy&quot; (men) and &quot;Crunchy&quot; (robots) stored on your satellite. You use Squishy and Crunchy to drop down from your satellite to a constantly rotating planet Mars to explore the hidden terrain and discover water resources. Each Squishy that holds a terrain hex at the end of the fiscal year will provide water to send back to Earth in a running tally with the highest total at the end of the game being awarded the Monopoly of Mars for their Corporation.&#10;&#10;Each Fiscal Year is divided into 4 Quarters and a Fiscal Year End. During the turn order players: receive water from Earth and roll for safe transit; active Squishy and Crunchy units; bid on the Chair; resolve storm movement and damage; determine and wait for Mars rotation; move units down to and around on Mars; resolve hex control through conflict; resupply their units on the surface with water from the satellite; accumulate profit points for terrain held; attempt to discover Alien Tech; and generally mess with the competition whenever they can using MarsNeedsYou Cards.&#10;&#10;MarsNeedsYou Cards are held by players and used to benefit themselves or mess with the competition. Players also bid with water for a &quot;Chairmanship&quot; which allows them to roll to determine the amount of rotation of Mars before players are allowed to move their Squishy and Crunchy to the surface. &quot;Chairman&quot; also get to decide which of all the players will go first, with play proceeding in a clockwise order. This allows them to decide where they would like to be in the order of play. Where conflict occurs between multiple players for a terrain hex the &quot;Chairman&quot; also decides who fights first, even if they are involved in the conflict. And speaking of conflict, players who move their units onto other player occupied terrain hex are now in &quot;Strenuous Negotiations&quot; and must roll dice to determine who will hold the terrain and reap the profit from it and who will die and be rendered back into water for collection. If a player is not involved in any conflict they may pay water and roll for the chance to collect an Alien Tech Card which will provide them with an advantage courtesy of found Mars Alien Technology.&#10;&#10;At the end of the last Fiscal Year, players count up their profit and any game bonuses for things like holding specific terrain or having the most Squishy on Mars and see how much total profit they have sent back to Earth.  The player who squeezes the most profit from Mars is granted the development monopoly and wins the conflict!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Gamecrafters: &quot;Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond is an easy to learn bluffing game for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;The year is 1926. The astounding Sphinx Diamond has been brought to London from Egypt. A glamorous masquerade party is being thrown to celebrate its unveiling. However, thieves lurk among the city&rsquo;s rich and famous, each planning to steal the rare jewel. In Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond, players take on the role of a thief in disguise. They must guard their true identity while using poison to eliminate their competition.&quot;&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond is a quick, fast-paced mystery card game in which players are attempting to be the last one standing without having other players uncover their secret identity. The game has two sets of characters: one set is masked, which are placed down in a row in the center of the table, the others are unmasked and one is secretly dealt to each player. Each player is now working to keep their character alive (no poison cards played on the character) until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to the character cards, there are poison and antidote cards and three (3) item cards that can be added for varying levels of difficulty.&#10;&#10;Each player takes two (2) actions on their turn:&#10;&#10;&bull; Draw a card (poison or antidote)&#10;&bull; Play a card - play a poison on ANY character even if they are already poisoned. The poison remains on the character until any players play an antidote with the matching icon on a poisoned character to remove a poison. (Example: Snake antidote will remove a snake poison on a character.&#10;&bull; Move an item - The items sit above the characters and can be moved to an adjacent character.&#10;&#10;The base game is played with just the Mirror in play. When the mirror is above a character, that character cannot have poisoned played on them. (Antidotes can be played.)&#10;&#10;When there is one (1) character that has no poison cards on them the game ends. The player who is that character will reveal themselves and they are the winner. However, if that character is NOT one of the player characters, the game resumes.&#10;&#10;The Sphinx Diamond and Opera Glasses items can be added to the mix to up the difficulty of the game. They move in the same way as the mirror but have different effects. The Opera glasses item allows players to peek at each other's hand of cards. The Sphinx Diamond changes the win condition: In order to win, the player must be the last character with no poisons AND have the Sphinx Diamond above their character.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "2-6 players battle it out battle royale style in a race to craft the strongest weapon! Players play the role of a warrior that must combine different grips, guards, and blades to create a fantastical weapon!&#10;&#10;Game Prep:&#10;Each player has a space in front of them known as the Forge where they place different card types including blades, grips, guards, shields, and gadgets. Each player starts with an Adventurer blade and wooden grip in their Forge. Each player starts with an attack die (starts at d4) and a health die (d20 set to 20). The Armory (draw pile) is shuffled and 6 cards are dealt to each player. A starting player is chosen.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The objective of the game is to be the last player standing after all others have been defeated. The goal as the game progresses is to place grips and guard onto your blade in order to Reforge. This allows you to upgrade your attack die (d4-&gt;d6-&gt;d8-&gt;d10-&gt;d12), giving the benefit of more possible damage and allowing you to use more powerful blades (Forge level requirements are marked on cards).&#10;&#10;Attacking is done by selecting a target player and adding up all the attack modifiers (red number) on your blade, grip, and guards. This is your base attack. You then roll your attack die and add it to your base attack to determine the total attack. Subtract your target's defense (blue number) to calculate damage dealt to the target player.&#10;&#10;Blocking can be performed if the defending player has at least one part (guard or grip) in play attached to their blade. To block, both players roll their attack die (blade and part modifiers are ignored). If the defending player rolls higher, they take no damage. If the attacking player rolls equal to or higher, the defending player takes the damage they would have AND discards a part of their choice from their Forge.&#10;&#10;Shields can be placed on a player's turn. If an attack meets or exceeds the shield's stability (marked in the corner of the card), the shield is discarded and the defending player takes no damage (there is no overflow damage to player). If the attack is less than the shield's stability, the player takes no damage and the shield remains. The stability of the shield is reset after each player's turn (it does not decrease like health).&#10;&#10;Turn Flow:&#10;1) Draw a card.&#10;2) Recycle (discard two cards to draw one).&#10;2) Use gadgets (as many as you'd like).&#10;3) Place or replace a part (one per turn).&#10;4) Reforge or attack (you cannot attack if you Reforge).&#10;&#10;When a player's health reaches zero, that player is out. The player that dealt the killing blow &quot;loots&quot; the defeated player and takes all cards that were in that player's hand and Forge.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dugout Steps Baseball is a full simulation of the game of Baseball that features a highly detailed interaction between Pitchers and Batters, giving flavor to the age-old battle between Hurler and Slugger. Dugout Steps Baseball provides for a wide variety in Pitcher Performance which, in turn, makes each game unique and detailed. Once a ball is put into play, the action really heats up in Dugout Steps Baseball. Ballparks and Fielders are easily incorporated into game play and you will certainly know the difference between playing at Wrigley Field and Dodger Stadium. Great Fielders who flash the leather really make a difference in Dugout Steps Baseball as they bail out Pitchers with great defensive plays. Big Bat and No Leather players will provide pop at the plate, but fizzle in the field. Drama surrounds Big Flys that can either get out or fall short of the wall. Fielders can pick 'em off the top of the fence and wind can blow a Big Fly foul. When men are on base, Strategy becomes involved and adds fun.&#10;&#10;Dugout Steps Baseball features a highly sophisticated system for knowing the location of a batted ball without having to do anything more than simply look at a number. This one number, however, opens up a world of possibility in Fielding and Baserunning. Baserunner Advancement features Collisions and Close Plays where the Baserunner attempts to avoid a tag or the Fielder tries to slap the tag on the Baserunner. Blown Calls add drama and fun and trigger Manager Arguments. Plays involving the Pivot are handled easily, but with great detail, as Middle Infielders try to Turn Two or a Baserunner attempts to break up a Twin Killing.&#10;&#10;Dugout Steps Baseball includes the option to be played at a Basic Level and even contains an optional Add-On for determining Pitch Counts easily and seamlessly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Foxes and racoons try to outwit each other on the mountain. The start player is the last to have seen a fox or a racoon. The game is a mix of bluff, hand management, and some take that, until one player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;The game comes with English and Japanese rules, and both on the cards. The publisher chooses not to identify the game designers or artists, listing them only as Bodlanca.&#10;&#10;Animals living on Mt. Mayakashi use magic and are masters of disguise. Late at night, they transform their appearance and begin outfoxing each other. The winner of this game is highly acclaimed as the best magician on the mountain.&#10;&#10;Each player has an index card and a health card with their health shown in coloured bars from 10 to 1. As the game progresses, players lose or gain Health Points (HP) and when a player's HP falls to zero or lower, the game ends. The player with the highest HP is the winner.&#10;&#10;The deck has a mix of attack cards, defence cards, ability cards, and cards with no effect. The deck is shuffled and players are dealt a hand of five (hand limit is seven).&#10;&#10;The active player plays a card face-down and declares the card's name. The player may choose to lie or be truthful. If no player calls out &quot;Doubt&quot;, the card's effect takes place (presumably it is shown).&#10;&#10;If however a player did call out &quot;Doubt&quot;, the card is shown now. If the player was truthful, the caller recieves 1 point of damage. If the player was false, they recieve a point of damage instead. The card effect is resolved, and then player draws a card to their hand.&#10;&#10;If they now have more than seven cards, they discard down, and the turn moves clockwise.&#10;&#10;The card effects are simple and evident, attack does damage, defence blocks or defers it, and the abilities are to draw two cards, or heal one point, or view another player's hand, or no effect at all.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wintergrim is a turn-based strategic card game made for 1 player per card deck. The first edition includes two theme based card decks of 50 cards each, named: Spirits of Summer &amp; Wolves of Winter. It also includes 8 green d6 dices and rule cards.&#10;&#10;The first who arrived from the sea, called it Asheim. They discovered a land with ancient cultures, unpredictable weather and forest-dwelling humans allied with strange creatures and spirits. At first everyone was cautious... Years later, sparked by the death of an asheim jarl in a sudden windstorm, the coast dwelling warriors of Asheim make their revenging assaults over the frozen hills of Wintergrim, east through Stormshade on the spirits of Vanheim, a realm of strangely lush forests in an otherwise wintry mountain area. The time has come to seek control over the mountain dwelling creatures that seem to warm and cool the winds to the will of the spirits.&#10;&#10;Find new areas and paths, build structures, hire workers, warriors and leaders, and use tactics and weather to your advantage. Manage economics and food supply, and capture enemy units while you defeat your opponent to gain access to more powerful units and/or other benefits like mixing your used cards into your deck. Your units can move in/out of structures, between your own areas, or to/from enemy areas by first moving to a Path. Dices contributes with the unpredictability of how long weather stays in play, how your units attack/defend in close/ranged combat, and they are used to keep track of damage to units/structures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

(Meishi Janken-deai ni kansha) means 'Business Card Janken - thanks for meeting!'. Deai ni kansha! is a shady phrase, which would translate to &quot;Let's be thankful for us getting to know each other!&quot;, suggesting the satirical nature of the game. Janken is the Japanese name for Rock Scissors Paper, and is quite popular in Japan as a way of deciding things. For example, a group of several players will use it quickly to choose the start player. In this game, it means more like a way of proving your claim.&#10;&#10;In Japan, business culture is very strict, and each salaryman has their own business card. It becomes more than a contact, it becomes a symbol, the soul of the businessman. There is a polite way to give and receive a business card. It's claimed a person might get fired for bending a card they've been handed. So the designers intentionally mock the sacred nature of business cards with this frivolous game.&#10;&#10;The game is played with a deck of fake but highly realistic business cards (two are real). (So realistic, I walked off with one by mistake at the Tokyo Game Market, thinking it was the publisher's card). With company logos styled like Yapoo!, NYSO, Fugitsu, Noodle, the cards have names, addresses, QR codes, the lot.&#10;&#10;Meishi Janken - Deai ni Kansha! is a game to group together more people (by their business cards) by announcing what they have in common. The game takes place at an inter-industry exchange meeting. The players each start with a hand of 4 to 6 business cards, depending on the number of players, and try to group them with other cards as potential business partners according to what the owners of the business cards might have in common. In playing the game, cards are placed face-up, and players identify common features between cards. The colours, the logos, the names of people, the addresses, any information that matches can count.&#10;&#10;Each time you add a card to a group, state what feature the new card (that is, the person) shares with the group in addition to the features already shared among the group (so as to &quot;deepen the ties&quot;), and that group will belong to you. Otherwise, replace a card in your hand by discarding it in the party area and drawing a card from the deck. You can also choose to add the cards in the party area to any group. The game ends when the deck runs out and the players have    used up their cards. At the end of the game, the player who has grouped the most cards wins as the &quot;networking master&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game is intended for humour and satire, but the publishers remind you to be respectful of people's private information, since you can use real business cards too.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Muffin Mythos is a semi-coop all vs. one game of Cthulhu fighting goodness.&#10;&#10;All of the armies of the world have been defeated by the legendary monster Cthulhu. Civilization has crumbled beneath the chaos and destruction. Mankind is left defeated and without hope of any salvation. An unlikely group of rebels have come together to defeat the monster. They call themselves the Shepherds. Coming together in unity has not been easy for the Shepherds, as some of them only fight for personal glory and gain. However they are united through one common purpose: defeat Cthulhu, and save the future of mankind.&#10;&#10;With all the world's armies defeated, salvation seems impossible. Until one day, a small peculiar stranger appears covered head to toe by a robe. He speaks in a low grizzly voice, muttering to himself as he limps towards them. What appears to be crumbs fall to the floor with every word he mumbles.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm too late, they won't listen.&quot; he grumbles to himself. &quot;Doom. Doom.&quot; The stranger hobbles closer to the Shepherds, more crumbs falling to the ground as he moves. &quot;Hope, there is hope. You must listen. You must find them.&quot; The stranger grabs hold of the collar of a Shepherd pulling himself close.&#10;&#10;&quot;Find the Muffins.&quot;&#10;&#10;The stranger collapses to the floor and seems to disappear as crumbs scatter across the room.&#10;&#10;In Muffin Mythos players will build an army by rolling and re-rolling dice in farkle, or yahtzee style. Players recruit their army by scoring their dice without rolling a Cthulhu symbol on a custom wood engraved die. They may also explore the city and find companions, and items which will help them in their quest.&#10;&#10;One player will play as Cthulhu and will roll dice in a similar way, but instead of recruiting an army the Cthulhu player will destroy townspeople and the town itself.&#10;&#10;Players may optionally choose to brawl with their friends in order to raise their army's power and ultimately be the sole Shepherd responsible for defeating Cthulhu.&#10;&#10;Once a player believes their army is strong enough to defeat Cthulhu, they may engage Cthulhu in battle. Once a player is engaged they may not disengage or allow Cthulhu to take a special attack against the players army. If a player's army is defeated they lose all items and companions and start back in the town with nothing.&#10;&#10;Cthulhu wins when he defeats a certain number of townspeople or destroys a certain number of town cards.&#10;&#10;Players win by either single handedly defeating Cthulhu, or working together to defeat him.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

To facilitate the campaign game, a separated Player Sheet has been added to track the progress of your Character.&#10;&#10;You start the game creating and equipping your character, then you will generate the dungeon using the 1PG Deck, that will help you designing the random layout of the map (where and how to connect the rooms/corridors). Each Scenario includes unique events, encounters, obstacles and of course enemies that you&rsquo;ll need to face during your exploration of the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Combat is not resolved with a plain die roll but instead provides several tactical options in the form of the available Combat Actions: will you select a Strong Attack or instead a Feint and Counterattack? Enemies very often have special attack capabilities that you will need to evaluate to identify the best strategy: this is especially important when you&rsquo;ll face the Boss.&#10;&#10;Scenarios can be played (and re-played) individually or you can play them in succession as a campaign: loot and experience points accumulated by your character will allow to purchase better equipment and improve your attributes.&#10;&#10;The game includes three different Scenarios, and new ones are already planned to expand the gaming options.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Gliders Racing is the world's first board game about gliding for both pilots and those who dream to be a pilot.&#10;&#10;Practice the racing tactics, understand the meteorology and atmospheric phenomena which drive your flight and win the Big Race.&#10;Enjoy realistic maps and cockpit views.&#10;Have great fun while improving your flying skills.&#10;Invite other players and compete to be the best glider pilot!&#10;&#10;How does actual gliding work?&#10;Do you know how does all this actually work? A glider (sometimes also called a sailplane) is an aircraft, that while flying is continuously losing altitude, up until it is so low, that the glider must land. The glider will commence its flight by being launched into the air either by an powered towing aeroplane or a stationary, ground-based winch. In such a way, a glider acquires its starting altitude, and may begin to lose it, thus beginning the flight. The glider can regain the altitude it lost by using atmospheric thermal updrafts. By utilizing such atmospheric phenomena, the glider can not only remain airborne for hours, but also cover large distances &ndash; gaining altitude in updrafts and losing it while traveling to another updraft. This is why it is crucial for the glider pilot to spend as much time as possible in updrafts, and as little time as possible in areas where are no updrafts. Such areas are called downdrafts.&#10;&#10;Basic Rules.&#10;Up to 4 players can play the game. Each player begins the game at the home airfield (START point), at the altitude of 1,500 meters. The goal of the game if to get to the FINISH point, visiting in succession all of the checkpoints, designated 1, 2 3, 4. The route between the points is the player&rsquo;s choice. You can take the most direct, straight-line route, but other, less direct routes may be easier and more efficient. Remember: you need to visit all points in succession: START, 1, 2, 3, 4, and finally FINISH.&#10;&#10;Flying throw the map you will loose the altitude which you can rebuild (under the cumulus cloud, ridge called on map sail or wave). Rebuild altitude takes a time, so in our game next player is moving at that time.&#10;&#10;During all flight you have to keep over minimum your altitude and avoid out of landing which means you have start your journey again.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one which will be first on finish.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Blackwater is the fifth Chapter Pack in the King's Landing cycle for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game.&#10;&#10;The King&rsquo;s Landing cycle takes a new approach to the Game of Thrones LCG. Rather than following the plot of A Song of Ice and Fire, this cycle is centered around the capital of the seven kingdoms, allowing you to explore the world of Westeros more freely than ever before. Every Chapter Pack in this cycle features three copies each of twenty unique cards to strengthen your decks and help you embrace the deadly intrigues of A Song of Ice and Fire with the continued cultivation of the shadow keyword, first reintroduced in the Dance of Shadows cycle.&#10;&#10;Your journey to the capital of the seven kingdoms draws you beyond the city walls to explore the surrounding waterways that acted at the setting of the greatest battle in the War of the Five Kings. This battle was the making of many warriors, and you may elevate your own knights to the rank of Kingsguard if you deem them worthy. As shadows continue to creep in from the North, the Reach, and the streets of King's Landing itself, you may find that need more protection than ever if your House is to earn victory and claim the Iron Throne!&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Castles of Dawnstone is a deck building and worker placement game for 1 or more players where you are trying to destroy your opponents village. Everyone starts with the same deck of 10 cards, but through individual village development and hiring mercenaries from the general pool you hopefully muster a better army than your opponent. In a turn, the active player plays all 5 cards in his hand and gains their benefits. Some cards may produce income to purchase mercenary cards or pay them off to retire so your opponent can't hire them. Other cards will allow you to attack your opponent outright. Some may increase the attack strength of your attacking cards. Others will allow you to build better buildings in your village, or worship at the alter of your Gods to give you the upper hand. There are lots of combinations for you to discover. Once you have played all of your cards, move any idle workers in your village to the designated area and leave the ones still working where they are. Then discard the cards you played and draw a new hand of 5 cards. Now your opponent takes their turn. That's it. Super simple rules with a complex strategy and high replay ability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It can be played as a 2 or 3 player game, as a 4 player game in partnership.&#10;&#10;Players try to develop their potions as alchemists, and the first player who clears out their hand will win.&#10;&#10;To win the game, it is important to determine which color of potion is rare. Because each time you create a potion unique in the world, you can take your turn again. So the players will aim to make potions which require more complex composition.&#10;&#10;Further more you should keep in mind that you have a fellow player. By playing cards from your hand onto your partners potions, you will get closer to winning.&#10;&#10;However, be careful, your fellow may secretly keep 'philosopher&rsquo;s stone' card, a wild card in their hand. The philosopher's stone acts like a joker and can complete any potion. Knowing this is in play adds a thrill to the game.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 2013 by Chicken Dice Games (&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#186;) and revised and re-issued by Southern Cross Games (&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#182;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#186;) in 2016.&#10;'user summary&#10;&#10;",

When one player at the base of the steps or on a step rolls the required symbols for the next step, all players at the same level as that player in the chamber may move up to that step.

The new border will make it easier for machines to read the cards, helping to prevent mispackaging. Advertising for the set featured the planeswalker Garruk Wildspeaker, with a tagline of &quot;Hunt Bigger Game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Magic 2015 includes the mechanic &quot;Convoke&quot;, which originally appeared in Ravnica: City of Guilds. This mechanic allows a player to use their creatures to help cast spells with Convoke.

The returning mechanic of Magic 2014 is Slivers, a series of creatures of which each grants an ability to each Sliver.&#10;&#10;Magic 2014 marked a change to the Legend rule. It made the &quot;Indestructible&quot; effect a keyword, and changed the phrasing for unblockable creatures to &quot;can't be blocked.&quot; Slivers in Magic 2014 also worked subtly differently from Slivers in earlier Magic; they now only affected Slivers owned by the same controller, rather than all Slivers in the game. Slivers also received an art redesign that de-emphasized their original beak-headed, one-clawed, one-tailed insect-like appearance, and instead became monstrous humanoids whose appearance varied heavily by card, but had &quot;normal&quot; features such as faces and eyes. This redesign proved controversial; one reviewer noted &quot;slivers are one of the most iconic designs in all of Magic: The Gathering. To essentially muddle them down into just another humanoid monster thing is really disappointing.&quot; Wizards of the Coast acknowledged the negative feedback, noting that some players disliked the new art style, and included a card in Magic 2015 that used the original Sliver appearance in Sliver Hive&#10;&#10;",

It featured a cycle of double-faced cards (originally used in Innistrad) that have a legendary creature on one side representing the character before their transformation, and a planeswalker on the reverse face that represents them after gaining their new power.&#10;&#10;The set introduced the mechanics of renown, spell mastery, and menace. It also features cards with the prowess mechanic, which was introduced in Khans of Tarkir block, and the scry mechanic, which was introduced in Mirrodin block.&#10;&#10;In February 2015, Wizards of the Coast said that it would be an introductory product &quot;like a core set&quot;, and it was published in the time period that a core set would have taken up during the pattern established by Magic 2010. After Origins, Magic switched to a new schedule where each year contained 2 blocks, and each block contained 2 sets. With the new schedule, there are no announced plans for a major &quot;standalone&quot; set like Origins that is not part of a block.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Monkey King Sun Wukong has decreed that his disciples, the monkeys of Flower and Fruit Mountain, must create a kingdom worthy of his status as Great Sage, Equal of Heaven. To do so each monkey must tame the mountain by following the Six Principles of Zen; forging paths, directing streams, and arranging features such as fruit trees, lanterns and statues that will most please King Monkey. In addition, Sun Wukong demands that all monkeys must help to build him a shrine on top of the mountain. Not all of the mountain monkeys agree with Sun Wukong however and some patrol the forest, ready to catch unwary monkeys.&#10;&#10;In Zen Monkeys players each have a monkey Disciple, creating their part of Sun Wukong's kingdom on the mountain. Each round player monkeys search the Wilds for placeable 'feature' resources or collect landscape tiles to shape their forest into a puzzle-like network of paths and streams. Searching along paths in the Wilds has a noise penalty that triggers the approach of the grey guardian monkeys who will chase and eject any monkeys found collecting. Sneaky monkeys will be able to collect and place these resources in their landscapes to best please King Monkey, following the set of objectives he has set them for the game. Collectable resources are scarce so the monkeys will have to landscape their part of the forest carefully and be ready to grab point-scoring features before their rivals can.&#10;&#10;After two full moon phases, the game ends and King Monkey appears to judge the most impressive landscapes of his new kingdom. Points are scored on the sets of features placed in each area, the adherence to the 6 zen principles and for the specific tasks assigned by King Monkey.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Please note that all weapons options are included in this box, as well as the pilot (in resin) and the recoiless gun.&#10;&#10;This reference comes with three Dust 1947 unit cards, one for each variant. Like all regular Dust 1947 miniatures, it comes already pre-assembled and primed. It's ready for the battlefield, or for painting, as you wish! You can directly paint over on it, since the priming serves as an undercoat and is compatible with any type of paint.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Ryu was the first walker developed specifically for the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, with great help from the Central Axis powers, especially Germany. Assembled on the powerful chassis of the PanzerKampfL&auml;ufer III, it has become the most common walker in the Japanese arsenal. The second version is very similar to the original Ryu with its laser guns, but also has a machine-gun for close infantry defense. The third version, Ryu III, mounts two impressive rail guns, from Japanese design. This reference allows you to field one of these two variants.&#10;&#10;This reference comes with two Dust 1947 unit cards, one for each variant, both for the IJN Bloc.

    "Description": "Players compete to balance exploitation and conservation in an effort to save endangered species from the brink of extinction. To do this, players must accumulate money through the collection and selling of resources in order to then buy and conserve land. To collect resources, players must exploit the land, and potentially push species to extinction. Players take the role of advisers to the Minister for the Environment - choosing when to approve requests for resource projects (collecting resources for doing so) and choosing which companies to give the approved contracts to (owned by other players, or themselves - who also collect resources). The role of the Minister is to conserve species, therefore the adviser that enables the best conservation of species wins the game! The game ends when either 15 species are saved, or 6 are made extinct.&#10;&#10;The setup for the game is always randomized: The lands are arranged at random, in addition to the location of the endangered species; The resource cost to improve the efficiency of exploited lands is randomized; and the resource cost to move species, create habitat bridges and recycle waste is also randomized.&#10;&#10;The board consists of 4 separate land types (Plains, Oceans, Mountains, Forests) with 20 endangered species. Players compete to collect 6 different resource types: Food (from Plains), Oil (from Oceans), Metal (from Mountains), Wood (from Forests), Electricity (from Electricity plants - built anywhere) and People (from Cities - built anywhere). They do this by buying and exploiting the land: spreading out from a starting land to adjacent land tiles. The cost of land grows as more of it is exploited. Players must also pay the cost of Waste that is generated by exploiting lands and extracting resources.&#10;&#10;A turn has two phases. Phase 1 involves: Approving resource projects (3 available each turn, drawn from a deck), Buying land, Buying/Selling resources, Upgrading lands and/or performing Acts of Conservation (building habitat bridges, relocating species, recycling waste). Phase 2 involves: Recycling waste at Recycling plants (built anywhere) and Paying Waste dues (mandatory).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
