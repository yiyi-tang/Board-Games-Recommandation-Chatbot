The remaining players are &quot;Candidates&quot;, and they must choose from their hand of blue skill cards which card they wish to hand face-down to the Employer. After everybody hands their blue skill cards face-down to the Employer, the Employer will decide based on the skill cards, which Candidate was the best and most appropriate match for the job. Whoever wins the round becomes the Employer for the next round, the cards are re-shuffled and the game restarts. The first player to win ten green job cards wins the entire game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Donjara (Jarapon) is a Mahjong-like family game series first released in 1980. Each version has a different theme, usually from a manga or an anime series (e.g. Gundam or Spy x Family), a movie franchise (e.g. Godzilla) or things like the Sanrio Characters (Hello Kitty!) or Chiikawa. The rules for each version are the same except for some minor differences and the scoring for sets.&#10;&#10;The setup is like in Mahjong except each player holds 8 tiles instead of Mahjong's 13 tiles. Each turn a player picks up one tile and discards one. The goal is to collect a winning hand, a &quot;yaku&quot; of 3 sets of 3 tiles. Different combinations score differently. The original version of the game was called Ponjan (Punch game), as you could &quot;Pon&quot; like in Mahjong. The same rule applies to the currect versions of the game. The difference to Ponjan is that in Ponjan you try to collect 3 sets of 4, instead of 3 tiles. Additionally, Jarapon published by Epoch has numbered tiles, making sequences possible, depending on the rules used. The game can be player by 2-4 players, is easy enough to teach anyone from 4 years olds to grandmothers but exciting enough for anyoneto have some casual fun.&#10;&#10;The sets come with 83 tiles plus a blank extra tile. Different versions can come with point tokens or scoring sticks. The NEO series of games that first came out in 2022 come with a board with detachable frame for easy storage, transfer and set-ups for different player counts.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "CHARGE! Eagles Rising allows you to recreate battles in the Napoleonic era from the tactical to grand tactical seamlessly.  &#10;It is a battalion level game that allows you to be an active participant whether you are the phasing or non-phasing player. You can expect historical realistic outcomes provided Napoleonic tactics are employed.&#10;&#10;You can use your figurines mounted for Empire and Napoleon&rsquo;s Battles in addition to many other popular games with no need to remount for playing this new system. You&rsquo;ll be able to start utiizing this new approach rather quickly with minimum preparation.&#10;&#10;The game has basic command and control, strategic movement, and higher unit morale (i.e. Division, Corps, Army), but keeps the individual unit moral to a minimum. This allows the game to be both strategic and tactical without bogging down &#10;in endless details.&#10;&#10;This game is based on the command of large formations with each turn representing 20-30 minutes of real time &#10;and a scale of  1&rdquo; equals 40-60yards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sensuikan: Japanese Fleet Submarines, 1941-45 is a solitaire, tactical level game that places you in command of a Japanese Fleet submarine from Pearl Harbor until the end of the war in 1945. &#10;After choosing a class, your mission is to conduct special missions as assigned by the Combined Fleet. &#10;The player will take his submarine on assigned missions with the objective to complete said missions, as opposed to necessarily sinking merchant vessels (although that is sometimes an objective). &#10;You will be advancing your crew quality and increasing your commander&rsquo;s rank and awards&mdash;all while remembering you have to make it home amidst diminishing odds of survival as the war progresses.&#10;&#10;Players will find it extremely challenging to survive an entire tour from 1941 to 1945, at which time, if still alive, you will surrender at port, having done your part on the front lines.&#10;&#10;A fascinating historical addition to Sensuikan is three new modules: the Aircraft Module, the Midget Sub Module, and the Kaiten (suicide torpedo) Module. These modules facilitate play if a player is assigned to a submarine that is equipped with one of these special capabilities.&#10;&#10;The system is packed with rich technical detail based on the various submarine classes used by Japan. There are no less than 17 classes of submarine to choose from. These include:&#10;&#10;     Types A, B, C&#10;     Junsen (3 classes)&#10;     Kirai-Sen Class&#10;     Kaidai (5 classes)&#10;     Type B. 3 and Type C. 3&#10;     Sen-Toku and Sen-Taka Classes&#10;     Type A (Modified)&#10;&#10;&#10;The different classes have historical equipment, sometimes including aircraft in watertight hangars, midget submarines, and later in the war, suicide torpedoes. You may be assigned to special missions based on your class&rsquo;s capabilities &ndash; perhaps a midget submarine attack on Pearl Harbor or Australia, the bombing of the U.S. west coast, or possibly even an attack on the Panama Canal.&#10;&#10;Besides the focus on hardware, the human aspect of the war is captured as the submarine Commander (the player) and his crew can improve over time via skills acquisition. In addition to having combat modules to facilitate ease of play, the game includes a major change by including the &ldquo;Major Event&rdquo; markers that track the war&rsquo;s progress and possibly involve the player in supporting the Major Events as they occur.&#10;&#10;Gameplay moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial assignment, your submarine goes on patrol, randomly rolling for events and encounters. Special emphasis is placed on successfully conducting any operations assigned to you by Higher Command, as implemented by the &ldquo;Major Event&rdquo; marker system. Although sinking enemy shipping is always encouraged, the game&rsquo;s primary goal is to conduct operations as assigned to support the Main Force Fleet or other ongoing significant military operations.&#10;&#10;This game should be highly accessible to those familiar with the The Hunters or Silent Victory game systems and is meant to be a historical yet highly playable and exciting solitaire game covering Japanese fleet boat operations in World War II.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game is not about railways, but about investing in trading groups of countries to earn money. The main differences between this game and the usual 18xx game are that there are no railway tiles in the sea. Instead, you can use &quot;route blocks&quot; to expand your routes. In this period of Asian maritime trade, there are obstacles such as Japanese pirates and European powers. The game is played in a number of different ways. The number of turns is predetermined. There is no &quot;Bankruptcy is the end of the game&quot; rule. The game is similar to Poseidon, but a bit more 18xx.&#10;&#10;",

The emphasis in Blood Red Skies is on controlling a large number of planes at once. Action in the game is fast-paced, with no pre-plotting or book-keeping required. A smallish game of Blood Red Skies, with six planes per side, can be fought in forty-five minutes or less.&#10;&#10;A force is comprised of iconic World War 2 fighter aircraft using the dynamic &lsquo;Advantage&rsquo; system. Opposing pilots can also use card-based aircraft traits, doctrines, Ace skills and theatre rules to make the most of their planes and fighting environment.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Midway starter set contains everything you need to get playing, including rules, tokens, dice, game cards, and crucially 12 highly detailed Warlord Resin aircraft with which to battle.&#10;&#10;The Grumman F4F Wildcat When the US Navy and Marine Corps entered the Second World War, they had only one effective fighter aircraft available to them: the F4F Wildcat. Fortunately, the Wildcat proved more than equal to the task of holding the line.&#10;&#10;The Mitsubishi A6M2 &lsquo;Zero&rsquo; The Mitsubishi A6M Zero was a fast, modern fighter, but had no armour for the pilot. When the Zero (derived from the Japanese name Reisen - meaning Zero Fighter) was in the hands of aggressive and well-trained pilots this weakness was rarely apparent.&#10;&#10;The US aircraft are provided in blue-coloured resin and the Japanese in white/cream, making your squadrons easily distinguishable and able to launch into furious tabletop dogfights even before you touch paint to model.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In a fresh twist on established game mechanics, each player's resources - red, blue, and yellow &quot;primary color cubes&quot; - also function as the &quot;workers&quot; used to secure positions around a contested 4x4 grid of cards. Each round, players place cubes from their inventory on various border cards, before deciding to take one of two actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     investing cubes, allowing players to build up their supply of colors, or&#10;     spending cubes, obtaining a wide variety of action cards featuring inventive abilities and lucrative scoring bonuses&#10;&#10;&#10;When each round ends, players are also provided an opportunity to purchase vibrant paint swatches, further adding to their score - but depleting their inventory of resources at the same time. At the end of the game, players tally their scores. Most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;Featuring an approachable art style, a creative blend of mechanics familiar to veteran players, and a variety of cards to ensure no two games are alike, Chromatics is an exciting entry into the genre of two-player strategy games.

You can also use teleport spells to move ingredients (or steal them, ha ha!) between the witches' cauldrons. Finally, you can use a transmute action to magically swap one ingredient for another. As witches are not immune to attacks and traps, the Witch's Reflexes card will save you from more than one trouble!&#10;&#10;Witches also get fed up with being cheated, so they can sometimes use spells that will stun their opponents - watch out for them!

Players assemble a gang of local Dwellers with different talents (your gang tableau) and move through ancient tunnels hunting treasures and other rare finds. Treasures can be stashed for victory points or used to boost capabilities (movement, carrying load, health, dueling skill and gang recruitment) and activate tools. Treasure also hires you Dwellers for your gang. As your gang grows your capabilities also grow. As you travel deeper into the tunnel labyrinth, the going gets harder. Blessings from the Green Man God aid your quest, but the murderous Weasels will stop at nothing to prevent you getting your hands on treasure.&#10;&#10;Undergrowth is a tableau building game with mixed, interacting mechanics where the aim is to assemble the most skillful, most renowned and wealthiest treasure hunting gang. The winning player has the highest value card tableau and the most stashed gold at the end of 12 rounds. The game combines point to point movement, resource management, tableau building, dice combat and a hint of push your luck to produce a fun, adventurous and interactive tunnel crawling treasure hunt. Players have thinky dilemmas and interesting tactical choices. Deploy your tunnellers, move them through the tunnels, seek and find different treasures, avoid obstacles, interact with opponents, build your gang and grow your wealth and local reputation. Recruit new gang members from the local Inn and pay their cost to add them to your gang, then use their immediate or ongoing skills to become the dominant treasure hunting gang.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player will contribute to creating the graph (Candelsticks) of one (or more) quoted Financial Instrument, by playing cards from his hand. In his turn, the player can also decide to open or close positions, betting on the rise or fall of the Financial Instrument. The player will earn from the difference between the price at which he opened the position and the price at which he closes the position. &#10;It is essential to study the intentions of the opponents and hinder them while trying to position themselves strategically. Some Money Management cards help you to better manage your positions and hinder your opponents with the typical dynamics of drawing cards, having them discarded, spying or playing out of your turn. &#10;Attention instead to the Event cards that once drawn are activated and can upset the market (and the wallet of those who have risked too much). Of course, whoever earns the most wins.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to have an elementary basic development that mirrors the development on the market of a financial instrument. The player is led to make delicate choices based on market trends, dealing with an emotional state and risk management that are typical of real operations.&#10;&#10;In this sense, the game is designed so that statistically the rise in prices is slower than the relative descents (you go up the stairs and go down with the elevator). At the same time it will never be possible to know in a game, if you are in a bear market or a bull market as some random cards are removed from the deck at each game.&#10;&#10;The entire game is designed to give food for thought and teaching. The possibility of comparison is in fact a competitive advantage that very often people in the financial world do not use due to the difficulty of dealing with such delicate issues as personal investments.&#10;&#10;The possibility of comparison is continuously solicited by combining different financial instruments and players with market situations and risk appetites that are different for each of us.&#10;&#10;",

Do the same with the Normal game until you feel you are ready for some more challenges in the Advanced difficulty.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt 6 cards to each player, then draw and place cards to build their caravan. During the action of drawing cards, if any player draws the New Moon card, the first round immediately ends. The game plays in 3 rounds. After the first round is over, start the second and then the third round exactly the same as the first round. After the third round is finished, the player with the highest total point is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Completed project cards provide VIKTORY points, and the player with the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;The game takes a maximum of 20 minutes to play and ends after 20 rounds. There are no turns. Everyone plays simultaneously. New rounds are beeped by a timer and players draw up to three new cards and attempt to complete projects. For newer players or larger groups, rounds should be set to 1 minute. With experienced or fewer players, rounds should be set for less time, for example, 35 seconds.&#10;&#10;Project cards requiring more resources and rarer resources are harder to complete, but provide significantly more VIKTORY points. Once each round, a player may discard his current project card and draw a new one.&#10;&#10;If a player has the right combination of resource cards to complete a project card, he would:&#10;1. Collect the needed resource cards and the project card&#10;2. Turn them facedown in a completed project stack off to the side for end game scoring&#10;3. Draw another project card from the shared deck of project cards&#10;&#10;There are no trade restrictions. Players can trade any combination of resource, debt, or project cards as part of a trade.&#10;&#10;",

With thousands of demobilized sailors, pirating explodes in the West Indies and across the Atlantic.&#10;&#10;One crew of pirates, calling themselves the Flying Gang, seek fame, fortune, and self-governance by building their own Republic free from the constraints of kings, queens, and imperialism. Will you work together to build the Pirate Republic? Or will you betray your brethren in pursuit of greater riches? The sea is your territory; anyone on or near it, your prey.&#10;&#10;The Pirate Republic: Africa Gambit is a second edition to the original  The Pirate Republic. It is a thematic deck building, sandbox adventure game for 1-5 players which also adds West Africa riches, new Pirates, the Portuguese, and a campaign mode into the mix.   Set in the early 18th-century, each player is an infamous pirate captain weaving their own tale by performing daring feats and plundering on the high seas.&#10;&#10;It's a time of conquest and the lure of riches, indomitable spirit and fat treasure galleons, pirate utopias and watery graves!&#10;&#10;Are you ready to get your Pirate on?&#10;&#10;How does it play?&#10;&#10;You start with a deck of 12 cards, 2 of which are unique to your Pirate while 10 are shared. As you acquire cards and build your deck, your decisions will shape your Pirates&rsquo; personality.&#10;&#10;Using your cards you will sail across the map, strike fear on enemies, recruit crew, attack, defend, form a pirate haven, sack forts, complete global missions, or build infamy (which lets you gain even stronger cards). Each turn you will draw a hand of cards and take actions with them. Once you are out of cards, play goes to the next Pirate, and this continues until everyone has exhausted their decks.&#10;&#10;Individually you are amassing Swagger as quickly as you can while collectively completing the global missions. The game ends when the global mission (chosen by the players before the game begins) is completed Alternatively, whoever reaches 120 Swagger first is the winner.&#10;&#10;.....&#10;&#10;",

These commandments make the game different every time you play, and make the players do or don&rsquo;t do various things to avoid getting penalty points.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Each player at their turn must play a card first, and then take a card from the draw pile. The main rule is: You can never play a one-digit card on another one-digit card, and a two-digit card on another two-digit card.&#10;&#10;Commandments:&#10;Two commandments always govern the game: 1. Sneezing is forbidden! 2. Saying &lsquo;I&rsquo; or &lsquo;Me&rsquo; or &lsquo;Myself&rsquo; is forbidden! Eight more commandments will be added to the game randomly during the play. Commandment Cards add different rules to each game, making it very competitive and fun. So, all you need to do is to obey the commandments, or delude others into disobeying them!&#10;&#10;All players must obey the in-play commandments. Failing to do so must be penalized by one Penalty Token. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The theme is aimed at redefining natural spaces and putting players in contact with legends, customs and characters from native cultures.&#10;The objective of the game is to obtain the 4 Stones that are originally located in the center of the board and are represented by pyramids. This is achieved by entering the box where the stones are or by taking them away from the other players, using the same method.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can move their avatar, use nature powers, or change nature cards to summon one of the 4 animals on the board, so that more than one avatar can be used per player. If a player is caught, he loses the elements that he has been adding in his game (cards, powers, stones, animals) and returns to the origin, from where he re-enters the board.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player manages to collect the 4 Stones of the Universe&#10;&#10;Throughout the game we can find sacred spaces of protection, with characters known to all such as the flap, the pachamama, the salamanca, native animals and the use of powers of nature to achieve objectives.&#10;&#10;Piedras del Universo invites meeting, collaboration, concentration and strategy development, in addition to training adaptation to the unexpected and problem solving. Its instruction manual is at the same time, the construction of a story full of characters and situations that help us learn more about our own mythology.&#10;&#10;",

Communist airpower is represented by an AA track (interceptors+flak) which &quot;fires&quot; at UN Command air. You can knock down the AA level by air superiority missions. Other air missions include close support and interdiction. Interdiction is against the Communist logistics level. The lower the level, the less likely the Communists will go on the offensive. Thus, you have to allocate your airpower for what you think is thebest strategy.&#10;&#10;Two random events table: one for the North Korean invasion, the second kicks in when the Chinese enter. One random event is Soviet air intervention, which raises the Communist AA level considerably. Reinforcements: these come in on randomly determined turns, mainly to show fog of war and vary each game. You can also bring in US units from the strategic reserve, at a cost in victory points (these include elements of the 2nd Armored and 82nd Airborne divisions).&#10;&#10;Special rules:&#10;US mechanized task forces (you can form them from divisions).&#10;Chinese logistics surges (gotta do more interdiction to counter this!).&#10;Eighth Army commander: either Walker or Ridgway, each with their own advantages.&#10;&#10;&#10;Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #349&#10;&#10;",
