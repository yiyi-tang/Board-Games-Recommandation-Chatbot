    "Description": "Smart hens lay eggs and fight for their seats.&#10;The way to get a place is math!&#10;But you need to remember where the eggs are. You can remove it the moment you are off guard.&#10;Who is the smartest hen?&#10;&#10;&lt;Purpose of the game&gt;&#10;1. You need to figure out the location and number of eggs to score more points than other players.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game ready&gt;&#10;1. Each player takes 20 pieces of the same color.&#10;2. Randomly cover 25 lid tiles on the board.&#10;3. Each player shuffles the cards and draws 4 cards.&#10;4. The remaining cards are placed in a pile next to the board.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game play&gt;&#10;1. When the first player's turn comes, he uses it to add the required number of 4 cards in his hand.&#10;ex) When using 2 cards: (1) card + (2) card = 3&#10;ex) When using 3 cards: (1) card + (2) card + (3) card = 6&#10;2. Open the divider cover, insert 1 game piece (egg), and then close the cover again.&#10;3. Discard the used cards and draw cards from the pile for the number of cards used. This way the turn is over and the next person's turn begins.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game ends&gt;&#10;The game ends when all players' game pieces are used up. And when you open the lid, the one with the most eggs wins. Completing 3 and 4 items straight and diagonally gives 3 and 4 additional points each, and if there are discarded game pieces (eggs), the player with the most points by calculating -1 per piece wins.&#10;&#10;",

Can you be the first pirate king?&#10;&#10;This game is for 2-4 players. Your goal is to earn more honor than anyone else and become a pirate king.&#10;&#10;There are times when someone will take a risk to gain fame, and some will predict their own victory through reasoning. But be careful. Pirates always endure sacrifices.&#10;&#10;A card that you think is a good card can be a bad card. Conversely, bad cards can give off a light that you thought was impossible.&#10;&#10;Everything is in the hands of the Pirate King candidates.&#10;&#10;&lt;Purpose of the game&gt;&#10;1. The one with the most Corsair fame by summoning pirates wins.&#10;&#10;&lt;Game ready&gt;&#10;1.

After your eyes are tired from any computer / mobilephone / TV / smartphone etc - screen - it is great to spend time playing  just with a piece of paper, pencil and 2 (d6) dice. Also you can organize a tournament for any amount of players and for any amount of time. To start you need to download a score sheet and it is the score sheet for one player.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game: To get as much as possible points.&#10;To get points you must make as many continuous Lines as possible with Dots along the vertical, horizontally and diagonally. The more Dots in the line, the more points you get. You must have at least 3 Dots in a Line to get any points. First it looks like a very simple game but more you play more hints and tactics you will find.&#10;&#10;ROLL DICE and you get two numbers from two ordinary 6-sided dice. The numbers on the Dice are the coordinates where you need to put a Dot on a gaming board.&#10;If the coordinates are occupied and the player cannot place a Dot, then he receives a penalty point (draw a cross in the low left of the gaming board). Each GAME lasts up to 3 penalty points. After getting the third penalty point - GAME ends &ndash; start to count the lines.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each of you is unique: different abilities, powers, starting characteristics and capacities. But you all have the same aim: find the exit.&#10;The first who finds it and makes it out alive causes the maze to collapse on the others, winning the game.&#10;&#10;Labirintiny is a boardgame, but it's boardless. The &quot;board&quot; on which the players move is a maze formed by the cards. Each hero has its own particular start card, and every time a character steps &quot;out of the board&quot;, a new card is placed in the maze.&#10;Every card is unique, as every maze formed at every game.&#10;It's practically impossible to play twice the same scenario.&#10;&#10;Players move across the dungeon formed by the cards, looking for the exit. The dungeon is filled with monsters to defeat, chests to unlock, treasures to find, opportunities to seize, events that can change everything, and ways to obtain more objects and power.&#10;The exits, even if found right away, are protected and difficult to pass through. Only the bravest will dare to challenge their defenses!&#10;&#10;With Labirintiny you can: play alone against the maze; or with 2-4 players, each on their own; or 4 players paired in teams. In addition to these options there are different game modes included in the rules.&#10;Another important aspect of the game is the size: the game adapts to the surface on which is played, and not vice-versa. You can play on a table, on the floor, on a chair, any surface as long as it's stable: your choice will determine the maximum size of the maze.&#10;&#10;Self-produced by Mezzocielo&amp;Friends,it's their first boardgame.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You will be going door-to-door drawing candy cards at each house, aiming to get your favorite candy while avoiding those you have ranked the lowest. While you have some information about what is at the house, you can never be 100% sure what the next draw will turn up.&#10;&#10;Careful though, as it isn't just bad candy you are risking by continuing to draw, but also the good will of your neighbors; drawing a matching event card will trigger a unique event at each house. You just took a chocolate bar, your favorite! Do you go back in for another and risk dropping the chocolate back into the bucket? The Grinch at the next house has told you to only take two. Do you listen, or keep drawing and hope he doesn't notice?&#10;&#10;Once home you have until someone draws the parents card to trade your undesirable candy or tales of the evenings adventures for better candy. Whoever manages to get the best haul of candy (according to their personal ranking) wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If all players have their anti-virus chips side-by-side, put their hands away at the same time and reveal them to everyone. It is both a viral particle and a vaccine to be developed.&#10;3. The cards in the pile are used to make 2 sectors. The sector puts 4 cards next to the pile. This place is called a laboratory.&#10;&#10;    Even if the order of the vaccine chips and cards is the same during the game preparation process, the vaccine was not developed, and it is successful only when the new card placed by the player has the same order of the cards in the lab.&#10;&#10;&#10;4.

Make sure a vaccine has been developed.&#10;5. If the order of the vaccine to be developed and the potion card between team members are the same, the vaccine for virus treatment has been successfully developed. Store successfully developed vaccines aside.&#10;6. Place a card and draw a card from the front of the sector or from the pile. In this way, it preserves 4 cards per sector.&#10;(Please push the cards toward the pile so the next player can place them.)&#10;&#10;    If you place a card and the card in front of the sector is turned over, remove the card and unconditionally draw a card from the pile.&#10;&#10;&#10;7.

    "Description": "Submarines: The Kaidai-7-class, or KD-7, was developed in the late 1930s, following on from the preceding KD-6 class. With a surface range of 8,000nm at 16kts, and a submerged endurance of 50nm at 5kts, they possessed a slightly better underwater performance to the late-model KD-6s and better surface speed (though not range) than the earlier members of that class. All members of the class were lost by mid-1944. Another ocean-going submersible using 533mm forward and aft torpedo tubes, it served in the South Pacific as well as the waters off Australia. I-177 sunk the hospital ship AHS Centaur off Stradbroke Island. It was presumed lost with all hands on 18 November 1944, while the I-176 was lost six months earlier off of the Solomon&rsquo;s. There were 10 KD-7 submarines built overall.&#10;&#10;MTBs: Designed as a suicide craft, the Shin&rsquo;y&#197;&#141; either carried a powerful explosive or two depth charges. The depth charges were intended to be planted by the pilot of the boat, after which he would then make his escape. Although nearly 10,000 were built, they accounted for the sinking of only 5 ships, mainly landing craft.&#10;&#10;The Imperial Japanese Navy fielded a number of variants on a standard torpedo boat design, differing mainly in machinery fit which affected displacement, giving the illusion of more variety than existed in practice. 238 boats were built within these designations, all armed with two 18-inch torpedoes and 25mm or 13.2mm guns.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;3 Kaidai-7-class Submarine&#10;2 Shin'yo Kamikaze boat sections&#10;2 T-14 MTB sections&#10;Ship Cards&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Submarines: A long-ranged submersible, the Type IX was the most successful U-boat of the war, with each vessel averaging over 100,000 tons of shipping sunk. One Type IX, U-107, made the most successful convoy mission of the war, with nearly 100,000 tons of shipping sunk out of Freetown in Africa. The latest variants of this design were capable of ranges of more than 23,000 miles, allowing them to rove far in search of convoys, while their heavy load of torpedoes allowed them to keep pace with a convoy, attacking night after night.&#10;&#10;MTBs: The R1-class of R-Boat (from the German R&auml;umboot, meaning minesweeper) was intended to be used as a shallow water minesweeper but, as the war went on, it became a multi-role craft. Its duties expanded to include patrol, antisubmarine, convoy escort, minelaying, and rescue operations. Some classes of R-Boat, such as the R310, were fitted with torpedo tubes, though performance was very modest compared to craft specifically designed for the role.&#10;&#10;The ultimate S-Boat to be operational in significant numbers was the S-100-class, which was produced from 1943 and was said to be the best fast patrol boat of its time. The S-100-class was nicknamed the Calotte, as it featured a rounded armoured bridge. It was powered by three Daimler-Benz engines giving it an overall capacity of around 7,500 hp and developing an outstanding top speed of 48 knots.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;3 Type IX U-Boats&#10;2 S-100 S-Boat Sections&#10;2 R-Boat Sections&#10;Ship Cards&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

So, Spin away and Wu Xing!&#10;&#10;Xing is a game of strategy and balance where players are the masters of a single element. They must use the language of the universe - Math - to tactically position their elements in a sequence and gain victory over others. Spin, pick a card and solve the question to find your position(s) on the board. Place your element token using strategy and planning. Master basic concepts of factors and multiples and gain critical thinking skills in this epic battle of minds!&#10;&#10;In Xing, players master the laws of nature by controlling the elements - Huo, Shui and Tu. Each player picks one element and collects 14 tokens of that element. The game board and action spinner are placed in the centre.&#10;Shuffle the fuse and atomise card decks separately and place them beside the game board. &#10;On your turn, spin the action spinner.&#10;If you get Fuse, pick the top card from the fuse deck. &#10;If you get Atomise pick the top card from the atomise deck and,&#10;If you get Pick Any, pick the top card from any deck.&#10;After you pick a card, read what is said and solve it. then choose where you want to place one of your element tokens &#10;For example, if the card reads, &lsquo;multiple of 4 between 35 to 55&rsquo;, then you can place your token on 36, 40, 44 or 48.&#10;&#10;Remember, you can place only one of your element tokens per turn&#10;You must place the element based on the solution of the card you picked.&#10;If the card has more than one solution, pick one of them and place your token there&#10;If a location already has a token then you cannot place another&#10;If you cannot place your token on the game board, you pass your turn&#10;&#10;In each deck, there are 2 Wu (the spiral symbol) cards and 2 remove cards. These are special cards. &#10;The Wu card allows you to place one token on the wu symbol on the board. The &lsquo;remove&rsquo; card allows you to remove one token of an opponent from the board. when a token is removed it goes back to that player. Once all your element tokens have been used, then you can move them around on the board. just take it from one spot and place it on another, as per the card you pick. Remember, you can place an element token to create your sequence or block an opponent. choose your strategy! The first player to create a line of five of their own element tokens, wins the game. This could be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Xing can also be played with 6 players split into 3 teams of 2.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But beware, perils lie everywhere. Anyone can enter but only a few can escape&hellip;&#10;&#10;Trailblazers is an exciting memory drawing game that your family will not get enough of. The goal is simple: see a map, spot the treasures and obstacles, remember them and then draw your own way out of it using memory and some basic rules. Then, spin away and maximise your points! Sounds simple but is a laughing riot when opponents take a wrong turn. &#10;Enjoy as your kids use principles of geometry, memory and strategy to draw their way through various adventure worlds. See them master basic concepts of lines and angles, decision making and motor skills right before your eyes!&#10;&#10;In Trail Blazers, players travel through four different adventures, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. The goal is to draw your way out of each maze in the adventure region. Everybody starts with a Path Map, and a sketch pen. Place the adventure book in the centre. Choose an adventure region, and start with Maze 1. Cover the maze with the Spin-A-Round spinner. Keep your sand timer ready.&#10;VIEWING ROUND (30 secs) - When the timer begins, all players must visualise and remember a path in the maze from Start to Finish. &#10;During this time, players are not allowed to draw anything. All pens must be down!&#10;At the end of 30 seconds, the maze is covered again with the Spin-A-Round spinner.&#10;DRAWING ROUND (60 secs) - All players draw their paths on their Path Maps from Start to Finish. They must try to score maximum points by collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. All players must enter with a Ray at the Start point and exit with a Ray at the Finish point. You can enter or exit horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. All paths must be individual line segments, connecting the dots on the path maps from Start to Finish. All paths must be horizontal or vertical and not diagonal. At the end of the drawing round, each player counts their score by placing their path map on the maze in the adventure book. Each coin you collect in your path, you get the points mentioned on it. Each obstacle you hit, you lose points as mentioned on the left hand pages. Add all points for the coins collected, subtract all points for the obstacles hit, add 2 points for entering with a ray at the correct Start point and add 2 points for exiting with a ray at the correct Finish point. This is your score for the drawing round. &#10;SPINNING ROUND - The player with the highest score for this maze, spins the spinner. Now, choose either your entry or exit Ray as the reference Ray. If you get a Parallel, then you count all lines parallel to the reference Ray. If you get a Perpendicular, then you count all lines perpendicular to the reference Ray. Then you multiply the number above by either x1 or x2 as per what they have spun. This is your score for the spinning round. &#10;Add the scores of the Drawing and Spinning round as the final score for maze 1. Repeat  the same for Mazes 2 and 3 in the adventure region. The person with the highest total of all three mazes, wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Oliva and her husband Paul are visiting a newly acquired mine late one day when they are attacked by a deranged man who is slobbering and incoherent. Paul is killed in the ensuing fight. Oliva escapes to a nearby Saloon. There she runs into a group of people who have no idea what&rsquo;s going on, except that they heard the dead have risen and are attacking the living. However, a telegram arrived earlier in the day saying a posse is on the way to help rescue survivors but the bad news they won't arrive till morning as they are going town to town to find survivors. All they have to do is survive the night! &#10;It won&rsquo;t be easy as this is the One Night in Dead West...&#10;&#10;You and a group of survivors are held up at a Saloon. The zombies will spawn at the tip of each hour on the game track at random locations determined by 6x D10s. If the zombies are already on the map before spawning new ones, you would check if they break any Barricades, enter the saloon, Move, or attack any players.&#10;&#10;Then all the player characters will take their turns in any order they want. They can take a 30-minute action or an hour as long as they haven't taken a 30-minute action already during that hour. Once they are they decide which duration they want to take they move their player pawn on the time track and can only take another 30 minutes or another turn once all the players passed or are on the same space as their pawn.&#10;&#10;During a turn, they can choose Rest, Barricade, search for items (if available), or fight zombies. Fighting and barricading costs energy while resting and search requires the player to draw events.&#10;&#10;If you survive till 8 am the next day the Posse arrives to whip out the remaining zombies and you must figure out if they mistaken you for a zombie or not based on how many hit points you have left and roll of a D16.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can win by finding the key to the bar with the wagon and successfully remove the nitroglycerine from it or it could be game over early.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Forces of History is a game that simulates world history, using an original combination of game mechanics inspired by games as diverse as Terraforming Mars, Twilight Struggle, Innovation, and Reiner Knizia's Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation. Instead of controlling a particular historical leader or empire, players take on the roles of celestial beings who are pulling the strings of history from behind the curtains. The celestials must help each other to make the divine plan for the world unfold, but beneath the thin veneer of cooperation there is fierce rivalry... for the Lord of Time, as ancient as creation itself, will give a rich reward to the celestial who shows the most skill at influencing world events. This is why all actions in the game&mdash;recruiting agents, collecting coins, claiming forces, playing cards and more&mdash;are ultimately aimed at just one thing: to gain as many Influence Points (IP) as possible. At the end of the game, the player with the most IP wins.&#10;&#10;Forces of History is a complex strategy game that combines the best of several different worlds. It simulates world history, yet every playthrough is different from the one before; it offers rich historical lore to the hobby-historian, but you don't need to know or care about history to play it.&#10;&#10;The game offers several different game variants: Classical-Medieval Age game (standard), Classical Age game, Medieval Age game, and team play (2v2) in any of the above settings. The playing time can vary from 2 hours up to 6-7 hours, depending on the variant chosen (and on player familiarity). NOTE: The Modern Age is not yet available, but if the game is released and becomes as successful as we hope, it will be released in the upcoming expansion.&#10;&#10;This is a game that doesn't easily fit into any established category.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is set a long time in the future, in a galaxy far nearer than you would have expected. Mankind has been forced into an uncivilised part of space due to its own self destruction. Earth has become overcrowded, and the poor are being shipped to the far reaches of space, so that the rich can live in luxury. Despite all the odds, the earthlings have managed to tame the once destructive alien nations bringing order to the galaxy. The United Federation of Planets now resides over the squabbling factions, and with the introduction of a unified currency it has made trading agreements for the first time in centuries possible. The continual mission for peace throughout the galaxy has yet to be established, but the humans are determined to one day make it happen.&#10;&#10;You are a fourth generation migrant with an overwhelming urge to Return to Earth. They say it can&rsquo;t be done, and once deported there is no going back. However, the stories of the home-world have always kept you interested, and you have never been one to follow protocol. You have worked your way up from a gutter thief, to the Captain of a star ship, and are just the right kind of upstart to stick it to the man.&#10;&#10;On your last mission, you traded several tons of raw plasma for information about the &ldquo;Returner&rdquo;; a guy living in a star system at the edge of the galaxy. For a small fortune he will arrange a new identity, and a shuttle back to the home-world. You&rsquo;re broke after the deal for his whereabouts, but this won&rsquo;t stop you. Your goal is to fill your boots with a bucket load of cash, and pay this guy a visit. He is your only hope to Return to Earth...&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The main part of the game board represents the galaxy and is made up of 10 systems, and each is divided into 11 sectors. The systems each have a core at their centre, and this is where random planets and stars are placed at the start of a game. The core of a system is where planets and major stars have formed over thousands of years.&#10;&#10;At two centre points of the galaxy, where six systems have collided, they have crushed the cores to create asteroid belts. They are dangerous and time consuming to navigate.&#10;&#10;In all but one system there is a sector that has a resource that can be mined, or collected by ships. The resources can be traded at any of the six inhabited planets found in the galaxy. They all have a space station where trade goods are imported and exported (by the players). Cargo purchased, ships are upgraded, and fuel and shields are replenished. They are also great places to board passengers (or fugitives), hire crew and find work. Entering a planetary core allows a ship to use its facilities, but docking fees and trips between them is costly, so players must plan their routes carefully and wisely.&#10;&#10;Using the star ship (player mat), captains can trade and perform missions to earn the cash they need to return to earth. The missions involve dangerous jobs (legal or illegal), passenger transports (or fugitive smuggling), running cargo (or smuggling), and how a player behaves in the game can seriously dictate how they will be treated when they visit the space ports, or if they are approached by NPC ships.&#10;&#10;At the start of a game each player begins with just enough to get them off the starting blocks, but they must expand their ship and crew quickly or fall prey to being picked off by space pirates or the other players. Adding tech to a ship helps them in tricky situations, whilst adding crew will aid them with their skills. The downside with crew is they need to be paid for each space run they are aboard, but they are much cheaper than having tech installed.&#10;&#10;Games are timed and will come to an end when the time marker hits the end space, but a player can beat the clock and score victory, if they can win at one of six challenges determined at the start of a game.  They range from earning a fixed number of dollars (enough to return to earth), being first to have a certain class of star ship, being first to complete a set number of missions, or a set number of rounds, or being first to earn enough fame or piracy.&#10;&#10;As the game time slowly ticks away the galaxy is evolving and global events come in and out of play, making the game sometimes more challenging, but also adding an element of luck, something each and every player will need to survive in the alien galaxy and return to earth.&#10;&#10;Available from The Game Crafter&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Althingi is a quick set-up, fast-play game of strength and influence for 2-4 players based in Viking-Age Iceland. Each player takes on the role of a powerful Chieftain and tries to take control of the annual gathering known as the Althingi through good old-fashioned bribery, coercion, and intimidation.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over a series of days each with three rounds: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. In the morning Chieftains gather Loot which has value both in bribing Vikings and in equipping them for holmgang (a duel). In the afternoon phase Chieftains strategically bribe the new Vikings that arrive that round to join their camp using their Loot cards while retaining enough resources to defend themselves in the Evening phase. During the Evening, Chieftains can use Vikings in their camp to challenge holmgang (a duel) against Vikings from other camps. The aim of the game is to gain the most influence, which is acquired by having Vikings join your camp and by winning holmgangs (duels). The player with the most influence at the end of the game controls the Althingi and wins!&#10;&#10;The aesthetic of this game is gritty and raw, with striking original illustrations by Lada Shustova. Special attention was paid to historical details such as clothing, weapons, and bartering goods, so rest assured that there are no horned helmets in this game! If you&rsquo;ve visited Iceland, then you&rsquo;ll recognize the landscape art as the fields of Thingvellir. And Viking history buffs might recognize the meaning of the two runes used in the game, symbols for Strength and for Influence.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Hoping to take advantage of these rumors and boost its image, your city is planning a contest: build a flying machine, and find someone foolish enough to fly it.&#10;&#10;Now, you know a publicity stunt when you hear one, but the idea has intrigued you.  You may be a humble farmer, but you have assets that others may not- a working knowledge of mechanics, determination, a hard work ethic, and&hellip; animals.  Lots of animals.  A grin slowly spreads on your face. &ldquo;When pigs shall fly, they say,&rdquo; you mutter to yourself. &ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s take to the skies!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;When Pigs Shall Fly is a family weight dice-drafting game in which players prepare for the city&rsquo;s flight contest by researching the importance of the various theories of flight, designing a flying craft, training a pig to pilot their craft, and improving their craft&rsquo;s materials to make it as light as possible.  Along the way, they must also try to generate publicity and utilize the other farm animals to help them in their quest for aviation greatness.  When the big day arrives, players will have a chance to see the fruits of their labor by flying their craft in the contest, and hopefully, become locally known as the farmer with their head in the clouds!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Without the public's knowledge, the United States is just months from this becoming a reality.&#10;     &#10;In Los Alamos, an extensive, embedded network of spies have been biding their time, waiting for the right moment to carry out their orders to steal the top secret information.

Can you steal all of the documents and get out of Los Alamos before getting caught?&#10;&#10;The Los Alamos Conspiracy is a tile laying game where you are trying to match certain tile patterns to &quot;steal&quot; files. With each turn you will place a tile and flip a tile (representing the Military Police). If you can exhaust the entire stack of tiles with all four resources, you win! If the Military Police catch up with you or you cannot get out of town with all four files, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
