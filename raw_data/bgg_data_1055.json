Expand your city, recruit characters, rise in economic power and complete quests to gain prestige and increase your influence. In the end only the first to finish a wonder through prestige alone is the winner. Will that be you?&#10;&#10;In Imnia you take the role of a medieval lord who, in pursuit of power and glory, seeks to prove himself as a great ruler. To do this and be the first to finish building a wonder in your town you will expand your city by constructing new buildings, from basic ones, to advanced and unique, craft items which you will use to recruit characters, engage in land and sea trade to bring in wealth and exotic resources and finally fulfil quests. Through all of these you will first have to raise your influence to the highest level, 7, and finally transform your influence into coat-of-arms tokens to build a wonder and win.&#10;&#10;Imnia is at it's core a race to the finish embedded within a thematic economical strategy game. Each player builds through resource management and card drafting a unique asymmetrical tableau in his player area, representing the buildings and recruited characters in his town. Each such unique tableau gives players asymmetrical powers activated with a custom worker placement mechanic.&#10;&#10;",

Play them at the beginning of your turn to throw off your opponents and get an advantage over the gameplay.&#10;&#10;The design of the cards is slick, with hand-drawn icons on each card.

    "Description": "Summary:&#10;In Contract Conquest, you take the role of a wealthy real estate mogul who has decided to build a tower. Unfortunately for you, you are not the only one building towers, and other real estate moguls will do everything in their power to stop you. Can you battle the odds, the elements, and worst of all, the other players to come out on top with the tallest tower?&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;Contract Conquest is a card based tower building game for 2 or more players which can take as little as 30 minutes and can be expanded on to increase the play time up to 2 hours.  Players take turns building rooms in their tower, while playing cards to decimate their opponent's tower and improve their own. All players have to watch out for the disaster cards which can be devastating to all players.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;Be the player with the most Construction Points (CP) when any player completes the top floor of their tower.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Treadheads is a new and unique game system that covers Second World War and future combined-arms tactical combat. TH will integrate armor, infantry, artillery and air support for miniatures and hex-based board gaming. The unit level is individual vehicles &amp; aircraft with squads &amp; teams for infantry. Each player will command up to a reinforced combined arms company, confronting the same challenges and fortunes of war as real tank commanders and infantry squad leaders in combat with the enemy.&#10;&#10;They will advance to contact, identify and react to threats, engage targets, and then adapt their own battle plans as necessary. TH encourages the use the tactics and strategies, including those taken directly from the real manuals, and features weapons platforms that perform with a high degree of detail &amp; accuracy.&#10;&#10;What sets this game apart from other games at this scale &amp; subject? Treadheads centers around the concept of &ldquo;Time in Action&rdquo; as a way to simulate the interactive and simultaneous actions of units in a historical 1:1 engagement. This timing synchronizes movement and firing commands and eliminates additional rules and traditional Sequence of Play for initiative determination, orders phase, opportunity fire and over-watch, while allowing simultaneous movement &amp; target engagement.&#10;&#10;TH and the OODA Decision Loop: The principle of the Decision Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) was developed by USAF Colonel John Boyd. By mastering this process and getting &quot;inside&quot; the cycle, disrupting an opponent's thinking processes, and forcing him to commit to a plan before he's ready, this offers opportunities and pressures for him to make mistakes. That timing aspect of acting before your opponent is what allows you to seize the initiative and exploit it.&#10;&#10;",

Neither the wendigo nor the Silent One wanted this symbiotic relationship, but Fate is rarely inclined to offer a true choice. As time has moved on, they have developed a respect for each other, moving from animosity to the kinship of pack siblings.&#10;&#10;They no longer interact much with the Cult, preferring their own company. While they answer to Rasputina, it is a strained relationship compared to the rest of the Silent Ones. Storm's nature has driven Snow more towards independence, and she is more willful as a result. For now, the two are joined with the Cult's cause.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

He devoured books on the arcane and soon proved to be a powerful user of magic in his own right, but his peaceful life of learning came to a violent halt the day that the Guild arrested his master for undermining their authority. Sandeep took up his Master&rsquo;s cursed Gada that day and unleashed the fury of Banasuva for the first time.&#10;&#10;Sandeep was personally asked to come to Malifaux by Viktor Ramos in order to help train a new generation of Arcanists in the ways of magic. He holds his classes in secret, instilling in his students a respect for the arcane which he wishes he had on that fateful day back in India. He is an excellent teacher, and Ramos has been pleased with the progress of his students.&#10;&#10;The locations of his classes frequently move, staying one step ahead of the Guild. In quiet moments of reflection and meditation, Sandeep often regrets the need for violence and wishes for a peaceful, quiet environment where his students could grow and prosper. He knows the tyranny and cruelty of the Guild all too well, and constant vigilance prevents him from dwelling on his own dark past.&#10;&#10;Sandeep&rsquo;s box set contains six models, including Sandeep himself. Kudra, Sandeep&rsquo;s loyal student, is his right-hand-woman, and she defends her teacher with arcane skill and physical prowess. Sandeep can summon his Totem, Banasuva, to present a large, flaming threat for his opponent. Finally, the Poison Gamin are versatile Minions which Sandeep is also capable of summoning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each night, you venture out to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; items to make your tiny house bigger, better and nicer to live in. But beware of fellow tiny people, who are also trying to furnish their homes, and won&rsquo;t hesitate to scuffle with you for the items they want.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s more, you have to look out for the cat, the ferocious pet of the humans, whose keen senses know when there&rsquo;s a scuffle among the tiny people. Avoid the cat at all costs, or you&rsquo;ll be cat food. Survive the scuffles and the feline wrath, and you&rsquo;ll return with the materials to decorate your home. You can even assemble borrowed items to create more elaborate furniture. If you accomplish your goals for a dream home, you&rsquo;ll be the envy of all tiny people.&#10;&#10;This is a card-based game where 3-5 players start of with just a an empty room card. Their ideal dream home is dictated by goal cards drawn at the start of each game. Each turn, item cards are presented and all players simultaneously place their meeples on the items they want to grab. If two or more players go after the same item card, a scuffle breaks out. Scuffles are resolved with dice rolls but if the difference exceeds two, the cat will hear and disrupt the scuffle. Everyone flees and no one gets the item.&#10;&#10;Players decorate their room card with the item cards. There are also Assembly cards where players are required to get two or more specified item cards to build into the Assembly. Assemblies score more and give action bonuses.

The cat who can successfully complete this task first will forever go down in history as the cat who discovered gravity!&#10;The idea of the game is to collect 6 or more science points to be deemed the &quot;Greatest Science Cat of All Time!&quot; In order to conduct an experiment, you must knock a card off of the table using your Scientific Method. You then apply the rule on the card to the game and MUST follow it to the best of your ability. If you fail to follow a rule in play and another player calls you out on it, you must return a card back into the pile.

    "Description": "EGYPT, 1942... After defeat at the Battle of Gazala, the British 8th Army has been chased back through the western deserts, fighting a rearguard action to hold the line near a railway halt called El Alamein.  Here, the tide of the desert war would turn decisively in the British&rsquo;s favour. At El Alamein Rommel&rsquo;s weary army was repeatedly defeated and forced into a very long retreat to save itself. Meanwhile, American and British troops land on the shores of Morocco and Algeria in Operation Torch, with the plan to cut-off the Germans by capturing Tunisia. A hard seven-month campaign would follow in the final struggle to capture North Africa.&#10;&#10;&bull; BACKGROUND A general overview of the later North Africa campaign, from Gazala, through three battles at El Alamein to Operation Torch and the Allies&rsquo; attack into Tunisia. With British, American and French forces of 1st Army in the north and 8th Army pursuing Rommel&rsquo;s Panzer Armee Afrika to the Mareth Line, and then beyond, in the south. This book covers the desert fighting from May 1942 to May 1943 and the Axis&rsquo; ultimate surrender in Tunisia.&#10;&#10;&bull; ARMY LISTS Nine army lists designed to be played with the character of the principal combatants for North Africa: the veteran Deutsche Afrikakorps for 1942 and Defenders of Tunisia for 1943, Italian armoured and infantry divisions to face British (and Commonwealth) armoured and infantry divisions. Also, for Tunisia, the first combat operations for the US 1st Armoured Division and US infantry divisions, as well as ex-Vichy French &lsquo;March&rsquo; divisions, now turned against their former Axis allies.&#10;&#10;&bull; SPECIAL RULES New special rules to adapt the core Battlegroup rules to the later North African battlefields. Recreating the character of desert fighting, with its dusty conditions, reliance on tank warfare and mobile formations, and the wearing effects of the harsh conditions. Also rules for the colder, muddy, difficult hill-country of northern Tunisia, a very different type of battlefield, all helping to create games with the distinctive feel for the end of the &lsquo;desert&rsquo; war.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Like streaming music and films for endless entertainment, you can now choose from a growing number of games in the Multi Game System. Each component in this compact system is carefully crafted to play in a wide variety of games, at home or away.&#10;&#10;For centuries, playing cards have been used, to play many popular games. Today, quality wood, bronze or printed chip components are used interchangeably to play lots of games. The main components are square tiles, with colors and symbols on both sides. You can play more games, with more players, when you possess more tiles.&#10;&#10;When Multi Game System books are released, you can extend your game collection. When new Multi Game System books are released you can expand your game collection. The style or type of games is growing and many games get updated with alternative play or expansions. They are created by casual and prolific designers from the USA, UK and Germany, plus a few classics designed in Ancient Egypt or the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;Build up your game library, step by step, with additional components designed for play with upcoming books. Keep your home clean and the environment green, with these compact and enduring pieces.&#10;&#10;The games take you back to the lives of warriors, fishermen and other heroes of the Ancient World. They are easy to learn in a few minutes and can be played in 10 to 30 minutes or more These social abstract games, encourage players to interact in widely differing ways, from fear-driven collaboration, collusion, trickery and bluffing and deceit, and of course, competition. Enjoy adventure in the Ancient World and create your own story.&#10;&#10;Chess, Latrunculi, and traditional Seega are strategic battles between two minds with nothing is left to chance and everything is open in plain sight on the battle field. The greatest mind will prevail through skillful use of his forces. Words are not spoken and only detract from victory. The real world has chance and luck, secrecy and concealment which makes Journey Stones and King&rsquo;s Ransom so much fun. More than two are usually involved in real life, so most of the social abstract games allow four or more to play. The rich relationships between many players, with shifting allegiances or when facing a common challenge are memorable. In set to play for Stella, Inuit, ILIOS or Assyrians, &ldquo;may keep them hidden from other players&rdquo;, means you may work together with some players and show your tiles, build trust and enhance cooperation! It&rsquo;s not enough to use your strategic skill and not open your mouth! Assyrians and Dream Lands rely solely on persuasion and verbal skills.&#10;&#10;As you see how the components are used, you may be inspired to add to the library and create your own games, limited only by your creativity.&#10;&#10;The tiles can be put together in different combinations to give the components needed to play these 25 games.&#10;&#10;MGS&#10;&#10;Ziggurats                                    &#10;Journey Stones&#10;Rays&#10;Silk Roads&#10;Numidia                                    &#10;Melos&#10;Latrunculi                                  &#10;Seega&#10;Kush                                        &#10;Stella&#10;Cheetah                                     &#10;King's Ransom&#10;Inuit&#10;&#10;PREMIUM MGS&#10;&#10;Tekel&#10;Tholos                                      &#10;Capere&#10;Agros&#10;&#10;DELUXE MGS&#10;&#10;Lost&#10;Floodwaters&#10;Assyrians&#10;Dark Death&#10;ILIOS                                       &#10;Raetia&#10;&#10;SUPER DELUXE MGS&#10;&#10;Dream Lands&#10;Summons&#10;&#10;Some of the games such a Kush and Tholos are available in the system with the enhancements and expansions. Some of the classic public domain games such as Seega &amp; Latrunculi have been updated or expanded for today's players. In the same way, we show you how to play (and even improve) the modern card game King&rsquo;s Ransom with the MGS tiles.&#10;&#10;It is a GAME DESIGN KIT with many styles of tiles, dice and disks for you to expand, design and develop your own games. Dream Lands is more interesting with these extra tiles and Assyrians can now be played with up to 20 players! We are designing new games and expansions which use the designer kit tiles. Take a look at how the components have been used in the 26 games and you will be inspired to design yourself.&#10;&#10;You will be surprised how well the components allow you to play so many dice, card, or tile games. Checkers a simple game with the rules readily available online, and even Chess can be played with the MGS tiles. As you successfully implement more complicated games your confidence and ambition will grow.&#10;&#10;The tiles can be put together in different combinations to give the components needed to play your own game designs. Game designers should get this kit and test their own games. We are open to publish your game in the next rule books, if it uses these components.&#10;&#10;Versions &amp; Extras:&#10;&#10;MGS&#10;&#10;4 Player 14 Games       80 Square Tiles    Sets A &amp; B&#10;&#10;PREMIUM MGS&#10;&#10;4 Player 18 Games      120 Square Tiles    Sets A, B &amp; C&#10;&#10;DELUXE MGS&#10;&#10;5 Player 24 Games      160 Squarer Tiles   Sets A, B, C &amp; D&#10;&#10;SUPER DELUXE MGS&#10;&#10;6 Player 26 Games       40 Square Tiles    Sets A, B, C, D &amp; E&#10;&#10;GAME DESIGNER KIT GDK   40 Square Tiles    Expansion Set F&#10;&#10;TREASURE CHEST&#10;&#10;8 x 8 Board &amp; Storage&#10;&#10;CHESSMEN&#10;&#10;16 Black &amp; 16 White Wood Chess Pieces&#10;&#10;ILIOS &amp; Capere are also available from Playford Games as standalone games.

Either a base set with set A &amp; B or deluxe set with A,B, C &amp; D. These allow players to experience the system at a lower cost.&#10;&#10;",

The central sector of the NATO front here was held by the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) supported by West German forces.  The terrain along the frontier with East Germany was dominated by the Luneberg Heath, an area marked by swamps, rivers and forested terrain that favored the defenders. Once through here, however, the terrain opened up to flat land that stretched to the Dutch and Belgian borders. A breakthrough here by the Communist forces would also certainly lead to a collapse of any NATO defense of West Germany, and a likely defeat by the forces of the Free World.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

From every town in the land the call goes out for heroes to take up the quest for the Five Weapons of Power. Ancient artifacts of immense power capable of giving their wielder the power to be...king! You must heed this call but your quest will not be easy. You must leave your home with only a small supply of modest provisions and brave the Overland's dangers as you seek news and information of the Five Weapons of Power.

    "Description": "There was a moment when the proud Japanese, who had been humiliated and treated like second-class citizens by the StateEmpire for far too long, rose up against their oppressors and claimed their freedom. The Japanese Uprising was a brief but terribly intense and savage conflict for which the Japanese paid a high price in blood for their victory but finally managed to tear away from Yu Jing. After the Uprising, the Japanese Secessionist Army, or JSA, has been reformulated based on the figure of the servo-powered samurais, as natural leaders both in spirit and in combat. However, the JSA maintains its nature of being primarily an assault force, because the Bushido doctrine requires no less.&#10;&#10;A box with 9 new and incredible miniatures belonging to JSA, a Japan completely independent of Yu Jing, part of the Non-Aligned Armies (NA2). It includes an introductory manual, scenery, dice... everything you need to start with Infinity or expand your collection!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A bloody war between two mighty kingdoms has reached an impasse. Each ruler now turns to the northern tribes in an attempt to form an alliance, and turn the tides. Will you be able to capture the favor of the Four Tribes?&#10;&#10;In Four Tribes, you and one other player will be placing cards, according to the rules, to either side of a row of six village cards. Most of these cards you are placing represent provisions that each village is lacking. Your goal is to appease the elder of each village more than your opponent by giving them higher ranked goods.&#10;&#10;In addition to provisions, there are a host of special cards that you may employ that might be defensive in nature, or be a devastating blow to your opponent. Hand-management and timing is the key!&#10;&#10;Four Tribes is a game of strategy and tactics that is balanced with a bit of luck. Each player draws from their own deck of cards, but each player has the same deck, so while you may draw on the weak-side early on, you will know that powerful cards are coming up that you can capitalize on.&#10;&#10;Four Tribes can be setup, played, and put away in about 30 minutes, making it a great lunchtime or filler game. I specifically designed this game to be a game that I can play with my wife and since then have heard from dozens of couples who play Four Tribes regularly.&#10;&#10;This newest edition takes everything that was loved about the original version, that was very successful on KickStarter, and boils it down and redevelops it into something that feels much like the original, but is new at the same time.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;28 Card Orange Army Deck 28 Card Purple Army Deck 6 Double-sided Standard Village Cards 6 Double-sided Winter Village Cards 6 Fire Expansion Cards 6 Flood Expansion Cards 3 Longhouse Cards 1 Blizzard Token 12 Village Elder Pawns 42 Wooden Houses (10 each of Blue, Green, Red, &amp; Yellow, and 2 Black) 1 drawstring bag Instruction Booklet&#10;&#10;",

All in all, a self-respecting Swedish games publisher needed a financial game.&#10;&#10;Koncern is the usual Monopoly-like game were players move around by dice rolls and buys and sells stocks and bonds etc. The publishing year is an estimate made on company historic grounds (the companies that features in the game, that is).&#10;&#10;An interesting feature is that the companies in this game were to an high degree part of the Handelsbanken sphere of influence, while competitor Lemeco's contemporary game Kapital connected to the sphere of S-E-Banken.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Saxtorpsloppet (&quot;The Saxtorp Race&quot;) is a motorcycle racing and betting game from Swedish publisher Alga. It is one of Alga's first games ever.&#10;&#10;It has an unusual mechanic since one person handles all six motorcycles and an infinite number of participants can take part and place bets. (It is also possible to be only sex players, each with one motorcycle and in that case it is a normal racing game.)&#10;&#10;The game consists of six small wooden motorcycles (with drivers), each mounted on a small sheet of carton, some playing card-size pieces to lay out as the track, and the rules. The track pieces have numbers on both sides, 1 to 6 in different random orders.&#10;&#10;When playing the track pieces is laid out in a straight fashion in a random order (which makes the number of possible tracks very high) and one playing piece (motorcycle) is choosen to start. That piece will, when placed on the side of the first track piece, point towards one of the sex numbers (digits) and that motorcycle is then moved along the first. Now the second motorcycle will point towards a number, and so a third motorcycle is moved forward (pointing to a number). And so it goes on.&#10;&#10;Eventually one of the already moved motorcycles will be moved a track piece ahead and point to another number on that track piece. In a few moves' time all six motorcycles will be engaged in the race, &quot;promoting&quot; another (or ocassionally itself) to further pieces on the track. Winner is the playing piece (motorcycle) that reaches the last track piece first. The track pieces are double-sided so the race takes place along 24 track sections.&#10;&#10;",

You can cross through the two corpse-filled and rat-infested Deep Realms by means of a perilous bridge or venture even deeper into an ancient system of tunnels inhabited by rats, feral pets, and much worse monsters. In the gloomy and perilous Deep Realms you will certainly encounter tremendous danger, but you may also find tantalizing wealth &mdash; or even a Talisman.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mini-expansion consisting of an additional face card, the Outlaw, an Outlaw meeple, and four new, optional Joker cards.&#10;&#10;As face cards, Outlaws rank above 10 and below Jack.  When an Outlaw is played while Prospecting, players place the Outlaw meeple on any tile or, if already in play, move the Outlaw to a new tile. At game end, the tile containing the Outlaw meeple scores only half its value in gold.&#10;&#10;Each Outlaw card features an illustration based on historic outlaws of the California Gold Rush, chosen by backers of the Kickstarter Project.  These include: Joaquin Murrieta, Eleanor Dumont, Black Bart, and Jack Powers.  Illustrations for the Jokers were likewise selected by backers and include depictions of a card shark and a town drunk.&#10;&#10;The mini expansion is packaged separately from the base game and will be available to non-Kickstarter backers.&#10;&#10;",
