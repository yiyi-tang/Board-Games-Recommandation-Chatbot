On the game's record, the beginning of the narration is the same in all tracks, and just the result of the sprint changes. Each side has 10 different tracks with every cyclist having its chance to win, naturally.

A short game, not only for the break between two lectures. Printed on ecological hemp cloth. Unusually packed in a silver aluminum cylinder. Limited Edition.&#10;   &#10;The special reason for using hemp cloth for the board was a word joke (hemp = Hanf in German): Hanfried == Han(f)fried == Hanf-Fried. The price of the game was exactly 15.58 Euro, motivated by the year 1558 when Jena University was founded.&#10; Information from the designer: I realized one very personal copy with wooden board (instead of hemp cloth) where the (neutral) Hanfried piece is a real silver coin. Two pictures of this item are found in the picture gallery.&#10;&#10;",

In funny small dialog , which originate partially from the feather/spring from Bully Herbig, a search term is replaced in the text by the word &ldquo;Bully&rdquo;. While a player reads out the texts, the others must try to guess the term. This guessing takes place into four steps, trying to encircle the term a bit in each round. Amazing what (wrong) associations some first references may lead to.&#10;While this first part of the game is strictly played in sequence, as soon as someone says the correct answer the game changes into chaotic action.&#10;The so-called riddle master must try to catch with a cup the figures of the others, which stand in the center of the game board. They try to pull fast enough the cord and thus theirs figures of the board, otherwise point loss.&#10;This odd mixture of knowledge and dexterity, has even something from the parodic humor of the Bully films.&#10;Two long-proved mechanisms are connected here in new and unusual way to an entertaining game.&#10;&#10;",

After more than a decade of employment in different companies and industries, different departments and sectors of the businesses, from agriculture to software production, I realized that at the end of the day, one common factor was evident; the desire for career advancement and the fruits and privileges that accompanied the advancement.   To me, everything seemed to revolve around this common factor, Advancement; the economy, lifestyle and life in general all seemed to be a game where the rules were already written and I had to follow them.&#10;&#10;With this understanding in mind, I embarked on the arduous task of arranging it all on paper and it wasn&rsquo;t long before I had a complete and playable game.  The circular design of the game was chosen to emphasize the revolving aspect of the game.  I had four gas stations to remind us of both the need for gas and the high gas prices.  I included childcare; a common denominator in our families and most other successful and complete families.  Since we all have to pay taxes, I included a slot for the IRS on the game.  It was abundantly clear that since I got paid once every pay period, then one complete revolution around the board was equivalent to one complete pay period.  Domestic utilities were also included in the game for this was an everyday necessity.&#10;&#10;There were several things I could have included in the game such as food and health insurance but I ran out of room.  However, I did include vacation, a common phenomenon at work, whether earned or incidental such as sick time or penalty (suspensions).  The Superior Court was included to provide a platform for one to forward his/ her grievances and concerns and to provide a platform for one to mount their best defense whenever the circumstance arose.&#10;&#10;For disciplinary purpose and as an instrument of the constant penalty awaiting the lawbreakers, I included the jail slot on the game.  I also included the INS slot on the game due to the fact that there are numerous undocumented immigrants who masquerade as legal entities hence the need for consistently proving ones eligibility for employment.  As much as I despise paying the high insurance premiums, the state law requires that we maintain auto insurance at all times.  In an effort to keep the game fun and entertaining, I included the mailbox and email as tools to deliver messages, promotions, bonus, and even penalties.&#10;&#10;The eight departments, Shipping and Receiving, Production, Assembly, Customer Service, Packaging, Maintenance, Quality Assurance and Management were chosen because I had personal experience in them and I felt that they were crucial to any manufacturing enterprise.  Other departments such as accounting, advertising and marketing though important to a company were not included because I figured that some companies were able to operate profitably by either doubling or outsourcing these departments.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Column Line And Square (CLS) is a game of war set in the period of Napoleon (1808-1815). It was written by &quot;The 30mm Midwestern Napoleonic Wargamers Confederation.&quot; Most of the research and rule-writing was by Fred Vietmeyer, with additional input by Dave Mort and Hugh Reynolds.&#10;&#10;CLS-II (aka the second edition) was photocopied typed text, about 100 pages. In addition, and almost mandatory at our games, was the addendum, the &quot;3R&quot; (Reviewed Referee Rulings) which documented the 'official' resolution of most rules disputes. There were also 'Optional Rules', 'Potential, Optional Rules', and 'Local Optional Rules'. I've got two three-ring binders given over to the rules and add-ons (and I quit keeping the add-ons long before we broke up).&#10;&#10;CLS-III, also called The Battle Book, was a commercially available distillation of the above into about 100 pages. I can't remember who published it - it's out of print and unavailable. Fred still holds the copyright, but I doubt that it will ever see the light of day again.&#10;&#10;I played CLS for about 20 years, from the mid '60s to the mid '80s; we broke up as a group in 1987 or 1988.&#10;&#10;The rule set is a grand tactical set, using a 20 to 1 ratio (roughly) based on roster and unit strengths in the Spanish battles. The normal game was for 7 turns, using map marking and simultaneous movement. The typical command for a player would be a regiment of cavalry, two regiments of infantry, and a battery - about 220 to 280 castings. The basic map and maneuver units were the battalion and the squadron, with light infantry as an exception, run as either a formed battalion or as individual platoons of skirmishers (two, three, or four castings to the platoon, depending upon nationality).&#10;&#10;--description from http://theminiaturespage.com/rules/nap/cls.html&#10;&#10;",

In Word of Mouth, the fun has been enhanced as players must place their best on the one definition they feel fits the &quot;official&quot; definition.  The first player to fill his/her home base with betting chips wins, so that the name of the game is to come up with the most believable sounding definition, be it fact of fiction.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this game is that it isn't necessarily for high-brows.  If a player's vocabulary knowledge is shaky but his imagination and bluffing skills are tops, he could easily win the game by persuading the other players to pass their betting chips his way.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "These are a couple of games, made in Singapore, which come together in the same box. The objectives of these two games are to inculcate good social behaviors and habits.&#10;&#10;The eponymous Our Town Sparkles is a simple roll and move boardgame. The first player to get to the end of the track by exact count wins. The Social Responsibility Game has a circular track (in the sense that you go round and round the track) and players follow instructions on the board where their pieces land. There are Social Responsibility Quotient (SRQ) cards worth up to 20 SRQ points. Players can also earn and lose money depending on their social behavior. There are red penalty cards, drawn when a player lands on a 'Penalty Square', and green cards that a player picks up after landing on a 'Good Social Habit Square'. The game ends when a player runs out of money, or there are no more SRQ point cards. The player with the most SRQ points wins. A curious feature of the game is the role of Social Responsibility Judege (SRJ) - the SRJ administers all penalties, rewards or awards.&#10;&#10;Graphics and illustrations by Rolling Art Pte Ltd.&#10;The year of publication is based on a discount coupon (for Popular Bookstore) that came with the game and was valid only till October 2005.&#10;&#10;A version of this game, called Tampines Our Pride, combining the Social Responsibility Game and Tampines Our Pride Game (a roll-and-move game, like the Our Town Sparkles Game) was created for the Tampines Town Council. The differences are in the roll-and-move game (different track and events) and the Social Responsibility Game has some slightly different artwork - for example, there's a picture of the Tampines Changkat Community Club on the board. The board itself is made from cardboard and not as thick as the mounted board used in Our Town Sparkles.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On March 7th, 1945, the Americans captured one of the last standing across the mighty Rhine River in Germany. It was pure luck that the Germans had failed to blow the bridge up.&#10;&#10;Operation Loralie, the codeword to destroy this key crossing and been fumbled. Fumbled badly by the Germans. Confusion reigned on the German side and the Americans seized the bridge.&#10;&#10;Now, the battle began. Germany&rsquo;s &ldquo;wonder weapons&rdquo; were all directed at the bridge, from V-2 Rockets (which came close), jet bombers, massive Jagdtiger, Jagdpanther, Tiger II tanks and even SS Frogmen, all took their turn at sending the bridge to the bottom of the Rhine. The 9th, 11th and Lehr Panzer Divisions attempted to destroy the American bridgehead but were low of fuel.&#10;&#10;The game captures this pure luck situation, as at any moment, luck can change the course of the battle, as in real life! All the elements are present that were there in the battle. What might have happened had the bridge been destroyed after the Americans had crossed? or, had the German panzers been able to attack as a coherent force?&#10;&#10;The game uses a point to point movement system, easy to learn and hard to master. Daily turns, units range from company to battalions. The Americans must capture the bridge and cross to expand the bridgehead.&#10;&#10;",
