    "Description": "A simulation game created to demonstrate some key principles of supply chain management. It was made in the early 1960's by some professors at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&#10;&#10;The game is played by 4 to 8 people, who must cooperate despite limited information transfer.  Early versions (including the one pictured) used pieces on a board, later refined to paper spreadsheets and then computerized ones.  The target is to minimize total costs across the whole team, from factory to distributor to wholesaler to retailer.  (With more than 4 players, either multiple players can be assigned to each station or the game can shift to competition between multiple teams.)  Each day beer moves forward through the chain, paper order slips move backward, and shortages impose costs.  The order slips are the only data each stage has to work with -- no table talk!  End customer demand is simulated by a deck of cards, which can be stacked or randomized by the moderator to emulate different market conditions.&#10;&#10;The game runs for a specific number of day/rounds, initially 36 at MIT (but the moderator told the players it would be 50 to prevent horizon effects).  Invariably the limited information causes &quot;bullwhip effects&quot; that ripple down the chain, which is the main lesson the game teaches.&#10;&#10;",

After playing any card they can wrap one of their own films to stop people playing cards into it, including themselves.&#10;&#10;During the selling phase players take it in turns to roll for each of their wrapped films, trying to get under the cult value on a d6.

    "Description": "From the game's introduction:&#10;&#10;&quot;HP is a combination of rule changes, additions and army lists to allow the G&#195;&#165; P&#195;&#165; rules to be used for the first half of the 17th century. The focus is on the Thirty Years War, but it is certainly possible to use them for other conflicts as well. Examples of these include, but are not limited to: the English Civil War and the wars between Sweden and Poland. I have intentionally left the late 17th century out, as I feel this period is better covered by the standard rules.&#10;&#10;&quot;My ambition has been to include enough new/changed elements to produce the right &quot;period feel&quot;. The game should not feel like a WSS game with different figures. I have tried to do it as I haven&#226;&#128;&#159;t found a set of rules that deal with the 30YW in a way I like, and because I felt that G&aring; P&aring; actually could be used to cover the period - although with some changes needed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Because of this I have decided to change some of the unit type names, and create new ones as well. My hope is that this doesn&#226;&#128;&#159;t create too much confusion, but instead generates more period feel.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the 17th century units tended to use deeper formations. The musketeers had a slower rate of fire and the socket bayonet arrived only towards the end of the period. This means they will have to be protected by pike-armed friends to a much larger degree.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This auto racing simulation replay game comes with two versions, one for Indy Cars and one for NASCAR.  2009 edition comes with real-life drivers and stats based on 2008 season.  Game is available in print and play version and also via e-book.&#10;&#10;From the Downey Games website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Fast Lane Racing is the culmination of two years worth of design and testing.&#10;&#10;With Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve covered all of the bases.  Every element of open wheel racing is covered from qualifying right down to the checkered flag.&#10;&#10;In Fast Lane racing, drivers are rated separately for qualifying and racing, giving you an extremely accurate picture of each and every driver to get behind the wheel in the 2008 season.  To further enhance the realism, each driver is rated for the various track types run in the open wheel series.  Drivers are also rated for their ability to lead laps, how they perform during pit stops, and tendency to avoid mechanical failures.  You truly get an accurate representation of each driver.&#10;&#10;All tracks are individually rated as well.  Each track is rated for Pole Position Speed, number of caution flags, Racing Speed, and weather.&#10;&#10;Speaking of weather; how many times have you watched a race and heard the drivers and commentators talk about how the track has changed due to weather?  In Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve replicated this most important facet of racing.  You&rsquo;ll see the effects of a green track following heavy rains.  You&rsquo;ll see drivers run faster laps at Indianapolis as the track closes and the track cools.&#10;&#10;And speaking of Indianapolis, we have replicated EVERY facet of the unique qualifying format of the world&rsquo;s most famous race, right down to the bumping into the field!&#10;&#10;Fast Lane Racing is not a quick play game.  However, we&rsquo;ve compressed the racing into the most exciting elements, giving you a game that plays quickly.  With Fast Lane Racing, you&rsquo;ll be able to realistically complete an entire season.  A typical race and qualifying session takes approximately 40 to 60 minutes total.  If you use actual qualifiers and only run the races, you&rsquo;ll consistently finish within 20 minutes.  And while we have compressed the racing, we have not cut corners.  You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see&rdquo; every detail of the race unfold right on your tabletop!&#10;&#10;Each Fast Lane Racing Year Book contains everything you need to play.  There are no external &ldquo;game parts&rdquo; to buy.&#10;&#10;The printed games feature individual, die-cut driver and track cards, with everything packed in a sturdy game box.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is a 1937 Disney animated film based on &quot;Snow White,&quot; a German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. The film was Disney's first full-length animated feature film, and the first color, animated film in motion picture history. It consistently ranks among the greatest films of all time; in 2007 it ranked at #34 in a list of 100 and was the only animated film in the list. In 1989 the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; Like other Disney projects, spin-off marketing soon created related merchandise. Products introduced in 1937 included &quot;The Game of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; from Milton Bradley Company. A complicated game with several different playing pieces and multiple types of rules, the game attempts to mimic the plot of the movie. The winning player's Snow White playing piece triumphs at the end with a kiss from the handsome prince.&#10;&#10;Description courtesy of thestrong.org (Creative Commons, BY-NC-ND)&#10;&#10;",

Once a player has found it, the others will try to snatch it away.&#10;&#10;In the first part of the game the players move through Hang-Tschou looking for hints. The hints always point to buildings in the city. When a player has gathered two hints of the same kind he needs to move to that location to uncover where the treasure is hidden.&#10;&#10;This starts the second, co-operative phase of the game. If the player who got the hint manages to reach the treasure he wins. From now on, though, all other players will try to hunt him down.

    "Description": "The game Triad was self-published by Sid Sackson in 1957 and was the third game &quot;published&quot; by him chronologically. Poke was published in Esquire Magazine in 1946, and he published Slam himself in 1951. Slam, since it has more rules, came in an approximately 4&quot;x2&quot; white paper booklet. Both of these games would be reprinted in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games in 1969, while Triad would appear (slightly modified) as Pe-Ling in 1970. Triad was then published in GAMES magazine in 1986, while Pe-Ling was presented at Spiel in 1989 and in included in an issue #5 of Spielbox in 1990.&#10;&#10;Triad is similar to Mah Jongg, but uses a special deck made from two decks of cards using only the ace through 8 of each suit. For four players, a third set of cards is added. The rules mostly detail scoring for the various hands that can be formed.&#10;&#10;In this game, players try to combine twelve cards in three sets of four cards, each set belonging to one of the three classes allowed. To do this, players can choose to take a face-up card from the draw pile or a face-down card from the discard pile. A set of the Class 1 type consists of four cards of the same suit. For Class 2 sets, each four cards should be arranged as two pairs, with the sum of the values being 9 (e.g., 2, 2 and 7, 7). Class 3 is about making groups of four cards of the same number (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 2). In each Class, some cards combinations are considered weak, easy or strong, giving 2, 4 or 8 points, respectively. Moreover, there are several conditions and card combinations that add doubling factors progressively to the total sum. In this way, one doubling multiplies the points by a factor of 2, two by 4, three by 8, etc. The game lasts several rounds until a player reaches a predetermined amount of points.&#10;&#10;",

Players then decide if they want to sell and/or buy goods there. Also, every action takes time, and how you spend it is very important. Will you spend more time to reach a bigger planet so that the chances of getting cheap cargo will be bigger? or will you travel to smaller planets, hoping to increase the number of trades even though they may be a bit less profitable? Will you try to sell and buy on the same planet to save traveling time, but risk getting a worse deal on one of the transactions? or will you just do one thing, maximizing profit but wasting more time flying through space? Last, will you risk losing your cargo by selling it where it's illegal?&#10;&#10;",

The probability of winning a rally for either player stays pretty much the same regardless of his/her choices.&#10;&#10;The game board, representing a tennis court with scoring tables, is quite neat though.&#10;&#10;The box contains:&#10;&#10;1 playing board of two interlocking halves&#10;5 dice: &#10; - service (yellow)&#10; - in/out (white)&#10; - stroke (white)&#10; - singles position (light blue)&#10; - doubles position (green)&#10;4 purple scoring tokens&#10;1 purple player token (large)&#10;4 green scoring tokens&#10;1 green player token (large)&#10;1 yellow ball token&#10;1 set of rules&#10;&#10;Year of publication is unsure (not reported on rules booklet), but box features Boris Becker and Gabriela Sabatini in their prime, so late Eighties would be a reasonable guess.&#10;&#10;",

If a player doesn&rsquo;t end a strike, he&rsquo;ll have to suffer tough consequences during the next turns.  The strikes will be tougher to settle as the game advance so players should make sure they have enough money to meet the demands of the unions.

Each player takes turns driving it through the town, responding to a host of funny, thought-provoking card and Playbook-based questions. Once everybody has driven, the car races toward the finish line (Weekend Wish) to see whose idea of family fun will soon come true.&#10;&#10;Family Matters&trade; invites players aged 7+ to share stories, discover trivia, do funny things and creatively explore 140 make-believe, location-based issues (&quot;Fake Family Crises&quot;) from totally new perspectives.&#10;&#10;Herding your family into a single room is hard. Convincing them to talk plainly and calmly about personal or emotionally charged topics is next to impossible. As communication, or a lack thereof, has such serious consequences, effectively addressing this kind of stuff - sooner NOT later - matters a lot.&#10;&#10;If only there was a way to playfully facilitate self-expression and encourage collaborative conversation...&#10;&#10;Enter Family Matters, the game parents will wish their family played when they were kids.

Players each write down their &quot;Weekend wish&quot; on Page 10 of the Playbook&#10;2. Players select a peg and place it into the car by age - youngest first, please. &#10;3. The driver parks the car at anyone one of the four possible starting points. &#10;4. The driver rolls the cube to start the car and move it forward. &#10;5. The driver does whatever the space suggests: (i) read/respond to a card that matches the space, (ii) move from one &quot;Black Hole&quot; to another or (iii) resolve, with other passengers, a location based Fake Family Crisis (found on pages 14-41 in the Playbook)&#10;6. See page 6 of the Playbook for instruction on how to resolve a Fake Family Crisis.&#10;7. Only after resolving a Fake Family Crisis is it time to change drivers (and car seats). &#10;8. Once all players have driven, reach takes a turn rolling toward the board's center. &#10;9. The first player to land upon the Weekend Wish space &quot;wins&quot; the game. &#10;10. The entire family must grant the winning player's Weekend Wish.&#10;&#10;",
