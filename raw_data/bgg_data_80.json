    "Description": "One of the greatest battles in World War II history is finally coming to Worthington Publishing:&#10;&#10;&quot;1944 Battle of the Bulge&quot; designed by Dan Fournie, and using concepts from Worthington's Holdfast Series, is a fast playing Bulge wargame that will give you hours of game play.  With fewer than 50 counters per side, and 8 pages of rules, you'll be up and playing in 15 minutes, and finishing games in 2 hours or less.&#10;&#10;Each side gets a set number of resource points to move and have combat, each move or combat costing a resource point.  But you can do these in any order, so attack with an adjacent unit, create a hole, and then race through with another unit, which can then attack!  Then move the initial unit that attacked to create the hole...the decisions are yours!&#10;&#10;Breakthroughs will occur, having the right units in position to expoit your opportunities is critical.  The Germans start with more resource points and will reduce as the game goes on, the allies on the other hand start with fewer and go up as the game goes on, reflecting the historical situation.&#10;&#10;Much like in Dunkirk: France 1940 we have included optional German Objective Cards.  The German player secretly picks one prior to play, the Allied player does not know the true German objective until the game end creating tension right up to the last die roll.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Although the publisher claims 1-2 players, it has no solitaire opponent to compete against. It&#039;s a 2-player game, and like most 2-player games, you can solo both sides.&#10;&#10;",

Both sides are as evenly matched as one gets during the war, and there is a constant stream of reinforcement keeping both players in the game up to the end.&#10;&#10;2nd Bull Run is one of General Robert E. Lee's greatest victories, in which he smashed John Pope's politically riddled Union army, setting the stage for the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) several weeks later.&#10;&#10;Red Badge of Courage uses version 4.3 of the GBACW system, building on lessons learned from the two previous battle games in the series. And the game not only includes the two complete battles, but it has a half dozen smaller scenarios that enable you to play various aspects of the battle in detail, many in a day.&#10;&#10;Designer: Richard H.

Standard game is simultaneous rolling, not turn-based.&#10;On a 7 you can:&#10;&#10;    Stand 1 meep (if none standing)&#10;    Help 1 meep to its feet&#10;    Help 1 standing meep into FoS&#10;    Knock down 1 standing opponent&#10;    Toss 1 opponent out of FoS (you need 1 in) BUT place them standing up outside FoS&#10;    Send out RECON PAIR from the FoS to get 1 supply box&#10;    Stand 1 knocked down meep in RECON PAIR&#10;    Knock down 1 meep in RECON PAIR&#10;    Drag 1 supply box into FoS with standing RECON PAIR&#10;    Seal FoS &ndash; Close lid with at least 4 of your meeps in &amp; 1 supply box for the WIN!&#10;&#10;&#10;What about the monster?&#10;&#10;Three game modes &ndash; Decide before you start: UHOH or OMG or CRA-CRA!&#10;&#10;     UHOH activates monster die as soon as a supply box gets into the FoS. This is standard play. Once activated, player rolling doubles of monster die&rsquo;s face-up number has to turn monster die down 1.  A double 6 turns monster die to 5, a double 5 turns it to 4 &amp; so on. When monster die is on 1, snake eyes (double 1s) ends game. Monster gets in FoS &amp; eats you! BUT . . . either player can be a hero by tossing 1 of their outside standing meeps onto monster die! That meep is forever gone (but not forgotten). However, next double 1s ends the game unless another jumps on. Sacrificing a meep doesn&rsquo;t need a 7 &amp; can be done in or out of FoS but only when monster die is on 1.&#10;     OMG mode activates monster die when the game starts. Faster game but it sucks to be human.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Sanzen-sekai no karasu wo koroshi, nushi to asane ga shitemitai&quot; (translated as &quot;I'd kill all the crows in the world to sleep with you in the morning&quot;) is an old song sung at a red-light district in the mid-1800s by one guest: Takasugi Shinsaku, a central figure of the early Meiji Restoration who lived a turbulent life. The saying means, &quot;When a crow cries, I must leave this place. Even if I must kill crows all over the world, I want to stay with you a little while longer.&quot; The song expresses his longing for amorous time to be prolonged for even just a short while.&#10;&#10;In the game Sanzen Sekai: I'd kill all the crows in the world to be with you a little longer, now titled Crows Overkill in its newest edition, players roleplay guests in a red-light district. Many birds gather in front of each player. The players must kill or move birds to prevent them from crying. If birds in front of a player cry, that player must leave the red-light district to go home (i.e. drop out of the game). The player who manages to stay in the red-light district for the longest time wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players attempt to be the last one called away from the red-light district by the cry of crows, warblers, and roosters.  The game consists of two decks of cards &mdash; birds and shamisen &mdash; along with a time board. Each turn follows this sequence:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Cards are drawn from both decks. Birds are placed on the table in front of the current player, while shamisen cards go into their hand.&#10;    Shamisen cards are then played to eliminate birds.&#10;    A check is made against the time board to see whether the remaining birds cry and the current player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;&#10;The turns continue until one player remains in the game and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

You must contend with adverse weather, unpredictable storms, and the unrest, fatigue, and disease that will spread among your crew as the voyage advances.&#10;&#10;All of this is abstracted in a game that uses a deck of 54 cards, some markers, and one pawn to track the position of your fleet. Adamastor is essentially a hand/tableau-management game with multi-use cards that can be played in 15 minutes. Each card in play has the potential to help or hinder you during your journey. Different events will trigger when certain combinations of icons are in play. Most of these events will hurt, but some might help. The challenges that the sailors faced in these heroic journeys are also abstracted into a system in which you will gain traumas. These cards will increase as the game progresses, making your task even more difficult.&#10;&#10;Masterful command of these cards will lead you to a successful voyage full of wealth and adventure, but be wary as danger and disaster await with every pull from the deck.&#10;&#10;",

We can&rsquo;t tell you any more without spoilers, but if you like conspiracy theories, science fiction and plot twists you will love this one.&#10;&#10;Key Enigma is an escape box that mixes puzzles, narrative, and technology to immerse you in a challenging experience so carefully designed that it may be impossible for you to distinguish reality from fiction.&#10;&#10;A box full of mysteries and enigmas will reach your hands. With the materials, codes, and clues hidden inside, you must use your ingenuity and match the objects to solve the case. With this model, we want to expand the possibilities of traditional Escape Rooms. By not being dependent on a physical space we have greater freedom to: create complex, different and surprising puzzles, a more sophisticated story and we can make the game reach all over the world. The box is the heart of the project where you will find the material that serves as a bridge to connect the physical and digital world to live an immersive experience.&#10;&#10;You'll get a mix of: Traditional puzzles, Immersive / Digital puzzles, Codes, Advanced Puzzles&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Filler, players employ multi-use cards and a blend of simultaneous action selection, time and resource management, set-collection, and hand-building to collect ingredients needed to fill tasty pastries on their way to becoming the Star Baker.&#10;&#10;Starting with a hand of three cards with various start times and basic ingredients, players choose a card to reveal along with other players to determine the turn order. The earliest player to show up for work goes first and so on around the table. Using cards from their hands (i.e., their pantry), players may use ingredients they have acquired to fill recipes from a central row of available cards (the recipe book) or restock the pantry by picking up all of their previously played cards. Each recipe filled provides new start times and ingredients to use in future rounds and may earn points that are represented by money, customer reviews, or critical acclaim at the end of the game. The availability of bonus points and cards containing special actions help to direct players' choices in the kitchen, add depth of play, and provide variety and replayability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Alias consists of many cards, each card has 6 words written on it. Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &quot;Silver Medal&quot;). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.&#10;&#10;Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The &quot;explainer&quot; must change every turn. Each team gets a figure representing them on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take cards from the pack (not showing it to the other team member(s)) and explain the words on every card that have the same number as the space their figure landed on. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the  word that is written on card  by using sentences to describe the word.  For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn. Variations: opposites and/or foreign words are allowed.&#10;&#10;Based on Alias' success, Tactic has kept publishing re-implemented versions of the same basegame, such as Fame Alias, Junior Alias, Junior Alias: Travel, Muumi Alias, Family Alias,  Party Alias,  High School Musical Party Alias, and has also licensed Noteability as Musiikki Alias.&#10;&#10;Tactic gives the official launch year of Alias as 1991, but the first edition was actually available already in 1990 and a limited release of the game may have been issued as early as 1989.&#10;&#10;Expansions in the form of additional decks of cards have been published since the early 1990's.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ama is tired. It has been a long day of chasing her grandchildren, and she needs a break. Ama has been around for a long time and she has a few tricks up her sleeve. With the promise of her famous fruit salad, Ama sends her grandchildren down to the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market to collect fruit... and to get out of her hair! Collecting different fruit is no easy task, as the fruit boats &ndash; full of mango, banana, papaya, guava, grapefruit, rambutan, and the famous starfruit &ndash; are constantly shifting around the Khlong Damnoen Saduak Canal of Thailand.&#10;&#10;In Floating Market, the players are Ama's eager grandchildren, competing to be the first to collect five different types of fruit for Ama... AND get the first bowl of fruit salad! Each player has customers (Ama&rsquo;s grandchildren), which they will assign to fruit boats (to collect fruit) and to buildings (to receive special abilities). Each player will also add a die to the dice pool each round in an attempt to influence a die roll that determines which fruit boat will hand out fruit.&#10;&#10;Floating Market utilizes polyhedral dice, worker placement, and dice speculation to create a unique and accessible experience for gamers of all levels. The rules and turns are simple and intuitive and the game teaches quickly, making it perfect for a family or group of new gamers. Experienced gamers will appreciate the unique blend of new and familiar mechanics and the quick, fun gameplay that uses polyhedral dice in a new and interesting way.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There are six different (but equal) gambling joints where bits representing money are distributed at the beginning of each round. The object of the game is to finish with the most money. Players simultaneously choose a card from their hands to play. Each card corresponds to one of the six gambling joints and depicts either a gambler or a cop. The cards are revealed, and in each gambling joint where a gambler has been played, the money will be awarded, &agrave; la Hoity Toity/Adel Verplichtet, to the gambler unless a cop has also been played in the joint, in which case the cop gets it; if a cop  shows up but no gambler, the money stays where it is for the next round. When two gamblers or two cops both claim the money in the same joint, a negotiation mechanism which may involve the roll of a die comes into play. You have to do well in the simultaneity sweeps to get into contention at all, but doing well in the negotiation can make the difference between coming in first or second.&#10;&#10;The game comes in a small package about the size of a videotape and is attractively decorated in a sort of mid-1970s Gil Kane/Joe Giella DC Comics style.&#10;&#10;",

The world we see around us is an illusion hiding True Reality, a horrible illusion fabricated to keep humanity at bay, and to prevent our awakening.&#10;&#10;That is the premise to the darkest of the CCGs.  You play an Archon or an Angel of Death.  You lay beings or regions around you and to the side in a Tarot type layout.  On these cards you can play influence cards.  Your spell casters can play spells and there are commandments that you can play that have instant effects.  On your turn you try to influence the population at large by moving population counters onto your outer cards then to your inner cards then onto the card representing you.  With 2 players there are 9 population markers and the first to sway 5 wins.  Of course along the way your beings will be throwing everything but the kitchen sink at each other.&#10;&#10;Between the subject matter and the dark and very graphic cards this is not a kids game.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you must perform 1 action, either taking Flower tiles from the Field and placing them in your garden, taking Bees from the Field, or placing Bees in your Garden.&#10;&#10;When taking Flower tiles, you should pick the next tile after the Sun marker in the circle around the Field, but you can spend Bees from your reserve and place it on that tile to &quot;skip&quot; it. Manage your Bees wisely and pick the best Flower tiles.&#10;&#10;Flower tiles must connect to at least another tile in your garden. Create large flowerbeds of the same color and use your Bees to pollinate them and increase their value. Collect Hives and get rid of Spider Webs to gather more Bees at the end of the Season.&#10;&#10;A Season ends when the last Flower tile has been taken from the circle around the Field. At the end of the third Season, the game ends.&#10;&#10;You score your most valuable area of each color: Red/Yellow/Blue areas are worth points equal to the number of spaces times the number of Bees in that area; white areas are worth 1 point for each space in that area. You also get 5 points for each full row and/or column in your Garden board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Score the most runs by drafting the best dice and stringing together powerful combos! Slowly set up the base runners with singles, and then hit a grand slam, or steal bases to sneak your runners home! The rolls of the dice make each round a whole new ball game. Everyone gets to play even when it&rsquo;s not their turn, so the strategic thinking never ends! Dust off home plate, get out your leather glove, and PLAY BALL!&#10;&#10;Baseball Highlights: The Dice Game is played with a set of 9 Play dice, 6 Power dice, 1 Pitcher&rsquo;s die, a game board, and a game sheet for each player.&#10;&#10;Each round the active player will roll the Play dice and any Power dice they have unlocked to place them each of the matching 6 board areas. Then, the active player will select one of these 6 areas and will use the dice from that area to cross off boxes in the matching track on their player game sheet. Once they are done, the inactive players select 1 die from 2 different areas to cross off 2 boxes in the matching tracks on their game sheets.&#10;&#10;Marking off boxes in the 6 tracks (and the bonus Clutch Hits track) will place new runners on base and advance your existing runners for singles, doubles, triples, home runs, walks, and stolen bases. Each time you advance a base runner to home, you will score 1 run. The player who scores the most runs by the end of the game wins. But be careful, the result on the Pitcher&rsquo;s die may remove some of your base runners before they can score!&#10;&#10;Baseball Highlights: The Dice Game is for 1 to 4 players ages 8 and up.

Let your burdens drift away, if only for a moment, in the rich aromatic steam of your favorite tea.&#10;&#10;A Nice Cuppa is the seventh game in Button Shy&rsquo;s Simply Solo series. Designed by Scott Almes, the game tasks the player with managing Worries through careful card management across 8 turns. As Worries are revealed, they complicate your life and force you to become distracted. Focus on your tea to eliminate those pesky problems and soothe your shattered nerves. Once your tea is ready, evaluate how you did.&#10;&#10;&#10;When your worries start to pile up, it&rsquo;s important to focus on what really matters by concentrating on the soothing ritual of preparing a cup of tea.&#10;&#10;To start the game, first shuffle the 7 Tea cards and place them in a line, Focused side up, each with a random face-down Worry card directly below it.&#10;&#10;On your turn, first flip over a single face-down Worry. Then, in sequence from left to right, resolve each face-up Worry. These force you to rearrange your Tea cards in various ways, and you'll need to plan carefully to keep them from messing up your well-laid plans.&#10;&#10;After all Worries have been resolved, flip each Tea card above a face-up Worry to its opposite face. This turns a Focused Tea card into a Distracted one and vice versa.&#10;&#10;Remove each face-up Worry that&rsquo;s below a Focused Tea card. These Worries have been addressed through the calming powers of tea and won&rsquo;t be dealt with again!&#10;&#10;Lastly, if you choose to, you may swap any two adjacent Tea cards to get them in a better position for the next turn.&#10;&#10;After 8 turns, your tea is ready (whether you are or not). Score points for each Tea Card you have in the correct order, plus extra points for each Tea Card with its Focused side showing. But beware that you&rsquo;ll lose points for each remaining Worry.&#10;&#10;Tally up your total and check your score to see whether you&rsquo;re ready to face the rest of your day or need to cozy up with another cuppa!&#10;&#10;",

It's a multiplayer wargame with a card-driven combat system and a political layer that players must contend with.&#10;&#10;For just over one hundred years England and France battled over who would sit on the French throne. Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons. All in all, 'twas a grand time!&#10;&#10;The game randomly lasts from 8 to 10 turns.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most Pretender Points.  &#10;Points are gained at the end of each turn for each Province a player controls.  &#10;Controlled cities gain revenue. Those can be spent on Battle Cards and fortification.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved by playing Battle Cards (yellow(numerical) or red(special cards), combined with Influence, fortifications, and die roll.&#10;&#10;TURN SEQUENCE&#10;Income phase: based on controlled cities&#10;Political phase: vote for War or Peace&#10;Battle Cards collection  &#10;Purchase fortifications and/or cards.  &#10;Player Order phase&#10;Event(s) phase&#10;Foreign Intervention phase&#10;Player Turns: In player order, each player resolves:  &#10;1-Expansion moves&#10;2-Combat only if 2+ Yellow cards; Resolve battle, then repeat combat if needed.&#10;Pretender Points: Players gain points (depending on regions they control), then Influence points (up to 6), then discard all cards.&#10;GAME END: check on turn 8 and 9, automatic on 10&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1 mounted game board &#10;80 cards (a la Tarot) &#10;20 resin cast castles and 10 resin cast strongholds &#10;die-cut coin markers and garrisons representing the factions of France, England, Navarre, Brittany, Flanders and Burgandy.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sequel Renaissance&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bagh Chal is a traditional abstract game that is popular in Nepal. The name roughly translates to &quot;Tigers Moving&quot;. It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.&#10;&#10;The board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.&#10;&#10;It is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.&#10;See also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.&#10;&#10;Games played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar. See the according image galleries of these games.&#10;&#10;",

Players gain victory points for performing well on prep missions, attracting famous scientists to their cause and, of course, how far they got on the Moon landing mission.&#10;The core of the game are the mission tests, which consist of rolling five dice. Dice have success, neutral, and failure results, which add respectively to your success rating, do nothing, or subtract from it. The total of your successes will determine the points you earn from the mission and whether you'll get a bonus on the final lunar mission or not. Die rolls can be affected by technology and your success can be influenced by having scientists research relevant tech and by cards played by any player.&#10;&#10;1969 combines simple dice mechanics with elements of resource management and even some light engine building to make an interesting lightweight experience. There are some mechanics of player interference (meaning players can disrupt each other's progress), but these elements can be avoided if desired.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The King has commissioned a magnificent Castle that will span the ages. The ones who build it will be blessed with riches, power, and Renown for all time. This is where you come in. To build a Castle require workers, and your Guild is ready to answer the call.  You are one of the few, the clever, and the devious, who aims to scheme and expand power by any means necessary. Use care though; the King will visit the Castle and Inspect it to make sure that everything is to his liking. If he finds you have been participating in shady deals, he will strip your Guild of its Influence and resources. Claim credit for building his Castle and prove to him that you are the greatest Guild in the land.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;CastleScape is a deck-building area-control game set in medieval times. It is a time of Kings and Guilds, money and power, deception and influence. In CastleScape, each player represents one of four Guilds who are building a large castle, containing many Baileys, for the King. Players build Walls into Baileys, gather recruits to spread their Guild&rsquo;s influence, spend gold, perform questionable deeds in the Back Alley, and complete Goals and Quests. However, they must balance their actions with how much Infamy and Corruption they will accrue from performing them. Whenever the King visits the Castle to inspect it, he will strip Influence from the Guilds based on their Infamy.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with a basic deck of cards (gold, recruits, walls, and a few clumsy thieves) and a couple hidden goals. The game board starts with one wall in the center, and players must build outward, always adding walls adjacent to other walls. Whenever a Bailey is completed, Renown(points) will be awarded based on how large that Bailey is, and the player with the most Influence in that Bailey will claim the Renown. Starting in the same area and building outwards forces all players to have a high level of player interactivity and decision making so that no two games will ever feel the same. Inspections will remove significant amounts of Influence from the game board, giving players additional ways to influence how things play out.&#10;&#10;CastleScape is highly strategic and incentivizes players to play differently each game. Besides each player&rsquo;s hidden objective cards and a Castle that is procedurally built each game, players will plan multiple turns ahead to build the castle how they see fit. The Market also has both static and rotating card options to keep gameplay fresh and interesting. Points can be earned by building and claiming credit for Baileys, purchasing cards, and completing hidden or public goals; but points will be lost based on Corruption.&#10;&#10;CastleScape has been created to give a fresh take on the Deck-builder genre, adding heavy player interaction on a central game board, with far more to think about than just what cards you want to purchase. It offers deep strategy, nearly unlimited replayability, and interesting/fun interactions and combos.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the roles of four key investigators &ndash; instinctive journalist Warren Spacey, tenacious reporter Vicki Vale, brutish detective Harvey Bullock, or the cunning Catwoman &ndash; who are drawn into a series of mysterious events unfolding in Gotham City.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players cooperatively make decisions running the investigation and trying to solve a series of challenging cases. They visit famous locations in Gotham City (like the Batcave, Arkham Asylum, Blackgate Penitentiary, and the Gotham City Gazette) and cross paths with well-known Batman characters (like Batman, The Penguin, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, Scarecrow, and more) while trying to chase leads, identify suspects, and gather enough information to help save Gotham City. The game also adds a brand new hidden agenda mechanic, which assigns secret goals and unique win conditions for each player based upon which DC character they portray.&#10;&#10;In Batman: Everybody Lies, players utilize a variety of physical and digital game components &ndash; a deck of cards with essential clues and plot twists, various physical handouts, and a dedicated website with access to in-world resources from the Gotham City Gazette archives &ndash; for a truly immersive experience. The game also features another new thematic treat &ndash; Scenes &ndash; that bring memorable gameplay moments to life via original comic book illustrations that feel torn straight from the pages and panels of the beloved comics.&#10;&#10;Beginning with an introductory Prologue designed to get players acquainted with the game rules, Batman: Everybody Lies then continues with three big cases to solve, each taking roughly 2-3 hours to play. Each case can be played separately as stand-alone episodes, yet should players crack all four cases, they will unravel a master narrative with an epic climax. Every scenario ends with a final report with questions verifying how well the team has investigated the case.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the tactical card game We Will Wok You, you must provide delicious dishes for the visitors at a wok music festival. However, some dastardly thief has stolen your ingredients! You need to replace them and come up with new dishes as soon as possible...&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players lay out 12-18 wok cards which show the dishes they can make or the special powers available to them in the kitchen. Lay out four lines of ingredient cards, with three cards each in the top two rows and two cards each in the bottom two rows; place six coin cards next to the top two rows, and four coins next to the bottom two rows. Each player starts with three coin cards in hand. On a turn, a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Takes one coin card from one of the two rows of coin cards.&#10;    Buys all the ingredients in a row by paying however many coins lie next to that row.&#10;    Takes a wok card by playing ingredient cards with four matching symbols onto the table in front of you.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you take a coin, you reduce the cost to buy the ingredient cards in the two adjacent rows; when you buy ingredients, you place the coins used on the appropriate coin row next to the ingredients, raising the cost for future purchases. You also replace the ingredients with two or three cards from the deck as appropriate. When both ingredient rows next to a coin row are empty, each player takes one final turn, then the game ends.&#10;&#10;Players then see which woks score for them: Some score the listed number of points; some require you to play a combination of ingredients onto them (whether from your ingredient cards on the table or those in your hand) in order to score anything; some score for each ingredient of a certain type or two placed onto them; and some score only for cards from your hand. The &quot;men at wok&quot; cards provide special abilities, boosting the points scored for certain types of woks, or allowing you to substitute one ingredient for another on one wok card, or transforming a wok into a fixed number of points with no ingredients required. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "...und Tsch&uuml;ss! means &quot;So Long!&quot; and is a simple card game where players compete for successive scoring cards on the table by laying cards with the lowest total. The trick is, there is one scoring card fewer than the number of players, so someone always goes empty handed. A bit like musical chairs.&#10;&#10;The deck has blue cards numbered 1 to 15 and red cards numbered -5 and -10. According to the number of players, you're dealt a hand and then the scoring cards are laid out. So with 6 players, you get 9 cards and compete for 5 on the table. The scoring cards are sorted from lowest to highest and everybody chooses a card from their hand and shows it. The lowest value card wins the lowest scoring card (which could easily be a negative!). That player is out and the remaining players choose another card. Whoever has the lowest total takes the next lowest scoring card and is out, and so on , until there are 2 players left competing for the final scoring card. Again, you add a card to your total, and whoever now has the HIGHEST total wins the last scoring card. Which means that if you can't go for the prize, you try to duck out earlier. Get it wrong and you've no chance of getting points. Play twice through the deck and the highest points scored wins.&#10;&#10;Part of the Goldsieber &#195;&#160; la Carte line of games.&#10;&#10;",

From the once-dormant Tekirin volcano, the vengeful Magmaroth has emerged. Born of earth and fire, its goal is to mold the world to its image: primal and ruthless. The time is now for the masters to face their destiny.&#10;&#10;The Masters' Trials: Wrath of Magmaroth is a cooperative dice-crafting game in which players represent the masters from the orders that have banded together to face the evil elemental. Each player has a board that represents their character and five dice which they use to apply the effects of their abilities. Each round, they face new minions, generate mana, and get to master new abilities, adding them on their characters. After ten rounds, they come face-to-face with the powerful Magmaroth, which they have to defeat before the whole volcano collapses around them.&#10;&#10;The Masters' Trials uses the dice-crafting mechanism made popular in the game Dice City but in a new and exciting way. Each player's character consists of three different boards that represent their class, order, and weapon. These boards determine their initial abilities as well as the ones that the players can master during the game. By combining them in different ways, you can create new characters, allowing for a different experience in each game!&#10;&#10;Build your character the best way possible, work together with your fellow players, roll your dice, and use the powerful techniques you have mastered in order to defeat Magmaroth before he destroys everything!&#10;&#10;",

The end goal is visiting Kathmandu. Along the way players gain points through different means: Visiting temples, trading for goods in the cities, discovering each landscape, and drawing the many unique animals that call Nepal their home.&#10;&#10;The players need to be efficient in their turns, to achieve as much as possible but to also not waste much time, since a storm is coming!

    "Description": "In June of 1757, Frederick the Great and his highly trained Royal Army of Prussia approaches an Austrian army encamped along a low range of hills. Hoping just one more victory will force the Austrians to sue for peace, Frederick sets in motion his master tactic, the &quot;oblique maneuver&quot; against the enemy right flank. Only now the Austrians are under a new commander, the imperturbable Field Marshal von Daun. He calmly redeploys his forces and the Prussian turning maneuver instead becomes a brutal frontal assault. That night some 10,000 Prussians lay dead on the field, with another 5,000 captured. Frederick suffers his first defeat in the Seven Years War.&#10;&#10;Based on the popular La Bataille system, Kolin offers the first authentic treatment of battles during the Age of Reason. Special command and movement rules reflect the inflexible and difficult nature of commanding armies of the day compared to their Napoleonic descendants. Players must master infantry, cavalry, and artillery tactics at a time when trained manpower is extremely valuable, and not mere &quot;cannon-fodder&quot;.&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;&#10;    420 counters&#10;    3 34&quot; x 22&quot; period maps&#10;    2nd edition standard rules&#10;    Exclusive rules book&#10;    Separate charts and tables &#10;    Insightful historical commentary by Dr. Christopher Duffy.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

After battling for the capture of Stalingrad through most of the Autumn, the German army holds the bulk of the city. Holding the extended flanks of the German advance are Axis allied troops of dubious quality. Opposing those flanks are the shock troops of the 1942 Soviet winter counteroffensive. The latter are poised to initiate the encircling movement which will generate the Stalingrad Pocket and later the greatest single disaster to befall the German army during World War II.&#10;&#10;Stalingrad Pocket is the first Standard Combat Series (SCS) game by The Gamers and covers the Soviet counteroffensive Operation Uranus and the German attempts to hold its pincers apart. It  the fighting in November and December 1942. Soviet play requires the optimum use of a ponderous and fragile weapon&mdash;the Red Army of '42. German play requires saber-like use of mobile forces, the concentration and maintenance of reserves, and lightning hit and run attacks designed to derail the Soviet military machine.&#10;&#10;The Standard Combat Series is a new gaming series that will take its place along side the others in The Gamers (and later Multi-Man Publishing) line of products. It is designed to off-set the more complex treatments of our other series. Experienced players will feel comfortable with the system as soon as they read the rules.

The tree trunk &mdash; which is the game container in many versions &mdash; is placed in the middle of the table with the lid on it. On a turn, a player announces that they'll play 1-3 cards, then they turn the cards over from their deck one by one, placing them on the tree as required by what's depicted on the card. If the card shows only foliage, then you can place it anywhere; if it shows a flower or monkey, then you must make the card hang over the edge so that the &quot;ground&quot; depicted on the card has no part of the tree underneath it. The snake must be placed between two other cards, the toucan tossed on top from a foot away, the leopard dropped straight onto the tree from a foot above, and the bat dropped onto the tree &mdash; but only after you close your eyes before extending your arm over the table! The beehive card can't be covered by anything except foliage and flowers, while the chameleon copies the card previously played.&#10;&#10;If any cards fall off the tree while you're adding something to it, then you place those cards (and any cards that you've yet to place that turn) in a personal penalty pile. As soon as someone places their final card, the game ends. Players count the cards remaining in their deck with those in their penalty pile, and whoever has the fewest cards wins!&#10;&#10;",

The victory is possible only if all clans unite!&#10;&#10;But Scottish aristocrats often prefer personal enrichment to fighting for freedom. At the same time, King Edward I of England, nicknamed Hammer of the Scotts, pays generously to those who join his side!&#10;&#10;Each round, English army invades the lands of Scotland. Players take on the roles of Scottish clan leaders. They hire troops and send them to battle. Then each rival secretly decides which side he will support: England or Scotland. The Choice tokens are flipped simultaneously. Each side sums up their strengths (the traitors join the English army). Then the winning side of the battle is proclaimed.&#10;&#10;Swords and Bagpipes is based on the famous Prisoner&#226;&#128;&#153;s Dilemma. As a rule, treachery brings more gold. At the end, the richest player wins the game! However, if England conquers Scotland, the winner is not the richest player, but the player who had betrayed fewer times. Since Scotland can be defeated but not broken, its clans will need to rally around the most loyal clan!&#10;&#10;Remember the movie Braveheart with Mel Gibson? Freedom-loving patriots, corrupt aristocrats, and the cruelty of the English king. It's all there in the game, and it&rsquo;s what its participants will experience!&#10;&#10;",

Words may be formed horizontally or vertically, as in Scrabble, but, as the title suggests, the letters may also be stacked.  This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.  This results in scoring that increases as the game continues, even for simpler words.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Qwixx Longo is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Gameplay is nearly identical to 2012's Qwixx, but with eight-sided dice allowing for higher numbers to be rolled and lucky numbers that give additional chances to mark off spaces.&#10;&#10;Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-16 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 16-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six eight-sided dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows; additionally, if the sum of the white dice matches one of the two lucky numbers printed on your scoresheet, you immediately mark off the next number in the row in which you have the fewest marks.&#10;&#10;Then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you have at least six numbers marked in a row, then you can mark off either of the final two spaces in a colored row (15/16 in red/yellow and 3/2 in green/blue) &mdash; assuming the dice allow you to do so, of course. If you do this, you also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&#10;&#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Breakthrough: Cambrai, On November 20, 1917, 324 British tanks, followed by 8 infantry divisions, advanced on a front of 10,000 yards against the German lines near Cambrai, in Flanders. A combined-arms assault, plus the use of new artillery techniques, initially smashed the German trench line.  In several places, the attackers suffered almost no casualties and, by the end of the day, recorded gains of three to four miles. Would it be possible, this time, to break through to the &ldquo;green fields beyond&rdquo;? British euphoria over the success of the offensive was dampered only by the loss of 47% of their tanks on the first day.&#10;&#10;A two player game simulating the British assault to breach the &ldquo;Hindenburg Line&rdquo; between November 20 and December 3, 1917. One player controls the British forces, the other the German forces. The object of the game is to control a certain number of areas on the map or, for the British, to exit units off the map into certain perimeter zones.  An area-movement game which uses impulse mechanics (where players alternate &quot;mini-turns&quot;) similar to popular games like Breakout: Normandy and Monty's Gamble: Market Garden. The impulse nature of the game means little or no down time for each player while waiting for the other to complete a move or attack.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day broken down into 4 phases and impulses&#10;Area: 1 inch equals 1/6 mile / 268 meters&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigades&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (240 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Breakthrough: Cambrai rulebook&#10;One 12-page Breakthrough: Cambrai playbook&#10;Six single-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;Four 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, many of your fellow rulers also hope to stake their claim in this new world. Whose villages will stand, and whose will fall?&#10;&#10;Each card has a gold value, and your goal is to earn 100 gold pieces across multiple rounds by building villages. Do this by collecting three unit cards of the same color and laying them down. If an enemy puts down a card you'd like to have, it's time for battle! Send out your village's finest hero or hire one in secret by playing it face-down from your hand, and your opponent will do the same. Play the stronger card, and you'll be able to take a prisoner from your enemy's village and make it part of your own.&#10;&#10;However, it's not enough to simply send your most powerful units to attack neighboring kingdoms. Each unit has its own winning strategies: knights excel at defense, the wizard's power falters only when facing enemies of the same color, the dragon's strength increases with each enemy he defeats, and heroes become much stronger when you're in last place. These are only a few of the 15 different unit types you'll command. With the right combination of luck and skill, you'll always come out on top.&#10;&#10;War is one way to expand your empire, but it is certainly not the only way. Perhaps you'd like to avoid conflict altogether. Take on the role of a benevolent king who gives freely to other players, and you'll win bonus gold for being the first to empty their hand and end the round. However you choose to play, there are strategic choices to be made. How will you rule?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Freeman's Farm 1777 is the first in our Battle Formations game series. These games are based on a new game system that has been designed for solitaire and two-player gaming.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to break three of the formations of the opposing side.  This is done by activating your formations and choosing the best actions for it to undertake given the state of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Should you fire your artillery or attack with your infantry?  Or should you move your formation to a part of the battlefield that provides an advantage?  Or reinforce a faltering formation with troops from a stronger formation?  Whatever choice you make, there is a cost to the morale of your active formation.&#10;&#10;Further, you are limited by the number of times you can call upon a formation, and once called upon you must decide how long you want it to press the attack.&#10;&#10;Each time you call upon a formation your army gains momentum.  As your army builds momentum it allows you to press your formations to continue attacking, but the cost is a reduction in the momentum the army has built up as well as reductions in the morale of the attacking formations.&#10;&#10;Each formation has a fixed number of troop markers that can be hit in combat and are also subject to breaking from morale loss.  Each formation can only be activated when its activation card is played, and these are limited and not always available.  Each formation reduces its morale when activated and when continuing attacks.&#10;&#10;Formations are broken when they fail a morale test OR when all their troop markers are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Players decide which formations to activate and how far to push once they begin attacking. Push just enough and they can win the day.  Push too much and a failed morale test will break them.&#10;&#10;Freeman's Farm has been designed for easy set up and quick game play. Game unit placement is shown on the game board and units are wooden markers representing troop and artillery formations. The game was developed for solitaire play AND for two players.  In solitaire mode players can play as either the American or the British against the solitaire player game engine.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was originally published in the summer of 2001 as collectible game &quot;Vortex&quot;, and was promoted with free demo-kits distributed to the hobby industry in the spring of 2001. &quot;Vortex&quot; used a clever connected-hexagons-as-board game system that would later inspire other games in the &quot;hexagon mass as a board&quot; category.&#10;&#10;From the FFG Website:&#10;&#10;Maelstrom is a fixed, stand-alone 2-4 player board game that contains every common and starter flat from the Vortex fantasy battle game - 54 flats in all, over 150 tiles. Maelstrom is the perfect way for strategy board gamers who don't like collectibility to experience the game, and is an ideal way for Vortex fans to fill out their collections.&#10;&#10;The Masters of the Void are at war. Using the powers of the Vortex, they tear holes in the fabric of existence, recruiting powerful allies and enslaving lands, cities, and beasts of the wild. Magic, creatures of unimaginable power, and engines of destruction are bound to the Vortex and equally engulfed in the bitter struggle between the Masters.&#10;&#10;Designed by Diskwars creators Tom Jolly and Christian T. Petersen, Maelstrom is a game of fantasy battles, magic, and resource management using a unique hexagonal tile game field that grows as players add allies, land, and relics to fill the void that surrounds the Vortex. Game play is fast and furious, as players seek to gain mastery over the battlefield, shaping the very foundation of the Vortex with each strategically placed tile. Only one can rule the void. Will you?&quot;&#10;&#10;This is the game Vortex, packaged in a non-collectible format.  The box contains a ton of tiles.  Vortex includes 92 &quot;flats&quot; of tiles total (16 &quot;fixed&quot;, 38 &quot;standard&quot;, and 38 &quot;rare); this box contains all of the fixed and standard flats (for a total of 54 flats).  Note that events and relics are not included in this game, as they are in Vortex (all events and relics are rare).  Otherwise, it's the same game as Vortex, and you can even add Vortex booster packs to this game to increase your collection.  That having been said, you really don't need to.  Events DO add to the game experience, but they're not necessary -- this is a complete game without any further purchases.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Maelstrom Expansion Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

As a mansion owner, you've come to the Freak Shop to stock your mansion with the horrors that will guarantee that your visitors have a most unforgettable stay!&#10;&#10;Freak Shop is a short and simple tactical card game for 2 to 5 players that relies on a tricky trade mechanism. All cards in the game represent the frightening things, with values going from 1 to 10, that any real good freaky mansion owner must have in their collection. Players begin with four cards in their mansion (personal area), and cards are available in the Freak Shop (common zone at the center of the table). Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives. To achieve this, they try to make the best trades between cards currently in their mansion and cards available in the Shop so that their collection grows in both quantity and value, while also best fitting the objectives.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you make one single trade between cards currently in your mansion and cards available in the Shop. To do that, you have the choice between two options:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sell at the fair price =&gt; Trade any number of cards totaling a given value for any number of cards worth exactly the same total value. &#10;     Get a good deal =&gt;  Exchange a series of cards of one single value with a series of the same number of cards of another single value.&#10;&#10;&#10;Throughout a game of Freak Shop, you try to take the best trade opportunities each turn to first make your mansion grow, then ensure that you can end with the collection worth the most points. Good deals help to get higher value cards, and fair price trades help to get more cards in your mansion. As everything is about trades, a central strategic point is to determine which cards are better used for optimizing new trades instead of being kept for scoring!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Clash of Giants: Civil War takes the game system from Ted S. Raicer&rsquo;s popular and critically acclaimed Clash of Giants WWI series to two of the storied battles of the American Civil War: Second Bull Run and Gettysburg. CoG: Civil War uses a modified version of the chit-pull Activation system of Clash of Giants II: Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914, while retaining the CoG combat system. Every (mostly brigade-level) unit has a Tactical Efficiency Rating based on its morale, training, leadership, and experience, but even a poor unit can have a heroic moment, while the Iron Brigade might not always be made of iron. It is a true player&rsquo;s system, which produces realistic results without a lot of fiddly procedures, and allows players to concentrate on the game rather than the rules.&#10; Units in CoG: Civil War are mostly infantry brigades, (with the odd cavalry brigade or demi-brigade).  Each day is divided into four day turns and one night turn. The maps depict woods, hills, steep hexsides, railway cuts and embankments, roads, rivers, creeks, bridges, towns, marshy ground, and the Devil&rsquo;s Den at Gettysburg.&#10; The Activation rules, which combines random formation activation (mostly corps for the Union and divisions for the Confederates) with variable movement allowances, creates the fog of war and friction so important to Civil War battles. Ordering your corps commander to take a hill is one thing-getting him to act as you wish is another. And because these effects are achieved without hidden counter/dummy unit mechanics, CoG: Civil War is not only a fast-paced two-player game, but excellent as well for solo play.  Some Activation markers also allow you to coordinate more than one formation, such as Longstreet at Gettysburg. But don&rsquo;t expect Old Pete to do so early in the day!&#10;&#10;One thing that speeds play in CoG: Civil War is the unusual treatment of artillery. There are no artillery units depicted; instead artillery appears as Combat Support Markers which are added (attacker first) to the combat strength of engaged units. Artillery CSMs are generally assigned to a specific division or corps, though army reserve artillery can be used to support any units. Artillery cannot be used in combat in certain terrain (woods or town hexes), but there are no line of sight considerations to slow down play or complicate the rules. Instead both line of sight and enemy counter-battery fire are handled with an elegant abstraction: each turn all available artillery CSMs of both sides go into a cup, and then half are randomly drawn. Whatever comes out of the cup is available for use that turn, so the player with more artillery on the field is more likely to get artillery support. This also allows a simple way to model the effectiveness of the Union Artillery Reserve at Gettysburg; once arrived, these markers never go in the cup, and are always available for use. Overall, CoG: Civil War&rsquo;s portrait of artillery as an occasionally decisive but definitely secondary arm is arguabley more realistic than many more complicated designs.&#10; The two battles, Second Bull Run and Gettysburg, depict one of Lee&rsquo;s greatest victories, prior to his first invasion of the north, and his greatest defeat during his second invasion. Both are meeting engagements, with limited forces deployed at the start, gradually building to mighty clashes. The arrival of fresh forces is another area where the game system allows variability: units may be delayed or arrive at the wrong road. You can even attempt to speed the arrival of your off-board forces, but at increased risk of their arriving later instead.&#10;&#10;&#10;Winning involves a combination of taking and holding victory hexes, exiting units, and inflicting casualties. You can also earn victory points to compensate for units whose arrival is delayed-but only if you didn&rsquo;t try to force march them to an earlier arrival!  Players will have to judge trading losses for taking or holding tactically important ground.&#10;&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as General Pope&rsquo;s confused and confusing orders at Second Bull Run, the Confederate grand battery on the third day at Gettysburg, the use of the Union VI Corps as a reserve in both battles, cavalry delaying actions and retreat before combat, rallying units at night, and the actions of certain key leaders. But though there is enough chrome to give each battle a distinctive flavor, the action remains uncluttered, quick-playing, and  exciting.&#10; Not simply &ldquo;another Civil War battle system,&rdquo; CoG: Civil War presents a fresh new look at an oft-game topic. Giving each side a chance to change history in an afternoon&rsquo;s gaming, the use of the Clash of Giants system also shows the sometimes surprising links between the battles of the Civil War and the opening battles of the Great War 50 years later.  Fans of either the Civil War or the Clash of Giants series will not be disappointed.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Black Wednesday: The Battle of Krasni Bor, 10-11 Feb 1943, is game 7 in the Tactical Combat Series by The Gamers and covers The Battle of Krasni Bor which was the key battle of the Second Lake Ladoga Offensive. Although the siege of Leningrad had been broken, the city was far from secure. This battle was intended to guarantee the Leningrad&rsquo;s safety. The game depicts February 10, 1943, a day which would come to be known to the Spanish as &ldquo;Black Wednesday.&rdquo; The battle is a microcosm of Soviet offensive operations in World War II. Massive bombardment, wave assaults, desperate hedgehog defenses and even more desperate counter-attacks are features of this battle pitting the might of the Soviet army against the brave (but woefully outnumbered) Spanish Blue Division.&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;History: At the beginning of 1943, the Red Armies facing Army Group North had lifted the siege of  Leningrad. In order to enlarge the lifeline into the city, they attacked thc Axis Forces holding its flanks.&#10; The Spanish Blue: In the euphoria surrounding the German invasion of Russia in 1941 the Spanish government raised an infantry division of volunteers to assist the fight against Bolshevism.&#10;&#10;The Battle: Black Wednesday covers the Battle of Krasni Bor. It begins with a typical Soviet artillery barrage followed by the &quot;Urrah!&quot; of swarms of Soviet infantrymen. The newly anointed 63rd Guards Rifle Division led the attack with support by the 72nd Rifle Division (a former Ukrainian Penal unit) and part of the 43rd Rifle Division. Further support for the attack came from the T&middot;26, T&middot;34, and KV -1 tanks of the 1st Red Banner Tank Brigade. It was a full Soviet combined arms force striking a skilled dug in enemy.&#10;&#10;The Game: Black Wednesday is a full-force TCS treatment of a typical Eastern Front action-massive preparatory barrages against front-line trenches, waves of stubborn Soviet infantrymen, embattled knots of hedgehogged defenders.&#10;&#10;Black Wednesday highlights the doctrine and capabilities of massed Red Army troops and the skill, and elan of the elite Spanish Volunteers.&#10;&#10;Features&#10;&#10;     Streamlined Third Edition Game System with the same series rules as Hunters from the Sky. &#10;     Furious situation as the Soviets make a massed assault, the Spanish conduct a grim defense and the Germans come to counterattack.&#10;     First game ever to allow players to fire the largest Railroad Gun in history - the 800mm Gun DORA-as a variant. &#10;     Player Skill is highly rewarded. &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters&#10;Units: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium-High&#10;Complexity Level: High&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-50 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;Game number 7 in the Gamers Tactical Combat Series.
