    "Description": "A large vinyl playing mat is placed on the floor, with a 6 x 4 array of spots, each spot about 6 inches in diameter. The spots are colored red, blue, yellow, and green. A player is chosen to moderate, and the rest of the players, up to 4, stand on the play mat with their feet on different spots.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of the moderator spinning a spinner, which gives a result matching a random color with a random element from the set (left hand, right hand, left foot, right foot). Each player must put the relevant bodypart on the relevant color spot. If the bodypart is already on a spot of that color it is moved to another spot of the same color. No two players bodyparts can share the same spot. If a player falls or touches an elbow or knee to the ground they are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Iterate until one player remains.&#10;&#10;This classic party game became an overnight hit when on May 3, 1966 when Johnny Carson played it during the Tonight Show with Eva Gabor (see: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/104221).&#10;&#10;",

Schaper in 1949. However, Schaper's game was not the first based upon the insect known as the &quot;cootie&quot;. The creature was the subject of several tabletop games, mostly pencil and paper games, in the decades of the twentieth century following World War I.&#10;&#10;In 1927, the J. H. Warder Company of Chicago released Tu-Tee, and the Charles Bowlby Company released Cootie; though based on a &quot;build a bug&quot; concept similar to Schaper's, both were paper and pencil games.&#10;Schaper's game was the first to employ a fully three dimensional, free-standing plastic cootie.&#10;&#10;Known in Australia as Creepy Critters and in the UK as Beetle Drive.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battleship was originally a pencil-and-paper public domain game known by different names, but Milton Bradley made it into the well known board game in 1967.  The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.&#10;&#10;Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.&#10;&#10;The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).&#10;&#10;In 2008, Hasbro &quot;reinvented&quot; the game into Battleship (Revised).&#10;&#10;Some history of the published versions of the game:&#10;1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.&#10;1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.&#10;1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.&#10;1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G. Krueger Brewing Co.&#10;1940's: Maurice L. Freedman Co. of RI publishes Warfare Naval Combat.&#10;1961: Ideal publishes Salvo.&#10;&#10;Other titles over the years have included Swiss Navy, Sunk (Parker Bros.), Convoy (Transogram), Wings (Strategy Games Co. of California), and Naval Battle (3M Paper and Pencil Version) .&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the first player to move all pawns &quot;home&quot;.&#10;&#10;Parcheesi is the westernized version.&#10;&#10;The usual game is for 2-4 players.  Jumbo's version handles up to 6. There is also a Schmidt-Spiele edition with a double-sided board. One side for 4 players, the other for 6. Juegos de la Antig&uuml;edad Parchis boards are up to 8 players.&#10;&#10;'Wa-hoo' (or 'Wahoo') is a homegrown variant of the game, popular in Texas and surrounding states since the early 1900s, which features different rules and team play.&#10;&#10;Another homegrown variant is to prohibit players to capture each others pawns. But this overprotective variant is not recommended!&#10;&#10;",

By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.&#10;&#10;Slides are located at various places around the game board. When a player's piece lands at the beginning of one of these slides not of its own color, it automatically advances to the end, removing any piece on the slide and sending it back to Start.&#10;&#10;Game moves are directed exclusively by cards from the play-action deck.  If one plays the normal version in which one card is drawn from the deck each turn, the outcome has a huge element of luck.  Sorry can be made more of a strategic game (and more appealing to adults) by dealing five cards to each player at the start of the game and allowing the player to choose which card he/she will play each turn.  In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.&#10;&#10;A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;",

Everybody else wins!&#10;&#10;The best part of this game is seeing another player draw the old maid away from you. You're supposed to keep it a secret when this happens (because other players will avoid drawing from the victim if they know that they risk the old maid by doing so), but young children usually laugh or gloat when the old maid gets taken from them. Adults playing can make the victim feel better by trying to draw the maid away from them.&#10;&#10;",

They also try to collect cheese cards, which allow them to move other mice to cheese wheel which is the bait for the trap.  Once the mousetrap has been completely constructed, players can attempt to capture each others' mice in it by turning the crank, which activates the mousetrap. If the mousetrap doesn't malfunction, the mouse is captured and out of the game. The winner is the last mouse who avoids being trapped.  The main appeal of Mouse Trap is the ridiculously complex contraption that is the mousetrap.

To win you&rsquo;ll need to keep one player alive all the way from Independence, MO to the Willamette Valley. But between rattlesnakes, starvation, dead oxen, broken bones, dysentery, and a host of other calamities the odds are long . . . almost as long as the Oregon Trail itself.&#10;&#10;Players work together to move along the trail, fording rivers and playing Supply Cards to overcome calamities.

If player 2 doesn't have any matches, he says &quot;Go Fish&quot; and player 1 draws from the draw pile.  If the card drawn matches the last card asked for or makes a set, player 1 gets another turn.  If not, play moves to the player.&#10;&#10;The first player who ends his turn with no cards left in his hand (all cards are in sets), wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": " Operation is a dexterity game in which you must extract silly body parts from a hapless patient.  In the course of the game you acquire cards which dictate that you must remove a certain piece from the body of the patient.  To do this you use a set of tweezers that are attached by wire to the game board.  If you are sloppy and touch the metal sides of the hole where the item is located, the patient's pain is indicated by a sudden buzzer and light-up nose.  Successful extractions net cash, and the player with the most cash at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Various editions change the patient and the items to be removed, but the game stays the same in its essence:&#10;&#10;     Shrek -- just like the classic version, but with Shrek.&#10;     Simpsons -- Remove Homer's Bowler's Thumb, Pot Belly, Foot in Mouth, Rubber Neck, Trick Knee, etc.&#10;     T-Rex -- excavating bones of a T. Rex&#10;     Spiderman 3 -- healing all of Spiderman's ailments&#10;     Pit Stop -- manipulating various car parts instead of people-parts&#10;     Star Wars -- just like classic version, but with R2D2 and C3PO&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game attempts to mirror life events many people go through from going to college, raising a family, buying a home, working and retiring.&#10;&#10;The intent of the game is to have the most assets at the end of the game, assets are earned primarily by working and earning tokens with dollar amounts on them.  Additionally the first person to complete the course gets additional money tokens.&#10;&#10;There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel or landing on spaces that tell you to move to a specific space or forward or back.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  There are a handful of choices regarding insurance and investments but for the most part it is a game of luck.&#10;&#10;Note -- this entry covers many versions of the game with different rule sets.  In general, the newer the printing the gentler the rules.  The 1960s original can be quite brutal if the players choose to act on all the options made available to them.  The most recent versions are suitable for young children without parental supervision.&#10;&#10;",

It's a simplified Pachisi variant in which only one die is rolled per turn.&#10;&#10;The game is abstract, each player has set of pawns of his color. Each turn player rolls a die using the Pop-O-Matic and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is bumped, the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.&#10;&#10;For advanced players, we suggest that when a piece gets bumped, it should only be bumped back to its START space, rather than to its HOME.  Only when bumped from their START space are pieces sent HOME.&#10;&#10;Travel Trouble uses the same mechanisms, but is on a smaller board with fewer spaces, so it plays more quickly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Theme&#10;Players take the part of land owners, attempting to buy and then develop their land. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;On their turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, they has the opportunity to buy it or auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, they may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If they lands on a property owned by another player, they must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money. (though some editions end the game when the first player goes bankrupt)&#10;&#10;Cultural impact on rules&#10;Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.&#10;&#10;",

Both players place 3 cards face down (occasionally, some people play with the modified rules of 1 or 2 face-down cards instead of the standard three) on the table and then place another face-up card on top of those.  If the two are equal, they place more face-down cards and add another face-up card (etc.)  The winner of the round once the most recent face-up cards are different in value takes all of the cards currently on the table.

    "Description": "Created by Eleanor Abbott in the early 1940's to entertain children recovering from polio and first published by Milton Bradley (now Hasbro) in 1949, Candy Land encourages young players to socialize, exercise patience, recognize colors, learn rules, and follow directions.&#10;&#10;Players race down a rainbow-colored track to be the first to find the lost King Kandy at Candy Castle, but watch out for obstacles like the sticky Molasses Swamp!  Start by placing your plastic Gingerbread Man (or other character marker) at the beginning of the track.  Each turn, players draw a simple card and move by matching the color on the card to the next color on the track.  Some cards show a named location on the board; players who draw these cards move forward or backward on the track to the named location.  The game ends when the first player arrives at Candy Castle by reaching or moving beyond the last square on the track.&#10;&#10;In the 2004 version, younger players are not required to remove backward on the track if they draw a named card, and the last square of the track was changed from a Violet Square to a Rainbow Square, resolving a 55-year dispute over whether a player needs to land on the Violet Square or move beyond the Violet Square to win.&#10;&#10;Prior to the 2006 version, three colored spaces on the track (one in Molasses Swamp and two &quot;Cherry Pitfalls&quot;) were marked with a dot.  Players who landed on a dot were &quot;stuck,&quot; and were unable to move from the spot until they drew a card that matched the color of the square they were on.  The 2006 version replaced gum drops with licorice spaces; players who land on a licorice space only lose their next turn.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The Legend of the Lost Candy Castle&rdquo; is printed inside the box and can be read out loud. The game parts can be stored below it. The game board is colorful and has lots of yummy candy references.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Volgafront is a folio add-on to Columbia Games EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45.  It provides an eastern map extension of Russia so that a complete picture of the strategic possibilities during WWII in Germany's fight with the Soviet Union.  It also comes with an additional EastFront rulebook and a set of new scenarios that utilize the map extension directly.  EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45 is required to play with the VolgaFront map.  VolgaFront is also part of the EuroFront series.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;EastFront: The War in Russia 1941-45 &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition includes most of the VolgaFront map (but not scenarios).&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The main object of the game is to get 10 points, mostly by having your mice get food from the refrigerator back into the mouse-hole. The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered &quot;Clobbered&quot; and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects. In the basic game, you get 4 points for having your mice get a piece of food back to the mouse-hole, and 1 point when your cat clobbers an opponent's mouse. Optional rules include rules for variable points for the different types of food (cheese, drumstick, apple)&#10;&#10;",

Let 's hope that you have better cards than your opponents!&#10;&#10;Two teams of two or three players compete with the aim to open as many pubs as they can. But they not only try to set up their own enterprise but also to cancel the efforts of the other team by any means. For this purpose the teams can hire hooligans and bombers to threat the opponents. They can also cause other inconveniences like influenza for the personnel of the other team, pipe bursts or denial of credit. The other team can defend themselves with their own hooligans, managers or the two doormen Gaston and Gustave. Both, developing / opening of pubs and getting rid of the competitors, gain points. You have, for example, destroyed the other teams disco. Not only do the others not score points with their disco if you call a disco your own, their customers come to your premises (where else could they dance?)  and you collect MONEY (points)!! But even if you only have a simple beer garden, the bomb attack was useful for your business because the disco-dancers will visit the other pubs of the quarter if they don 't find their favorite disco, and yours is one of them.&#10;&#10;By the end of the game the most successful gastronome is obviously the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;",

It is played with a deck which is basically two standard decks of cards with some interesting variations on suits and the four Jokers thrown in. To start, each player is dealt four cards which form the basis for four stacks. The goal is to have each stack sum to 21 points. Any stack which sums to greater than 21 points is immediately tossed out. Any stack that sums to less is still in play. Only stacks that sum to 21 score. When all stacks have either scored or blown, the round is over.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players do essentially two things in Ferkelei: Shift their portfolios of stock in show pigs, and play cards to award prize money to pigs (or cause them to lose money or not to win). Many stock-based games have these features, but this game has a significant bandwagon effect. As one color of pig became active, many players would accumulate its stock, and the stockholders would naturally do things that helped each other, without forming explicit alliances. Then the color would play out, or other players would quash it or play the negative pig, and the game would move on to another color. The effect is like successive waves of popularity being washed out or dashed.&#10;&#10;More about the mechanics for those who are interested: On each turn, the player may exchange one stock chip for another or buy one. (At the start, nobody has cash to buy, so they only have their initial two chips available for exchange.) Then the player plays as many cards of one color as they like (from zero to five, except zero is not allowed if one has five or the draw pile is empty). Playing the cards can cover up competing pigs and/or bring one's favored pig to the fore, awarding it prizes depending on how far it has reached and how many times it appears on the board.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Merchants, with a number of changes&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Nomination Whist variant that is played with an odd deck of cards. The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which &#10;count as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a&#10;bonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score&#10;20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end&#10;of a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each&#10;player uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,&#10;this suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off&#10;here between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.&#10;However, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away &#10;a high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has &#10;been determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.&#10;This gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.&#10;&#10;",

After this, cards of any suit may be played on open cards in runs of ascending or descending order. At the end of a turn, a player must play a card even if he was able to discard. If a player puts a card into a run that could have been used to open a card, he loses a turn and must take a penalty card from the player who catches him in the act.&#10;&#10;",

Kings, aces and jokers are used as special action cards. After dealing out all the cards, four dice rolls determine the four penalty numbers. Any one who has the corresponding cards in their hands must pay to the kitty. In phase two, each player rolls the dice and either advances the corresponding peg on the board or pays more to the pot if the a penalty number is rolled. Like Parker Bros. &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, the length of each track is proportional to the probability of the roll. Therefore, the  &quot;7&quot; peg must travel the greatest distance while the &quot;2&quot; and &quot;12&quot; (Queen) pegs need only travel three spaces to win. When a peg crosses the finish line unchallenged, each corresponding card in players' hands are worth a quarter of the pot.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Ultimate Soccer is a new and exciting soccer board game that allows you to be the player as well as the coach.  You play against each other alternating as an attacker and a defender.  The attacker can select either a Fate or an Action card from draw piles.  Action cards map out actual plays with 2-6 passes and a shot on goal.  Each Action card has a number on it 5v3 or 3v3.  These numbers tell you how many dice you will be rolling against each other for each pass.  The attacker is always the first number.  If the attacker rolls a higher number it completes the pass and you go on to the next pass, if the defender rolls a higher number than the attacker the pass was not complete and the action card gets discarded and now the defender draws a Fate or Action card and becomes the attacker.  If the attacker completes all of his passes and is now at the last line on the card this is the shot on goal.  For the shot on goal the attacker and the defender only roll one die a piece to simulate the shooter and the goalkeeper.&#10;&#10;Fate cards are things that can happen during a game like red card, injuries, goalkeeper saves.  Fate cards can be used at any time to help you in your game.  The game is complete when all the action cards have been used.  Unless someone has an injury time fate card and wants to use it.&#10;&#10;",

It has two new pieces called Princes which combine the powers of the chess knight and the Big Battle Queen. The Big Battle queen in addition to the powers of the ordinary chess queen can also jump over an immediately adjacent piece. The pawns (called soldiers in Big Battle) can move one two or threes squares; not just on their first moves but for any move. It makes for a pretty sharp end game. Almost all the pieces in Big Battle have enhanced powers when compared to their chess counterparts. There have been a number of Big Battle tournaments in New Zealand, including two national tournaments. You can find out more about Big Battle at the Chess Variants page or at Zillions of games. They have a script for playing Big Battle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "According to the Designer/Publisher:&#10;&#10;SMUGGLE is a family action adventure board game that allows individual or team play.  The winner is the first player to complete a major, minor, and short treasure route.  Treasure Routes are diamonds, rubies, Inca Gold, Art Treasures, Mexican Silver, and money.  Play is accomplished on a dual-action board game, with movement of Jetliners on the peripheral Treasure Runway, which dictate the movement of Treasure Seekers and Treasure Couriers along the Treasure Routes on the world map in the center of the board. When a Seeker reaches a Destination Foreign City (New York to Johannesburg for Diamonds), a suitcase which is color coded to the Treasure Route (Orange for Major Routes, Gold for Minor Routes, and Grape for Short Routes) is attached to the base of the Seeker, which becomes a Treasure Courier.  The Courier then returns the Treasure (in the suitcase!) to the U.S. City of Embarkation.  When the Courier reaches the Customs 12 Mile Limit it can't move without declaring the treasure or making a smuggle attempt.  SMUGGLE cards are collected to facilitate the smuggle attempts.  Yin Yang Cards bring good fortune or bad fortune along the way. Each game has different dynamics.  Gals can square off against the guys and youngsters like to beat up on the adults!  There is interaction of players all along the Treasure Routes.  All players are in the game until it is over.  The play builds in excitement until the game-winning treasure is smuggled.  Smuggle Masters can team up against Treasure Czars for two teams of three players.  Three teams of two players include Border Jumpers, Port Runners, and Bootleggers.  Or it can be everybody for themselves. Everything is color coded for quick visual reference as to players and pieces.  Quick Start Rules supplement the Rules of Play to allow immediate play to begin.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;The game changes the base game in three main ways:&#10;&#10;First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.&#10;&#10;Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)&#10;&#10;Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.&#10;&#10;",

Each player then takes it in turn to roll the number dice and move their train along the allotted spaces, they must then give an answer from the category they land on using the last letter from the previous players answer as the starting letter of their answer...and so on.&#10;&#10;For example&#10;The game is in full flow and it's your turn, the player to your right has left you on an 'E' by saying Bruce leE (they were on the actor/actress square). You roll the dice, you move four spaces and land on the music square. You only have 60 seconds to say the name of a group or singer whose name begins with an 'E'.&#10;&#10;Who do you say...the sands of time are slipping away...if you don't say a name soon you will lose one of your passengers, there's only a few seconds left...what about Elvis presleY. It gets you out of trouble and leaves the next player on a 'Y', they could now be the one in trouble with you taking one of their passengers.&#10;&#10;",
