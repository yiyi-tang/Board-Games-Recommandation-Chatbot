    "Description": "&ldquo;Millions of years in the future, admits a universe dying a cold, premature death, mankind has overcome great challenges. They have conquered and outlived every alien race. They have overthrown a millennial reign of a cruel quasi-immortal tyrant. They have occupied all the remaining habitable galaxies of the Universe. But their greatest challenge is now themselves. The Human species has evolved into two different peoples: the Morlocks and the Eloi. And now they battle each other to determine which of them shall be masters of the universe.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;One player plays the space fleets of the Eloi. The Eloi are a gentle, yet determined people, under the vigilant care of their Empress. They seek to liberate the six galaxies from the cruel Morlocks. One player plays the space fleets of the Morlock Empire. The Morlocks are a fierce and technologically advance people. The only way they wish to serve the Eloi, is on their dinner tables. Each player uses an identical deck of cards. Six sided dice will also be required.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Goal: To win, one player must possess all six of the inhabitable galaxies of the Universe. To capture (or recapture) a galaxy card, one must win a battle by destroying all of the opponent&rsquo;s ships.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

Their goal is to overrun the American defenders, however their leadership and troop Strength is being decimated. Can the British complete the task before it is too late? Victory: The Americans win if all British units are destroyed. The British win if all American units are overrun. Otherwise the British score is the number of American units that were overrun.

The face-up number shows the strength of each unit. The units are moved down a twenty space track. Moving dice off the end of the track helps reduce the strength of the American forces by removing cards from the American Troop deck. The British win when all American Troop cards have been eliminated.&#10;&#10;The game may be played in three different ways: solitaire, two-player (American versus British), or multiplayer (two or more players play the British competing for high score).&#10;&#10;",
