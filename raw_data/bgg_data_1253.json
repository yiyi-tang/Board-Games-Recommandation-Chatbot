You will need Tongs or Slotted Ladle to cook ingredients, and Bowls to contain the cooked ingredients. You get to roll the dice for each bowl card played in front of you. If you manage to roll a matching colour with an ingredient in the cooked area, dip it into a sauce before you eat by picking a Sauce Card, and yum!&#10;&#10;The game is designed to accommodate players of different levels:&#10;&#10;Simple (with young children)&#10;- Bowl cards are separated into another drawing pile. &#10;- King of the Pot is removed from the deck.&#10;- Orange Sauce removed from Sauce deck&#10;&#10;Normal (general game)&#10;- Bowl cards are shuffled into the action deck.&#10;- King of the Pot is added to the deck.&#10;- All Sauce cards in use.&#10;&#10;Advanced (familiar players of the game)&#10;- Cooked ingredients are only shown to all players once before being placed in the pot.&#10;- Advancement to Frenzy Phase (swapping of ingredients).&#10;- Longer gameplay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Most abstract strategy games are played with a single, central goal in mind, or sometimes a secondary goal. For example, in Chess it is to checkmate the King, in Checkers it is to eliminate all of the opponent's pieces or force a stalemate. Aggression is different in that it has several possible goals in play simultaneously. All the pieces move and capture the same as one another. Complexity of play is achieved by having a unique win/loss condition tied to each separate piece type. Players must juggle the demands of multiple goals and adjust strategies throughout play.&#10;&#10;Pieces have two kinds of movement, a March or a Lunge. A March is a sliding move in a straight line any number of empty squares, like a Chess Queen. A Lunge is a capturing move. The piece jumps over an adjacent enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Only one piece can be captured on a turn. Multiple jumps are not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 7x8 board. On each player's back row, the central space is marked with a flag.&#10;&#10;The Blue player goes first. Each player begins with a Scout in hand. On their first turn, a player moves forward one of his Infantry pieces. Then he drops his Scout on any empty square on the board, as long as it is not under attack. After that, each player makes two moves per turn. First moving one of his regular pieces, then moving his Scout.&#10;&#10;The Scout and the General are both defensive pieces and have the further restriction of not being allowed to move to a space where they can be attacked. Since there are two moves involved each turn, it is permitted to move the General to a space where it may be jumped by an enemy piece, as long as the Scout immediately moves behind the General to guard it.&#10;&#10;The piece types and their winning conditions are:&#10;&#10;Scout: [Blockade] A Scout requires freedom of movement to do its job. If a player is able to trap or capture the opponent's Scout so that it has no legal move on its turn, the player wins.&#10;&#10;Infantry: [Elimination] If all seven units of the opponent's Infantry are captured, the player wins.&#10;&#10;Sapper: [Arrangement] Sappers seek to construct a fortification within enemy territory. 'Enemy territory' is defined as the four rows on the opponent's side of the board. A 'fortification' is three Sappers connected in a row, horizontally or vertically. Diagonally does not count.&#10;&#10;Saboteur: [Traversal] A Saboteur seeks to blow up the enemy's Regimental Headquarters. The HQ is the central space located on a player's back row, and is marked with a flag. The player wins if he is able to move the Saboteur safely across the board and on to the opponent's Regimental Headquarters square.&#10;&#10;General: [Checkmate] The player wins if they are able to checkmate the opponent's General. As in Chess, if the player's General is in Check, then the player on their next move must get their General out of check, if possible.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The board game is based on the film WolfWalkers.&#10;&#10;ABOUT THE FILM&#10;&#10;In a time of superstition and magic, a young apprentice hunter, Robyn Goodfellowe, journeys to Ireland with her father to wipe out the last wolf pack. While exploring the forbidden lands outside the city walls, Robyn befriends a free-spirited girl, Mebh, a member of a mysterious tribe rumored to have the ability to transform into wolves by night. As they search for Mebh&rsquo;s missing mother, Robyn uncovers a secret that draws her further into the enchanted world of the WOLFWALKERS and risks turning into the very thing her father is tasked to destroy.&#10;&#10;ABOUT THE BOARD GAME&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to find three parts of the wolf soul in one colour and bring it back to the Lair before soldiers, who start in the town area on one side of the board, reach the Lair on the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;The central board has a grid (called road) with fields marked with four different symbols. Some of the fields are connected with a path to the area with stacks of tiles. There are rune symbols at each intersection which represent the runes players collect during the game to buy the tiles. The grid is divided into three town areas with two fields marked for soldiers at the top of the board and nine forest areas at the bottom with the Lair area where players start the game &ndash; each with their own Wolfwalker figure.&#10;&#10;Each area has a stack with a certain number of tiles which depends on the mode players choose. In general, there are four types of tiles: a) tiles that move soldiers toward the Lair; b) wolf souls that the players try to find (three parts in three colours); c) tiles that help players find the wolf souls or change the soldier movements and d) neutral tiles. Each game mode adds some tiles or changes their meaning.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the player rolls a die and moves along any road. They have to stop on the first field with a symbol matching the symbol on the die. Then they count the rune symbols they passed on their way and take the rune tokens which are used to buy the tiles. It is possible to get more than one rune in one turn (if you pass two rune symbols, you get two runes, etc.). If the field they ended their movement on is connected with a path to a stack of tiles, they reveal the top tile(s). If they reveal a soldier tile, they have to move one of the soldiers in the direction shown on the tile. If the tile has a price (wolf souls, tiles that help players) the player can buy it with runes they collected. If the bought tile is a wolf soul, they place it in front of them. If it is any other tile, they have to use it immediately (e.g., you have another turn; move one of the soldiers in any direction).&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are two special symbols on the die that allow players to either reveal any top tile on the board or buy any revealed tile on the board.&#10;&#10;The game has three cooperative game modes with each adding additional rules and new tiles (e.g., look at the top tile of any stack, then place it on top of any pile face down) or more soldier tiles to make the game more difficult. The fourth mode is the competitive mode with the player who collects the completed wolf soul and brings it back to the Lair first winning.&#10;&#10;At the end of the rules you can also find achievements (e.g., win three games in a row, play solo with two Wolfwalker figures) and challenges that change the rules a bit in a unique way (e.g., win with soldiers being at the two rune symbols at the top of the board at the end of the game; each player looks at two chosen stacks of tiles in secret before the game starts. For the rest of the game you cannot communicate.)&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Collect sets of breakfast or tea time menus and gain victory points. In this tiny set collection game you play sets of cards to score points and get your hand empty, because this brings you bonus points.&#10;The twist is between collecting bigger sets to score more points for a single set or play smaller sets to score for the empty-hand-bonus and get 5 new cards for free.&#10;&#10;With the new refill-edition you can play the game with up to 6 players and you get the new refill cards. These return a tea or coffee back to your hand or bring an extra point on cake sets. You must flip your refill-card after every use.&#10;&#10;The game comes in a tiny tin box and you can take it with you everywhere you go.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A tile placement game for all ages, this intuitive-to-play and fast moving game involves pattern (tile edge) matching and spatial recognition. The game is played with six-sided tiles, each edge having either one, two, three or four pips.&#10;&#10;Usually a 2-4 player game, Hexinos can be played by five player (six is unwieldly and its too long between turns).&#10;&#10;All players start each turn with two tiles (hidden from the other players). On their turn the player places one of those two tiles onto the game table, matching at least one edge of their six sided tile to a tile edge already on the game table. That placement is immediately scored (see below), the player retrieves another tile from the facedown tilepile and then the player to their left takes their turn. Play continues until all tiles have been placed.&#10;&#10;There are two ways of scoring Hexinos tile placement: Basic and Advanced. Basic can be used with younger kids or just to make the game play go a bit faster.&#10;&#10;Basic scoring is super basic - if the player matches:&#10;&#10;+  one edge of their tile to one edge of a tile already on the game table: score one point&#10;&#10;+ two edges of their tile: score three points&#10;&#10;+  three edges of their tile: score six points&#10;&#10;+ four edges of their tile: score ten points&#10;&#10;+  five edges of their tile: score fifteen points&#10;&#10;+ all edges of their tile - the &quot;perfect match&quot;: that player wins immediately.&#10;&#10;Advanced scoring requires both addition and multiplication:&#10;&#10;+  one edge of their tile to one edge of a tile already on the game table: score one point for each pip on that matching edge of the player's tile (e.g. if the matching tile edge has three pips, its three points (not six))&#10;&#10;+ two edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by two&#10;&#10;+  three edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by three&#10;&#10;+ four edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by four&#10;&#10;+  five edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by five&#10;&#10;For both Basic and Advanced scoring - if the placed tile closes off an empty tile space (called &quot;bridging&quot;), the placing player scores as usual for the edges that match, then a bonus of six points for each empty hex that has been closed off.&#10;&#10;A note about younger players:&#10;As long as the player can hold and place the tiles, Hexinos can be played at any age. For younger players it encourages both pattern matching and spatial recognition - seeing their tile with an edge with 2 pips next to a 3 pip edge, but does that match what is on the tiles already on the table, or is the 2 &amp; 3 &quot;backwards&quot;? And with the basic scoring system, kids easily grasp the benefit of &quot;more edges matching is better&quot; without needed to know addition or multiplication.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each set of checkers is numbered 1-6 twice.&#10;&#10;In each game the pieces are randomly placed in the usual Checkers starting positions. (A variant is given where after determining first player, the second player's pieces are re-arranged to match the first player's.)&#10;&#10;Game 1 is played like Checkers except that a piece can only jump a piece with an equal or lower number. The object is to capture both opposing 6s, although a player also wins if their opponent can no longer move.&#10;&#10;In Game 2 players score points every time they make a jump - normally the absolute difference between the jumping piece's number and that on the piece being jumped, but if the numbers add to seven or eleven that many points are scored instead. When no captures can be made remaining pieces are added to players' scores.&#10;&#10;Game 3 also uses scoring, in a different way. In this game when a piece is jumped the capturing player keeps it in front of them in a scoring area, and when a piece reaches the back row it is removed and added to its owner's scoring area. (There are no kings.) The winner is the first player to reach 30 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You're a villain, but not very good at it &mdash; Take on the role of a B-list villain who didn&rsquo;t quite make the cut! In an attempt to capture at least a little bit of infamy, you&rsquo;re racing other not-so-super villains to publish a book about your misdeeds. Travel around the city hiring dastardly henchman, building outrageous gadgets, and committing pranks and petty crimes. Then write it all down for your (hopefully) best-selling novel!&#10;&#10;In Book of Villainy, you move around various locations in rondel fashion, collecting sets of henchman to complete chapters for your book. You score points by collecting chapters with certain themes and arranging the chapters of your book in ascending order.&#10;&#10;Once any player completes their book, the game ends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

From that point on players take turns to:&#10;&#10;Place a stone on a cell adjacent to the last stone placed by the opponent, and ...&#10;    ... place a stone on a cell that has only vacant cells as neighbors.&#10;&#10;When the player to move cannot make the second placement of their turn, their turn ends, the restricted placement phase ends, and the free placement phase begins.&#10;&#10;2. The free placement phase&#10;&#10;Now players take turns placing one stone on any vacant cell.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the board has only 1 empty cell remaining. (Now each player has placed the same number of stones.)&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins. A player's score is the product of the sizes of all his groups. Ties are rare but possible.&#10;&#10;Several games by Christian Freeling use this &quot;one bound, one free&quot; placement protocol, which he began exploring in 2012.&#10;&#10;",

After that, it&rsquo;s an all-out bidding war to see who can tip-toe the furthest around the volcano &mdash; without getting burned.&#10;&#10;Instructions.&#10;&#10;Gameplay takes place over a series of rounds. At the start of each round, players must set their lava traps.&#10;&#10;&#10;Out of sight of the other players, take your cluster of Blinks in setup mode and single click any number of them to activate (or de-activate) a lava trap. Lava traps look like 2 red faces rotating around the Blink, while non-trap pieces are 2 green faces rotating. Make sure to remember where you place your traps!&#10;&#10;Once satisfied with your trap placement, double click any Blink in your cluster to hide your lava traps under a beautiful green grassy hill.&#10;&#10;With the traps hidden, all the players connect their Blinks back together into one mega cluster. The oldest player starts by betting how many Blinks they can click without hitting any Lava Traps (e.g. &ldquo;I think I can click two Blinks without hitting any lava&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;The player on their left must now either raise or challenge. If they raise, they must bet a higher number (e.g. 3 Blinks or more). But if they challenge, the previous player must carry out their bet to see if they can do it. They must start by single clicking one of their own Blinks. After that, they can click any Blinks they like.&#10;&#10;If the player that has been challenged fails to click all the Blinks wagered without touching lava, the Volcano will erupt, spraying ash everywhere and covering the hill with lava. A new round now begins, but the player who lost the challenge will have one Blink removed from their cluster (e.g. if last round they had 4 Blinks, this round they will have 3). However, if the player successfully completed the challenge and didn&rsquo;t set off the Volcano, in the next round the player that challenged them will lose a Blink.&#10;&#10;",

A beam of energy will automatically shoot out of your gadget in a straight line into the mansion, destroying any spirits in its path. &#10;Your gadget has 3 different weapon functions. To switch between weapons, single click your weapon Blink. &#10;There are four types of apparitions that may appear depending on the level you selected, and each one can only be killed by a specific weapon on your gadget.

Make sure to zap the ghosts before they fully materialize, or the mansion will be lost. &#10; WIN CONDITION&#10;If an apparition fully materializes in this plane before you zap it, the mansion will become irreparably infested with demons and you will have lost. However, if you are able to ward off spirits for a whole minute then the house will be cleansed and glow with a holy yellow light. &#10;You may then double-click any Blink to return to level select, and pick a new level to battle the ghosts again.&#10;&#10;",

There is also a piece representing the ball and a pair of dice.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player rolls both dice, which give movement points to use for their players and/or the ball. One die is used for forwards and backwards movement and the other for sideways and diagonal movement.&#10;&#10;The game generally follows Rugby Union rules (e.g. no forward passes) and points are scored the same way.&#10;&#10;The game was published by the designer under the game APT Games.&#10;&#10;",

This line separates the two sides, white against blue.&#10;The goal of the game is to obtain the largest number possible of consecutive signs or of a same symbol. The principle is to put down a pair of cards of same sign in order to be allowed to place a third card on his side of the Zodiac. &#10;It is permitted to place a sign on the line only if it is different from the ones which are already on its side. If the opponent has already placed a card there, then a battle is engaged to determine which player will keep that sign.&#10;For the battle, both players secretly choose a die among their available dice. The dice are thrown and the winner is the player obtaining the highest score. The used dice are then put away.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Permute is an abstract strategy game inspired by the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube.  In Permute, two players take it in turns to twist 2x2 sets of pieces on the board, attempting to 'solve' together connected groups of their pieces.  The player who builds the bigger solved group wins the game &ndash; but at any time, the opponent can step in and twist your groups apart again!&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Permute is played on a square board filled with orange and yellow playing pieces in an alternating checkerboard pattern.  Orange always plays first.  Players take it in turns to select a 2x2 area of the board, called a &lsquo;face&rsquo;, and twist the pieces within that area 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, as if rotating the face of a 2x2 Rubik&rsquo;s Cube.  After twisting, the active player must flip over or &lsquo;bandage&rsquo; one of her pieces in that face; bandaged pieces may not be part of any more twisting moves for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, the accumulating bandaged pieces eventually make any further twists impossible; at that point, the game is over.  Players then count up their largest connected ('solved') group of pieces of their colour; pieces only count as connected when they are horizontally or vertically adjacent.  The player with the largest solved group of pieces wins the game.  If the players are tied for the largest group, then the second-largest groups of each player are compared to determine the winner; if those are also tied, then the third-largest groups are compared; and so on.&#10;&#10;Permute is a scalable game and can be played on any board size. &#10; Playing on a 12x12 board is recommended for casual play, and a 16x16 board for deeper strategic contests.  A typical game on a 12x12 board will last 40-50 turns; a 16x16 game will last 70-80 turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
