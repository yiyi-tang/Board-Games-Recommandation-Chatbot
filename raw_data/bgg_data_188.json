Players then tally their scores, earning 3 points for each border that contains more of their marks than the opponent's, 2 or 4 points for each trough they control, and 2-20 points for each herd they have, depending on the size of the herd.

    "Description": "The Battle of Lepanto is a two-player or multi-player (Ottoman versus Christian) operational level game, designed by Robert Cowling. The game includes 280 die-cut counters, with the each warship chit representing two ships per counter; there are three primary ships types: Galleys, Galliots and Galleasses, each with different capabilities. The colorful map features the Ionian Sea, printed with the historical set up of both sides just as the two opposing fleets were arrayed to begin battle, as well as various charts and tables for easy reference during play. The land area featured represents the peninsular areas of the Grecian mainland.&#10;&#10;The rules entail a variety of mechanics pertaining to 16th century naval combat, such as Wind Direction, Ramming, Boarding, Small-Arms Fire, Gunnery Ranges, Exhaustion, Galliot Shoreline Movement, Christian Small-Arms Advantages, Ottoman Maneuver Advantages, as well as the designations of the historical admirals in the battle, such as Don Juan, Ali Pasha, etc.&#10;&#10;The easy and quick game sequence is as follows:&#10;&#10;Movement&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;&#10;Reorientation&#10;&#10;Movement is regulated in terms of the front and back side of each warship chit. As each ship completes its movement, it is flipped from its A (Alpha) side over to its O (Omega) side (or vice versa, if they began the turn on their Omega sides). When all desired moves have been completed, the player&rsquo;s remaining ships are also flipped to their O (Omega) side (or vice versa, if they began the turn on their Omega sides) to indicate the end of the entire Movement Phase. In this way, players may easily keep track of which ships have moved, and which have not, during each game turn.&#10;&#10;Victory in the game is determined by the accumulation of VPs for eliminated and damaged ships that have been inflicted by each side.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A boardgame of 19th-Century Mars, set in the Space 1889 RPG universe, players take the role of one of 10 adventurers leading an expedition into the mines of the sinister Martian King Gnaashriik in an attempt to rescue slaves and gather up loot.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special ability useful throughout the game plus an special way to score extra points (For example, if Sir Colton-Haynes recovers the Ancient Tablets, he scores 10 points instead of the normal 4).&#10;&#10;The board is made of tiles which are shuffled and placed face-down to form a mine shaft 5 levels deep.&#10;&#10;Each turn players move through the mines, turning over tiles to create a series of passages and rooms, discovering and fighting off Martian baddies, and grabbing whatever goodies they can find.&#10;&#10;There is a deck of cards that drives discoveries and can allow characters to find hidden passages, set off a trap, or wander upon an extra nasty combat.&#10;&#10;The deck is also the endgame timer.  Once it is depleted, players rush to the surface to end the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Space 1889 Adversaries&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bourre (pronounced &quot;boo-ray&quot;) is a trick-taking card game similar to Spades. It is widely played in Louisiana, particularly within the Cajun culture and on the off-shore oil platforms near the Louisiana Gulf Coast.&#10;&#10;Bourre uses a standard 52-card deck. Players ante up and are dealt a five card hand. They may then &quot;fold&quot; or continue, swapping out up to all five cards (in some variants they will re-ante to play a hand). The rules are fairly straightforward:&#10; (from Wikipedia entry):&#10;   1. You must play to win. This goes beyond simply &quot;playing a higher card&quot;; if you know that no one else has any trumps, and it is your turn to lead, you must play trumps if you have them.&#10;   2. You must play on-suit if possible, even if your highest on-suit card will not beat the highest card in play. Even if a trump has been played on a non-trump lead, if you have a card of the suit led, you must play on that suit.&#10;   3. You must play a trump if you have no on-suit cards. You still must play to win; if the only trump played is a 3, you hold the 2 and the Ace of trumps but no cards of the lead suit, you must play the Ace of trumps.&#10;   4. If you have neither any cards of the lead suit nor any trumps, you may play any card. This is an off card, and is effectively lower than the 2 of the lead suit.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, the person with the most tricks, takes the pot. If there is a tie, the pot stays in for the next round. If one of the players who played a hand did not take any tricks at all, he is said to have &quot;bourreed&quot; and must match the pot as his ante for the next round. Needless to say, the pot can get quite large, especially with larger groups playing.&#10;&#10;",

Numerous guests had accepted the invitation to the funeral service for the late queen, and now await the mourning king&rsquo;s eulogy. After all, he is now without an heir to the throne &ndash; and many of those present sense an opportunity for themselves. When the king finally rises, there is a hushed silence. He raises his goblet and lets his keen gaze wander from face to face. &ldquo;Few of you are here to mourn my beloved wife with me,&rdquo; the king begins, and takes a sip from the goblet. Suddenly he begins to cough and puts his hand to his throat. He collapses, knocking food from the table. A murmur goes through the crowd as orders are shouted frantically for aid. The king is carried out of the hall in a hurry, and minutes of dismay pass. Then the personal doctor emerges and announces to all, &quot;The king is dead!&quot;&#10;&#10;In UNDO: Long Live the King, players learn the rules and encounter the starting situation of the case on the first few cards, which also guide them through the setup. Once the setup is complete, players carry out nine time jumps. Every jump takes them to one independent moment from the past and allows them to change that moment in one of three ways, which may change the starting situation for better or for worse. The players need to discuss what they know and try to come up with theories about the story, using the clues they gather from the different time jumps. Only by continuously adapting their theories and making the right choices will they successfully change fate and save the life of the king.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.&#10;&#10;The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece.

    "Description": "What red-blooded lad hasn't imagined himself fighting at the side of Robin Hood against the evil Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham? Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, Robin Hood and his Merry Men are all part of a young man's rite of passage from childhood flights of fancy. Long the stuff of screen legend, Robin Hood now lives again in a game format for the entire family.&#10;&#10;So come with us back to the greenwood in twelfth century England as our heroes Robin, Little john, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and Allan A&rsquo; Dale scour the countryside with quarter staff and long bow rob the rich and save the poor from the oppressions of nobles and clergy. Each player assumes the role of an outlaw clad in Lincoln green and tries to outdo his fellows in amassing the most gold by winning archery contests, recruiting stout yeomen, or robbing wealthy travelers. But beware; the woods are full of the Sheriff's men. Ambushes by Prince John or Sir Guy of Guisbourne could land you in irons in a castle dungeon.&#10;&#10;Play is extremely simple as each player maneuvers his band across the map using playing cards that both dictate the action and define the sequence of play with little or no reference to the rules. Yet, strategy is important. You can opt to stick to the relative safety of the woods and dine on the King's deer or don a disguise to sneak into Nottingham Castle to cudgel the Sheriff himself.&#10;&#10;",

There are two variants described, a 2-6 player game as well as a 2-player version outlined in the rules.&#10;&#10;Broad appeal to children and adults due to the clear mechanics and straight-forward play.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes 44 cards in 11 groups of four different images. Players build up their 'stash piles' by 'patenting' as many 'claims' as possible. This is accomplished by collecting sets in multiple stacks by drawing from a draw pile or common pool of 8 tiles in the center of the table based on matches and placing tiles into the pool if no match can be found.&#10;&#10;Matches can also be made with the top card of piles of any other player. The end game comes when all cards are in the possession of the players, and the stacks are consolidated to determine who has the largest stack of claims.&#10;&#10;The 2-player variant involves repeat-dealing of four cards to players when their hands are exhausted by set collection from the pool until all cards from the deck have been utilized.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;    R&#195;&#164;uber&#10;&#10;&#10;",

And maybe that somebody is you...&#10;&#10;The Asylum is a small dice-based solitaire game. Each time a room is entered for the first time, a relic is found and dice are assigned for future moves. The player must complete three tasks to gain the clues that will identify the cursed relic. Then they must get that relic and escape from the asylum, all using the limited dice rolls available. Extra rolls are available by locking the room, but this shuts down the possibilities for future movement. And once the ghost is alerted to your presence it comes after you. If you get caught or trapped then you lose the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, the player starts with the airplane in one corner and rolls the four-sided &quot;dice sticks&quot;; each dice stick has four colored arrows on its sides (red, yellow, green, blue), and after rolling she can move the plane along a colored arrow to an adjacent island as long as she rolled that color on a die. If she lands on an island with a canister, she must place one of her dice on it. She can then end her turn and score the number of coins shown on this island, or she can roll again; if she rolls again and can't move the plane, her turn ends and she scores nothing.&#10;&#10;The first player to have collected 25 or more coins wins!&#10;&#10;",

The important thing, of course, is that your team must be able to figure out what that object is before time runs out. Words come in two degrees of difficulty. Players advance on a score track as they guess words, but as you near the finish line, a die roll determines how you're handicapped: eyes closed, using only string, one hand, limited number of objects, etc. On your second-to-last turn, your opponents choose which three objects you can use to create the word that your team needs to guess in order to win.&#10;&#10;",

In Mow Money, you and up to five other players compete as start-up landscape company owners armed with a push-mower, a few bucks, and big dreams of growing your businesses into landscaping powerhouses. The property owners in Walkerville generally award contracts to companies that agree to work for the lowest pay, but sometimes having a good reputation will sway the auction in your favor. Through cunning management of bids and odd jobs, your goal is about earning the best reputation &mdash; and while in this game reputation matters most, in the end, having a few extra bucks won't hurt.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Saipan was a critical objective in the US Navy's &quot;island hopping&quot; campaign in the Pacific; its two airfields were suitable for heavy bombers. Hence three US divisions were scheduled to invade Saipan on 15 June 1944, supported by nearly two-dozen battleships that had begun a bombardment two days before. More than 30,000 fanatic Japanese were entrenched on the island, dug into caves and other formidable defensive positions. The battle for Saipan proved to be one of the fiercest battles of the Pacific War, and the deadliest up to that time for both sides.&#10;&#10;Saipan utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From naval bombardment to bazookas, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single engineer battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by flamethrowers &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending a plateau. As its attack gets underway, however, the engineer battalion may suddenly come under fire from enemy mortars. More support will be needed to take the plateau, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Saipan the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of the battles in the Pacific. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting on Saipan. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 2 days&#10;    Hex: 1/3 mile (580 yards) / 538 meters&#10;    Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 17 x 22&quot; full color map&#10;    One dual-side printed countersheet (80 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One Saipan rulebook&#10;    One Fire &amp; Movement Folio Standard rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High (4 out of 5)&#10;Complexity Level: Low (2 out of 5)&#10;Players: 2&#10;Playing Time: 1-2 hours&#10;&#10;(from the Decision Games' website and back of folio)&#10;&#10;",

In the trick-taking card game Djinn, every captured trick shows the way to treasure, but the djinn can unexpectedly intervene in the action. Who can enter the famous treasure cave first?&#10;&#10;A game of Djinn lasts multiple rounds, with each round being eight tricks. Standard trick-taking rules are used, with players needing to follow suit of the card led, and throwing off whatever card they want if they can't follow suit. The deck contains four suits, with cards numbered 1-15 in each suit. Each player starts with a hand of eight cards and one djinn card that contains a special power a player can use on their turn. The top card of the deck is flipped to reveal the trump suit. Whenever a player wins a trick, they keep one card from this trick face up in front of them, discard the remaining cards, then lead to the next trick.&#10;&#10;After the round ends, players see whether they can discard captured cards to advance into the treasure cave, which is made up of three lines of challenge cards, with each challenge requiring three, four, or five cards depending on the row where it's located. Sample challenges might be to discard three cards that sum to more than 30, three cards of the same color, or three cards in numerical order. If a player completes one of the three challenges requiring three cards, they discard these three cards, then place their player token on the &quot;three challenge&quot; row. At the end of the next round, they can ideally complete one of the three four-card challenges. Players who are in the back of the pack receive a bonus djinn card before the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete one of the five-card challenges wins! If multiple players reach this row at the same time, ties are broken by the number of captured cards those players still hold.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the Decision Games' website:)&#10;&#10;By February 1943, much of the inexperienced US II Corps had been deployed along the trails leading through a small canyon known as Kasserine Pass. The US commander, Gen. Lloyd Fredendall, had overextended his lead units, dividing them into individual, unsupported packets while disregarded his flanks. Rommel was quick to recognize the opportunity to inflict a defeat on the untested Americans, and he soon mounted an offensive with two panzer divisions.&#10;&#10;Kasserine utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From artillery to dive bombers, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by mortars &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending a ridge. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself advancing through a minefield. More support will be necessary to take the ridge, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Kasserine, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of the battles in North Africa. Units are typically two-sided formations that can suffer casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting at Kasserine Pass. Winning is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium, Released Compass Games April 2021. Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium encompasses the Napoleonic years 1798-1815, and is designed for two to eight players, the game pitches eight Empire Nations of the Napoleonic Wars, divided into two Alliances in a fight to the death struggle for control of Napoleonic Europe.&#10;&#10;The objective of Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium is for one Alliance to conquer the other by either achieving a Capital Victory (capturing key enemy territories) or a Battle Points Victory (based on favorable outcomes and achievements made during game play).&#10;&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium is a team-based game! The key to winning Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium is your ability to strategize and work as a team with your allies. Each player rules an Empire with difference strengths and weakness, with different economic starting points and geographic positions. No two Empires are alike! Everyone brings something different to the table and in Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium survival relies on strong partnerships to capitalise your advantages!&#10;&#10;But although no two Empires are alike, the two opposing alliances are equal. The slight imbalance of commencement units is offset geographically and by the combination of Empire individual special abilities.&#10;&#10;Upheaval of changing alliances and treaty ramifications, weather and world events are all represented in the game via 160 beautifully designed &ldquo;Battle Cards&rdquo; that play out consequences of battlefield defeats!  These cards balance real history and real-world events with the element of chance and fog of war!&#10;&#10;And with Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium, the more you play, the more your individual rank and prestige grows as you earn both individual and team ranking points with every game!&#10;&#10;The average game would run five to six hours but can be campaigned to play for days. And it&rsquo;s straight into the cannon fire or cannon fodder depending on your battle fortunes as an average game would encompass an average of 80 to 100 battles!&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;Scope: Napoleonic Grand Strategic&#10;Complexity: 6 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 4 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 1 Turn = 1 Year&#10;Map Scale: Global map centred on Europe, North Africa&#10;Unit Scale: 10,000 men per Infantry unit, 2,000 men per Cavalry unit, 50 cannon per Artillery unit, 5 ships of the line per Fleet unit&#10;Playing Time: 4-6 hours for Battle Point Game, 6-15 hours for Campaign Game depending upon skill of players.

After a grueling hour of gaming, you discover that you've tied for first place with your arch nemesis, Toady Johansen. Again. You grab for the rulebook, but Toady is faster than you, and begins reading, &quot;In case of a tie, all players rejoice in their shared victory.&quot; You're outraged. Even Toady, who would be languishing in second-to-last place if it weren't for the kingmaking efforts of your other arch nemesis, Art Smithers, is visibly shaken. What is this, the World Cup? Unbelievable.&#10;&#10;But now, however, there's a solution to this problem (the tied player one, not that Cheeto issue..that'll have to wait until there are significant technological advances): TieBreaker. TieBreaker is the definitive method for determining who wins a tied game. And even though it's the follow-up from the designer of the award-winning Start Player, TieBreaker isn't at all random; it challenges each tied player to show, once and for all, that he is indeed deserving of victory by having the tied players compete in a simple challenge.&#10;&#10;With more than 50 cards and a giant orange TieBreaker meeple, you can always be confident that tied games will be resolved satisfactorily. There will be a winner, and most likely that winner will be you.&#10;&#10;Because, regardless of what your so-called politically-correct friends say, it really isn't about how you play the game. It's about crushing Toady Johansen until he cries for his momma.&#10;&#10;TieBreaker will debut October 2011 at Spiel.&#10;&#10;TieBreaker has already been awarded the Board 2 Pieces Game of the Year for 2011!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Serica is a game for two players and is about the trade between the ancient empires of Rome and the Han Dynasty of China (around 200 AD). Each player will draft cards into a deck, use those cards to send Trade Caravans across Asia, and build opportunities in trade, military and the court. Players must work together to trade goods while competing to build cards and gain victory points.&#10;&#10;Win: Players gain Victory Points (VP) by sending trade caravans across the Silk Road Trade Map and buying/building cards on their side of the Map. The game ends when one player builds 10 cards. At that point the player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Needed to Play: &#10;&bull; The deck of 54 cards (53 game cards and 1 Player Aid card).&#10;&bull; The game board showing the Silk Road map.&#10;&bull; 18 eurocubes in each of 6 colors (blue, red, yellow, green, white, purple) to represent the Trade Goods, plus 1 additional red and yellow eurocube for the Victory Point track.&#10;&bull; 15 gray/black eurocubes to represent Artisans.&#10;&bull; 3 pawns in red and yellow to represent the Trade Caravans.&#10;&#10;Setup: Decide who will be the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire and place the Silk Road Trade Map between both players. This map allows players to track their Trade Caravans across the Silk Road through Asia. It also designates areas for players to build fields of cards in the game to gain Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Play: &#10;Each round of the game consists of 4 phases. Each player will complete all phases in turn. Player 1 going first, followed by Player 2.&#10;(Note: Card abilities in a Player&rsquo;s Empire may be used at any time during &#10;phases 1-3, and all card abilities are cumulative.)&#10;&#10;&bull; Phase 1: Production                                                                           &#10;During Phase 1, the active player has 8 Production Points (PP) to spend. Production points are used to produce trade goods and hire artisans, which are in turn, used to buy cards, build cards and send Trade Caravans across the Silk Road for VP.&#10;&#10;&bull; Phase 2: Buy/Build/Defend                                                                              &#10;The active player may now do any of the following 3 actions. Actions must, however, be in the following order:&#10;&#10;A. Buy: Buy one or more cards from the Crossroads by discarding the correct number and type of trade goods listed on the card, from a player&rsquo;s supply. After buying a card, the player places this card on their discard pile next to their Player Empire (unless a card ability in a Player&rsquo;s Empire states otherwise), and replaces the card just purchased with a new card from the Crossroads draw pile. If there are no more cards in the Crossroads draw pile, cards cannot be replaced.&#10;&#10;B. Build: Build one or more cards from your player empire by discarding the correct number of artisans equal to the build cost as listed on the card. Place this card in one of the 4 fields located to the left or right of the Silk Road Trade Map as designated by the player&rsquo;s color (Note: a player may only build cards to their side of the Trade Map). Built cards gain victory points for the player. Add these victory points to the player&rsquo;s total on the Victory Point Track. Built cards no longer have their card abilities available to the player; they are now worth only victory points and, in some cases, defensive strength.&#10;&#10;Players may not switch cards in any field once built.&#10;&#10;Players may not build a card more than 3 cards in distance out from the Silk Road Trade Map&#10;&#10;Cards in fields do not have to match in name, type or color.&#10;&#10;Cards must be adjacent for additional stacked victory points.&#10;&#10;C. Defend: Defeat one Enemy card from the Crossroads if the total defensive strength in your player field is equal to or greater than the Enemy card&rsquo;s strength. Remove the Enemy card from the game and replace the empty space with a new card from the Crossroads draw pile. Gain any victory points and awards as listed on the Enemy card.&#10;&#10;&bull; Phase 3: Trade                                                                                &#10;The active player may now do only one of the following:&#10;&#10;a. Begin a new Trade Caravan: &#10;A player may ship up to 4 trade goods at any one time in a single Trade Caravan. They may ship fewer if they choose to. The Warehouse and Trading Post cards can add extra trade goods to a Trade Caravan.&#10;&#10;A player may move all of their Trade Caravan pawns one space towards the opposing player. (Note: Each Trader card in your Player Empire allows Trade Caravans to move one additional space during this phase). &#10;Any Enemy abilities are now applied for any Enemy cards in the Crossroads. These may result in the loss of Trade Goods or entire Trade Caravans. Trade Goods have the following values when determining which to lose: Gold and Silk (3), Wine and &#10;Porcelain (2), Glassware and Spices (1).&#10;If a player must lose an entire Trade Caravan, they may choose which to remove.&#10;&#10;&bull; Phase 4: Discard                                                                           &#10;The active player must now discard all cards from their Player Empire to their discard pile and deal out 4 new cards from their draw pile to their Player Empire. If there are not enough cards left to draw from, shuffle the discard pile and create a new draw pile. If there are still not enough cards to deal out 4 new cards the player will not have 4 cards in their Player Empire in the next round.&#10;&#10;Any Crossroads cards that have been discarded (not those that have been defeated during Phase 2) should be shuffled back into the Crossroads draw deck.&#10;&#10;End Game: Once a player has built 10 cards to their respective field the game ends immediately. The player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Milton Bradley marketed this game as a tie-in with Ralph Bakshi's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; animated feature film. However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a character from the Fellowship. The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.&#10;&#10;Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains. A special die tells players how many turns they will be bogged down in a mountain space once they enter it.&#10;&#10;Card and Ring management afford strategy opportunities, while the rules remain simple enough (and the game quick enough) to allow the game to be played by a wide variety of ages. Despite its divergence from the main story, the game itself offers a measure of challenge that makes it enjoyable - far more so than it would have been as a simple &quot;roll-and-move&quot; game with a strict adherence to the movie or book theme.&#10;&#10;",

The game begins with tiles placed face down to build the territory.  Players explore the territory while fighting enemy troops with knights, soldiers, a Pegasus, and captured dragons.  War is only one strategy to play -- players can also try to take the princess to the enemy castle and force her marriage to the local prince.&#10;&#10;For Draco Mundis&#10;The players have the responsibility of a team of various adventurers trying to gain victory points by exploring the jungle. All players start with exactly the same team.&#10;&#10;First they must lay down their pawns (characters, terrains) and then, in turn, realize two actions, like move, fight, or explore.&#10;&#10;In order to gain victory points, they can kill their opponents or manage to place some of their characters in strategic points on the map.&#10;&#10;Each pawn has its own constraints, e.g. all cannot move in every direction, or have the same movement points and fight points. Some have special abilities.&#10;&#10;",

Each player also has a set of four short blocks called &quot;biddis&quot;, with each biddi being one of four colors.&#10;&#10;In the first round, one player rolls four ten-sided dice the same colors as the biddis, rerolling as necessary until at least three different numbers show. Players then race to create a single stack of blocks that includes a biddi at the height shown on the matching colored die. If the red die shows a 3, for example, then the red biddi needs to be placed on third level. What's more, you must create a continuous black line up the face of these blocks, rotating and flipping the blocks as needed to keep the line continuous.&#10;&#10;When someone has created a stack six blocks high, they end the round. Then everyone scores 1 point for each block in their stack, starting from the table up to the highest legally placed block. The player who ended the round scores 2 bonus points for each biddi that shows the smiling face on it right-side-up in their stack.&#10;&#10;Players then complete six more rounds, stacking their blocks one higher level each round so that in the seventh round, they're placing all eight blocks and all four biddis in a stack twelve levels high. After scoring in this seventh round, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

You win by having the most &ldquo;Power&rdquo; at the end of the game. But you need to watch out; everyone else has their own agenda too. You each have an identity; Media Mogul, Tech Entrepreneur, Politician, Criminal Mastermind, Corrupt Copper or Celebrity. Just like in real life you will all be colluding and stabbing each other in the back. Similarly, you will all have &quot;Skeletons&quot; in your closet, representing your scandalous and misspent past.&#10;&#10;Starting with a &ldquo;chicken feed&rdquo; salary of &pound;100k, a few &ldquo;Favours&rdquo; in your pocket and ideas for new &ldquo;Business Ventures&rdquo; you build up a shady empire; from newspapers to apps and record labels to gambling rackets. As well as earning you more cash, each Venture gives you more Power while you control it. As a bonus, Ventures that are related and colour coded to your identity give you extra Power. For example, the Media Mogul will seek to own the Daily Hate Newspaper.&#10;&#10;As well as setting up Ventures, players take turns to make deals, extort enemies and use &ldquo;Favours&rdquo; to attack rivals or give themselves a boost. The game also allows for bluffing with Favours, which is one way to manipulate the situation to your advantage.&#10;&#10;They say the road to Power is paved with good intentions and some Favours offer a shadier path. If a Favour is illegal, like arms dealing or expenses fraud, playing this card will cause you to receive a &quot;Skeleton&quot; in your closet. These must be closely guarded as if uncovered, can cause you to lose Power.&#10;&#10;Build an empire and amass Power by manipulating your rivals...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the strategic tile-laying game Komodo, players are zoologists attempting to build new habitats for Australasian animals imperilled by an incoming asteroid. Each player holds two animal cards stating the type and amount of terrain needed, five multi-terrain tiles, and wild cards. On a turn, they may lay up to three tiles, place one or both of their animals in free-form contiguous blocks of appropriate terrain, and use all or some of their wild cards. The starter tile has two blocks of each of the four terrain types: forest, grassland, desert and water. The number of blocks of terrain needed by an animal is equivalent to the number of points you can score by placing it. When the tile supply is exhausted, each player takes a final turn, then loses points for any unplaced animals still in hand. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Komodo can be played competitively in both basic or strategic mode. In the former, wild cards are obtained randomly; in the latter, players can choose their wild cards. Actions permitted by a wild card include: releasing animals to free up their terrain; bartering or stealing terrain tiles; remodeling tiles already placed; and forcing an exchange of animals.&#10;&#10;In the cooperative version of Komodo, all 32 animals must be housed and each player must place at least one animal during their turn. The game is played open-handed, and the wild cards hinder the players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Wikipedia:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sueca is a 4 players game, that plays with two teams, partners sitting opposite from each other. It is played with 40 cards (remove the 8s, 9s, 10s from a standard 52 card deck). The rank of the cards in each suit, from highest rank to lowest one, is: Ace, 7, King, Jack, Queen, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. As well as the high position of the seven, notice that the jack beats the queen..&#10;&#10;The game is played clockwise. The first dealer is chosen at random and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.The player to the dealer's right shuffles the cards and the player at the dealer's left cuts. The dealer then gives 10 cards to each player, in a single batch, beginning with the player to dealer's left, going around clockwise and ending with the dealer. The bottom card of the deck, which belongs to the dealer, is turned face up, and its suit becomes trumps.Alternatively, the dealer can choose to deal the first ten cards to himself, the next ten to the player to his right, and so on counter-clockwise. In this case the dealer's first card (the original top card of the deck) is turned up and determines the trump suit.&#10;&#10;The player to the left of the dealer (the one who cut the cards) leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can. A player who has no card of the suit led may play any card. If any cards of the trump suit are played to a trick, the highest trump wins. Otherwise, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.&#10;&#10;Being considered a &quot;deaf-dumb persons game&quot; in Portugal, there can be no talking between the players and no exchange of signals between partners (considered cheating in tournament play). In casual play, though, this rule is frequently overridden, with signs actually being negotiated between partners prior to playing, which adds a different level of fun to the game - as each team tries to discover the others cheating signs so they can get the upper hand in play.&#10;&#10;In Sueca, the aim is to win tricks containing valuable cards. The card values are:&#10;Ace ..... 11 points&#10;7 ..... 10 points&#10;King ..... 4 points&#10;Jack ..... 3 points&#10;Queen ..... 2 points&#10;The rest of the cards = no points.&#10;&#10;There are 120 points in the deck altogether.&#10;&#10;The object of the play is to win tricks containing more than half of the card points. The team which takes more than 60 card points scores one game. The first team to score four games win the rubber.&#10;&#10;If a team takes 91 or more card points in tricks on one deal, they score two games instead of one.&#10;&#10;If they take all the tricks they score four games and thus win the rubber immediately. Taking 120 points but losing a trick (with no counting cards in it) is not sufficient to win the rubber. In this case the winning team would just score 2 games for having more than 90.&#10;&#10;In case of tie it's considered a null game... no team gets any point.&quot;&#10;&#10;There is a variant called Sueca Italiana which is for 5 players.&#10;&#10;",

Movement cards are drawn and must be chosen wisely, because only the numbers on the cards will reveal the turn order. Each round you will be planning three turns, which you will then carry out one by one. This cycle repeats until someone collects 20 gold (or more), thus immediately winning the game.&#10;&#10;As if that weren't enough adventure, the map offers a completely new world with every game: the game board can be arranged in more than 1.500 variations!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players place two each of six kinds of animals into two separate bags; someone shuffles the duel cards (after first removing any colors not in play), then places the four round cards in numerical order. Shuffle the three stacks of route cards, then reveal one card from each deck; each route card depicts an animal on the sign next to a taxi stop and some cards also show the animal on the card.&#10;&#10;In each round, you'll draw the duel cards one by one, and for each duel card the two players shown on the card each take a bag, then race to find one of the animals depicted on a face-up route card in their bag &mdash; without looking inside the bag, mind you. If a player finds the wrong animal, then the opponent can still find one; if the player finds the right animal, he takes the matching route card from the display and tries to add it to his start card on either the left or right side. The number of paths on adjacent cards must match! If they don't match, the player returns the card, gaining nothing, and the next duel card is drawn. In addition, if the route card actually depicts the animal in question, the player keeps the animal token instead of returning it to the bag.&#10;&#10;Once all the duel cards have been used, shuffle them and reveal the next round card. After four complete rounds or after one stack of route cards is empty, the game ends. Each player scores one point for each route card in her path and each animal in her collection; whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10;",

The deck also includes dancing candles that are wild, and can be used in place of any color.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, the first player to collect all eight differently colored candles wins. In the advanced game, the player with the highest score at game's end wins.

You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent&rsquo;s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made.

They prevent Sunken Chests from providing Treasure, and do nothing when they are played.&#10;&#10;The rest of the cards in the game do many awesome things, like help players find Sunken Chests faster, mess with other players&rsquo; cards, and provide bonuses/penalties.&#10;&#10;The waves can get a little wild, but we are sure you will conquer them and discover the riches you seek!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This Flip and Fill (roll and write) game has players taking on the role of a freight company owner. Over the course of three weeks(rounds) players will seek to load their trucks with good and deliver them to their customers. The earlier you deliver, the more you get paid, so time is of the essence. Will you send truck that are not fully loaded, or will you wait and see if you can fill a truck all the way up? The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview&#10;&#10;Each turn players will flip over 3 cards from a standard playing deck and use the cards to either load their trucks, or move them. Some trucks take certain goods (suits) and not others, while some trucks care more about the amount of goods (number on the card). Once you have decided a truck is full enough use the value on a card to move it, by marking off spaces on its path. However trucks in transit may not be loaded anymore, so choose wisely.&#10;&#10;At the end of each week all trucks that are delivered will score, while trucks in transit count for nothing. This means that trucks scored in the first week score score 3 times total, while trucks in the second week score 2 times, and trucks scored in the last week score once. Plan your moves wisely as waiting too long could mean a lower payout than you were hoping for.&#10;&#10;Game ends after 3 weeks each with 5 turns. Players total up money earned from all 3 weeks and the player with the most money wins. In the event of a tie the player with the most delivered trucks wins.&#10;&#10;",

We do recommend at least four dice per player. During a player's turn, the dice are rolled, the zombies chasing them, and depending on the result, the zombies are either killed, continue to pursue, or are passed to other players or into the Quarantine Zone. The first player to start their turn with no dice to roll escapes and is declared the winner. A four player game typically lasts 5 to 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;",
