The goal of the game is to occupy the enemy airport with the pilot in the middle, surrounded by the planes. Movement is determined by the number die in any direction. If the color die shows the color of the active player, he gets another turn (up to 3 turns in a row). On the roll of a 6 a plane or the pilot has to be moved from ist starting position, if possible. If a figure lands on a space with an enemy figure, the enemy is sent back to a starting space, now including the 2nd line. The figures can't move into their own airport.&#10;&#10;",

It is an adaptation of the well known game &quot;Pit,&quot; but instead of commodities like wheat, soybeans, corn... it uses the HOTTEST cryptos on the market!  Each card has must know facts about the coin itself and the game comes loaded with must know facts before investing.  Cryptocurrency is the biggest game changer since the invention of the internet, YET fewer than 1 in 4000 people even own a bitcoin!  Whether you are a serious investor or just want to have a fun time, this is the game for you!  Get ahead of the curve and have a blast!  Become familiar with crypto while playing the funnest game in your closet!&#10;&#10;Bitcoin the Card Game is fun for ages 7+ and for 3-8 Players. Multiple decks can be used for larger groups! 78 cards per deck; 8 suits (coins) of 9 identical cards, a hacker card, a miner card, an instruction card, 2 must know bitcoin facts cards, and a future of bitcoin card.  Only the coins and the hacker and miner cards are used in game play.&#10;&#10;OBJECT:&#10;&#10;Be the first crypto trader to score a total of 5000 points.  As soon as the dealer yells, &quot;BITCOIN,&quot; you become a crypto coin trader trying to &quot;own the marker&quot; of one of the following 8 coins: Bitcoin, Ethereal, Litecoin, Monero, Bitcoin Cash, NEM, Dash, or Coinye West.  You &quot;own&quot; that particular coin when you have in your hand all 9 cards of the same coin.&#10;&#10;SET UP&#10;&#10;1. Select a dealer&#10;&#10;2. Prepare a score sheet&#10;&#10;3. Use one complete 9 card suit per each player in the game plus the hacker and miner cards.  Leave all other cards out of the game.&#10;&#10;4. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals out all the cards in play face down.  Each player should have 9 and the players with the miner and hacker cards should have 10.&#10;&#10;5. Pick up the cards and arrange them by suit.  Don't let anyone else see them.  Decide which coin you want to own.  Hint: pick the coin you have the most of in your hand.&#10;&#10;6. When everyone has sorted their cards the dealer says, &quot;Bitcoin&quot; and the trading begins.&#10;&#10;PLAY&#10;&#10;As soon as the dealer said, &quot;bitcoin!&quot; everyone starts trading.  To trade, select 1-4 cards from your hand of the same suit that you do not want to own and say, &quot;one! one!&quot; or &quot;two! two!&quot; depending on how many cards you want to trade.  You may trade with any opponent who is calling out the same number.  Sometimes a particular opponent will want to trade fewer cards than you do.  In this case you can lower your bid and trade the smaller number.  you CANNOT look at the cards you are trading for until the trade is complete, NOT can you reveal which cards you are trading.  It is a race to see who can collect all 9 the quickest.  The first player to call out the coin they have once they own the coin wins the number of points associated with that particular coin.  No one else wins any points that round.&#10;&#10;WILD CARDS&#10;&#10;If someone goes out and you hold the miner and/or hacker cards you lose 200 points per wild card in your hand.  If you have 8 cards of a singer coin and the miner card, you may lay down all 9 (8 coins plus the miner card) and shout out &quot;DOUBLE BITCOIN, DOUBLE MONERO! etc..) In his case you win double the points on the card.  If you have the hacker card in your hand you may not lay down your cards until you have gotten rid of it.  You jay trade both cards together or separately or with another coin but you CANNOT trade more than 4 cards at a time.&#10;&#10;COINYE WEST&#10;&#10;This coin is worth much less than the other coins but if someone collects all 9 everyone else loses points.  Double Coinye means everyone also loses double as well!&#10;&#10;WINNING&#10;&#10;The game is played several times until a player has a total of 5000 points.&#10;&#10;",

Hunger of a Shadow Vile expands the role of Cities, provides new uses for Lux, and introduces Luxwardens and Cultists to the base game. Hunger of a Shadow Vile is not a standalone game: Shadows of Malice&reg; is required to play.  The expansion Seekers of a Hidden Light is only required to take advantage of the new uses for Lux offered in this expansion.&#10;&#10;Hunger of a Shadow Vile brings life to the Cities of Aethos and highlights the struggle between the Lumosari, the Luxwardens of Aethos, and the Shahudiri, the Cultists of Xulth&ucirc;l. The additional content allows players to engage in battles to drive Xulth&ucirc;l&rsquo;s followers from the Cities of the Realm, and, in so doing, starve the Lord of Shadow and remove the threat it poses. Because Xulth&ucirc;l feeds on fear, anxiety, and despair, when all the Cities in the game are purged of Cultists and these dark emotions are excised, Xulth&ucirc;l begins to starve and grows too weak to generate Shadows.&#10;&#10;But be warned! While you can defeat Xulth&ucirc;l by purging its Cultists from the Cities of Aethos, your efforts will not deter the Shadows from their singleminded pursuit of a skin for their master. And the Shadow Lord's corruptors are still roaming the land, seeking to debilitate the avatars with their master's corruption.&#10;&#10;Time is not on your side.&#10;&#10;",

For example, a player rolls 3/4/6 : a) he may place 3 tokens on squares &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot; and &quot;6&quot; ; b) he may place 2 tokens on square &quot;12&quot; (=3x4) and &quot;6&quot; ; c) he may place 1 token on square &quot;18&quot; (=3x4+6). All operations may be used.&#10;&#10;When a player places 5 of his tokens in a straight line orthogonally or diagonally, he scores points according to the colour of the squares they are located on : 1 point on a yellow square, 2 points on an orange square, 3 points on a red square.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player runs out of tokens. Each unplayed token is worth 1 point for each player. The player with the maximum score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1987 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a four handed version of the abstract game Xiangqi, the latter also known as Chinese chess.&#10;&#10;In the tradition game, the board is divided in half by a line called the river. In the four player version, one might call this a sea. Then each player uses a standard set of pieces set up on their half of a standard board. (Hence only two sets of standard pieces are needed. Ownership of pieces is marked by their orientation since they would read as right-side-up to the controlling player.) Where the river would normally be is extended into a large empty square. Pieces cross but do not go onto this space, the sea. Lines of the board extend across the sea no differently than across the river as far as players opposite each other are concerned. The lines of movement connect to players at either side's boards as if the board on which a player's pieces begin were rotated toward the player on either side. Play is clockwise and otherwise the standard rules of xiangqi apply in all instances.&#10;&#10;If at the start of a player's turn, the player's &quot;king&quot; (to use Western terminology for simplicity) is checkmated-- whether by a single player's pieces or pieces of multiple players in combination-- that player is immediately eliminated from the game. Only the &quot;king&quot; is taken from the board but that player's turn is thereafter skipped. Remaining pieces may be taken but do not otherwise move. The last remaining player wins.&#10;&#10;This is a game intended primarily for DIY play. Two sets of pieces are needed along with four half-boards. These can be printed from files on BGG or fashioned using multiple sets from the traditional game.&#10;&#10;To play a 3 player variant, one of the 4 half-boards is simply not used. A 2 player variant would be the traditional game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Community card poker refers to any game of poker that uses community cards (also called &quot;shared cards&quot; or &quot;window cards&quot;), which are cards dealt face up in the center of the table and shared by all players. In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (&quot;hole cards&quot;), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the &quot;board&quot;, and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's private hand. The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s.&#10;&#10;Also known as &quot;flop poker&quot;, community card poker is a variation of stud poker. Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. Texas hold 'em and Omaha are two well-known variants of the community card family.&#10;&#10;Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stud poker is any of a number of poker variants in which each player receives a mix of face-down and face-up cards dealt in multiple betting rounds. Stud games are also typically non-positional games, meaning that the player who bets first on each round may change from round to round (it is usually the player whose face-up cards make the best hand for the game being played). The cards dealt face down to each individual player are called hole cards, which gave rise to the common English expression ace in the hole for any hidden advantage.&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face-down and face-up rounds, or streets, with a round of betting following each. This is the next-oldest family; as poker progressed from three to five-card hands, they were often dealt one card at a time, either face-down or face-up, with a betting round between each. The most popular stud variant today, seven-card stud, deals two extra cards to each player (three face-down, four face-up) from which they must make the best possible 5-card hand.&#10;&#10;Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&#10;&#10;",

The game is a quirky and fun variation of the popular 'shithead'. It has unique cards with a colourful design and the game has new exciting rules.&#10;&#10;Played in groups from 2 to 5, the players try to get rid of their cards first to win. Each player is dealt three cards face down and three cards face up on top of them. Another three cards become the player's hand. The players take turns clockwise and play al least one card equal to or higher than the last card on the discard pile. They may play multiple cards of the same rank at once. If a player cannot play a card, he must pick up the discard pile and add it to his hand.&#10;&#10;In the first stage of the game players play with the cards in their hand and replenish their hand with cards from the stock pile (to three). Once the stock pile and a player's hand is empty, the player may begin playing his face up cards and thereafter his face down cards one by one. At this point the game starts to become very strategic.&#10;&#10;The game contains wildcards that may be played on every card and there are cards that activate a special action such as 'skip a turn' or 'play a card lower' (instead of higher). The &frac12; card is the twist of the game. It can be combined with the cards 3&frac12;, 6&frac12; and 9&frac12; to form a new rank (4, 7 or 10) and activate a corresponding action.&#10;&#10;To play an extra fast and exciting game there is a short version of the game for 2 or 3 player in which some cards can be removed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the future, explorers around the world discover secret staircases within ancient pyramids. At the bottom of the hundred thousand dusty steps are three doors. Anyone who opens a door is never heard from again. Whispered rumors speak of lost treasure, primeval technology, and nightmarish creatures. Powerfully driven adventurers arrive to bravely knock on DEATH&rsquo;S DOOR.&#10;&#10;Each player in DEATH&rsquo;S DOOR has their own unique ways of gaining points centered around themes like exploring, killing, or looting. You win by completing the objectives described on your Story card and preventing other players from completing theirs. You must combine strategy, tactics, and diplomacy as you place and open dungeons, discover dangers, and gather powerful treasure.&#10;&#10;Players start in different parts of the dungeon, and place tiles with a hex grid to create the board. You choose whether to join forces or fight solo. Lairs, with more monsters and a lair boss, are challenging and require multiple party members working together. The Final Boss is very difficult to defeat. The game ends when the Final Boss dies (everyone wins), or when there is one player left alive (highest score wins).&#10;&#10;A simple yet dynamic attribute system defines the ability of players and monsters to engage the world. They describe how everyone attacks, defends, and acts. Taken together, they represent the health of the character. As you get bonuses to these attributes, you become more powerful. As you take damage, you become weaker. If all three attributes drop to one, the character is dead.&#10;&#10;With only a dozen pages of rules and about two hours of play time, DEATH'S DOOR is designed to deliver RPG depth and lasting replayability that can be still learned and completed in one sitting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In preparation of the final battle in Talos&rsquo; arena you will spar with your enemies in search of winning combinations and the greatest heroes to truly represent your individual style and strategy. &#10;We created the game with the goal of enhancing the experience for everybody while eliminating bad elements common in other games. Thus, the basic mechanisms of the game include the following elements:&#10;&#10;&bull; To win you need to constantly interfere in your opponent&rsquo;s turns, while risking and gaining small and large advantages. You actively play at all times during the game.&#10;&#10;&bull; There is no sequence of phases, just a never ending battle of all versus all. Players do not have to wait until the enemy has assembled an unbreakable combination to counteract it. You attack and intercept at will, even if your opponent charges forward.&#10;&#10;&bull; The game is designed to make as little restrictions as possible and to maximize the potential of the player&rsquo;s creativity, cooperation, and clever deceit to affect the outcome.&#10;&#10;&bull; There is very little path dependency. There is no sure victor of the game practically until the very last move to ensure that you always have a chance to win and affect the game.&#10;&#10;&bull; There is only little preparation for the game.

    "Description": "You are feeding the hungry fish a fist full of worms (hand of worm cards).  The goal of the base game is to be the first to feed all your worms to the fish (empty your hand).  The fish mechanism gets programmed to know where all the players.  The fish will make jokes, chuckle at players, ask for food, and make other comments while the game is in progress.  When the game finishes, the fish will automatically announce the winner.&#10;&#10;To start, every player gets a hand of cards that evenly distribute the 12 worm cards.  The Fish mechanism gets setup by placing it on the base and pushing it's fin.  The fish will spin and ask &quot;Are you ready to play&quot; at one of 4 player positions.  If there is a player at the position, hit the fish fin to confirm.  If not, wait a few seconds and the fish will skip to the next possible player position.  Then the fish spins and randomly stops to face a player.  It makes an automated comment like &quot;I'm hungry&quot; and waits for the player it's facing to add a worm card to it's mouth.  Players need to be quick or the fish will skip the player.  Once you put a worm in the fishes mouth, the fish will make a crunch noise, spin and then randomly stop on a player position, spit the worm card out and chuckle.  It may spit the card out to the player who put the worm in it's mouth in the first place.  This process will repeat and eventually one player will have no cards left in their hand and win the game.  The Fish will announce the winner.&#10;&#10;There is also an advance game play variant:  To start the game, separate the cards into stacks by color. Each player chooses the stack of cards that match the color of their player number on the game base. Turn Fish Food ON, and all players press the fish&rsquo;s fin.&#10;&#10;Feed the fish when he spins to you, but instead of trying to get rid of your card, try to collect three cards of another player&rsquo;s color! When you have collected three cards in another color, press the fish&rsquo;s fin once - you&rsquo;re the winner!&#10;&#10;From the publishers website:  Fish Food is the FINtastic game with the smart fish that knows how to play! If he lands on you, feed him one of your cards. Watch out on the next spin &ndash; he may spit the card back to you! Get rid of all of your cards to win. The fish knows who wins and will call out the winner at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rough Riders! is a war game which depicts the battles of San Juan Heights and El Caney, in Cuba, and actions in the Philippines, between the eager, but nearly clueless, Army of the United States, and the highly experienced and far better equipped Armies of Spain, as well as the resultant insurgency of the Moro&rsquo;s that came with acquisition of the Philippines.&#10;&#10;Each Player represents a Commander who controls a number of Battalions, and it is his task to defeat the enemy through maneuver and firepower. Even though an Army may have many Battalions, and far outnumber their enemy, if the soldiers are new to war, discipline, and command, those advantages can quickly evaporate. To achieve victory with such an army, a Commander, by his personal example and with the help of his junior officers, must struggle to keep his confused and isolated men fighting and moving on their objective, or see them fail and die to no purpose.&#10;&#10;Completely original, card driven, and exceptionally fast and &quot;clean,&quot; no other set of rules on this subject has caught the essential problems of command and control as experienced by all forces engaged.&#10;&#10;A special rules section for battles in Mindanao against the Moros are included which allow not only for hidden movement, but random generation of terrain as U.S. Forces advance across country mastered by inhabitants whose fanaticism became legendary.&#10;&#10;The 74 page, 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; rules book comes with full color covers, 8 pages of color maps and flags to help identify units in play, as well as the complete Action Deck of cards paper printed in b&amp;w, ready to cut out and use, as well as useful Game Markers which eliminate the need for written records.&#10;&#10;Scaled at 1:10 and intended for 15mm or 25/28mm figures.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In When Cutie Met Patootie, we meet Cutie, the residents of Kodiak Harbor, and the ten alien visitors who have just arrived on nearby Alaskan shores. Cutie has been in the care of her grandmother while her archeologist parents are on a dangerous expedition. However, after their being gone for six months, Cutie and the residents of Kodiak Harbor fear the worst. Join Cutie as she travels into the forest with Amelia, one of the visitors, to discover the truth of her parents' whereabouts.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players take a secret Citizen card and three path cards, then they randomly assemble the Alaskan shore visitor cards in a row of ten and place the corresponding Visitor pieces on their card.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns playing a path card each turn. Path cards can be used in multiple ways: build the growing map, help visitors collect sprite gems, or spend those sprite gems to advance visitors along the built map. When building the map, players can connect only to the existing path to create a pyramid shape, ever tightening the forest path!&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered when one visitor reaches the top. To determine a winner, players reveal their secret roles, each detailing specific sprite gems for which they earn points. Players tally points based on the location of visitors holding their designated sprite gems. The person with the most sprite gem points wins!&#10;&#10;When Cutie Met Patootie is the first game of The Entanglement Series by The Daniel Zayas Company. This game ships with a mini-expansion titled The Man Who Moves the Water, which allows for solo play.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a board of 7 x 7 squares, and the object of the game is to completely fill the board with coloured tiles - these being multicoloured and covering between 1 and 5 squares. Like-coloured tiles may not be adjacent, but can touch at corners. Game play involves throwing two dice to determine which tiles to use, and once placed, they may not be rearranged (tiles may be discarded, or refused). Throwing a six allows you to steal a tile from another player.&#10;&#10;With dice, there is an element of luck, but strategic play can help mitigate this. Games are comparatively short so they are ideal fillers between more complicated longer games. Sometimes gameplay can be frenetic. Because of the simplicity, it can appeal to a wide age range.&#10;&#10;",

Each card can be used in several different ways, and there are many strategies to discover. Every card relates to one of five resources, and each resource has two separate themes represented by card abilities. Focusing exclusively on one resource provides the ability to play powerful buildings, while gathering multiple types of resource provides the ability to play a much greater variety of cards and combine their abilities in unexpected ways.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to become the new mayor?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It was invented in the 1970s in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is derived from Crazy Eights; in fact, the name Craits is derived from Crazy Eights itself. Craits is similar to the marketed game Uno, which has its own specialized deck, and many cards assume the functions of Uno's specialized cards.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first to get rid of all your cards. When it is your turn, you may play a card from your hand that matches either the suit or the rank of the most recent card played. If you cannot (or choose not to ) play, you draw instead.&#10;&#10;Many cards have additional effects, such as forcing other players to draw, reversing the direction of play, etc.&#10;&#10;",

This game provides an excellent opportunity for you to accompany little ones in this new way of interacting with others through a simplified game designed just for them. With its two levels of difficulty, this association game will follow children as they progress.&#10;The aim of the game is to fill the illustrated game boards with the emotion-disks. At first the child is just playing a matching game on their own which introduces them to emotions. In multi-player form each player gets a board and on your turn you turn over a disk. If a player has that disk on their board they get to keep it otherwise is it set aside. In the more advanced version you only keep the disk if it is on your board otherwise you put it back face down. The first player to fill their game board wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game claims to be the funniest game in the world. Two players try to move 4 pawns from the base of the board beyond the dark spot between the snake heads. pawns that actually get on the dark spot have to begin anew. Movement is determined b a die. If the roll of the die shows a result that allows a pawn to get on the dark spot, it has to be used for this pawn. The small black dots (crossroads) can be occupied by any number of pawns of the same color. If a pawn gets on a crossroad, that is occupid by one or more pawns of the other color, the other pawns have to go back to the next crossroads behind them. If a pawn has the opportunity to reach a crossroads, it has to do that. The first player to get all 4 pawns off the game board beyond the dark spot wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
