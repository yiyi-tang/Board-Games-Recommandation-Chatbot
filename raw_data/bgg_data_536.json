Most road cards have a rider underneath, each of the twelve different riders appears under four different cards.Every player is supposed to manage one (or more) riders. When one rider shows up, he loses strength and therefore has less chances to be the winner, which is the last rider to appear, the one under the finish line banner. The game includes items like banners, public &amp; price money. The track is formed by cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ULA is a Finnish acronym meaning &quot;ultra-short wavelength&quot; in relation to radio waves; the English equivalent is VHF or &quot;very high frequency&quot;. The game name Ula-taxi (or Ulataksi) refers to the mode of communication between the taxi drivers and the central taxi station.&#10;&#10;The players are taxi drivers in an unnamed city. They draw assignment cards from a deck, take money (the amount depends on which city zone they are in and where they are going) and drive to the address on the card using movement points rolled with a six-sided die. Players decide beforehand whether the game ends for example when someone has completed five assignments or when the last card in the deck has been drawn and the action completed.&#10;&#10;During the game, the players are free to choose their routes in the streets, but movement has some restrictions: right-hand side traffic, stop signs, one-way streets etc. Violating the no-stopping sign or speed limits results in a ticket and the player loses money (for example rolling a 5 on a street with a speed limit of 3 means that the player pays 2). There are also tunnels and a ferry which give additional choices. If cars of two players collide, both go to the repair shop and the player who was moving at the time must pay a sum equivalent to the remainder of movement points on the die. Among the assignment cards there are a few cards on car maintenance, vehicle inspection and insurance which require payments and movements to appropriate locations. When the end conditions agreed upon are met, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;The rules were written in May 1968. The original game board is a paper sheet glued on a thick two-fold cardboard. The city zone payment chart is thin cardboard as are the 70 cards and the small square ferry. The game includes 100 paper banknotes with denominations of one and five. For each player there is a small plastic car and an assignment marker.&#10;&#10;The first paragraph of the rules (translated from Finnish): &quot;Ula-taxi is an interesting, surprising and educational game with which you will surely find entertainment. The basic idea of the game is simple, although the abundance of rules may at first feel discomforting. Once the players have become accustomed to the instructions, they will notice that the majority of them is based on general traffic regulations, the knowledge of which is nowadays common among the citizenship.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

This map features Unique Track Builds: Track builds can not be duplicated; once a player has built a section of track between two locations, no one else can build that same connection.

Each deck contains 10 sets of 4 matching colored cards, one wild card, and one black card.&#10;&#10;The center of the table contains one less peg than the number of players. Once anyone in the circle has a set they can grab a peg &ndash; after that it&rsquo;s a free-for-all to get one of the colored pegs before they&rsquo;re gone whether you have a set or not. Each peg is worth a different point value and one player will be left empty-handed each round, so you&rsquo;ve gotta be fast to get one! Each player earns points depending on the color of the peg they grabbed. The player without a peg earns no points. Players who have unused wild cards or black cards in their hand at the end of the round lose points. At the end of all rounds the score pad will be full and whichever player has the most points is victorious!&#10;&#10;More information about Fumbly Pegs can be found at http://www.fumblypegs.com&#10;&#10;",

As players pull blocks from the stack, being careful not to let it topple, they ask each other questions that focus on building self-esteem, social skills and coping strategies. As they concentrate on removing the blocks, players tend to relax, allowing them to open up and talk more freely with one another. Playing Totika will encourage people of all ages to set and achieve goals, motivate themselves, identify strong role models and form healthy relationships. Totika includes the Self-Esteem deck of questions but may be played with any card deck made by Open Spaces, LLC.&quot;&#10;&#10;48 colored, wood blocks and 48 question cards, each with 4 questions for 2 or more players ages 8 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from instructions)&#10;&#10;&quot;Megamerger is a game where industrial empires are built through strategy and finesse, by merging single industries into powerful conglomerates.  Players acquire control of selected industries, collecting higher fees as their empires become more powerful.  Along the &quot;Road to Riches&quot; they find greater challenge as opponents build competing conglomerates and as each one formulates strategies for financial supremacy.&quot;&#10;&#10;In MegaMerger players move around the board buying up shares in various industries. They can own anywhere from 5% of an industry, up to 100% in an industry. Players want to control many industries in the same color in order to make a &quot;conglomerate&quot; which will help them expand how much money they get from players who land on their industries.&#10;&#10;However, just because a player owns a part of an industry does not prevent it from being bought by another player. Unlike Monopoly, as long as the player has something, they are in the game. This could be as little as 5% ownership in an industry with no money in front of them.&#10;&#10;",

And the game pretty much runs itself. Allowing more time to actually play the game instead of bookkeeping and number crunching.&#10; The game can be played as a one off mission(depending on scenario length) in as little as 20 minutes. Or as a series of missions together as a campaign.&#10;&#10;The scenarios/maps are built using modular tiles and various easy to assemble props with a variety of victory conditions allowing for a completely different game with each play.&#10;&#10;",

This affects movement as well, in that lower grades of troops require multiple actions to carry out formation changes.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence is as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Active player determines number of actions available (2-4)&#10;2. If Active player has 3-4 actions, he may use these actions to move and/or fire units as desired.  If he rolls only 2 actions, the Reactive player is allowed to Preempt or react (e.g., evading).&#10;3. Melee phase.&#10;4. Brigade morale phase.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was produced by a commercial ad agency as its contribution to the Singapore National Council Against Drug Abuse, as part of the Partnership for a Drug Free Singapore programme. Essentially applying the mechanics of the game, Snap, the game uses 60 cards (4 each of 15 designs) with illustrations of grotesque and pitiful creatures that have succumbed to the evils of drug abuse. Each card comes with a little rhyme detailing the sad fate of its character - for example:&#10;&#10;MAK THE RABBIT&#10;&quot;I wish you peace&quot; said Mak the rabbit.&#10;His friends gave him drugs,&#10;Now he can't kick the habit.&#10;&#10;The cards are dealt out evenly to each player and players take turns to reveal a card from their stack. When two cards of the same design are seen, the first player to shout &quot;NABBED!&quot; gets to keep both stacks of upturned cards adding all of them face down to the bottom of his/her stack.&#10;&#10;The name of the agency providing the concept and design of the game was WORK - no individual designer was indentified. The illustrations are credited to Theseus Chan and the rhymes to Jim Aitchison.&#10;&#10;The Partnership for a Drug Free Singapore programme began earlier in 2002 and featured the characters in a series of cartoons with anti-drug rhymes. The card game was published in 2004 and was distributed in schools.&#10;&#10;",

More detail rules for fighting and moving sailing ships have been written. However, they are not&#10;playable or enjoyable due to the need to constantly stop play in order to check the rules or a matrix. These rules were written for 1/600 scale vessels. There are also lines of 1/450, 1/900 and 1/1200 vessels on the market which can use these rules as written.&#10;&#10;SAILS was designed to reflect ship to ship combat with squadron size the largest size battle.

The outcome of each scenario determines what forces the Regular player will have available in the next. The scenarios may also be played stand-alone if desired.&#10;Set in a fictional city, The Three Block War contains a generic Regular force that could be drawn from nearly any that might find itself involved in an asymmetrical war. The setting is also generic enough that the campaign could easily be transplanted to any geographical locale with no more adjustment than changing a few place names. Although written for Ambush Alley, these scenarios could easily be used for any contemporary skirmish game.&#10;The Three Block War contains all the information and special rules necessary for play, along with Ambush Alley&rsquo;s signature photographic board examples.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Ambush Alley!

The time scale is 1 turn = 20 minutes, which is fairly short for a grand tactical set of rules.&#10;&#10;Game turn sequence is as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Activation (each division or cavalry brigade rolls a die to determine if they can move effectively that turn)&#10;2. First Move Determination&#10;3. Combat Phase One (first mover moves and fires)&#10;4. Morale Phase One (first mover)&#10;5. Combat Phase One (2nd mover moves and fires)&#10;6. Morale Phase Two (2nd mover)&#10;7. March Phase (both sides make march moves)&#10;8.

But making money should not be too hard, this is the busiest port in the world.&#10;&#10;The Port Singapore board is divided into bays. Next to the board lie the ships that need to be loaded. Each ship has a hold that needs to line up with one of your bays before you can get your grunts to load the goods (barrels).  Along the back of the board is a track on which 4 action cubes sit.  On your turn you pick up one of the cubes, do the action, then slide all the cubes forward putting your cube at the end.  Cubes usually have a cost involved in choosing them, but they get cheaper the farther they move down from the top of the track.  The actions on the faces vary from cube to cube, you may only take the action shown on the top face of the cube when you choose it.&#10;&#10;The cubes contain actions like:&#10;&#10;    Heave ho.  Pull a ship along the wharf or send full ships off and get new ships to load. Good for annoying players who may be about to load or bringing a ship to your warehouse bay.&#10;    Union meeting.  Shuffle you grunts around the wharf and roll one of the action cubes for a random result. &#10;    Do business.  This gets goods in your ware house to load or lets you hire grunts to do your loading.&#10;    Load a ship. Move one load per grunt into a ship's hold opposite to your warehouses.&#10;    Take a bribe.  Helps you get things done.&#10;    The Payoff.  Pay one of your opponent's grunts to simply go home for the day.&#10;    Brawl.  Cause a ruckus in the bay next to one of your bays, good for disrupting opponents.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when the barrels in the supply run low (depending on the number of players).
