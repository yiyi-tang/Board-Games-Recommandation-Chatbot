The game comes with two programmed scenarios, Bolt from the Blue (a one turn scenario) and First Strike (standard ten turn scenario) and instructions for varying the First Strike scenario if desired.&#10;&#10;As would be expected in a game featuring nuclear war, it is quite possible for both players to lose utterly. Also, one side can lose utterly, while the other side may not achieve &quot;victory conditions&quot; in game terms.  All involved in the design and production of this game make it clear that if this hypothetical situation had played out, incredible horrors would have been unleashed upon the world and there would not have been any winners in any real sense.&#10;&#10;From the designer:&#10;&quot;First Strike is a game about thermonuclear war between the superpowers during the Cold War, in November 1983. This is based on actual historic incidents and persons wishing to become acquainted with them can read 'Comrade Kryuchov's Instructions', about Operation Ryan, or 'War Scare: Russia and America on the Nuclear Brink'&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Although the Royalists under Lord Hopton forced the Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller to retreat from their hilltop position, they suffered so many casualties themselves and were left so disordered and short of ammunition that an injured Hopton was forced to retire.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Roundway Down was fought on July 13, 1643, during the English Civil War. A Royalist cavalry force under Lord Wilmot won a crushing victory over the Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller who were besieging Devizes in central Wiltshire, which was defended by Lord Hopton.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Cheriton was an important Parliamentarian victory in the English Civil War. It took place on March 29, 1644 and resulted in the defeat of a Royalist army, which threw King Charles I onto the defensive for the remainder of the year.&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;6 Page Rules&#10;3 8.5x11&quot; Maps&#10;1 Player Aid&#10;159 Counters&#10;&#10;",

It was sold in boxes that contained just half of the pitch, balls, a complete team, coach, bench, referee and a goal.&#10;&#10;The plastic figures were made by a round and hollow flat base into which the actual figure (different poses according to their role) had to be pressed in. Colours represented teams of the Italian Serie A of the time, so you could buy your favourite team. To play you needed at least two boxes in order to form the complete playing area. The figures were flicked more or less as in Subbuteo. The most used ball was a semi-spheric one, because the round one was too difficult to control properly.&#10;&#10;Don't remember if there was a set of rules in the box or if we just made our own&#10;&#10;A few months later, at the end of 1973, Atlantic published the Super GiocaGoal.

The Units are primarily squad sized.&#10;&#10;The players deploy Units, which may be accompanied by Attachments, and all units in play can attack an opposing unit once per turn. All combat is considered simultaneous, so every unit has a chance to attack, even on a turn in which it is destroyed.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to eliminate all of your opponent&rsquo;s cards.&#10;&#10;",

While the interstate can allow for quick goods transportation, it also becomes increasingly clogged as the game progresses and eventually becomes nearly impassable.&#10;&#10;The Berlin Wall, meanwhile, takes Age of Steam back to the era of the Cold War and the divided city of Berlin. Troop garrisons impede goods movement for much of the game, and the wall also presents an imposing obstacle. Of course, the fall of the wall in 1989 changes everything.&#10;&#10;The Berlin Wall map was reprinted in 2011 as part of Age of Steam Expansion: Moon and Berlin Wall.&#10;&#10;",

A short introductory exercise is designed to be worked through in advance.&#10;&#10;The game has three separate parts- an introductory exercise and two &quot;moves&quot;. The introductory exercise covers the fundamentals of the problem and some basic facts (like who has nuclear arsenals today) and gets players thinking about the overall issue. The first move is a crisis control exercise in which players take on the roles of top officials in five nations that are wrestling with a future nuclear crisis involving India and Pakistan. The second and final move is a post-crisis negotiation exercise in which players seek a long-term solution to the conflict between India and Pakistan,&#10;&#10;",

Each player is given 10 plastic score-markers for tallying. A player sets the steel ball at one end of the rail and releases it. Timing a swing of the pendulum, the other player attempts to knock the ball off the rail and into one of the scoring areas marked 100, 200, 500. If the player misses, the other player attempts to catch the pendulum and, if successful, can take a shot at scoring as well.&#10;&#10;Play continues until someone scores, in which case the scoring player sets the ball in action again, or until the ball stops rolling, in which case the original &ldquo;roller&rdquo; sets the ball on its path again.&#10;&#10;The game is over when either player has placed all 10 markers and the scores are tallied.&#10;&#10;Impact was released in 1971. Interestingly, the game Balanko http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/23728 , winner of the &ldquo;Family Fun&rdquo; award in 2007, appears to be a direct &ldquo;descendant&rdquo; of this game, with the designer claiming to have invented the game in his garage. A quote from his site states, with irony that may be intentional or not: &ldquo;Upon tinkering around in the garage one day with his son, Jamie began to build a game without any knowing of how this game would one day strongly impact his life.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Released toward the end of the Great Depression in 1937, The Big Board, like many games released during this time frame, reflects an America, and the world, pulling itself out of economic chaos. The lure of trading large sums of cash with the possibility of striking it rich ran deep in the collective unconscious across the globe.&#10;&#10;The box includes 835 shares of stock in each of nine different corporations with the following denominations/counts: 1/10, 5/5, 10/5, 50/5, 100/5. This is at odds with the instructions which call for 435 shares. It also includes approximately $110,000 in paper money in the following denominations: $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $1,000 and $5,000. Again this is at odds with the instructions which call for $147,600. Included is one pair of standard dice, a dice cup, 9 wooden Price markers, and one large board marking the rising stock prices.&#10;&#10;The Big Board  &ldquo;represents the quotation board as used in a broker&rsquo;s office&rdquo;, and attempts to &ldquo;represent in a realistic manner the fluctuation of stocks, as on the New York Stock Exchange.&rdquo; Nine stocks are available for trading. Each player starts with $5,000.00. One player is selected as the supervisor of the treasury and stock certificates. The instructions suggest that this player throws the dice and moves the price quotation markers, but is &ldquo;not the banker and does not participate in the profits or losses of the BIG BOARD.&rdquo;, effectively removing the player from the game. For those who don&rsquo;t wish to be left out of the game, an easy house rule could fix this by allowing one person to be banker and perhaps shifting the throw of the dice from player to player.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the price markers on each of the stock spaces marked PAR. The market is now open and all players may purchase one or more shares of as many stocks as they wish. The dice are then rolled for the first stock, with the operator moving the marker upward the matching number of spaces rolled. If the marker lands on a value space, the price is set, if it lands on a &ldquo;Down To&rdquo; space, it is moved to the corresponding lower value and the price is set there. Players may now buy or sell values of this stock. These phases are continued for each stock, with the dice returning to the first stock when the others have been set. During intervals, transactions can occur at the current price of any stock.&#10;&#10;The game can end in several ways: at a set time determined by all players at the start of the game (suggested by the game designers as a more realistic simulation of stock activity from day to day), or when 1 player has lost all money or the treasury is exhausted, or even when 1 player has made a &ldquo;certain amount of money over and above that which he started with&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;",

You use action tokens to gather workers and to have your workers build creations. You can also use the FX you purchased in phase two to help your workers. The game ends when a player has five or more creations at the end of the third phase. If you have the most creations at the end of the game, you win.&#10;&#10;The Unnamed Game requires a Special Powers deck, an FX deck, a Creation Tracker. You can download these from the publisher. You&rsquo;ll also need to provide a Poker deck, about 5 six-sided dice per player, a unique pawn for each player, a totem, and about 30 tokens.&#10;&#10;A three-player game takes about 40 minutes to play. The Unnamed Game&rsquo;s unusual structure and strategic nature probably makes it appropriate for ages 14 and older.&#10;&#10;",

The game scale is 10km per hex, units are brigades or divisions, or cadres/groups.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Millennium Wars system is quite unique relative to traditional wargame designs. Rather than utilize quantitative &quot;factors&quot; for such things as movement and combat, the game is entirely missions based, with each unit being capable of performing a given set of missions as indicated by icons on the backs of the unit counters. Missions are combined into Operations against specific targets, which can include other units in play, populations centers on the map, or political capital. Targets on the receiving end of such operations must execute specific casualty chains to account for losses caused by offensive operations. The game also utilizes a unique &quot;Tier&quot; system that determines the number of phases the units of any given faction may conduct missions per turn.&#10;&#10;The full game (not yet released) explores the past, present, and future of the Arab/Israeli struggle. Includes a 56 page booklet focused on the history behind (and yet to come of) the game.&#10;&#10;Scenarios included in the full game:&#10;1. '48 War Phase 1&#10;2. '48 War Phase 2&#10;3. '67 War&#10;4. '67 War Jihad (What if)&#10;5. &lsquo;73 War &#10;6. &rsquo;82 Lebanon War&#10;7. &rsquo;06 Military Solution in Southern Lebanon&#10;8.
