The bonus is doubled up to 2 fish in provinces that have failed to produce in the last round.

This way the fishmarket offers an extra layer of planning ahead and new challenges for the experienced CONCORDIA player.&#10;&#10;The opposite side of this board has the CYPRUS map for all who have missed it when buying Concordia: Venus (Expansion).&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Eysenhudt is an historical and atmospheric board game, which absorbs you right into the middle of the German Peasants' War (about the year 1525 &ndash; the doorstep between the late Middle Ages and the early Modern Era).&#10;&#10;As for now, Eysenhudt is available for free as a PnP (Print &amp; Play) game. Look for all the stuff in the Files section.&#10;&#10;As a minor leader of the revolutionary movement (in a rather remote theatre of that war) you conduct all sorts of tactical and strategical operations &ndash; all with the aim to steer your troops in the best possible way through the excited and exciting (though perilous) times. &#10;Each round a player chooses one of the six basic Offices: Go, spread the word of the Reformation as a &raquo;Prediger&laquo; (Preacher) to make the countless &raquo;Thorps&laquo; (villages) more valuable for the revolution's cause (and to score Victory Points on top of that). As a &raquo;Rottmeister&laquo; (~ corporal) win over those Thorps &ndash; they are your (and your fellow player's) supply bases in food and units. As a &raquo;Trossweibel&laquo; (Whore's Sergeant) increase the storage volume of your wagon trek to store and transport your Food Barrels and various goods. Gather food as a &raquo;Proviantmeister&laquo; (Furir) and store the barrels in your wagons. Deploy new units (of various military and diplomatic uses and worth in Victory Points) as a &raquo;Werber&laquo; (Recruiter). And as a &raquo;Beutemeister&laquo; (~ purser) you might also want to visit one of the various markets where you can trade your booty into all sorts of useful equipment. These six basic Offices are closely linked together. More variability and depth (historical and tactical) are added by the &raquo;Eysenhudt Cards&laquo;, which can be chosen instead of an Office. Those cards represent tactical or strategical orders from your captain: Anthonius Eysenhudt. &#10;After each three rounds you have to perform certain actions during an &raquo;Encampment Phase&laquo; in which you try to conquer one of the very important fortified towns. For this combat action each player chooses the more defensive &raquo;Threatening Attack&laquo; or the more aggressive and physical &raquo;Storm Attack&laquo;. And the decision is crucial, because not only may it decide over the success or failure of the attack, you may also be attracted to act more aggressively in trying to storm the fortified towns (or strongholds) to make all the more booty (and even to increase your gain in Victory Points) but you'll on the other hand receive all the more Aggression Points, which increases the probability of a more severe punishment at the game's end.&#10;Cause in the end your fate lies in the hands of the &raquo;Principals' Justice&laquo; and you may yet lose much of what you've gained. And the punishment you'll receive reflects on your actions during game play. The decisions are as hard to make as the paths to win Eysenhudt are manifold. Overall the game is more cooperative than competitive. Nonetheless each player has to find his or her own strategy to score as much Victory Points as possible.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The book counts 52 pages, with 8 mysteries to solve. Playtime is about 60~90 minutes. Difficulty is easy, and basically anyone can play it (all the kanji learnt above elementary 6th grade has furigana attached). However, the stories gradually get harder and harder towards the end.&#10;A free demo is available for download on the official homepage.&#10;&#10;",

An additional hand of four are placed face-up in the center of the play area. Turns happen in real-time and simultaneously with players exchanging only one card from one hand with a card from the pool in the center of the table. Players may only have one hand active at a time in their hand and must lay any others down on the table face-down. When discarding a card to the center to trade, players must call out the name of the animal they are laying down. If it is a pig, instead of yelling &quot;Pig&quot;, they say &quot;Waffles&quot;, the pig's name.&#10;&#10;If a player has both a chicken and Waffles in their hand, they may discard them both to pick up two cards instead of the normal one, exclaiming &quot;Chicken -n- Waffles!&quot;&#10;&#10;The goal is to get all your hands to have matching four-of-a-kind sets with the exception of the chicken and Waffles cards - these must be paired up  with matching features (color of clothes) and combined with any other pair of animals. The round winner chooses another animal to add to the deck and plays the next round with an additional hand of cards. When playing with four hands (having won one), you may not use the wilds. When you win a second round, you may use wilds again, but must play the rest of the game one-handed. The first player to win three rounds is the overall winner.&#10;&#10;In a 6 player game, you play until you win two rounds, with the previous middle round (not being able to use wilds) ignored.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Avoid the seven deadly sins, embrace the seven heavenly virtues, and you&rsquo;ll be victorious!&#10;&#10;In Capital Vices players take actions in order to distribute colored resources of food and money.

You can further relax while watching the Huddersfield Giants play rugby, or take in some culture at the Choral Society.

    "Description": "Developed initially for special operations use, this amphibious troop transport ready vehicle is slowly becoming a staple of SSU forces around the planet. At the moment it can be mostly found with Spetsnaz and PLA forces, which make the most of its capabilities: the PT-47B can go nearly everywhere with a small group of soldiers. This version is equipped with powerful turret weapons that provide great fire support.&#10;&#10;This vehicle comes with three Dust 1947 unit cards: one for the SSU Bloc, one for the Spetsnaz Faction and one for the PLA Faction. Like all regular Dust 1947 miniatures, it comes already assembled and primed. It's ready for the battlefield, or for painting, as you wish! You can directly paint over on it, since the priming serves as an undercoat and is compatible with any type of paint.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Inspired by a very old game called &quot;Baccalaureate&quot; among Francophones and &quot;Categories&quot; among Anglophones,  I KNOW IT ALL is a board game created with the intent of uniting generations around themes testing their abilities and speed thinking. It presents a familiar universe to the players while remaining original; unlike the games above, we wanted this one more accomplished, more modern, more complex and much more captivating. We know beforehand that it will offer players, families and/or friends a unique experience while they are experiencing intense moments of fun, laughter, and knowledge building.&#10;&#10;Geared towards ages 12 and up, I KNOW IT ALL  is a game that tests your global knowledge. The winner is not necessarily the oldest or smartest person at the table, but the one keeping up with the fast pace and thinking on his/her feet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Heists, piracy, and chasing legends. Pirates of Elenia is the first Adventure Pack for Middara: Unintentional Malum.&#10;&#10;Adventure Packs are shorter tales that fill in the gaps of the stories from our Base Games. They represent all the stories happening behind the scenes. Each one plays a small part in the overall pictures of our narrative and world. They help to explain not only possible holes in the plot, but also to tie up events that transpire in other products.&#10;&#10;While smaller than Adventure Expansions, Adventure Packs contain a significant amount of content. Each one is laden with new miniatures, new Items, new Crawl Mode content, and all the over the top value that you can expect from Succubus Publishing.&#10;&#10;What makes our Adventure Packs extra special is their optional rules that can augment the stories that they&rsquo;re complementing. This comes in the form of new variants for monsters that already exist, new Adventurers for the Crawl Mode, new tiles that expand existing sets, and new Items that can be added to the store and used in our base products.&#10;&#10;Adventure Packs use brand new flags that augment other Adventures and they also reference flags used in other Adventures. They&rsquo;re designed to be played in a chronological order though they can still be played in any order. Pirates of Elenia for example is designed to be played anytime after you&rsquo;ve finished Chapter 3 of Unintentional Malum.&#10;&#10;Pirates of Elenia, Vol. 1 is an Adventure Pack designed for 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;Over 15 encounters, more than 20 new miniatures, and a plethora of new items, monsters, and more!&#10;&#10;Pirates of Elenia has a whopping 100k+ word narrative, Flags that propagate into UM2 and 3, as well as connections to larger narratives at play!&#10;&#10;Requires Unintentional Malum: Act 1 to play.&#10;&#10;Story Synopsis:&#10;&#10;The Index Phage&#10;&#10;Despite the abomination&rsquo;s presence in all the stories, the legend of The Index Phage had always been more of a wives tale than a real threat to the people of Middara. Even so, widespread rumors pegged this creature as the cause behind the horrible incurable illness called the Blight. This horrific disease had spread all across Elenia like a plague, so to Kajax and his crew, it only made sense that the citizens of Middara would tell themselves tall tales that give themselves hope.&#10;As the legend went, all you had to do was kill The Index Phage and you&rsquo;d cure the curse of the Blight.&#10;&#10;But it was all too convenient, and Kajax knew that they&rsquo;d be lucky if this monster even existed at all. But the wealth put forth by the richest aristocracies in a desperate attempt at finding a cure was all too real. With a concerning distress call coming in from Hyde, the Arsen family had finally had enough. With all other avenues already exhausted, it was time to chase legends and try the absurd.&#10;&#10;",

The cards can also be rotated 180 degrees to become money in the Wallet. On your turn, buy a pair of cards from the market to your hand and discard the money from your Wallet to the discard pile according to the market price card next to it. Then you must play 2 cards from your hand to your playing area, either to Plate or Wallet.&#10;&#10;Play continues until there are not enough cards to replenish the market.

    "Description": "Beni's Top 11 is a football card game created by the Swiss sports reporter Beni Thurnheer. The base game consists of two teams from the Swiss first football league, Grasshopper Club Z&uuml;rich and FC Luzern, which can be pitched against each other on a tiny game board (a ball is not included, but any coin or other small item can be used). &#10;Each player shuffles the stack of cards from their teams, which consists of three cards each of 15 players from that team. Then both players flip open the top card from their stack and compare the stats. The winning player (higher number) moves the ball one slot closer to the opponent's goal (or into the goal if the ball is in the box already). Depending on the ball's position, attack or defense values are used. If a player draws the coach, they can choose the stats from one of the three previous cards. After the stack of 45 cards is played through twice (two halves), the player with most goals is the winner.&#10;&#10;At least one additional set of cards was released for BSC Young Boys in 1992.&#10;The box credits a G. Meister as well, but whether as artist or co-designer remains unclear.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players are monster breeders at the monster breeding academy and have to pitch their creatures against each other in series of three rounds. &#10;The game begins with a drafting phase. Each player has 3 dueling cards and 9 drafting cards. Out of those nine cards, they add three to their dueling cards and distribute the rest among the other players. The process is repeated with the cards they hold afterwards. &#10;The players distribute the 12 cards they hold now into three stacks: 3 for the first round, 4 for the second and 5 for the third. During each round, players can choose to reveal some of their cards; for each revealed card, a point token is added to the pool (from the bank). Then players can choose to participate or withdraw. All participating players reveal their remaining cards and the highest total wins the pool (losing players add tokens to the pool). &#10;This is repeated through rounds two and three, then cards are distributed again. The game ends after the round when someone has gained 50 points.&#10;The strengths of the monsters are often interdependent, so holding certain combinations makes them stronger. To win, players must use these combinations cleverly.&#10;&#10;",
