In addition, 80 victory point chips are included.&#10;&#10;Each round is played as follows: the dealer will deal each player three cards. Four cards are played on the table, open. The players now take turns playing cards. On each turn, a player can play exactly one card. A player can use this card to capture a number of cards on the table. Cards can be captured if the sum of those cards is equal to the card played (i.e. you can capture a six and a two by playing an eight). If a player cannot capture any cards, he has to add a card to those open on the table. A player gets one point for capturing all cards on the table.&#10;&#10;The round lasts until all players have played their three hand cards. Now, each player receives points: One point for the player who has captured the yellow seven, one point for the player who has captured the most yellow cards and one point for the player who has captured the most cards.&#10;&#10;The play continues for a couple of rounds (either six rounds for two or three players, or a number of rounds equal to the number of players if there are four or more players. In the end, the player who has collected the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "First edition:&#10;&#10;Rather silly party game, distributed by a certain coffee retail powerhouse that will remain nameless.&#10;&#10;As one moves around the board, one can land on _Brainstorm_ (vaguely reminiscent of free-association Scattergories), _Survey Says!_ (a touch like the Family Feud TV game show), or present a short _Sound Bite_ to the other players, who will vote on presentation and persuasiveness.&#10;&#10;To make sure no-one takes the proceedings too seriously, there's a _Skid Row_ space (lose all points, and beg the other players to donate.  Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.&#10;&#10;Like all such games, it works well with the right crowd.&#10;&#10;Second edition:&#10;&#10;Hear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as &quot;Nuclear BLANK&quot;). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.&#10;&#10;What makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Each property is represented by one or more billboards, with the more valuable properties having larger billboards. When you purchase a property, you place a billboard into your personal plastic tower; when you pass &quot;Go!&quot; on the game board, you earn income based on the height of your tower. Reach a value of $800 on your tower, and you win.&#10;&#10;When you land on an opponent's property, you pay rent to that player based on the height of her tower. If you don't have enough cash on hand, hand over the top billboard in your tower instead but keep the cash you do have. This mechanism means there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;While players don't trade properties, you can effectively steal them through the use of Empire cards and the &quot;swap&quot; face on one die, which allows you to swap the top billboards on two towers.&#10;&#10;To date, two editions have been released in the U.S.: The Second &quot;Silver&quot; Edition has some updated properties &amp; movers from the First &quot;Gold&quot; Edition, but gameplay is the same for both editions.&#10;&#10;This game and Monopoly: Here & Now World Edition share many similarities.&#10;&#10;",

Available in Polish only.&#10;&#10;Wiochmen Wesele (Countryfellow Wedding) is an adventure card game in which you will take the roles of guests of a not-really-typical countryside wedding reception. They take court in the company of other guests, make new friends, dance, drink, eat and generally have fun, at the same time creating groups of followers who will help them in case of any trouble. All this takes place in a stylish fire station, temporarily changed into a party room.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to gain as many Fun Points as possible before the end of the game and make life tougher for your opponents. The time passing is measured with successive wedding events. The points are obtained mostly by Winning Over new guests and challenging other players to Duels (you do this by rolling a die and testing one of your attributes - Chat or Muscle - against the corresponding attribute of the opponent/guest).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Something Different is a card game that started out with a simple idea: A game in which the rules change as you play. What it evolved into is a fantastic party game in which players get to know each other and engage in hilarious challenges.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a deck of 100 cards. Each player starts with a hand of seven cards and is attempting to empty his hand to win. Next to the main deck, three cards are turned face up, each with a different rule. Each turn you play a card on one of these piles from your hand, changing the current rules in play. If you break a rule at any time, you draw a card. Sounds simple enough, but it gets better. The basic rules tell you which color cards you can play or what suit they need to be, but other cards may restrict what you can do physically, such as making you keep one hand on the table or making you talk like a pirate.&#10;&#10;The other notable mechanism in the game includes personal trivia, duels, and mini events called &quot;switch-a-roos&quot;. When trivia rules are in play, you get to test another player's knowledge of you. If they answer a question wrong, they draw a card &mdash; but at least they learned something about you! Duels are just as they sound &mdash; thumb wars, staring contests and more &mdash; but while you duel someone, play continues. The winner of a duel brags, the loser draws more cards. Switch-a-roos change the playing field, causing people to swap hands, trade seats, or reverse the order of play.&#10;&#10;",

The starting player turns the top card of his pack and puts it down face-up in front of the pack. The turn continues clockwise. Next time the starting player is on turn he places his turned card on top of the one already exposed. If you turn a card showing one higher or one lower than any top card turned by another player, place it on the top of that card. Go on until it does not fit.&#10;When a card number 1 is turned, place it in the middle of the table. As soon as card number two is turned place it on the one.Build up the packs in ascending order, otherwise according to the rules. If a card fits more than one pack  first try the packs in the middle. If a player fails to notice the possibility of placing a card he is a Donkey and he has to accept one card from each player. The winner is the player who gets rid of his cards first.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BATTLESHIP is a game of the maturing dreadnought. With the Washington Naval Conference and its resulting treaty limitations on ship numbers and tonnages, the battleship went completely over to 2nd generation designs, including all the major conversions, and then the final burst of 3rd generation dreadnoughts.    Meantime, also as a result of the treaty, a now type of warship, the heavy cruiser, came to the fore and began a progress still unfinished in the modern missile cruiser. These events through 1945 are covered by BATTLESHIP.  The game system was designed to reflect the concept of the Immune Zone, around which capital ship design revolved. This zone is roughly represented by the medium range defense value. But since when this value will come into effect is a result of the characteristics of the opposing player's guns, you must conduct your movements to, whenever possible, be in your immune zone while your opponent is being fired on at either long or short range. It is within these margins that damage can be done in safety.  A hint: learn to use escorts. Properly handled they can shape an engagement early by threat of torpedo action.&quot;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Simulations Canada's Battleship&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the box:&#10;In the beginning those that could master going between dimensions thought of it as novelty. There were worlds to discover, creatures to see and most importantly magic to master. But with all these things to keep them busy there was one thing they did not forget, Power. Soon it was easier to take from others than to find it on your own. The only place to hide was in great magical towers that they built between dimensions. All times in your world and in the others are at your disposal.&#10;&#10;Will you be the last to Reign in Towers in Time?&#10;&#10;Play overview:&#10;Each player represents a spellcaster, dueling with the other players for control of an abstractly defined extradimensional space.  Each player has five shields, represented by cards from that player's deck, that serve to anchor the player the dimension within the game's story, and as the player's presence in the game mechanically.  The goal is to eliminate the shields of all other players; when a player has no shields remaining, they are banished from the pocket dimension, and out of the game.  Victory goes to the last player with shields in play.&#10;&#10;To combat one another, players play Source cards, representing connections to various natural locations, be they landforms, weather phenomena, or natural disasters.  These resource cards allow the player to access Temper, the main resource in Towers in Time, themed to the four elements.  Using Temper, players pay the costs to summon creatures to wage war, conjure magical objects and artifacts to enhance the effectiveness of recruited creatures, and cast spells to strengthen their minions and weaken the opposing armies.  Additionally, once creatures are in play, most of them can provide Temper as well, although typically less than Source cards; most cards in Towers in Time are resource generators in addition to their other game effects.&#10;&#10;Source cards serve as the base for the titular Towers of Towers in Time.  Each Source has a default file of three ranks atop it, each space of which can be occupied by creatures and the cards they carry.  Creatures enter play within Towers, and must match the element represented by the Source atop which it stands (except for Neutral creatures, which may be played into any Tower).  There are rules to determine which creatures can enter play in which locations within a Tower, but once in play, most creatures can move between Towers, taking attached cards with them when they move.&#10;&#10;Turns do not follow the turn format common to many contemporary CCGs.  Instead, several phases are completed simultaneously by all players, then players alternate initiating and resolving a single action until both players have passed.  Action resolution varies depending on their effect, with some actions initiating a separate resolution phase with its own actions and timing (such as combat) and others are single-step actions (such as playing a card).  Additionally, a number of supplemental actions (&quot;free&quot; actions) facilitate utility functions, such as drawing Temper to pay for spells.  The opportunity to act first during the action round is determined by the player who won initiative during game setup (for the first turn only), or the player who did not take the last pass action on the previous turn.&#10;&#10;",

Can you time your actions to take advantage of when the flocks fly?&#10;&#10;During the game Flock, players try to expand their flock with the goal of scoring the most victory points after three rounds of play. Victory points are scored by controlling the action cards at the end of each round. Also, be sure to have enough tasty worms to feed your birds at the end of each round, or otherwise they will fly away. Will your flock be on top of the pecking order?&#10;&#10;In more detail, players start with three of their eleven birds in front of them. Six nest, egg and worm tokens are placed on the side for each player. On a turn, a player can either place a bird on one of the six action cards or activate an action card on which they have at least one bird. When you activate an action card, you can remove birds from the card &mdash; possibly paying worms, nests and eggs as well &mdash; to take the action shown, such as removing two birds from &quot;Feeding&quot; to get three worms. Spent birds are returned to your personal pool of resources, while other spent resources are placed on the side. Each player in turn order does the same with this action, then whether they used their birds or not, all birds are removed from this action card, flying away to the players' personal pools.&#10;&#10;When the &quot;Dominance&quot; card is activated, the dominant player adjusts their pecking order on the initiative track, then everyone else flies their birds from that card to the other action cards. When &quot;Competition&quot; is activated, which is possible only when enough birds have landed on it, each player spends a nest and worm for each of their birds (removing them if this isn't possible), then flies their birds to other action cards. Players then score points for having the most or secondmost birds on a card and for the birds left in their pool.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Card game containing: 60 Pupil cards, 20 teacher cards and a board with a path from 0 to 200.&#10;&#10;Each player, on their turn, chooses a card from their hand. A typical card will have three boxes at the bottom and in each box there will be a number. For example, the first box might say 8, the second box 7 and the third box +12. The first box is how many spaces you go up the track on the board. The second box is how many you go back, so, in my example, you go forward 8 and back 7 (a gain of 1 forward). The third box is the risk number. If you decide to take a risk, you roll the three dice and if you roll or beat the number (12 in my example) in the third box, you avoid the minus amount in box 2. But if you don't roll enough, then the minus points are doubled.&#10;&#10;At certain points when you cross spaces marked in red on the board, you draw the top card from the Teacher's deck and apply the numbers by adding them to the card played. This will normally result in higher moves, higher minuses and the dice roll needed if you decide to take a risk to avoid the minus number.&#10;&#10;The one with the most advanced spot on the board when the 60 Pupil cards have been used up, wins.&#10;&#10;Despite the common name and similar-appearing artwork, this is not the same game as Silence in Class!&#10;&#10;",

The options are: rolling the dice for movement (in some cases against other players), collecting an additional life card (you start with three in your hand) or drafting a Jumanji card. The Jumanji cards can be both positive and negative and may lock a player on a certain space until being freed. All in all it concerns a game of chance based on dice rolling and card drafting.&#10;&#10;Although the goal is to be the first player to reach the city of gold (Jumanji), this game is partly cooperative in that Jumanji wins when all players are locked on their space or have lost all of their lives.&#10;&#10;",

Flounders are not owned by players, they remain in the centre even if fully assembled.&#10;4. Two dice are thrown for assembly. A player may use either number rolled to add a Flounder part. If both numbers relate to started Flounders, then both numbers can be used.&#10;5. A double thrown grants an extra turn.&#10;6. When a 6 and a 1 are thrown, the player may take a complete Flounder from the centre and if there are none in the centre that player may take a complete Flounder from another player.&#10;7. When all the Flounders are complete and owned, the player with the most wins. If they are tied, they throw the dice to decide the winner.&#10;&#10;",

After the movement, the player has either reached a special field of the board or gets to draw a random encounter card. This may be an item to pick up or an enemy that must be overcome. At the special fields, keys may be collected or allied spirits recruited.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with a special die, which is rolled alternately by the player and by the enemy. Depending on the roll of this die, the rolling party may regain health, inflict damage or invoke special powers. These powers allow to deal more damage, regain health, collect treasure after victory etc. Each player and each enemy has three such powers, and the die roll determines which is used.&#10;&#10;During the game, players collect rewards like gems and tokens that increase their fighting power. They may also increase their power by recruiting an allied spirit.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to collect four keys and open the treasure vault. To collect a key, a coin must be tossed when a key field of the board is reached. The coin is made of cardboard and shows either YES or NO. If the NO side comes up, the action fails and no key is found. The same mechanic is used to check if the treasure vault can be opened once it is reached with four keys - if this fails, four new keys must be collected to retry.&#10;&#10;To hinder the success of the other players, mines can be used. These represent small traps of different type. If a player walks across such a mine - represented by a small cardboard chit - the mine may e.g. destroy equipment.&#10;&#10;Rules are in English, German and Russian.&#10;&#10;",

The aim is to avoid taking the last trick.&#10;&#10;Each trick is led by the winner of the previous trick (the first trick is led by the player to the dealer's left). Each in turn must then play a card equal to or higher in rank than the previous card played. If they cannot, they then must play their lowest card. Whoever plays the highest card, or the last played if equally high, wins the trick.&#10;&#10;Whoever wins the last trick scores penalty points equal to the face value of the card they won the trick with (as does anyone who played a card of the same rank), counting Ace 14, King 13, Queen 12, and Jack 11.&#10;&#10;A player reaching 30 points is a &quot;cucumber&quot; and drops out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The different colored cows tend to be sad when their favourite farmer is not around. It's up to the players to make them happy again by providing the nicest hay, the sunniest weather and the prettiest stable. Finding a farmer (or a farmer's wife) to take care of your cows will make them even happier. Off course, at the same time, you should prevent the other players from doing exactly so.&#10;&#10;Each player receives three cow cards (double sided, different moods) and one stable. The remaining cow cards (double sided,  are mixed together with the action cards. Three of them are spread out. The rest of them forms the drawing pile.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may either take one of the face up cards or the top card of the drawing pile. If it is a cow card you put in in front of you (without changing it's mood). If it is an action card, you perform the action thereby changing the cows' moods, stealing cows from other players, placing cows inside/outside the stables, etc. As an alternative to drawing a card you may also discard one of the face up which becomes out of play.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the drawing pile is used up. The player with the most happy cows (after subtracting minus points for the sad cows) wins the game.&#10;&#10;Trivia: The author was loosely inspired by the reality tv show &quot;Boer zoekt vrouw&quot; (Farmer Wants A Wife) when designing this game.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.koezoektboer.nl/&#10;&#10;",

Like Bingo, one may win by matching all of the fields on the grid-card, or by matching a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The cards themselves are colourfully and engagingly illustrated, and the Spanish captions will be helpful to anyone studying that language. Because the Loter&iacute;a cards include the name of the item beneath its illustration, they are used to teach reading, writing, history and social values. Many bilingual teachers use the game as a teaching tool in the United States.&#10;&#10;The most recognized version of Loter&iacute;a is the &quot;Don Clemente Gallo&quot; version, introduced in Mexico in 1887 by French businessman Don Clemente Jacques. The owners of Don Clemente Gallo Pasatiempos have continued this version through three generations. Throughout the past hundred years, the original artwork found on its 54 cards has remained the same, though the company issued a special edition in 2002 featuring the paintings of artist Teresa Villegas.&#10;&#10;",

Bell in his Games to play (1988) gives the board and the rules of a parisian version by Nar&ccedil;on (1820-1889) for English speaking people, with a lithography by H. Jannin.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a humorous adult card game. Play 'John' cards on your girls to make money. The first player to earn $1500 wins the game. Beware, making money can be difficult. Other players can send your girls to jail. They can't make money until you bail them out. For some reason, this doesn't cost any money.  If one of your girls fails a health exam, she is off the street. A clean bill of health brings her back. You can steal girls from other pimps or steal their Johns. You can get more girls too. This is a good thing, since each girl will only work for you four times.&#10;&#10;Each John is described by a profession or some characteristic. For example there is a Gardener John, a British John, and a Rancher John. Each card describes what services he desires (with some interesting euphemisms), and how much he pays for a trick. Some Johns have favorites. These Johns will pay triple. The above Johns' favorites are the Garden Ho, the Tally Ho, and the Westward Ho.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the creators of Trivial Pursuit, Ubi is a trivia game where you must strive to build your rubi ubi pyramid. Each time you successfully answer a question, you get a piece of your pyramid, provided you answered with the required &quot;precision&quot;. The answers are given based on the map provided, so your answer is basically a geographical area which you feel applies to the question or statement.&#10;&#10;The game is supplied with a reticle (map-reader), which provides you with the letter needed if you want to answer with &quot;triangular precision&quot;.  So you must answer with a number (for hexagonal precision) or a number and a letter (for triangular).  The four sides of the pyramid are earned by answering a question with triangular precision, one for each zone on the map (Americas, Europe, Water, and Universal - which is Africa, Asia and the other 3 zones).&#10;&#10;The rubi (top of the pyramid) is earned by first having the four sides done, then answering a final question.  The zone is determined by rolling the rubi like a die, as the zones are inscribed on the rubi piece.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the modular game Countdown: Special Ops, you are in charge of a special ops team with a special mission! Find hidden bombs and dismantle them, help hostages into safety, or take out terrorist leaders. Due to the high variation in goals, targets, threats and specific circumstances, players need to choose their set-up and strategy each time they start a mission or a campaign. Don't just throw in grenades with your buster at public places such as airports and train stations, or else civilians might get hurt, resulting in negative points on your mission balance. (Plus, you know, injuring civilians is not cool.) Develop your primary skill, but don't neglect your attack power, defense power and other skills if you want to stay alive in this thrilling new game.&#10;&#10;Countdown: Special Ops is fully modular, with players being able to create their own game by adjusting four different aspects of play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game situations: With more than 200 playing cards, the challenges and threats are different each time you play.&#10;     Game mode: You can play a single mission, a campaign or a scenario; each game mode has its own level and duration, and you're advised to start with a single mission on the lowest level (green).&#10;     Level up: Did you succeed a few times on level green? If so, you might want to try the next (orange) level or even a scenario, that is, three missions in a row with increasing difficulty!&#10;     Goals: Even players' goals can be altered. Countdown: Special Ops is a co-operative game, but if you'd like to change the rules, you could add one or two traitors to the team and play &quot;Traitor Mode&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;Development&#10;You can develop your own Special Op by improving his or her skills. This is done in scenario or campaign play. This brings out interesting aspects of the game in which you have to choose how many risk you want to take to gain extra experience or if you want to move slow and stay alive at all cost...&#10;&#10;This variation, combined with the 30-minute time limit per mission, makes the experience of a mission &quot;feel&quot; like an actual PC game in many aspects. Smart development is essential to survive the missions on higher threat levels.&#10;&#10;",

If not, press the button and summon Mr. Meeseeks to help you out. He wants to help. He hates his existence.

He will make you do all sorts of embarrassing and foolish things &mdash; if he doesn't simply kill you off, that is. The longer it takes for you to complete your Request, the more Mr. Meeseeks will appear. Soon, they may turn violent, so please do try your hardest.

    "Description": "(from the box lid:)&#10;&#10;Air War: Modern Tactical Air Combat is a unique, ultra-complex simulation of almost every facet of modern aerial combat.  Thirty of the most important aircraft types to emerge since 1952 - from the Soviet Union, United States, Great Britain, France, Israel and other nations - do battle in historical scenarios from the Middle East to Vietnam, from Korea to India-Pakistan, and in various hypothetical scenarios that include World War Three.  The game is played on a geomorphic map across which playing pieces move through a hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in regulating movement.  Probability charts reveal the outcome of various game functions.&#10;&#10;Contents: 48-page rules booklet; 16-page booklet of additional rules &amp; scenarios; 72-page chart booklet; 700 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; eight 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; soft map sections; and various play aids.&#10;&#10;Level of Complexity: Very High&#10;Average Playing Time: 2 hours&#10;Suitability for Solitaire Play: Very Low&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;At one point called the most complicated wargame ever. This modern air combat game has a scale of 1 airplane per counter, 500 feet per hex and 2.5 seconds per turn.&#10;&#10;The rule book is 48 pages long with 28 of those being rules. There is a large display for keeping track of each plane (4 per display) with a separate track for throttle, weapons, acceleration, turning at 5% increments, altitude and attitude giving each plane a true xyz position.&#10;&#10;Included is a 16 page booklet of 39 charts and tables. There are also individual sheets for each plane with info, charts and tables. There are also individual charts and tables for each type of missile.&#10;&#10;The game rightly suggests that you fly an individual plane around at first to learn how a plane operates before adding weapons. The game for all its detail is not without controversy as to realism. The energy rules and the claim that some aspects of the game are based on educated guesses because of the info on some planes being top secret, have caused this feeling of fudging.&#10;&#10;All in all one of SPI's most ambitious projects. There is also an expansion - Air War Update Kit.&#10;&#10;",
