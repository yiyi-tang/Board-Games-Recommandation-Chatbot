His first order of business was to create panic in the city above and to make his presence known. He sent out his best thieves in the cover of night to steal the king&rsquo;s crown. In the morning the king saw the crown was stolen and in its place a piece of paper with a crudely rendered eye scratched onto it.&#10;&#10;Word spread quickly and the city was both scared and on high alert.&#10;&#10;Your task is to sneak into Zogar&rsquo;s lair and reclaim the crown, and escape alive, in order to restore peace and calm to the city!&#10;&#10;You are attempting to steal back the crown from the evil wizard Zogar.&#10;&#10;First you must turn off the four lanterns in each corner to reveal the hidden crown in the center. During this time you move one space and then flip the tile you left behind. This is to simulate there being light and you being able to see where you are heading.&#10;&#10;Once all four lanterns are turned off you must flip the tile you plan to move to before moving and you leave the tile behind you alone. This is to simulate darkness and it makes things a bit harder. You must draw a little bit on your memory as well.&#10;&#10;You then make your way to the crown. Now you must do everything in reverse to escape. Once all eyes are turned back on the stairs are revealed again in the center, and you begin to move and then flip the tile behind you again.&#10;&#10;All the while you are drawing the attention of the Zogar. If you gain 14 Spot Tokens during the course of the game you are captured and you lose. You will also have to deal with monsters and traps that will steal your health away. Loose all your health and your journey ends.&#10;&#10;To deal with combat, you have four personal player tiles and another separate character marker. You move the marker to an adjacent tile and flip the one you left. You take the result of the tile you land on. If you fail to defeat the enemy, you loose one health token, and must move to another tile until you defeat them. This requires strategy and is a tense little puzzle in itself.&#10;&#10;There are some treasures that help you out that you can find like daggers, health potions, and holy symbols, but your wit and cunning as a player is what will garner you the victory!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "American Civil War 1861-1865 is a strategic level board wargame about the War Between the States. The US player controls the Union forces under Abraham Lincoln; the CSA player controls the Confederate forces under Jefferson Davis.&#10;&#10;Leaders are introduced over the course of the game (each game turn represents 3 months real time) and are activated using 'Command Points'. Each game turn consists of activating and rallying troops, supplying troops (including Port blockades), adding reinforcements, fortifying positions, activating Naval units, and then three separate movement/combat phases are executed.&#10;&#10;On the game turn track is listed a differential in victory points that the CSA player must obtain to win the game (which increases as the game progresses). If the CSA player does not achieve this total by the end of the Spring, 1865 turn he loses.&#10;&#10;",

The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated, or could have participated, in those fights. The maps represent the terrain over which those units fought or could have fought.&#10;&#10;Two games are included: Kabul &rsquo;79 (K&rsquo;79), covering the Soviet seizure of the Afghan capital in that year; and Wurzburg Pentomic (WP), the Soviets versus the US in Germany in the mid-to-late 1950s. There are two players in each game. In K&rsquo;79 one player controls the Soviets and the other commands the Afghans plus optional &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; US reinforcements. In WP one player controls the Soviets, the other runs US and West German forces. Both games use a main body of shared rules, and each also has its own special instructions. Designed by Joseph Miranda.&#10;&#10;Maneuver units include: infantry, elite infantry, air assault, airmobile infantry, mechanized Infantry, armor, armored cavalry, recon, special operations, security, military police, engineers, guerillas and headquarters. Ranged artillery types include: field artillery, self-propelled artillery, assault guns, rocket artillery and air defense artillery.&#10;Most units are battalions or regiments, but the entire counter-mix has units within it as large as divisions and as small as companies. Units are one-step, with their reverse sides used to show their &ldquo;untried&rdquo; status.&#10;&#10;Rules cover: random events, reinforcements, bombardment, suppression, air power, air mobility, atomic weapons, paratroops, recon, screening, special forces, guerrillas, fire control and much more.&#10;&#10;Cold War Battles 2: Pentomic Wurzburg &amp; Kabul '79 was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #263  Jul/Aug 2010.&#10;&#10;Pentomic Wurzburg Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn : 12 hours&#10;Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers&#10;Units: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Kabul '79 Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 273 yards / 250 meters&#10;Units: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; six color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Cold War Battles 2 rules booklet&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-8&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.&rdquo; -Albert Einstein&#10;&#10;STICKS AND STONES 2ND EDITION&#10;Seven days after a limited nuclear exchange has irradiated most of Russia and the United States, Soviets roll across the West German border, eager to claim precious non-irradiated ground for the Politburo. American armor stationed at the border rushes forward to meet them, and World War IV begins, fought with much more than Einstein's sticks and stones.&#10;&#10;BUT SECOND EDITION? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? GOOD QUESTION. HERE'S WHAT'S NEW. &#10;The rules have been updated, revised, and polished. Mark's goal was to create an error-free, easily understood version of the rules. We turned our polished writ over to one of the best layout artist in the industry to make the rules look as good as they read. We hope you'll like the results.&#10;We gave the same treatment to the Player Aid Cards. Again, our goal was to give you error-free, easily understood information, presented in an attractive manner. Additionally, the Fire Results Table as been modified to more closely align with Poland Strikes, and better fit the capabilities of the units in Sticks and Stones. &#10;The attractive counters, map, and Action Cards remain the same. So bottom line, if you bought the 1st edition, all you need to do is download the rules and PACs right here. For free. &#10;HOW DO YOU PLAY?&#10;&#10;Glad you asked. In Sticks and Stones each turn is gamed through several phases. At the beginning of the turn, the players determine initiative with a unique dice-off system in which ties award the initiative to whomever lacked it the previous turn and applying the Commander's Focus to the roll might tilt the odds in your favor. Next, players will draw a scenario-designated  number  Action Cards that may be used for anything from fire support (air and artillery strikes), through rally assists, to negating the opponent's just-played card. Then it is time to rally disrupted units with a simple D6 roll against a unit's morale. Action Cards, in addition to the special Aid chit, may be used to improve a unit's chances of preparing for combat.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Fire Phase and players alternate firing with individual units or stacks of units against in-range and in-sight enemy units. When firing on the enemy tanks, the target's Armor Factor is subtracted from the firing unit's Armor Piercing Factor, a D6 is rolled, and the results checked on the appropriate column on the Fire Results Table, yielding a number of potential hits. The target rolls a die for each potential hit and compares it to their morale. Pass the morale check, that hit is negated. These columns and die rolls can be modified by the target's terrain, flanking fire, the Focus marker (represents the commander's presence), and most importantly Action Cards, which can grant column shifts or even allow the same unit to fire again, adding a delicious uncertainty that the chaos of war. Players continue to alternate attacks until neither wishes to attack.&#10;&#10;Now it is time to move. Unlike the preceding Fire Phase, one player moves ALL his eligible units before the opposition gets to move. Certain units can move and fire or vice versa (with a penalty), unfired opposing units can opportunity fire on enemies moving within their line of sight. As in many other facets of the game, the insightful play of Action Cards during the movement phase is critical, allowing additional movement or opportunity fire conducted by units that have already fired or even the placement of a minefield.&#10;&#10;Finally, we reach the Aid and Focus Phase. Platoon Commander eschews the use of HQs that can be unrealistically targeted. Instead both players have Aid and Focus markers, representing where the commander intends to place emphasis or send additional assets (ammunition, weapons, etc) or first aid. The placement of these markers provides combat and morale bonuses to the units underneath them. Additionally, if the player chooses, the Focus marker can be used to influence the initiative roll. And that's how you play Sticks and Stones.&#10;&#10;EACH GAME INCLUDES:&#10;88 die-cut counters, depicting M901s, M113s, T-72s, T-80s, and M1 Abrams.&#10;1 super hot, only slightly radioactive, post-nuclear playing map.&#10;Easy rules and scenarios, so you can start playing before WWV. &#10;Three Player Aid Cards.&#10;18 Action Cards.&#10;A spiffy Ziploc bag for containment.&#10;You'll need to take two six-sided dice with you to the fallout shelter.&#10;&#10;Game Design: Mark Holt Walker&#10;Players: 2&#10;&#10;Duration: 60-90 minutes&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;",

The mine was so prosperous, in fact, that the troll had accumulated enough wealth to retire after years of hard work.&#10;Once a year, the elves who live in the forests near the mine celebrate their Great Wood Fair. One of the highlights of each Fair is the mining competition. The troll, who enjoys the Fair just as much as the elves, gladly opens up the mine to let the elves dig for gold. Only the fastest and luckiest elf is allowed to keep his gold though, so while the competition is friendly, it is also very challenging. No one seems to care that the elves try to hinder each other by hiding stones where they think their fellow competitors will dig. In the end, it is the most clever elf who will win and stake a claim to his gold.&#10;&#10;This is an simple bluffing game from the White Wind stable. Players spend money to buy shovels &amp; pickaxes to dig for gold. They then enter the mine, and start to dig. But wait!! players also get to place broken shovel and decoy counters on the board as well. A broken shovel means no gold, and you lose the implement you were digging with. All decoys (or no counters) means you get the gold value on the board space you're digging from. The question is - to dig or not to dig??&#10;&#10;The winner is the first to 50 gold, or the highest gold when someone with 50 gold gets out of the mine.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you slide one of the opponent's stones into one of the outer hexagons of the board. If necessary, you push one or more stones already on the board to make room for the new one. By pushing stones into new positions, you can drastically change the situation on the board, hopefully to your advantage.&#10;&#10;The board is non-symmetric, and the shape balances the disadvantage of starting, making Avverso a well-balanced game in addition to being quick and dramatic and requiring deep thought.&#10;&#10;",

Of course the more equipment present, the more gangsters you'll need to get past everything. For a perfect robbery, you'll want to have blueprints of the bank, a safehouse to escape to (so that you don't have to wander the city eternally like the flying Dutchman), and gangsters who are perfect for the situation: an electrician for alarms, a safecracker for safes, and one &quot;gorilla&quot; for each guard. Oh, and unless you want to try walking away with the loot, you'll need some method of transportation.&#10;&#10;Everything that players need is on the four types of cards: banks, hideouts, gangsters, and movement/action. In the first phase of the game, players draft their eleven-card hand &ndash; drawing a card from one stack and discarding a different type of card &ndash; until one player feels he has the perfect hand and shouts &quot;Bank robbery!&quot; This player is announcing that he has already robbed a bank, and now the other players need to figure out where the robbery took place and stop those thugs from getting to their hideout. (After all, if you're not getting the money, you don't want anyone else to have it either!)&#10;&#10;This second phase ends when the gangsters reach their safehouse or one or more opponents block them and show a stronger hand of criminals. During this phase, the bank robber receives no new cards (since he's on the run) while the other players do, giving them resources to hunt down the crooks. If two or more opponents catch the crooks, they each get 10% of the money as a reward; if only one opponent catches the crooks, she can keep the 10% or she can grab the money herself and try to make it to her hideout.&#10;&#10;After playing a predetermined number of bank robberies, the game ends and whoever holds the most money wins!&#10;&#10;",

The play cards go in your hand, and the nut is placed face up on the table in front of you. Play cards come in four types:&#10;&#10;&bull; Grab cards let you grab a nut from another player's stash in various ways, for example, &quot;Grab any one nut card worth 4 or less.&quot;&#10;&#10;&bull; Defense cards can prevent your nuts from being grabbed, e.g., &quot;Stop someone from grabbing one of your nuts.&quot;&#10;&#10;&bull; Mayhem cards are bad things that can happen, e.g., &quot;Choose two other players. They must both miss their next turn.&quot;&#10;&#10;&bull; Antics cards are ways that things do not go as planned when grabbing nuts, e.g., &quot;Draw the top card of the nut deck and put it in your stash.&quot;&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first reveal the top nut card and add it to your stash. Then you play one Grab, Mayhem or Antics card on another player; that player may play a Defend card to possibly prevent your action. Instead of playing a card, you can discard any number of cards from your hand, then draw replacements from the play deck. As soon as someone has more than 20 points worth of nuts, the game ends and this player wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Vince Lombardi's Game&quot; is a football simulation for two players that can be played on three levels. The basic game uses generic football teams. The intermediate game applies aggregate offensive and defensive ratings for the NFL/AFL team of each player's choice. The advanced game permits each side to use the individual stats for each NFL/AFL football player.&#10;&#10;This game was published under the title &quot;Vince Lombardi's Game&quot; in 1970 and 1973, and under the name &quot;Be a Pro Quarterback!&quot; in 1971.&#10;&#10;The latter variant is a bit of an oddity. The cover lists the maker as Sportsgames, the instructions list the maker as Sports Games, and the board lists the maker as RGI. Whoever published that edition, &quot;Be a Pro Quarterback!&quot; served as an odd placeholder between RGI's 1970 and 1973 Vince Lombardi football games. The rules of the game are the same as for the 1970 &quot;Vince Lombardi Game&quot; edition; only the players are different.&#10;&#10;See also the 1967 version &quot;Fran Tarkenton's Pro Football&quot; by RGI, using the same plays and cards, but in a much higher quality format. (The cards are thick board, laminated, and backed with light felt. The plays board is full color on a stand, laminated so the play differentials can be listed by each play in grease pencil. That version also includes a down maker and a ten yard marker.)&#10;&#10;",

(Question and illustration cards have text in Italian, English, German and French.) On a turn, a player either plays and reads a question card &ndash; which the player who holds the illustration card must answer as honestly as possible &ndash; or tries to guess the word hidden on the card. Before a player guesses, he can ante any number of chips into the pot. If no one else matches his ante, he claims all the chips in the pot without having to guess the word; if at least one other player antes, he must give his guess, winning the pot if correct.&#10;&#10;When a round end, the next player chooses a word from an illustration card and the game continues. When one player runs out of chips, the game ends and the player with the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;",

Morpheus must make sure that dreams leave Oniria to the world and minds of mortals at the same rate as to this moment, otherwise Earth is doomed to regress of thinking and Oniria &ndash; to annihilation. Mortals need dreams to think, remember and stimulate their imagination, Oniria needs sleeping humans to exist &ndash; without dreamers Oniria will be left without power. But Morpheus cannot rule Kingdom of Dreams and create dreams and send them alone. That is why he needs an assistant.  He makes a competition &ndash; Dreamweavers have three months (this is rather foggy, time in Oniria works &ndash; like most things &ndash; differently than in mortal world) to weave the most dreams with the most powerful oniric energies &ndash; the best weaver will become Morpheus&rsquo; right hand, and simultaneously second most powerful creature in Oniria.&#10;&#10;Morpheus is a game for 2-4 players in which players will create dreams. At the beginning of each turn, the active player rolls the dice. Then, players will choose the dice and according to the number they will get different gifts, with essence among them. After that, at certain locations Dreamweavers can assign the essence to dreams and completing them. Other gifts include Chronite, a rare mineral able to bend time, used as a currency and Onirite, a device which can bend the structure of Oniria, allowing players to take additional actions. Dreamweavers will travel through the land of Oniria exactly three months of game-time, which equals 21 turns. The board is randomly assembled from tiles and dreamweavers will go a full circle from location to location. Player who creates the most powerful dreams and collects the most victory points wins the game and becomes right hand and assistant of Morpheus.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to steal the hidden treasures of the other captains by figuring out the three landmarks that mark where each treasure is hidden. The first player to a treasure takes the largest share, while those who reach it second or third receive less. Keeping your treasure from being stolen is also worth victory points in the end. Find and steal the most treasures first to win in the end!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Players each get a random set of 3 cards (3 colors) each numbered 1-6: a unique combination. There are 3 decks of question cards matching these colors. On your turn, flip the top 3 questions; you may replace one of these by flipping the next card in that deck. All other players then respond AYE or NAY if they do or do not (respectively) have any exact matches. At any time players may guess the combo of any player by putting their guess into the treasure chest box. Each player in an n-player game may make n unique guesses.&#10;&#10;After 15 rounds, guesses are revealed in the order they were submitted. If correct, that player will steal from that pirate's treasure: first 3, then 2, then 1. If no one steals your treasure, it's worth 6 to you; if they do, you lose the points they're taking. The player with the most treasure (their own, plus any stolen from others) wins!&#10;&#10;",

Using fluid and dynamic systems for integrating the fierce combat and rapid movements of the companies and battalions contesting the beaches, cliffs, swamps and bocage bordering the rough North Sea coast, players will find the easy rules to offer rich puzzles and surprising opportunities on the cross-map march to victory.&#10;&#10;Bernard Law Montgomery led the Allied landings on the beaches closest to Germany, with the ambitious goal of moving inland and reaching the vital city of Caen within a day or two (dubbed &quot;Operation Neptune&quot;). But the German 716th Division, support by elements of the 21st Panzer Division, slowed the British advance down during these critical first few days and ultimately kept &lsquo;Monty&rsquo; out of Caen until, after Allied offensives in June, July, and August, they cleared the area once and for all.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;- Two complete games!&#10;- One 4-page, color  Standard Rules booklet&#10;- 80 color, 2-sided die-cut 1/2&quot; mounted pieces&#10;- 28 round 5/8&quot; counters&#10;- Two 11&quot; x 17&quot; color game maps with tables&#10;- Illustrated Examples of Play, Exclusive and Optional Game Rules&#10;- Part of a 5 game series!&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 8 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 company to regiment; each hex is 1 kilometer, and each turn is about 4.5 hours.&#10;&#10;",

In 1997 Helmut Ohley produced a variant set of rules for 18FR which introduced ports, the special track-tiles, etc. In 2009 J C Lawrence in collaboration with Helmut Ohley updated 18FR, extending and clarifying Helmut's original variant into a more interesting game.  Both variants require additional components to 1830: Railways & Robber Barons to play (files are provided to make your own) and assumes familiarity with the 1830: Railways & Robber Barons rules.&#10;&#10;Though this uses components of 1830 this is not an expansion, but is a separate standalone game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nubia is a solitaire game where you rule a Black African civilization of three Christian kingdoms in the Nile Valley: Nobadia, Makuria, and Alodia. Your culture is an heir to the glories of Ancient Egypt and the legendary Kingdom of Kush, but long gone are the days when you were conquering and ruling Egypt. In the game, it is A.D. 1172 and Nubia is under siege! For 400 years, you will battle to defend civilization against the fierce pagans of the Funj, and a jihad of marauding land-hungry Arabs. Deploy your famous archers, build fortified monasteries, send the Crown Prince into battle, and marry off your daughters in a desperate effort to stem the tide.&#10;&#10;This fast-play, fun, and educational solitaire game uses a system created by Darin Leviloff. &ldquo;Mek&rdquo; markers on five converging paths represent hostile Arab and pagan armies that surround your kingdoms. The paths all meet in Soba, your fabulously wealthy capital at the juncture of the Blue and White Nile rivers, where the danger of a &ldquo;Collapse&rdquo; exists if any of those armies makes it that far. In addition, three tracks representing medieval Nubian society (Nobility, Kingship, and the Army) greatly impact the overall situation. A card draw determines which paths and tracks move against you this turn, while the cards teach you about the history of ancient and medieval Nubia. The number of &ldquo;Efforts&rdquo; which you can use to move them back in your favor (if the Effort die roll succeeds) depends on the personal talents of your current Uru (king) and his chief advisor, the Metropolitan Bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church.&#10;&#10;Managing Efforts is key to the game, and you never have as many as you want. You can obtain more by selling off land and using your bishops for political gain instead of their natural religious calling: a short term strategy that can cost you victory points in the end. Each risky gambit is aimed at averting a system-wide social collapse, which can end the game suddenly. Your success (or failure) in holding off the five hostile armies helps determine how many noble families are still on your side when a Collapse approaches, so the better you play the game, the less chance the Collapse gets off the ground.&#10;&#10;As the game draws to a close, the Portuguese are searching Africa for the fabled Christian &ldquo;Kingdom of Prester John.&rdquo; Those legends may refer to you! Can you hold medieval Nubia together long enough to make contact with them and win the game?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The title comes from Amerigo Vespucci, and like that famed explorer, you must travel the world to search for goods. (Unlike him, you won't have a couple of continents named after you.) The farther you explore, the more likely you are to find goods of better value, but you have to make it back to market if you plan to sell anything, so don't wander off too far.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Cards have a picture of a boat, 1-3 captain's wheels, and 1 of 5 goods types (in differing rarities in the deck). Start with a hand of ... 4? On your turn, either sail (start a voyage if you're not on one, or continue the current voyage) or market (if you're not on a voyage).To sail further, play a card with the ship moving to the right -- #wheels adds to distance of voyage. May play out of your hand, or from your score pile (play face down; counts as 3 wheels). OR, explore: rotate last card clockwise, draw cards from deck (2 x distance sailed, hand limit 12). After exploring, must sail home; cards played count 2xwheels -- home when you've played at least the distance of the voyage. Upon arriving home, draw bonus cards (hand limit still applies):&#10;- if voyage was longest distance of all current voyages, 1 card.&#10;- if voyage was 7 wheels, 1 card; 8 wheels, 2; 9+ wheels, 3.&#10;&#10;If Marketing, add cards from hand to display; max 12 cards on display. Sort by type of goods. OR, sell cards already on display: sell all possible. Rarest good (looking at all markets on table) worth 1 coin per card. Most popular worth 1 coin/2 cards. All others are common, and worth 1 coin/3 cards. If tied for rarest/popular, goods become common. Sold goods are flipped over to represent coins (added to your score pile) or discarded.&#10;&#10;Game ends immediately if, after the first time through the draw deck, all players are at home at the same time; or the 2nd time through the draw deck. Make final sales, with all cards left in hand and on display worth 1 coin/4 cards.&#10;&#10;Most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

A 2nd edition was never published. It was reviewed by Phil Orbanes in Games and Puzzles Magazine #68 under the heading of &quot;Great Games that Never Made It.&quot; It has been modified slightly and released as a kit by Paul Jefferies, who renamed it Sack to fit his newly applied theme. In addition to Games and Puzzles #68 (reprinted in Games International (Issue 4 &#226;&#128;&#147; April 1989)) and Parlett&#039;s The Oxford History of Board Games, Bantu has recently been discussed in Abstract Games Magazine.&#10;&#10;This is a racing game. The track is circular, with four lanes, with some interaction and crossing over between lanes. Each player (2-4) has four pawns numbered 1-4. This number indicates the distance the pawn may move per turn, and where it may be entered onto the board (the fastest pawn (4) must travel the full distance, but each successively slower pawn travels one fourth less distance than its predecessor, so that the (1) pawn travels only one quarter of the board). Pawns may not jump others nor may two pawns occupy the same space. Ending a turn on a space occupied by an opponent's pawn causes the opponent's pawn to be returned to its starting position.  Pawns of any ownership that lie on spaces connected by a shaded background add their values together for determining movement. So a (red 1), (blue 4), (green 3) that all lie within the same shaded area would  give the first pawn to move, 8 spaces.  A player must use all movement without retracing his path on that turn.  If the player can not use the entire movement then the pawn can not be moved.  If none of his pawns may be moved the entire amount then the player forfeits that turn. First to bear all pawns off wins.&#10;&#10;",

Neutron warheads, rocket shells, lasers and charged particle beams fly through the vacuum.  Units move over the ground and in the &quot;air&quot;, and engagement ranges are limited only by a unit's current horizon, which depends on its altitude.  Communications, command and control, morale, cumulative vehicle damage, orbiting weapons platforms...It's all there!&#10;&#10;Several scenarios are provided, with playing times ranging from one to four hours.  Geomorphic mapboards and movable terrain features (craters of various sizes) provide for plenty of replayability.&#10;&#10;Solar Marine, also by Kerry Anderson, is very similar to Marine: 2002.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "OVERDRIVE is a game of dice allocation, which represents the members of your band. Each player takes on the role of the best rock band in their universe, whose goal is to get the most points until the last battle of bands. Use unique techniques, optimize your bandwidth and invest in improvements to prove who is the biggest band in the whole multiverse. This is rock'n roll, baby!&#10;&#10;LIST OF COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;1 Rules Book&#10;5 Band Sheet&#10;1 Game Board&#10;4 Disc Award Tiles&#10;16 cards of Opportunities&#10;20 Cancellation tiles&#10;1 First Player token&#10;24 Custom dices&#10;&#10;The game board contains the most basic actions of dice allocation. With a combination of dice faces, the player allocates their dice in the spaces available to perform the specific actions. If a space already contains dices from other players, you can not use that space.&#10;All players receive at the beginning of the match 4 dices of their color, which represents the members of their band. On your turn, you use the faces of your rolled dice, and allocate them on the board.&#10;In addition to the board, there are the Hit Cards, which work the same way, as there are spaces available to allocate dice and receive the bonuses. The difference is that a player can buy a Hit, and when another player allocates dices on his Hit, you are also benefited. For this reason, there is a deck of Hits with 18 different cards to be restored to the table as the players buy them (only 3 are revealed).&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a Band Sheet from their band, and each of them has the Fan, Fame, Overdrive and Money tracks, which are marked with cubes. Throughout the match, each player, through their actions, can improve these attributes to try to improve their score at the end of the game. Each band also has special abilities that are unlocked throughout the match, optimizing their technique and improving their performance.&#10;At the table, there are 4 discs of awards, which are goals that bands can achieve to claim them, and increase their score. When you take an award disc (bronze, silver, gold or diamond), you become the owner of it, and another player can not take it from you. You still have the option of swapping it for another better scoring disc when you can meet your requirements, but you will have to return the lower scoring score, making it available to other players.&#10;&#10;Finally, at the end of rounds 3, 6 and 8 (total of 8 rounds) the Battle of Bands takes place. Players use their dices to fight between them, trying to eliminate opponents' dices for 2 scrolling acts and comparing results. You can only defeat an opponent's dice if you have more equal faces than the symbol you want to remove from it. For example, you can use 2 skull faces to defeat the only skull result of one of your target foes. At the end of the battle, the remaining dice will provide bonuses to the players.&#10;In addition to the game, there is also a concern to accumulate symbols for the collection, which are printed on the Hit Cards, the Band Sheet, and Dices at the end of the last battle. This will give you more points towards the end of the match, as you score with each collection of at least 3 identical or different symbols.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is, at the end of round 8, to have more victory points than its opponents, thus becoming the best band of the multiverse.&#10;The game is for 2 to 4 players, and the starting time is around 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Far from the galactic core, Thyrria and its moons have been strip-mined and left for dead. Abandoned workers huddle together in makeshift settlements, struggling to survive in a world of scarce resources and lawlessness. Native nomads and bizarre creatures resurface to take back the wasteland. Factions and adventurers rise and fall, but only the greatest will be remembered in legend.&#10;&#10;Forsaken is an immersive sandbox adventure game where you take the role of a character looking to leave their mark in the harshest of worlds. Every character has a personalized branching story, with every path uniquely-tailored to the choices you make along the way. How will you change the face of Thyrria, and how will Thyrria change you?&#10;&#10;Your goal is to secure your place as a legend in any way you can, but there are many ways to become a legend. Navigating through personal and public story objectives, doing odd jobs, hunting down bounties, fulfilling prophecies, and even gambling at the Cantina can all advance your legend tracker. Finding the right opportunities to upgrade your gear, weapons, and skills can help you along the way. Once a player reaches the end of the track, the player with the greatest legend wins.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you may trigger an event or encounter, which allows you an opportunity to permanently change the game and the emergent story based on the decisions you make. These changes can determine your character&rsquo;s motives and goals personally, or guide the shared stories to impact the world itself. The more you change about the world, the bigger the mark you make and the greater your legend will be.&#10;&#10;",

The number of piles varies depending on the number of players, and if players ever reach a moment in which no one can play, everyone draws a card and it adds it to their hand at the same time, then the game play resumes.&#10;&#10;",

To get around this &ldquo;Operation PARTY&rdquo; is born. The quietest kong of each night will get bananas as a reward. But the noisiest kong will get a banana peel in the face instead. At the end of the third night, the party must end because by then KONGKANG will be wide awake. You must hoard as much banana as possible before KONGKANG wakes up. The kong that collects the most bananas wins.&#10;&#10;Kongkang: the wild party is a party card game based on a traditional card game from Southern Thailand called &quot;Kang&quot;. Players try to get rid of high cards and keep the low one.  But that is not all, you can steal banana tokens from you another player via in-game Flow mechanic. Or use ability card to hinder other players. The player who has the lowest hand when the round end, wins banana tokens. After three rounds, the player with the most banana tokens wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Last Resort, each player is the proud new owner of a defunct space station, which they plan to turn into the galaxy&rsquo;s trendiest space resort!&#10;&#10;Each round (or &lsquo;season&rsquo;) players will select one of their four advert cards to play, broadcasting it across the galaxy to attract tourists! These advert cards also dictate which parts of your station guests can check out of (generating income) and what kind of tile you can build this round. But beware &ndash; playing the same advert as another station will generate interference, causing Malfunction tiles to crop up on both stations!&#10;&#10;When players are done checking out tourists and buying new tiles, rockets packed with new tourists will arrive! In the Arrivals phase, players draft tourists to visit their stations, with the players whose attractions and amenities most align with current trends getting to pick first (which usually means they will also get extra tourists, as arrival numbers are rarely an exact multiple of the player count!) If a player does not have a suitable spot for the type of tourist they wish to draft, the tourist is ejected into space, negatively affecting your station&rsquo;s ratings!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the most QUID &ndash; or Quantum Universal Intergalactic Denomination, the accepted currency of all space resorts. QUID is generated not only by checking out tourists, but also competing to be the highest in each of the four &lsquo;Prestige&rsquo; categories &ndash; Thrills, Entertainment, Relaxation and Inspiration!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
