    "Description": "Potential Judge candidates are usually inducted into the Academy of Law at the tender age of five. Here, they are subject to rigorous academic training in all aspects of the law that governs the North American Mega-Cities. By the end of the process, they have acquired a level of knowledge that would exceed those of the most senior lawyers and justice officials of the early 21st century.&#10;&#10;In parallel to their academic training, they undergo an intensive physical and mental exercise programme that hones their firearms and close combat skills whilst also preparing them to endure the various injuries and physical hardships that life patrolling the streets will throw at them.&#10;&#10;Whilst the life of a cadet is mostly taken up by study and training, if a particularly serious situation or crisis demands the Justice Department deploy more manpower, cadets may be armed and sent out onto the streets, usually as part of a carefully monitored team engaging in fairly low intensity operations. One highlight of a cadet&rsquo;s continual assessment is the &lsquo;Hotdog Run&rsquo; where a group of cadets accompanied by Senior Judges are sent on patrol in the radioactive hell of the Cursed Earth beyond the Mega-City&rsquo;s walls.&#10;&#10;However, during the Necropolis and Chaos Day incidents cadets were deployed into highly dangerous situations normally only handled by a fully qualified Judge. Many cadets performed bravely and well, as befitted their training, but the losses incurred had serious future implications for the Justice Department when it was already struggling to maintain enough qualified Street Judges.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, like so many of his colleagues, he had an unhealthy obsession with Judge Dredd. Not only had the venerable Judge been instrumental in exposing the worst excesses of the SJS under Judge Cal, he also represented the one thing that the SJS could simply not process: an incorruptible Judge.&#10;&#10;For several years, Gerhart pursued a vendetta against Dredd to uncover some transgression, no matter how small. While investigating the death of a Tek Judge, he unsuccessfully tried to force Dredd to admit having a guilty conscience about the 350 million citizens who fell to the Chaos Virus, a bio&#226;&#128;&#144;weapon unleashed by Sov agents in revenge for Dredd destroying East&#226;&#128;&#144;Meg One.&#10;&#10;Ultimately Gerhart&rsquo;s obsession with Dredd would cost him dearly. He saved Dredd&rsquo;s life by taking the impact of a missile meant for his nemesis. He simply could not let Dredd die before guilt was fully proven. Gerhart&rsquo;s self&#226;&#128;&#144;sacrifice saw fully half of his shattered body being replaced by cybernetic parts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The ball moves the total of the three dice in the air and then rolls an additional 50 yards. A player may choose to roll only one or two dice.&#10;&#10;When in the approach area only one die is rolled and a chart is consulted, and there are additional rules for playing from the rough or a hazard.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn a player rolls a die and moves one of their pieces accordingly. If it lands on a dot it moves through the opening to the next row. If it lands on an X the player loses their next turn.&#10;&#10;If a piece encounters any other piece it ricochets and continues its movement back the way it came. However, it may not end up where it started the turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Passage is a connection game played on a 20x20 square grid. Each player has an identical (except for color) set of polyominoes - three each of the seven shown. The pieces have semicircles along their edges.&#10;&#10;Players are attempting to construct a path of their pieces between two opposite edges of the board. When pieces are next to each other their semicircles will join to form full circles. If a player can play a piece on top of an opposing piece so that at least two squares are covered and it forms more circles with adjacent pieces, the opposing piece is captured and replaced.&#10;&#10;When a path between edges is formed (and can't be broken by an immediate capture) each player counts their longest path and the player with the longer one scores the difference. A series of games should be played to determine the overall winner.&#10;&#10;The designer later (in Games &amp; Puzzles #50) suggested playing with two copies of each piece instead, or using a 24x24 board.&#10;&#10;",

So I made it!! I have been a big fan of Dungeon Core fiction for ages and thought that being able to physically build your own adventurer trap would be cool.&#10;&#10;Little Living Dungeon is a mint tin game so it is small and portable, you start with your core room, and a small amount of Mana to grow your dungeon by adding extra rooms, at the end each day a adventurer will enter your dungeon to try and get to the core, and you will hopefully fight them off, as you grow your dungeon the adventurers get stronger and more of them. All combat is dice roll based.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The second way is to control one of the circles of sleep by building four scenes in it.&#10;&#10;Create your own decks from over 100 available cards, strategically manage your special Pawns to control what is happening on the board so that you won't be devoured in the Lucid Dream.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The dream was there from the beginning.

    "Description": "In World War II it was the duty of all Allied prisoners of war (POWs) to try to escape their captors. If the escape was successful they could re-join the war, but even a failed attempt was not without merit, as it would keep many of the enemy busy tracking down escaped prisoners. Once having escaped the camp, the journey home would prove treacherous, and many POWs would lose their lives in the months that followed. Only sheer grit and determination would get them to safety. Hungry and weak from the backbreaking work suffered at the camps, they would need to draw on what little strength remained to pass through enemy terrain and reach neutral territory, to find a way back home.&#10;&#10;Each game of Escaping WWII begins with a group of four servicemen who have managed to break free from one of six prisoner of war camps. In the weeks leading up to their escape, they have gathered a few basic supplies, and made a crude map in order to plan their escape. Tired and hungry, they begin the long journey to freedom. Their immediate goal is to reach Paris and hook up with the French Resistance.&#10;&#10;With most of Europe under the Nazis control, getting to Paris will not be easy, and with the Nazi military on high alert, eyes are everywhere. Knowing who to trust will be difficult, and with the SS and the Gestapo relentlessly trying to track down escaped prisoners all over Europe, their agents will be everywhere. Local Resistance groups fighting back against the Nazi regime may provide vital assistance during the escape, but finding them will often prove dangerous.&#10;&#10;If they get to Paris, the resistance will provide all the necessary documentation, and help them with a &ldquo;Freedom Plan&rdquo;. This is vital to their escape, and without it, they dare not enter the South of France (the blue spaces shown on the servicemen&rsquo;s map).&#10;&#10;Once a Freedom Plan has been secured, the servicemen must travel through France and cross into Spain to win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;The game is available from the Game Crafter:&#10;&#10;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/escaping-wwii&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You'll examine real legal cases about careless, irresponsible acts that resulted in injury and damage to property.&#10;&#10;One player is appointed &quot;Chief Judge&quot; and (Step 1) draws one of the 120 Case Cards included with the game (they are intended to be played through sequentially). The Chief Judge reads aloud the basic information on the case, then directs an open discussion (Step 2). Then, at the bottom of each Case Card are one or more &quot;Consider Questions which the Chief Judge then reads aloud (Step 3), kicking off a second discussion in light of the new topics raised (Step 4).&#10;&#10;Eventually, each judge arrives at his or her own decision about the case (Step 5), stating it, and these are then recorded, as the Chief Judge flips the Case Card over and reads aloud the court's actual decision and reasons (Step 6).&#10;&#10;Judges who got it right then level up from Court Level 1 to Court Level 2 (levels are points), the Case Card is discarded, the next player clockwise from the Chief Judge takes over as the new chief, and the game continues through six cases. The judge who has reached the highest Court Level wins!&#10;As the game includes 120 legal cases, there are 20 full plays in the box, and the cases get more interesting and complicated as you go. The real-life cases were chosen because they were crazy memorable, legally important, or about everyday life.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#232;&#183;&#161;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#131; (Atome no Sakazuki) is a Japanese mafia game for 2 players only.&#10;&#10;The theme is the tracing of the six Yakuza leaders. The player will be a child of any of these six and will strive to have his boss elected next president. Everything from a word that the other party says, to the action that got lost for a moment, is a psychological battle of batch bees that is a hint to win.&#10;&#10;During the game you can feel the extraordinary tension, like the world of Yakuza. It is a game that you want to play with people who are close to each other and who know each other's personality. This game generally belongs to the genre called &quot;identity concealment type game&quot;. For this reason, revealing your identity (who is the boss in this game) is synonymous with defeat in the game.&#10;&#10;Actually, if the identity is out of the way, such as in a werewolf game, the game is not over immediately, but it will inevitably be at a disadvantage. And most of the information in this game is open. The information hidden by the opponent is only the main card of each other, and the contents of the hand are visible to each other until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the important information is from &quot;what to put out&quot; to &quot;a little action that I tried to put in this character for a moment&quot;. I want to raise the position of my boss, but the other party has the final say.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#183;&#161;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#230;&#156;&#159;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#229;&#176;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#158;&#172;&#232;&#191;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#231;&#183;&#138;&#229;&#188;&#181;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#228;&#186;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#159;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#176;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#230;&#159;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#172;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#232;&#136;&#172;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#229;&#140;&#191;&#231;&#179;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#177;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#229;&#140;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#231;&#190;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#174;&#159;&#233;&#154;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&

If you found your crusading sessions lack grievance, drama, and PvP, or your Purgatorium looks too sad and unpopulated, you should add this Army to the Saracene Deck and dive right into a fascinating world of the massacre, grieving, and vendettas, and see why exactly the Crusades ended the way they ended!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game starts with eighteen cards dealt face-down on the tableau to form three face-down &quot;pyramids&quot; of six cards each, and a row of ten cards beneath. This is built by dealing out ten cards face-up in a row; then nine cards face-down above them, offset by half a card to the right; then six cards above those, offset by the same amount (and leaving a one-card gap after the second and fourth cards); then three cards to cap the three pyramids.&#10;&#10;The twenty-four remaining cards make up the stock. The first card from the stock is put in the waste pile (sometimes known as the foundation/discard). For a card in the tableau to be moved to the waste pile, it must be a rank higher or lower regardless of suit. This card becomes the new top card and the process is repeated several times (e.g. 7-8-9-10-9-10-J-10-9-8, etc.) until the sequence stops. Along the way, any face-down cards that are no longer overlapping are turned up.&#10;&#10;In case the sequence is stopped, i.e. no card on the tableau can be put over the top card of the waste pile, a card is placed on the waste pile from the stock to see if it can start a new sequence. Cards are transferred from the stock to the waste pile one at a time as long as it does not begin a new sequence with the cards on the tableau.&#10;&#10;If there is no scoring being tracked, the game is won if all three peaks are cleared before or after the last card from the stock is discarded to the waste pile. However, the game is lost if there are still cards that cannot be placed on the waste pile after the stock has run out.&#10;&#10;",

Players use decks of 50 cards to attack and defend with Dragons of many types and colors. For an added challenge, players may use up to six (6) dice to increase the difficulty!&#10;&#10;Players draw cards and place dragons of varying colors with different abilities as Attackers or Defenders, and use Action cards that effect the entire field of play, in order to defeat their opponent by reducing their life points to 0.&#10;&#10;Players can capture each of the 27 locations to win a game and advance their Avatar Dragon one level. Certain levels unlock Stats that can be altered and each Location offers a benefit that can be used to the player's advantage. Utilizing any of the 6 dice allows access to Random Encounters, and a Stat Multiplier which multiplies all values on every card. Both of these features increase game time, but offer a more detailed experience.&#10;&#10;Another option for two or more players is Fast Duels, in which players simply draw 1 dragon card at a time against their opponent(s). The player with the highest attack wins the round, unless an opponent has a dragon with equal or higher defense, then the first player loses. If incorporating Regions, the game is over when 1 player controls all 27 locations.

Mars now has an atmosphere and your team is moving full throttle to build cities!&#10;&#10;Tear-a-Form on Mars is a &ldquo;Speak-and-Write&rdquo; variant on the Roll-and-Write genre.&#10;&#10;In Tear-a-Form on Mars, players are building a utopia on mars!&#10; In Tear-a-Form on Mars, each player will be managing two private grids which represent two separate plots of land:&#10;1. Their Building Site.&#10;2. Their Exploration Site.&#10;&#10;We have learned from our missteps on earth and on mars we are doing it right, everyone has equal say! This means when a player builds, all players must build in that way. Of course, the new world also values individuality and artistry, so all players may also equally express flexibility in their decisions. Surely, this should be easy for you!&#10;Happy building! Oh, and watch out for underground gas pockets!&#10;&#10;Each turn the active player will choose two areas to fill-in on their Build Site&#10;1. A private area that only they fill-in.&#10;2. A public area that all players must fill-in.&#10;&#10;When players fill-in enough of their grid to match the shape of a polyomino Building Card they own, they may discard that card to gain the benefits and points it offers. Plan accordingly because your space will become more limited as the game unfolds!&#10;&#10;Players will also find themselves using Redirect Cards to manipulate the areas they are required to fill-in to their advantage.&#10;&#10;But that's not all! Each player has been issued a Mars-Rover! The spaces you decide to fill-in on your Building Site will dictate its movement through the exploration site. This will gain you valuable resources, but watch out for gas pockets!&#10;&#10;The game's end is triggered when a player no longer has space to fulfill their Building Cards. At this point all players may spend their remaining resources to build whatever last few buildings they can!&#10;&#10;Tally your score with your private objectives, subtract points lost due to gas pockets, and the player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Welcome to Mars! You'll love it here!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Claws of the Tiger: Malaya 1941-1942 is a two-player, beer-and-pretzels game based on the December 1941 Japanese invasion of Malaya. One player controls the forces of Imperial Japan; the other plays those of the British Commonwealth.&#10;&#10;The game reflects the advantages enjoyed by the Japanese during the invasion in terms of command and control, equipment and training, and air superiority. Perhaps the primary reason for the so-called &ldquo;worst disaster&rdquo; in British military history, however, was the contrast between the effective and efficient strategic and tactical decisions taken by the Japanese high command and the ill-advised choices made by their British counterparts.  The latter were simply unprepared for &ldquo;modern&rdquo; warfare.&#10;&#10;In the game such decisions are the preserve of players who are likely to be better matched and, of course, under far less duress than the historical commanders. It is for this reason that the Victory Conditions are set so that the Japanese can win the game even if they do not replicate their historical achievement of capturing Singapore in 70 days.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;One 17&rdquo; x 21&rdquo; Hexagonal Game Map&#10;15 British and Japanese Force Counters&#10;Two Force Detail Sheets&#10;127 Force Detail Markers&#10;Nine Activation Markers&#10;Two Tactical Detail Sheets&#10;12 Tactical Detail Markers&#10;One Game Turn Marker&#10;Four Fortified Hex Markers&#10;Eight Solitaire Variant Excluded Force Counters&#10;Extended Example of Play&#10;&#10;Game Features:&#10;16 Game Turns&#10;Force Movement and Combat&#10;8-Page Rules Book&#10;Optional Rules&#10;176 Counters and Markers&#10;Movement by Sea&#10;Passable and Unpassable Terrain&#10;British Fortified Hexes&#10;Air Support&#10;British and Japanese Reinforcements&#10;Army Supply&#10;Solitaire Optional Variant&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

You and up to 4 four other friends will help the local sensei to rebuild their resepective dojos.

The first to build a sensei's dojo wins all glory!&#10;&#10;During your turn, draft a card, perform an action, draft a 2nd card, and perform another action. Free actions may be performed unlimited times at any point during your turn.&#10;&#10;To build a sensei&rsquo;s dojo, collect a set of set of 4 cards matching the same suit. (Ex. 1 stone temple, 1 stone eastern wall, 1 stone western wall, and 1 stone sensei). Place them in their appropriate spaces within your 6 space, pyramid-shaped, player area.&#10;&#10;In addition to set collection, each card type has a unique ability. For example, if you have a sensei in your play area, you may throw a shuriken (spend the shuriken by taping one of its corners on the opponent&rsquo;s targeted card) do attack! Combine certain card types to unlock hidden abilities! Ex: Having the wood sensei and the wood temple allows you to search the discard pile for 1 wall card (once per turn). You may also strategically place cards face-down to keep a card safe, withhold it from an enemy, or even to set a trap!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

At the equator a series of small settlements united by narrow streets to the only immense city, called Pyraqva, dimly illuminated by an eternal dawn. And then there is the Chasm where the Castle once stood, a huge mouth from which emerge unclean screams and creatures that should not exist. After the &quot;Great War&quot; against &quot;The Ancient Evil&quot; and its armies, little remained of that splendid city, but a group of heroes wants to exterminate their enemy once and for all, crossing dangerous paths, corridors of the castle dungeons, immense ravines and enemies of all kinds, up to the last cave at the base of the Chasm, in search of revenge.&quot;&#10;&#10;GAME MODES &#10;CO-OP: If a player chooses to face the Dungeon alone he will use 2 characters, the party can have 4 characters in total: therefore 2 players can use one hero  each, or 2 each ...

Players try to win rounds by playing their higher value cards. But the lower cards are cheaper to get, and give more victory points. Can players out-think their opponents and win rounds at lower cost?&#10;&#10;The cards have numbers and stars; high cards have few stars, low cards have more stars. Players each choose a card in secret and then reveal them. Mostly, the highest number will win the round, but some low cards will beat a higher value (so a 1 beats a 0 and a 5). Hence, the round has a rock-scissors-paper resolution.&#10;&#10;The winning card gets points by multiplying the card's stars by the number of players beaten. So a high card might win, but not get many points. If a player can win with a low card, they gain a much higher score.&#10;&#10;Players can also collect resource tokens (spent by playing some cards), and win bonus tiles from the centre. The game turns on being able to predict what other players will do, and maximise your scoring by winning with a low card, or collecting bonuses when you can't win.&#10;&#10;The game comes with JPN/ENG rules.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The game will use the same basic set of rules as the other games* in the series  and also has a few separate rules to account for the time period and way of war in the early 1700's. The map depicts the border area in southern Norway and Sweden, from Trondheim to Gothenburg.&#10;&#10;As the Swedish player your goal is to force a Norwegian surrender by capturing Christiania (modern-day Oslo) and at least two major fortresses. And keep your King alive,of course.

A game that will expand your vocabulary and bring out even forgotten words from the depths of your mind. The aim is to create Latvian words from the most valuable syllables, thus accumulating as many points as possible.&#10;On each card, there is one syllable that, when put together during the game, forms words. The rarer the syllable used, the more valuable the word is created. Each syllable has been assigned points depending on the frequency of use of syllables in Latvian. With this game you can make more than 2000 words. These include nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Words can be formed in basic forms and inflections - either.

Players build up armies to fight for the kingdom, using bluffing and bargaining. Using psychology to out-think the opponents is needed, as the ending is never certain.&#10;&#10;After a long war, the feudal system has declined, and leading aristocrats began to fight for the right to inherit the throne. Soldiers engage in combat seeking specific rewards.&#10;&#10;Practical rewards often cause betrayal and secession and end the era of loyalty and justice. In such an era, you must become one of the leading aristocracy. Form an army stronger than anyone in an arms race, for the war will bring in troops and mercenaries owned by other aristocrats.&#10;&#10;Only players can see their units targeted for the competition, so it is fun to have a psychological battle with such bluffing or bargaining. Without knowing the enmey well enough, players cannot forecast the winner.&#10;user

    "Description": "At last you've found it; a legendary and mysterious labyrinth, rumored to hold many treasures! Unfortunately, you're not alone; you've been followed by other treasure raiders, and you'll have to act quickly and shrewdly to secure the plunder for yourself.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;This is a thematic abstract spatial strategy game for 2-8 players in which players place and demolish walls to be the first to reach the treasures in the center of the labyrinth.&#10;It's recommended to play with 2-4 individual players or 2 teams of 2-4 players each. Game length scales by player count; roughly 15 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;The game is played on a square grid board, which is empty at setup except for 13 treasures near the center and player pawns adjacent to the corners. At the start of the game, players are dealt a hand of labyrinth wall cards which correspond to labyrinth wall pieces which are played on the board throughout the course of the game.&#10;&#10;TURNS&#10;Players take turns in clockwise order, choosing to perform one of four actions each turn; moving their player pawn, playing a labyrinth wall card to place a labyrinth wall on the board, weakening one of their own labyrinth walls on the board, or placing their rubble token on any labyrinth wall on the board.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS&#10;Pawns can only move orthogonally and can only stop when hitting either a labyrinth wall or the edge of the board, and pass through other pawns. Pawns collect treasure by moving through the treasure's square. Labyrinth walls are weakened whenever a pawn hits them, eventually being demolished instead and removed from the board. Players can only draw a new card when one of their labyrinth walls is removed from the board. Each player has only one rubble token; this can be played on any labyrinth wall on the board and acts as an open square, but must remain on that wall until the wall is demolished.&#10;&#10;TEAM PLAY&#10;Playing the game with two teams is the same as playing with individuals, except that collected treasure is pooled for each team on a team treasure board, and public table talk is typically allowed.&#10;&#10;STRATEGY&#10;Basic strategies involve placing labyrinth walls to either let your pawn stop in line with treasure, or to block other player's pawns. More advanced strategies include accomplishing both of the above with a single wall placement, using other player's constructions to your advantage, and placing walls to create an unblockable path to one or more treasures. Additionally, being careful to not run out of cards and using your rubble token wisely are both important.&#10;The ability to visualize and plan potential routes and layouts is key to mastering the game's strategy. Team play brings even more strategic depth; teammates can help each other achieve goals and work together to thwart the competition.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;The game ends immediately once it is no longer possible for the player(s) with the fewest treasures to gain enough treasures to have the most treasures. The number of treasures needed to win per player count is specified in the instruction manual for clarity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Table Air Combat is a fast, simple air combat game that can be played on any flat surface.  &#10;All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  &#10;Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.&#10;&#10;Each player has a flight of four aircraft represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &ldquo;performance rulers&rdquo; that represent the aircraft&rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed.&#10;&#10;A performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.&#10;&#10;TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  &#10;Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.&#10;&#10;Ki-44 Shoki was a high-altitude interceptor with an excellent climb rate.  &#10;Self-sealing fuel tanks and a radial engine made it tough compared with other Japanese aircraft, but it suffered from weak armament of just four 12.7mm machine guns.&#10;&#10;This set is a self-contained rulebook with miniatures for the Ki-44 Tojo and three scenarios that reference other aircraft.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sho-Go: US Navy attacks Japanese-held airfield on Formosa island.  Ki-44s defend against F6F Hellcat fighter-bombers.&#10;     Meridian: Royal Navy Hellcats and Avengers attack Japanese oil refineries in Sumatra.  The Japanese Army Air Force defends with Ki-44s&#10;     Otsu:  A variant of the Ki-44 uses 40mm cannons to intercept a formation of B-29 Superfortress bombers.&#10;&#10;&#10;This set contains miniatures for the  Ki-44.&#10;&#10;Other aircraft must be purchased separately.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The northern region of Sweden is rugged and full of snow-covered mountains that give way to lower foothills, heavily forested hills, dozens of rivers and an estimated 101,000 lakes. In the south, large lakes (some linked by canals) and widely cultivated plains stretch across the land. In the 1850s, Sweden began to build the national railway network. Sweden would soon rank among the foremost countries in per capita mileage of railroads. Will you develop the ferry lines along the southeastern shoreline, or instead risk the hardships of building through the rocky terrain of the North in search of greater gains? Railways of Sweden is an expansion map for Railways of the World, designed for 2 to 5 players. You will need the pieces from the Railways of the World base game or the Railways of Nippon base game to play it.&#10;&#10;Railways of Sweden is a 2-5 player map expansion to the Railways of the World series. This map features lots of heavy mountainous terrain. This expansion will come with a sheet of snowy track tiles to be optionally used in the northern mountains of Sweden. It also has a variety of new Railroad Operations cards, such as New Mining Town, Mountain Engineer, Extended Ferry Line and Passenger Express. In addition, it includes new +50/+100 point tokens to be used with the Railways of Sweden score &amp; income track.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the late 19th century, railway expansion across Australia suffered from inconsistent rail gauges as the colonies could not agree upon a standard. This lack of planning meant that different rail gauges must meet up at a station for passengers and cargo to switch from one line to the next before continuing on their journey. This break of gauge creates new challenges in rail line efficiency and new headaches for aspiring Rail Barons! Railways of Australia is an expansion map for Railways of the World, designed for 2 to 6 players. You will need the pieces from the Railways of the World base game or the Railways of Nippon base game to play it.&#10;&#10;Railways of Australia is a large 2-6 player map. This map has several unique features: a new terrain type - towns; region borders; and rebound Railroad Operations cards. When built, a town becomes a Gray New City on the map. There are also Railroad Operations cards that automatically build each of the 10 towns on the map. Players cannot build across region borders unless connecting through a city, or using a 'Triple Gauge' Railroad Operations card. This expansion includes junction track tiles for use with the Switch Tracks mini expansion. These new track tiles display the 2 lines coming together in each configuration. Switch tokens are also included so that players can use the Switch Track mini expansion right out of the box.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
