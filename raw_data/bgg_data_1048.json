Every few years, you meet your opponent to test your skill and to preserve your honor. In each game, opponents will participate in multiple duels to earn the most Prestige while managing to stay alive in the process. Each duel will be a choice when and how to attack your opponent in the most efficient manner. Players will then have the opportunity to evolve their play to surprise their opponents in later rounds with newfound tactics and attacks.&#10;&#10;Duel players will challenge each other with subtle but impactful decisions within this ten-minute card game. The game is enacted through a series of escalating duels fought between the players. In each duel, players will earn Prestige by dealing damage and playing faster timing cards than their opponent.&#10;&#10;Each duel consists of three rounds of combat, divided into two phases: Timing Phase and Action Phase. In the Timing Phase, players simultaneously choose a card from their hand to bid on turn order. In the Action Phase, players will play cards to try to win the duel. After each duel, players earn prestige and can gain better cards from the Advanced Techniques Deck. At the end of a duel, if a player has earned 7 Prestige, the game is over and the player with the most Prestige wins!&#10;&#10;The art and graphic design of the game captures the look and feel of renaissance era aristocracy.

After an eternity of exploiting the Empacta's resources, it is dried up and the ecosystem is exhausted.&#10;&#10;As an industrialist, you will use your resources to help re-shape the planet. By gathering and forming collections of assigned resources you will terraform Empacta back to its prime. After all, a city in the clouds is nothing without the planet below.&#10;&#10;In Feat on the Ground, each player will take their turn by playing a card to the map, adding resources or removing them. Together you will be working on a defined area, but players will assume different roles once an area is completed. If a player completes the area on their turn, they will get credit and score points. If it&rsquo;s completed on their opponent&rsquo;s turn, they will stash resources to bring back with them. At the end of the game, players score points if they stashed the most of a resource type. In the end, the player that manages to do these the best is declared winner.&#10;&#10;NOTE: Feat On The Ground requires 9 coins/cubes/tokens for tracking scores.&#10;&#10;",

There is a spring on which you place a cap, with a pointed top facing up. The top is to serve as spindle for the turntable. All 32 chips are divided equally among the players who sit down (or stand) at a certain distance from the turntable. Minimum distance should be 30cm, measured between the clenched fist (arms outstretched)and the centre of the turntable. &#10;The object of the game is, for each player to try to get rid of his stock of chips, as quickly as possible. Players try to do so, when it is their turn, by throwing a least one chip onto the turntable, after which they may give the next player his turn. However, if a player thinks he will be able to get rid of more than one chip during one and the same turn, he may go on throwing chips onto the turntable. But mind this: if, during a player's turn, chips fall of the turntable, his turn is over, and he must add the fallen chips to his stock.&#10;In case a player, when it is his turn, feels it would be too risky to try and throw chips onto the turntable, because he is afraid many chips may then fall off, that player may throw one of his chips and miss, deliberately. In other words: he may try to throw his chip in such a way, that it will bounce off the top side of the turntable. There must have been contact.&#10;The player who first gets rid of all his chips, wins the game. Players may also agree to play several rounds, to have one final winner.&#10;&#10;",

Warfare is extremely limited and somewhat restricted, as it was historically.&#10;&#10;During a turn a player collects resources from their territories, play cards, and pays their armies. Every card grants an amount of activation points which are used for activating armies, building new colonies, adding population to colonies, and raising new armies and fleets.&#10;&#10;If a player controls 10 city-state areas, he automatically wins.&#10;Otherwise at the end of the game (when the last card is drawn from the deck) every city-state area, colony, and resource point are accounted.

With less than 8 players, the excess companies are removed from play and their squares on the board are covered over leaving only the companies in play.&#10;&#10;The players take turns to roll a die and move a single counter around the board, the square the counter lands on affects all players in the game who has the shares in that company.&#10;&#10;The board is similar to monopoly with the companies separated by general bonus or penalty squares that affect all players in the game.&#10;&#10;When the counter passes the start the current round ends and the chairman invites bank investments or overdrafts, collects overdraft payments, and oversees the buying and selling of shares.&#10;&#10;If at any time during the round, a player cannot pay all the penalties then he has to sell shares to the chairman for a fixed price. At the beginning of the next round all players can buy those shares also at a fixed price.&#10;&#10;The game ends when 1 player has all 8 shares in 1 company, they get a &pound;1000 bonus. All players then add up their holdings in shares and money the player with the largest holding wins.&#10;&#10;",

If the &quot;Death&quot; card is dealt, the recipient is to exchange it for a new card, and it be inserted back into the deck. Set the deck face down between all participants. The player left of the dealer takes the first turn.&#10;&#10;For each turn, players draw 1 card and try to match 4 cards: the Suspect, Weapon, and Evidence cards featured on any Location card. Witness cards are wild and may be used in place of any Weapon or Evidence card. When a player has all 4 cards to make a match, he or she is to set it down on the playing surface, and announce a murder case has been solved. An opponent may inspect the cards to verify the match. If a player is unable to solve a case, and has more than 8 cards, he or she must discard 1 card into an open field of cards. Another player may take any discard, rather than drawing from the deck. A turn ends when a player solves a case, discards, or can do neither.&#10;&#10;When the Death card is drawn, the player dies and is to add all cards held to the discard field.&#10;&#10;The first player to solve 3 cases, wins!&#10;&#10;",

Within that star field, on the free planet of Orion, you have been recruited to stem the tide of pirates who have blockaded their small sector of space. However, it is what lies beyond those pirates that will change your destiny &mdash; and the universe &mdash; forever.&#10;&#10;Beyond the Edge uses a gaming system called &quot;Evolve/Beyond&quot;, an innovative method of allowing you to keep all that you have obtained during each game for the next, allowing you to have individual stories that are specific to your character and which progress independently of your allies.&#10;&#10;Beyond the Edge has an easy-to-learn cooperative game system in which rules and story develop as you play, allowing casual players to learn as they go. However, for gaming veterans, the faction system of Beyond the Edge creates a dynamic play experience in which the races and groups you ally with not only change your objective, but which special abilities and upgrades you have. What's more, with the &quot;Dry Dock&quot; system, you can even take your ship, captain, and missions and jump into other players' games, creating an ever-evolving gameplay experience.&#10;&#10;",

Players has to do their best to put them safely on the different boats. But be careful, if a boat is overweight it might get sink.&#10;&#10;The game last 3 rounds. &#10;Each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;1. Boarding the boats: Starting with the first player and going in turn order, players have to place their animals on the different boats.&#10;&#10;2. Resolution:  Resolving each boat takes place. &#10;Check the boat capacity: If the sum weight of the animals aboard is equal or less than the boat resistance the boat will set sail. If so, players place their animals in their player area, otherwise the boat sinks and animals go to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Be careful the animals you place on each boat, since depending on the kinds of animal that meet aboard might cause different situations, so some animals might be eaten by other animals or taken out of the boat.&#10;&#10;After finishing the third round the game ends. Players total the weight of the animals in their player area. (those which got to escape on the boats). The player with the most points will be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Suit is irrelevant.&#10;&#10;Each player has an equal number of counters placed in front of them - usually from 2 to 4 - to mark his or her &quot;lives&quot;. (Alternatively, a dollar bill or other note may be used, and players use the corners to mark their lives, folding a corner in when a life is lost.) Cards are dealt, one card to each, face down. Starting to the left of the dealer - each in turn examines their card. If they are satisfied with their card they may keep it, usually simply by announcing, &quot;I'm good.&quot; or similar. However, if they are unsatisfied they may pass it to the player on their left while announcing that they are &quot;not good&quot;, receiving that player's card back in return. The player to the left is obliged to exchange for the unwanted card unless they currently hold a King at which time they can refuse the card by showing their King. That transaction completed, privilege now passes to the player to the left who may or may not have a new card to decide on. (Players who have shown a King in defense are considered to have completed their play.) Play continues to the left as such. Once we reach the dealer the dealer has the same decision as any other player except that they exchange with the top card on the remaining deck instead of another player.&#10;&#10;All exchanges completed, the players' cards are then all turned face up, and the lowest at the table loses a counter/life - which they place into the central pot. Ties lose a life each. Once a player loses all their lives they are out of the game, and only remaining players are dealt in for the next hand. Each hand the dealer rotates to the next player to the left.&#10;&#10;Play continues as such until the only player with live(s) remaining takes the entire central pot.&#10;&#10;Of special note, if it gets down to just two players and they each have one counter and they tie, they both lose and place their existing counter into the pot and all players re-ante and start the round over again.&#10;&#10;",

So one by one the players draw a card and have to translate the Denglish sentences into German and then also have to find the correct English forms.

The one with the most gained cards in the end wins.&#10;Each player gets twelve cards and two cards that are the beginning of the tunnels. Then each player choses one card and discards faced down. The player with the highest number wins and is the first to place his card. It is important to only place cards to rows and columns in the same color (red, yellow, green, blue) and to place cards in the right number series. To gain points, the player has to complete a tunnel of four cards, which lay down in a row, a column or as a stack. The game ends if all cards are discarded. Additionally there are joker cards, which can be replaced for all other colors.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Howdy, stranger, I'm Ma Johnson. I used to run a lodging house back east. Ran a couple more in different towns on route out here, too. Seems to be the way, that once a town starts gittin' big it starts attracting the wrong sort. That's why I'm here talking to you now. The last town I was in turned bad once some mean critters started calling the shots. I knew it was time to move on when the mayor appointed the town drunk as marshal. We're way out in the middle of nowhere here, so hopefully the bad seeds will fall short.&quot;&#10;&#10;In A Town Called Nowhere, you take the role of a pioneer settling a new town in the Old West. There'll be business opportunities aplenty for folks with an eye on the main chance and pitfalls too for those who don't cover their tracks. As you'd expect, there&rsquo;ll be saloons, gambling, and gunfights. There'll be a jail, a bank, and a gunsmith. There'll be a marshal, a schoolteacher, and a lady called Ruby; the bank will get robbed, the corral will burn down, and some big shot will run you out of business so he can build a grand hotel where your wash house stands. Once the dust settles, that same big shot will paint his name on the town sign and say, &quot;If anyone has any objections, they should speak up now&quot;. Will you say anything? Course not, you'll head back to your washboard and eke out a meagre existence scrubbing miner's socks. Of course, it doesn't have to turn out that way. I mean, no one's even driven a stake yet.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on the grid map of the Town of Nowhere, which is empty at the start of the game. As players take their turns and the game progresses the map will become populated with all the buildings and businesses you'd expect in the Old West.  Each player controls the movements and actions of their gang of associates as they move about town taking care of business and business can be anything from manning the counter at the dry goods store to gunning down the marshal.&#10;&#10;The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game wins and gets to name the town after themselves.&#10;&#10;",

Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness Cards &ndash; These cards include special moments in your life that you have experienced during your time playing, collecting these cards are important to winning the game and finishing with enough points to obtain and maintain your American Dreams. Remember the player with the highest total from these cards is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Setup &amp; Starting&#10;Separate and shuffle the four different deck types, deal each player five American Dream Cards and one from each of the following decks; Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness. The player will have all Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness Cards face up in front of them.&#10;&#10;The first card played in the timeline will be played by the oldest player, they must play their earliest American Dreams Card i.e. 1909.&#10;&#10;Each player will take turns playing timeline cards and collecting or discarding Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness Cards based off the actions the American Dreams Card has them take.&#10;&#10;For your turn you please note that you may only play a card 1 to 3 years after the previous card played. For example: If a player lays down 1925 and you are the next player, you may play 1926, 1927, or 1928&mdash;if you do not have that card, your turn is skipped and discard an American Dreams Card of your choice.&#10;&#10;History Behind the Game&#10;Each play you will most likely lose or gain Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness cards each and every turn. The fluctuation mimics the point on the timeline when obtaining the American Dream was more difficult than in other years.&#10;&#10;During Wartime players will find it most difficult to maintain their current point total, use your cards wisely during these time to ensure that you will have the most points when the Timeline reaches fifty years from the starting point.

You will not discard in this scenario. All American Dreams cards will be played on the timeline.&#10;&#10;Example Of Play&#10;Player One sets down 1904 to start the game, which causes them to collect one Happiness card, concluding their turn. Player Two sets down 1907 to follow, causing them to collect one Liberty card, concluding their turn. Player Three sets down 1910 to follow, causing them to lose one Life card. On Player One's second turn at play, they choose to use one of their Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness cards that has an action&mdash;on this turn of play they have the option to trade a card with a fellow player. Player One chooses to take their 1 point value card and trade it for Player Two's 5 point value card.

Players place two workers each round, one at the lowest numbered position of a line of their choice, then one at the highest numbered position of a line of their choice, which are then moved in order to the available resource spots for that line. Points are scored for resources and majority of resources, for contributing to the arks that take them off the island, and for completing a secret goal by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In the game of Ark of Paradise, players are clan leaders in an island which is doomed to sink. They send their workers everywhere in the island to gather domestic artifacts, animals, and plants, and to build arks to evacuate from the island.At the end of sixth round, the island sinks and the arks depart to a new land. Players score points according to amount of items gathered and contribution to ark-building, and the highest scorer is the winner and leads the entire clans on the new land.&#10;&#10;This game utilizes unique worker-placemnt mechanism. Each round, available actions are determined by card draw, and action spaces are divided into three groups. Workers don't go into action spaces directory but into spaces which determine a group and priority. You may place two worders in a turn, first one into the top available priority of a group and second one into the bottom. After all eligible workers are placed, each worker is sent to their intended action group in the order of priority. You cannot be fully aware of which actions your workers do until that time. You will have moderate interactions with other players, and that is a fun part of this game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

    "Description": "Marrak Hesh 17 is a mini-game composed by a board, 26 goods tokens, 26 tranportation tokens, 2 2-players boards, 3 3-players boards, 3 corporation tokens and 10 &quot;deep space&quot; cards.&#10;At his turn a player places one transport token on a free space on the board representing an &quot;orbital souk&quot; and takes the corrisponding good. The taken good must be placed on the player board ortogonally adjacent to his others goods. The game ends when all players can't take goods from the board. &#10;Every player scores points for the biggest gruop of goods of the same type and the biggest group of goods of the same colour. Some goods give bonus points and in the advanced variant also the &quot;deep space&quot; cards add points for different conditions.&#10;&#10;",
