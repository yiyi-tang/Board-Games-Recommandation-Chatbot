    "Description": "Genesis is a game covering the turbulent Late Bronze Age in the Middle East, where kingdoms rose and fell while establishing many of the systems and ways of life that underwrite Western Civilization. Genesis is not a simulation of events during this era. Much like its ancestor game, Pax Romana, Genesis is a game that provides the players with the historical dramatis personae and allows them to forge their own empires. It also has a great emphasis on the control of the important trade routes and commercial centers and the building of the spectacular monuments these civilizations left for posterity and wonder. Genesis can be played by from one to five gamers.&#10;&#10;Each player represents one of the major Mesopotamian Bronze Age empires:  Egypt, The Hittites, The Mitanni, Assyria, Babylonia. There are several &ldquo;minor&rdquo; kingdoms that come into play through the use of the Event Cards:  Arzawa (Apasa, Milawata, Mallarima, Mira, Hindawa, Hapalla), Canaan (Hazor, Qatna, Meggido and Kadesh), and Elam (Susa).&#10;&#10;Each is trying to expand its economic reach, allowing them to build their empire to greater levels...and this will mean coming into inimical contact with each other. Gods play a major role, as do the great caravan centers of the age,bringing in luxury items from as far away as what would be Afghanistan.  And then there are the peasants and slaves which who can be most useful (some times), as well as the great techno advantages in chariotry.&#10;&#10;(from Game Rules introduction)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Speakeasy will transport you to the roaring 1920s during the era of Prohibition. Manhattan was under the firm control of Lucky Luciano, a prominent mobster. To strengthen his grip on the territory, he implemented a well-structured system. He divided Manhattan into different districts, each assigned to a specific mobster responsible for handling their &quot;business&quot; operations.&#10;&#10;In this worker-placement and card-management game, you take on the role of one of those mobsters, managing and operating your very own speakeasy empire in Manhattan. To do so, you'll need to use all your cunning and resources to stay ahead of the competition. As you improve your operation, become more infamous, and upgrade to more lavish speakeasies and even casinos, you'll attract the attention of the outside mafia and the police. You need to use your leverage to keep your business running and receive your share from Lucky Luciano.&#10;&#10;You need to hire goons to help you take over Manhattan during this exciting and dangerous time. You can associate with outside mobsters &mdash; and even attack and rob rum runners to gain valuable resources to gain an edge over your rivals. You need to manage your cards carefully, placing your workers strategically to deliver illicit liquor and reach Manhattan's goals to earn income. You will cook your books to fill your safes with free tax money by achieving some goals.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal is simple: accumulate the most money and become the most successful mobster in the city. Do you have what it takes to rise to the top of the speakeasy scene and take over Manhattan during Prohibition? It's time to grab your fedora and find out in Speakeasy.&#10;&#10;",

The game features three opposing armies controlled by the players. These forces include the German Cult of the Black Sun, the ancient Deep Ones, and the U.S. Rangers. Each force is made up of infantry, tanks or creatures and of course, heroes and villains. Each unit has its own set of unique characteristics and skills depicted on the high quality chunky tokens.&#10;&#10;Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff. While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies.

Now it's your turn to take on the roles of the dwarves, aiding Bilbo in his monumental quest to defy the odds and become a legend...&#10;&#10;The Hobbit is a board game of adventure and treasure for 2-5 players. On his quest to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins will need assistance and guidance from his stoic dwarf companions. As one of these dwarves, it is your responsibility to aide Bilbo on his journey and ensure that you recover the treasure that is destined for you.&#10;&#10;Conceived by acclaimed designer Reiner Knizia, The Hobbit features elegant game play, combining strategic card play with the unpredictability of dice rolling. The objective of the game is to be the player who accumulates the most treasure by the end of the adventure. Treasure is won through Adventure Cards, which are drawn when Bilbo enters an Adventure Space. Adventure Cards present players with a challenge that can be overcome by using the game's custom dice.&#10;&#10;Bilbo's dwarven companions have three stats that influence their ability to complete Adventures: Cunning, Strength, and Initiative. Cunning allows the player to re-roll dice when resolving Adventure Cards, Strength provides a number of axes to Adventure checks, and finally Initiative determines which player draws the Adventure Card first and how many shields they will contribute to battle.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'Arctic Front: Battle for Norway' is the third game of the Third World War series, uses the same rules as its predecessors but presents a very different gaming situation.&#10;&#10;The Soviet Leningrad Front, with its special airborne, amphibious, and arctic-equipped contingents, assaults Norway, reinforced with a few elite units from the U.S., Britain, Canada, and other NATO nations.&#10;&#10;Norway presents a constricted front to offensive operations. Along the Soviet border, the relatively open terrain in conjunction with possible outflanking moves through Finnish Lappland allows a rapid Soviet advance. The rest of the Norwegian Arctic is mountainous and can be a formidable barrier if well defended. The Soviet player must make full use of his airmobile, airlanding, and marine forces to penetrate this region, while guarding against raids from U.S. marines and British commandos.&#10;&#10;The complex relations between the Soviet Union and the neutral Scandinavian nations - Finland and Sweden - has its effects in the game. Soviet forces may attempt to pass through the Finnish Arctic, and Finland may allow violation of its neutrality or offer limited or full resistance. Sweden will always defend its territory, but its effort may not be total. Also, Sweden may volunteer an expeditionary force to join NATO in Norway even if Sweden neutrality is not violated. Finally, the Soviet high command may mandate a general offensive in Scandinavia rather than just operations against Norway, providing additional forces from the strategic reserve for combat in Finland and Sweden.&#10;&#10;Additional rules allow Arctic Front to be combined and played with The Third World War: Battle for Germany and Southern Front: Race for the Turkish Straits, thus covering all the European war zones of the Third World War. Players can reinforce one front with forces from the others, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to Norway can turn the tide there for either side, but at what cost to the central or southern front, where every unit is desperately needed?&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    240 die-cut counters&#10;    two 17&quot; x 22&quot; maps&#10;    one rules booklet&#10;    one briefing/background sheet &#10;    one set of game charts&#10;    two dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Third World War series&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges&#10;&#10;&#10;      The Third World War fan - Mushroom Cloud&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player, as either Ottoman Turks or Knights of St John, musters troops and resources to overcome the various obstacles in their path before the two armies clash in an epic siege over three fronts on the tiny island of Malta: Birgu, Senglea, and the doomed fortress of Saint Elmo.&#10;&#10;Every beautiful card in the game is inspired by a real person or event from the time. With a focus on quick, tactical play and a thematic re-imagining of the events of the time, the game is non-collectable, and there is no deck building required. Each player simply grabs their deck and shuffles, then play begins.&#10;&#10;Note on title: When, after a relentless show of strength, the small fortress of St. Elmo's finally fell to the Turks they butchered the bodies of the Knights and floated the corpses across the bay to the remaining two forts to deter them from resisting further, lest they suffer the same fate. Instead, the Maltese forces chose to fight with 'the spirit of St. Elmo's'. When they eventually turned the tides against the Turks and chased them away the people of Malta chanted 'St. Elmo's Pay' - an expression they still use today to mean 'no mercy.'&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Amateurs to Arms! is a historical simulation game of the War of 1812. One player assumes the role of the British (including Canadian) forces, and the other plays the Americans. This often-overlooked conflict ended in a draw historically, but this was not the only possible outcome. The Americans clearly wished to annex Canada to their young nation, while the British wanted to teach their former colonies a lesson. The game includes all of the theaters of battle from the war: the US/ Canadian border and the Great Lakes (of course) but also the wilderness of the old Northwest, the Atlantic coast of the US, the Civilized Indians of the south, and the site of the final conflict at New Orleans.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents a few months of time (depending on the season). A typical turn consists of dealing out to each player the number of cards indicated on the turn track. The winter and spring turns require a few special tasks. The Americans will have more resources to commit to the war- until Napoleon is defeated in Europe, and the English player can focus more resources on their efforts in North America. Each card can be played for the event described on the card, or for the card&rsquo;s Operations Points, to move Expeditions, build ships and fortifications, or raise troops.&#10;&#10;Events on the cards and on the map will cause the markers on the Peace Track to move forward.  This represents the war weariness of each side&rsquo;s people: bad events will cause your people to demand peace.  Most events push inexorably towards peace; only a few rally your people for a longer war. When the two markers meet on the Peace Track, the game proceeds to the negotiations at Ghent, and the winner is determined.  Oh yes, and then each player plays one more card, while news of the peace travels across the Atlantic!&#10;&#10;",

Each player directs the effort of one or more of the major powers, plus their minor allies, using the card-driven operations and point-to-point movement system of many of GMT&rsquo;s most highly-regarded games.  The cards help players enact Frederick&rsquo;s pre-war invasion planning, Austrian minister Kaunitz&rsquo;s diplomatic triumph in the 2nd Treaty of Versailles, the operational ascendancy of Prussian and Hanoverian light troops, formation of the Austrian General Staff, huge financial loans, court intrigue at Versailles, Vienna, and St. Petersburg, and dozens of other key political, economic, and military events.  COM also uses split decks, which foster play of each power&rsquo;s events in two phases -- Early War (usually through mid-1758), and Wider War (1758 to conclusion) &ndash; and allow a multi-player game to use exactly the same rules as a 2-player contest.  COM augments the CDG system with a Colonial Conflict sub-game, a fully-integrated treatment of light unit operations, and a Fortunes of War chit pull, which varies the occurrence and/or timing of events beyond players&rsquo; control each year -- severe weather, desertion, attrition, possible deaths of English king George II, Empress Elizabeth of Russia, et al, and Madame Pompadour&rsquo;s political influence over the French commanders, to add further uncertainty and drama to the campaigns.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has an identical set of tiles and plays the same tile at the same time to their own tableau, but where each player places each tile may differ.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player creates their own world by connecting the landscapes on their tiles. Each player starts the game with the same starting tile in play. One player, the &quot;Leader&quot;, shuffles their tiles face down, then removes five tiles from play without looking at them. On a turn, the Leader reveals the next tile, calls out the number on it, then everyone places that same tile somewhere in their landscape, with the adjacent edges of each pair of tiles needing to match.&#10;&#10;When the Leader draws a tile with a red number, everyone places their piece, then starting with the player who holds the God piece (initially the Leader), everyone draws a monument tile from the center of the playing area and places it on an area in their landscape. Monuments come in three colors (while the landscapes have areas in four colors), and you use only two monuments of a color for each player in the game. After placing monuments, pass the God piece clockwise to the next player.&#10;&#10;The game ends after everyone has placed their twenty tiles, then players score points based on the areas where they have monuments. Each non-purple edge of a tile has a half-circle on it; when two such edges are placed together, the owner of those tiles has created a &quot;cookie&quot; in that area. To score, you look at each area where you have a monument. If you have no half-circles in this area &mdash; that is, the area is completely enclosed &mdash; then you score 2 points for each cookie in that area.

    "Description": "Siberia has a reputation for being a land of vast resources, and players are going to do their best to exploit those resources and convert them into as much loot as possible.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, place two different resources at random on each area in Siberia, place the remaining resources on their supply spaces, draw four of the 20 investment tiles from the bag and lay them on the game board, give each player his own playing panel and workers/salesmen, then place all the action counters in the bag.&#10;&#10;Siberia lasts an unspecified number of rounds. Each round consists of two phases: (1) drawing and placing action counters and (2) performing actions. In the first phase, all players draw six action counters from the bag, then place them on their individual playing panels. Most action counters show both a resource (five types possible) and a person (four types), while managers are on counters of their own. Each playing panel has columns for the five types of resources and the five types of workers, with space for two counters in each column. Players can also allocate counters to the &quot;research facility&quot; below their panel.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, players take actions one at a time until everyone has no actions remaining or passes. A resource or worker action can be taken only if both spaces are filled in the appropriate column; when a player takes an action, he removes all action counters in the column, returns them to the bag, then takes the action.&#10;&#10;&bull; The &quot;research facility&quot; action must be carried out first, with the player taking the designated resources from the supply and placing one resource in any location that doesn't already have that resource available.&#10;&#10;&bull; The worker actions allow a player to place a salesman in a stock exchange, place a worker in Vladivostok, move workers up to three spaces, move a manager to any action space, or claim an investment tile; each investment tile corresponds to a particular resource or worker action and is placed on the player panel permanently, allowing the player to take this action more easily in the future since the column is always half-filled.&#10;&#10;&bull; Each resource action allows a player to remove that resource from all areas where he has a worker, then immediately sell them on one of the stock exchanges where he has a salesman.&#10;&#10;A player can keep up to ten action counters on his playing panel at the end of a round, allowing him to prepare for and build up actions for future rounds. The game ends at the end of any round in which three of the five resources have no supply remaining or eight areas have had all their resources removed. (Once an area is exhausted, nothing can be placed in it for the remainder of the game.) The player who has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Let's Make a Bus Route: The Dice Game, each player is a member of a bus company and creates bus routes by drawing lines on a map. You want to meet the needs of each client &mdash; tourists, commuters, local university students, the elderly, and parents with children &mdash; while also considering congestion and traffic conditions. Who can create the bus route that pleases the most passengers?&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts 24 rounds, with you being the start player for half of those rounds. On a turn as the start player, you roll the six white dice in the game, then choose three of them, with the other player taking one of the remaining three dice. With the die results, you mark spots on the game board with an erasable pen to extend your bus route and pick up and drop off passengers. With bonuses, you can re-roll dice or roll an extra black die. After deducting traffic (and other) penalties, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The game includes two maps: On the City Map, you must be mindful of the river as its bridges restrict your course at various points of the map. On the Mars Map, you can warp from one corner of the map to one of the other three corners, continuing your route across vast distances!&#10;&#10;Let's Make a Bus Route: The Dice Game includes a solo mode that features mostly the same rules. The challenge is that you play the game twice on the same map with different colored markers, and re-using the same road in the second game causes traffic and negative points. How well can keep the routes separate to cover ground and make the most happy customers.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn the player may elect to move his explorer to a revealed location anywhere on the board, or move twice, each turn moving 0, 1, or 2 adjacent revealed spaces. The explorer may then take an action (such as reveal an unrevealed tile, or move various revealed tiles to other locations). The tiles represent trade goods (of various sets), nomads, herds of animals, gold, diamonds, and monuments. When the 11th monument is revealed, the game ends.

In Smitten, players work cooperatively with limited information/communication to complete two identical 3x3 grids of cards, each inspired by a Stonemaier game and illustrated by Vincent Dutrait. There are multiple difficulty levels and separate modes for solo and 2-player games.&#10;&#10;Smitten was inspired by comic book cards from Jamey's youth, specifically a set where various cards formed a cohesive 9-card panorama image. In trying to complete two of these images in Smitten, there is no set turn order; rather, players indicate a preference to play or not play a card. The played card has instructions for the other player to place a card, which they must do or the game instantly ends.&#10;&#10;Smitten is packaged inside a paper envelope; it's an entirely plastic-free, eco-friendly product.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Grab some dice and find out!&#10;&#10;In Kung Fu Zoo, players use six-sided animal dice to do battle in an enclosed arena. There are two gameplay variants: Cage Battle and Points Match. In either variant, players start with a team of dice-animals. But the similarities stop there. In a Cage Battle, players take turns flicking their animals into the arena. Your goal is to knock your opponent&rsquo;s animals onto their backs (stunning them) or through holes on the board (the &ldquo;cages&rdquo;). You win the match when all of your opponent&rsquo;s animals are stunned or in cages. The first player to win three matches wins! In a Points Match, players take turns flicking their animals into the arena. Your goal is to score 21 points before your opponent. Points are awarded at the end of each round, based upon the position of your dice that are left on the board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Micro Robots, a simultaneous play game inspired by Alex Randolph's classic Ricochet Robots, challenges players to quickly determine how a robot can move from one spot on the grid to another.&#10;&#10;To set up, choose to use the black or copper side of the four game boards, then arrange them in a 2x2 square. Each game board shows nine dice, and once arranged the completed grid shows 36 dice, with the dice being numbered 1-6 and showing six colors, with each combination of number and color appearing exactly once. Roll the color die and number die to determine the starting location for the transparent robot, then mark this space with the transparent starting token.&#10;&#10;In a round, roll the two dice to determine the target space; you can mark this space with a transparent victory token or simply have everyone remember which space they're trying to reach. Everyone simultaneously tries to figure out how to move the robot to the target space, and to move the robot, it must move orthogonally to a space that shares either the color or number of its current location. If the robot starts on &quot;3-green&quot;, for example, it can move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 3 or is green; if you'd move it to &quot;5-green&quot;, it can now once again move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 5 or is green; and so on.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has a solution, they yell out the number of moves, then take the robot and demonstrate the solution. If the solution takes exactly the number of moves claimed, the player earns a victory token; if not, the player gives one of their victory tokens (if they have any) to the player with the fewest tokens. In either case, the former target space becomes the new starting space for the next round.&#10;&#10;If any player possesses five victory tokens, they win! If the 25 victory tokens are distributed before someone collects five, then whoever holds the most tokens wins, with ties being possible.&#10;&#10;Expert Micro Robots players can increase the challenge of the game by placing the target victory token on the board, then rolling the two dice once again. The players must now determine a solution that first moves the robot to the space showing on the dice, then to the final destination.&#10;&#10;The transparent robot in Micro Robots can also be used in Ricochet Robots. This robot moves like any other robot in that game except that for an additional move it can pass through a wall instead of stopping at it. It cannot move through the central barrier or the exterior walls, and the only target space on which it can land is the colored vortex.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game combines elements of boardgames and miniatures, in a system that is card-driven. Cards drive the impulses that take place during each turn, and each player has a deck of cards, made up from the troops under his or her command. Each soldier's &quot;deck&quot; of cards reflects abilities and traits-- perhaps about how well they shoot or how slowly they move or how attracted they are to things like fresh milk, hot food, or loot. There are some Soldiers (called &quot;Characters&quot;) included in the base game (Day of Days) which are common, but the others in DoD and all that are purchased separately have unique characteristics (which all balance out to be &quot;equal&quot; according to a complex math formula which is seamless to the players). So players can only get the best out of their forces after they have learned each soldier's strengths and weaknesses. &quot;Day of Days&quot; includes moveable mapboard tiles, hand-painted 20mm miniatures (by FAA), scenarios, cards (several decks!) and everything needed to play. Additional Soldiers give more choices and more fun.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arracourt is a Battalion Combat Series (BCS) game depicting the forlorn Axis counterattack to stop Patton&rsquo;s drive across France in September 1944 and the stellar example of mobile US Combined Arms that stopped that offensive dead in its tracks.&#10;&#10;The rapid movement of Patton&rsquo;s Third Army eastward to Nancy has led them at the end of a supply net that is being re-allocated to put emphasis on the British in the north (which resulted in Operation Market Garden). The US 4th Armored Division in the lead performed a double envelopment of Nancy and is waiting for other elements to catch up.&#10;&#10;For the German part, Hitler sees an opportunity to do two things simultaneously: To strike at the US spearhead stopping their advance and to try out his newly formed Panzer Brigades&mdash;complete with Panthers just off the assembly line but manned by crews fresh out of training.&#10;&#10;The result was a classic defense studied by the US Army still today as the &ldquo;school solution&rdquo; of how to defeat an armored foe in a mobile set of battles.&#10;&#10;Arracourt is a game of those battles with both sides using all the tools of mobile warfare with both sides maneuvering to attack and defend the ground of their choosing. The game is straightforward for the beginner BCS player and works very well as a starter kit before trying any of the others in the series yet is still challenging for the BCS veteran. All scenarios are on one (or less than one) map.&#10;&#10;There are very few special rules to employ, well, except for dealing with Bazooka Charlie &hellip; a US L-4 artillery observation pilot who rigged his wings with bazooka launchers so he could go out daily and try to kill German tanks.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Arracourt Campaign (13 turns)&#10;     Saga of the Panzer Brigades (5 turns)&#10;     Battle of Lun&eacute;ville (Small) (2 turns)&#10;     Patton&rsquo;s Vanguard (12 turns)&#10;     Battle of Arracourt (Small) (4 turns)&#10;     Ghost Division (Small) (4 turns)&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        BCS rulebook (v2.0, in full color)&#10;        Two BCS Charts and Tables (v2.0, in full color)&#10;        BCS Support rulebook (v2.0, in full color)&#10;        Arracourt game specific rulebook&#10;        Turn Record Track card&#10;        One 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; full color game map&#10;        352 5/8&rdquo; Counters (one unit sheet and one marker sheet)&#10;        Six scenarios, all one-map or less, and four are five turns or less&#10;        Box and dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(from MMP website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Interceptor Ace: Daylight Air Defense Over Germany, 1943-44 is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a German fighter during World War II. Each turn consists of several days, during which a combat mission will be flown from one of many bases in Europe, attempting to intercept incoming American Bombers. Interceptor Ace is based on the popular, action-packed Nightfighter Ace game system by Gregory M. Smith with a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion and receive awards.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a German interceptor pilot and rack up kills. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request a transfer to other fighter bases in an attempt to get &ldquo;closer to the action&rdquo; or request a newer type of fighter. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player&rsquo;s eventual goal &ndash; to become the top &ldquo;Viermot&rdquo; killer of the war.&#10;&#10;The system is packed with rich technical detail but without the complexity to capture the key historical facets of the day bombing campaign over Germany. In terms of fighters alone, there are 30 aircraft models available to pilot. The families of fighters include:&#10;&#10;        Bf109 (11 aircraft)&#10;        Bf110 (4 aircraft)&#10;        Me410 (2 aircraft)&#10;        Fw190 (13 aircraft)&#10;&#10;&#10;For each interceptor, you will be using the date of availability, speed, area of operations based on originating base, individual weapon systems, damage, and crew status.&#10;&#10;Fighters can be assigned to one of seven possible major geographic base &ldquo;groups&rdquo; as follows:&#10;&#10;        Dutch: Woensdrecht, Schiphol, Deelen, Wevelgem&#10;        Bremen: Husum, Jever, Oldenburg, Hildesheim&#10;        French: St. Brieuc, Poix, Vannes-Meucon, Evreax&#10;        Ruhr: Jever, M&ouml;nchen-Gladbach&#10;        Munich: Neubiberg&#10;        M&#197;&#177;nster: M&uuml;nster-Handorf, Bad Lippspringe, Rheine&#10;        Frankfurt: Ansbach, Wertheim&#10;&#10;&#10;Besides the focus on hardware, the soft aspects of the war are also faithfully rendered for each pilot and crew. For example, air crew is characterized by various, including numerous Pilot skills, Wingman skills, Bordschuetze (Rear Gunner) skills, and Prestige Level. The emphasis on various skills and benefits to gaining experience creates even a stronger narrative when compared to the Hunters game system, which helps weave a tense and dramatic narrative during play. One major change in Interceptor Ace over Hunters is the ability to choose your crew improvements instead of randomly rolling for them. As these greatly impact on your combat capability (and survival), it is a major decision you must make. Another major change in the system is the wingman concept, who can possibly pull you out of a bad situation if he is still flying.&#10;&#10;Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot and crew along with your nightfighter assignment, play proceeds by checking for incoming raid information while checking for weather prior to take off. Following successful take off, play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the American. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a new fighter, or request a change of base. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until February 1944 should you make it through unscathed.&#10;&#10;This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters, Silent Victory, or Nightfighter Ace and designed by Gregory M. Smith. The game system lends itself very well to capturing the tense air defense over Germany. While Interceptor Ace is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;    Complexity: 6 out of 10&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10&#10;    Time Scale: 3-4 days per Turn&#10;    Map Scale: Abstract&#10;    Unit Scale: individual aircraft, individual weapon systems, individual electronic systems, specific crew members, and ammo rounds&#10;    Players: one (with option for two or more)&#10;    Playing Time: two to three hours&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;    One Countersheet of 9/16&Prime; unit-counters&#10;    Fifteen Aircraft Display Mats 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime; (double-sided, 30 total)&#10;    Four Player Aid Cards 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;    One Combat Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;    Two Bomber Target Mats 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;    One Pilot Awards Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;    One Air Operations Display Mat 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo;&#10;    Eight Ace Pilot Cards&#10;    Sixty Combat Cards&#10;    Rules Booklet featuring extensive Historical Background&#10;    One Logsheet 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;&#10;    Two 6-sided, one 10-sided, and one 20-sided die&#10;    Box and Lid&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players choose to draw resources and/or guild cards but the cards can also be purchased from other players or players can purchase resources from a warehouse. Use abilities to change the rules, tools to use fewer resources in making orders or sell crafted items. Special King's Items made for the King are revealed at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There are three types of Resources (metals, gems, and runes) and four types of Guild cards(Apprentices, Tools, Items and King's Items). Metals and Gems must be refined into resources before they can be used to craft orders. Guild cards are crafted on the 3rd phase of your turn and then completed on the 2nd phase of the next turn.&#10;&#10;There are four phases of the game; Refine Resource cards, Complete Guild card, Actions (6), Draw cards. Refine metal and gem cards by turning cards 180 degrees into refined resources. Then, all Guild cards crafted on the player&rsquo;s previous turn are now complete and can be used. There are six repeatable Actions in the game: Play a card, Craft a Guild card, Move or Swap a card, Buy a card from another player or from the warehouse, Discard a Guild card and Sell Resource cards. At the end of the player&rsquo;s turn, the player must draw four cards but cannot exceed their hand limit. Lastly, straighten any tilted cards placed into the player's market on their turn.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one Player has completed four King's Orders, or either the Guild or Mine decks run out, and then all players get one last turn. Resources are sold from the player's market and then the King's Orders are revealed, bonus coins are given for the highest valued King&lsquo;s Item (for each subtype). Count up your coins and the player with the most coins at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

He is accompanied by his familiar fellowship, who are charged with protecting him from the dangers he will face along the way. The players control the fortunes of this company together by moving the individual figures across the game board on a journey through many well-known places from the beloved Lord of the Rings novels. It is important to beware of the Nazgul while at the same time making sure that Frodo does not lose his confidence and freeze in despair. When Frodo reaches Mount Doom, the players have all won together.&#10;&#10;The movement of the characters is controlled by a special dice mechanism. Colored dice determine which figure can be moved. Your dice value determines the number of spaces a figure can travel. By choosing the dice before and after the roll, players are faced with decisions that are seemingly uncomplicated, but nevertheless significant for the outcome of the game. Black dice, which always must be rolled, trigger threats or cause encounters with enemies or friends. The encounter cards ensure the continuous, ever-growing threat to completing the quest.&#10;&#10;As in most co-operative games, players must coordinate their moves and actions with each other to ensure the desired outcome.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player also has a hand of cards, and the cards in the deck come in six colors, with each color having cards numbered 1-3. On a turn, you ask another player to give you a card, e.g., a red 3. If they have one in hand, they must give it to you. If not, they must give you either a red card or a 3 &mdash; their choice. If they have no reds or 3s, you randomly draw one card from their hand.&#10;&#10;If you already have the card you received in your play area, discard it and take a gold nugget; if not, place it in your play area. All players then take one of the two actions listed on this card:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Red and green cards either give you a nugget or let you pay 1-3 nuggets to play a card of value 1-3 from your hand; when you play a card from your hand, it can't already be in your play area, and you immediately take one of the two actions listed.&#10;    Gray and purple cards either let you draw three cards from the deck or discard two cards of the same suit to play a card from your hand into your play area.&#10;    Blue and orange cards either let you check off a space on your map in a region you've already opened or check off the next space on your railroad; if the space you checked has a reward, gain it immediately.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you have all three cards of a color in your play area, discard them, then check the flag on a map region that is adjacent to a region that you have already opened. Finally, if you have fewer than three cards in hand, draw until you have three cards.&#10;&#10;The purpose for all of this activity is to claim medals, which earn you points. You earn points for each region you open, and if you're the first player to open all regions of a color, you gain a medal worth bonus points. If you check all the spaces in a region, you earn a medal. If your railroad reaches the end of the line, you earn a medal. If you check all spaces with a certain symbol on your map, you earn a medal. Once a player has collected, the game ends at the end of that turn, then you tally all points to see who wins.&#10;&#10;Use shrewdness and discernment when calling or giving cards that you can take advantage of without helping your opponents too much. Ideally, you will be able to earn the points of the many medals scattered on your individual sheet route, as well as on the common bounty board.&#10;&#10;",

Most objective points are earned from non-combat activities such as alliances with the different factions.&#10;&#10;Contains 49 heroes, 90 treasures and a selection of map pieces, making each play different--new teams gathering new treasure on a completely new map. Expansions bring both the treasure count and the hero count up to 360--The Full Degree.&#10;&#10;With a ruleset significantly streamlined from Duel of Ages, Factions has half the rules word count of Duel of Ages I and over a third less than DoA II.

    "Description": "Quicksand is a real-time co-operative game in which players work together to deactivate the &quot;Quicksand&quot;, a dangerous trap of gears and sand. You can't just race as quickly as possible, though, because you must avoid setting off the trap.&#10;&#10;To set up, choose one of the 20+ scenarios, then lay out the gear tiles in the specified path and place the appropriate sand timers &mdash; which have different amounts of sand in them &mdash; on the first gears of the path. (The path might have obstacles on it based on the particular scenario.) Gears feature both a color (orange, yellow, gray) and a shape (square, circle, crescent). Each player starts with a hand of three cards, with a card showing one of the three colors, one of the three shapes, or a sand timer.&#10;&#10;Once the game starts, players play a card in turn to try to advance the sand timers and keep them from running out, refilling their hand after they play. When you play a color or shape card, you flip all of the sand timers currently on this color/shape, advancing them one space on the path if that next space is empty. When you play a sand timer card, you flip any one timer, advancing it, if possible. (If no timers are on gears matching the played card, nothing happens.)&#10;&#10;If a sand timer runs out, flip it and place it next to the gear on which it was previously located. If someone plays a sand timer card, they can recover this timer by flipping and placing it back onto the gear &mdash; but only if that tile is empty. If a set-aside timer runs out again, players lose the game.&#10;&#10;Once a timer reaches the last open space on the path, played cards matching that gear's color/shape will flip it &mdash; and if it runs out, you lose the game with no chance of recovery. If the sand timers fill the final gear tiles on the path without this happening, you win!&#10;&#10;",

You will then equip your vehicle with modifications to produce the perfect dustrunner.&#10;&#10;In Dustrunner you will be using the core mechanic of drawing two cards face-down and picking one to reveal. You may decide to resolve the first card and discard the second without looking at it, or you may pass on the first, but must then resolve the second. This mechanic is great at creating tension and choice. Enemy cards drawn as the 2nd card have more health, making passing on a raider as a first card all the bit more scary.&#10;&#10;There is only one way to win Dustrunner, and that is to reach your base before either the raiders catch you, or you lose all your health. Dustrunner is not a beat your own score game. You either reach the base and win, or you lose. However, there is a scoring system in place for folks who do like to see how well they did.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Knit Wit is a word game along the lines of Scattergories, with players trying to think up unique answers to particular categories in order to score points, but instead of using fixed categories, players generate their own categories while playing the game.&#10;&#10;To set up, each player takes numbered spools and looped strings based on the number of players, along with an answer sheet. A number of bonus buttons, which have 1-4 holes, are stacked on the table, again based on the number of players. Going clockwise around the table, each player (after the first) places one loop on the table so that it surrounds exactly one spool, then draws a word tag from the box and attaches it to this loop, then places one spool in one section of loop(s) that has no spool in it. (Think of a Venn diagram; two overlapping circles form three sections, with one section having both circles in common and two sections being part of only one circle.)&#10;&#10;Once all of the spools have been placed, everyone races to think of words, names, or phrases for each spool based on the word tags associated with that spool. If a spool has three loops around it, for example, it has three words associated with it, and your answer must relate to those words in some manner.&#10;&#10;As soon as someone has finished or can't think of more answers, they grab the topmost button on the stack (the one with the most holes). Once the final button is grabbed, players can't write more answers. Players then compare answers, crossing out those they have in common with someone else, then scoring points for the remaining answers; each answer is worth as many points as the number of loops around the spool with the same number. Buttons are worth as many points as the number of holes they have, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

He decides he wishes to marry her and sets off to find her. Unfortunately, he doesn't actually remember anything about her and is left wondering aloud to all: &quot;Does anyone know Cinderella?&quot; Hearing this, many influential people begin spreading rumors that their servant is the actual Cinderella.&#10;&#10;In Too Many Cinderellas, players represent powerful people in the far-off country who are trying to influence the Prince's decision about who is the real Cinderella, pointing him towards their &quot;Cinderella&quot;. If anyone tries to spread misinformation about your &quot;Cinderella&quot;, you can just say &quot;NO!&quot; at the audience with the Prince. Many Cinderellas have gathered; who will be recognized as the real &quot;Cinderella&quot; by the Prince?&#10;&#10;In game terms, the deck of cards is shuffled and each player receives four cards. The person with the smallest feet starts first. A player wins a round when she has the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. To find the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella, each player lays down a card. The card dictates which card will be or won't be the real Cinderella. When a card is laid down, everyone secretly votes whether or not they want the new rule for that round. This repeats until each player has played two cards. Then everyone reveals their hand, and whoever has the card that matches all the rules laid out in the round is the winner for having the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. In cases of ties, the winner is the player with the highest card.&#10;&#10;Game #3 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.&#10;&#10;",

The vampires and werewolves win by destroying the other team, while the humans are generally trying to simply stay alive (though some characters may end up aligning with one of the other two teams).&#10;&#10;Since everybody starts knowing only who they are, they must start working on deducing who the other players are and whether they are friend or foe. Acting quickly may help you gain an advantage by weakening the opposing team before they realize which of the players fighting is their ally, but moving hastily with limited information may see you accidentally eliminate a teammate and set your side back in the conflict.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players either try to gather information, find new equipment, or try to harm (or aid) another player. Different areas of the map influence what you may discover and who you may interact with while certain cards and abilities mean you can never be certain that things will go according to plan.&#10;&#10;",

There are several different editions of this game (originally released in the UK as Railway Rivals), but most feature several different hexagonal maps of real locations, such as Tennessee and Germany.  Starting from one of the cities pictured on the map, players build track during the first part of the game.  Players receive a small bonus for reaching a city before anyone else, but otherwise funds are quite limited.  After nearly every city has been connected to someone's rail line, several races are held on the resultant track.  The starting city and destination city are determined randomly, and players can use each other's track (for a nominal fee, of course).  After all races have been held, the player with largest bank account is the winner.&#10;&#10;This series of games is very similar to Mayfair Game's crayon rail games series, though they use erasable marker pens instead of crayons.&#10;&#10;",

Typically, there isn't any rotation of the tables. Once you enter the restaurant, you stay until it's closed.&#10;&#10;In its traditional form, fado is played by a trio of musicians: a guitarist plays &quot;Guitarra Portuguesa&quot; (a twelve-string Portuguese Guitar); a singer,  that is, a &quot;fadista&quot;; and a guitarist playing &quot;Viola de Fado&quot; (classical guitar). The Portuguese guitar has a unique sound, and the chords are played in different bars from those of the classical guitar.&#10;&#10;In the game House of Fado, players have to manage their restaurant, attract customers, and contract and promote fadistas and musicians, thus gaining prestige for their fado house. Managers will move their staff members to different places to perform some actions, using the same bump action as in The Gallerist.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You're a team of lowly maintenance robots built to keep the space station operational and clean so that the colonists can get on with...whatever it is they do. Unfortunately, the station has been invaded by creeps, alien creatures that slowly advance toward food (the colonists) so that they can multiply. The only thing keeping the colonists from being completely wiped out is your knowledge of the station, a couple of specialty tools and abilities unique to each of you, and a little bit of problem-solving code installed so you could do your jobs efficiently.&#10;&#10;Jupiter Rescue is a co-operative strategy game in which players work together to escort 28 colonists to an escape pod before they're converted into alien creeps. Each turn, players may take five actions, choosing from common options &mdash; moving themselves, moving nearby colonists, or killing alien creeps &mdash; and a series of programming cards that grant them special abilities. These cards can be played on the player's turn to activate the ability. Each player also gets to choose one card to be his &quot;core&quot; ability, letting him use it every turn instead of discarding it.&#10;&#10;New creeps are added to the board, which is composed of tiles, at the end of each player's turn by rolling a die; if a tile fills up with creeps, it's destroyed and removed from the game. Players lose if enough colonists get turned into creeps, or if certain key board tiles are all destroyed. Double-sided tiles allow for hundreds of station variations.&#10;&#10;",

The highest card played on a turn receives light tokens, the lowest card dark, with the exact number of tokens determined by a scoring card revealed for that turn. Once the round ends, players eliminate pairs of light and dark tokens from their holdings, and their score for the round equals however many tokens remain. After a certain number of rounds, whoever has the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Yin Yang differs from its predecessor Relationship Tightrope in that only nine of the ten cards in hand are played each round &mdash; giving players some wiggle room when deciding what to play &mdash; and the scoring cards have differing numbers for the light and dark tokens received on a turn (whereas in the previous game the scoring cards were parallel &mdash; such as 9/9 or 8/8).&#10;&#10;",

You can also attempt to steal a grasshopper card sitting between you and your neighbors.

    "Description": "Felinia is the third game in the Gold Trilogy, after Valdora and The Golden City. In the first two games, a city and a valley are explored; this time it is a whole country.  Felinia is a trading, collecting, and exploring board game that is modular and includes both a beginner and an advanced game.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Gold! Spices! Felinia is a mysterious continent, full of exotic riches! It&lsquo;s up to you to establish profitable trading posts, but beware: the competition is stiff.&#10;Alone or with a partner, hire a ship, fill its hulls full of refined merchandise, and set off to make yourself a fortune.&#10;&#10;Felinia is extremely interactive. It mixes an original bidding system with clever movement rules. Felinia is fascinating and addictive, for players new to games as well as confirmed masters.&#10;&#10;From the rule booklet:&#10;&#10;In the City of Katzburg, merchants are all discussing the big news. The mayor, Henry-Cat, has signed a trade agreement with the newly-discovered continent of Felinia. In exchange for precious goods (rare books, fine wines, precision watches, luxury clothing, and refined glassware), the Kingdoms of Felinia have agreed to let them install trading posts.&#10;&#10;Space is limited: You will have to act very quickly!&#10;&#10;Four ships have been chartered by the City to visit the five countries on Felinia. To board them, you must have a specific combination of merchandise provided by the markets of the City and requested by the leaders of Felinia. This also means you will have to earn money to be able to afford those purchases.&#10;&#10;The prices of the various merchandises are set by supply and demand, and can sometimes go very high! But it is the price you must pay to be on board one of the ships with hopes to establish a trading post on Felinia. Maybe you can collect gold and spices in the process!&#10;&#10;Each player represents a Family of Merchants whose goal is to have the highest prosperity at the time the last ship leaves Katzburg.&#10;&#10;Felinia is part three of &quot;The Gold Trilogy&quot; (besides The Golden City and Valdora)&#10;&#10;",

There are four colors with numbers from 1 to 9. You can either play color on color or number on number. Sounds boring so far, doesn't it? Well, that's why we have the special cards. For example, have someone draw four cards from the deck, or give a fellow player two cards out of your hand. And the fun part: You always get to choose who gets these cards!&#10;&#10;But wait, there's more: We come to the black cards, also numbered from 1 to 9. You can play these only on a number, not on the same color, and every time a black card is played, it activates an event card. These event cards go from Friday, the Thirteenth &mdash; where nothing happens &ndash; to Tornado, where all hand cards get shuffled together and handed out again.&#10;&#10;",

Deceive your opponents as an agent secretly working for a European power, recruiting key assets, buying off politicians, and instigating sabotage against foreign capitals. However, you will need the reluctant (or unwitting) support of your opponents to position your homeland for European domination, so tread carefully and do not reveal your true identity.&#10;&#10;Game Overview:&#10;At the start of the game, you receive an Alignment Token, which tells you which one of the competing European nations you secretly work for.&#10;&#10;The rest of the game unfolds over the course of 14 rounds, with each player (spy) performing 3 Actions per round. These actions include moving around the map, acquiring resources in the form of Supply Tokens, improving your abilities by recruiting Assets, manipulating the otherwise-random Politicians to your advantage, or even directly harassing opposing spies.&#10;&#10;But any action you take will directly affect at least one Nation, in the form of gains or losses in Influence points. Your mission during the game is to generate Influence for your own Nation, while at the same time preventing your opponents&rsquo; Nations from gaining too much&mdash;if you can deduce which Nations they are!&#10;&#10;Influence is tallied and compared during Scoring Phases, which take place at set intervals throughout the game. In a Scoring Phase, each Nation receives Power points based on how much Influence it has accumulated so far.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players reveal their Alignment Tokens, and the player whose Nation has the most Power is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It is also the first historical boardgame published, in two decades, to address galley warfare. As such, GMT's War Galley is almost a complete history for this era of war at sea.&#10;&#10;What is best about War Galley is how easy it is to play -- the rules are about half the length of the usual GBoH game -- and that means that most battles can be complete in several hours, at the most. The battles themselves, cover all aspects of galley tactics, from the line against line of big ships at Salamis (Cyprus), to the Chase, Turn and Fight of Chios, to the Line Astern vs. Line Abreast at Side, to probably the most unusual of all ancient battles, the Roman arrowhead against the Carthaginian Lines Astern at Drepanum in 249 B.C.&#10;&#10;War Galley wars and battles covered by the scenarios are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ionian Revolt- Lade, 494 BC&#10;     Peloponnesian War- Arginusae, 406 BC&#10;     The Silician Wars- Catana, 397 BC&#10;     The First Successor War- Salamis, 306 BC (Cyprus)&#10;     The First Punic War&#10;         Ecnomus, 256 BC&#10;         Drepanum, 249 BC&#10;         Aegatian Islands, 242 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Macedonian Wars- Chios, 201 BC&#10;     The War with Antiochus&#10;         Side, 190 BC&#10;         Myonessus, 190 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Civil War&#10;         Tauris, 47 BC&#10;         Naulochus, 36 BC&#10;         Actium, 31 BC &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",
