All you do is maneuver the magnet around the Jati maze. Sounds easy - but, here's the catch - you can't touch the magnet! All maneuvering must be done with the magnetic wand. Come too close to the magnet with the wand and - you've had it. The magnet either plunges over the edge or reverses itself and leaps toward the wand. Only a dazzling display of dexterity on your part will maneuver the magnet around the Jati maze and into the center. So, test your skill and dexterity; see if you're a novice or a Jati Master, and score yourself accordingly. As a novice, you'll only score 25 points. To be a JATI Master, you'll have to maneuver the magnet in printed side up - no easy feat! For superb skill, the Jati Master scores 100 points. What if you get the magnet in upside down, you ask. Well, then you're only an advanced Jati player; score 75 points and keep practicing.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:&#10;Jati, a tile laying game&#10;&#10;",

Each player acts as Chief of the Homicide Squad and as each new fact is unearthed he/she must choose the next step to take in his/her investigation. In doing so he may win money from his fellow investigators or he may lose to them, sometimes Heavily.&#10;&#10;The game comes with paper money, some of which is distributed to the players,  and a sheet which tells the background of the crime. The background is either read to ones self or read out loud to the entire group. Then the first page of the crime case is read. On the reverse of each case players will find 10 possible courses of action that he/she as investigator may take. After carefully considering all the given facts and without consulting any other player each investigator checks the two courses of action that he/she feels should now be taken.&#10;&#10;After all players have decided on their particular course of actions a blue sheet is read which gives both benefits and penalties to each player depending on what decisions they have made.  If both of the choices that an investigator makes are good the player will collect money from the kitty, if both are bad ones the player will pay into the kitty, if one is good and one is bad there will be a net plus/minus total which will create a small gain or loss.&#10;&#10;Now the next page of the crime is read and the another set of 10 possible actions will be given from which each player can choose two courses of action. This continues until final evidence is presented and each player will be asked &quot;Who Killed Gloria Don? Being correct pays off, being wrong costs you money. At the end of the game all players who have more money than what they started with sort of win with the player with the most money being the overall winner of the game.

It will usually start from the home town.  It can end anywhere.  If you live in the north, you may want to go to Florida and back. If you live in the east, you may want to go to the west coast and back.  The maps provided cover the entire United States on a scale so large that all but the smallest towns are shown.  They are the latest and most accurate maps that Rand McNally can provide.&#10;&#10;Each may follow a different route or all may follow the same route, but success may depend on who selects the shortest and fastest route.&#10;&#10;The first player spins the arrow on the spinning board at least on complete revolution and proceeds as directed, sticking his pin/auto into the map to mark his position.&#10;&#10;Delays, accidents, and detours affect only the player involved.  Other players proceed according to their own directions as indicated by the luck of the spin.&#10;&#10;Really, directions are hardly necessary.  The game is so like a real TREK that once you get into the spirit of the thing and use the imagination, you will meet the emergencies as they arise.&#10;&#10;",

There is also a standard Queen flanking the king, with the Minister located immediately on the King's opposite side.&#10;&#10;The Minister combines the move of the Knight and Bishop, choosing to move one way or the other each time, but not both simultaneously.  This is a unique addition to the game, and is a great complement to the Queen's movement.  In this way the game is different from Minister's Chess, and considerably so as a result.&#10;&#10;Minister's Chess has the 9x9 board and adds a pawn and another Queen to each side, but renames the Queen piece to Minister.  However, all Ministers move just like the standard Queen.&#10;&#10;",

Each player writes down a set number (usually 10) of 'things' on slips of paper.  These 'answers'  are folded up, placed into a bowl (or hat or cup, whatever you have handy), and the game begins.  Each player is  given 1 minute to draw slips of paper, one at a time, and try to get their teammates to guess the answer.  Much like Taboo, no charades (hand gestures) may be used, and no rhyming or &quot;starts with&quot; is allowed.&#10;&#10;The &quot;things&quot; written can be anything that makes sense, and can be conveyed.  Expressions, quotes, famous people, things, etc.  As long as it's not nonsense, it's appropriate.&#10;&#10;When the timer goes off, the team gets one, and only one guess, as to what the last answer was.  The teammates must confer, and come up with a guess.  Usually there's a time limit to this.  If it's guessed correctly, it's a point, otherwise it's tossed back in the bowl.&#10;&#10;The bowl is then passed clockwise, and the next person gets a turn.&#10;&#10;Continue until the bowl is empty.&#10;&#10;",

A player may borrow money or chips from another player, but a player may not borrow money from the bank.  A player may also trade or sell chips.&#10;&#10;A player may move to the Suburbs or Inner City, but that player will need two players to help him move or pay part of the player's salary.&#10; The rules state that if everybody cooperates, then everybody will prosper.&#10;&#10;One version of the box cover states that up to 7 player can play this game and that the game is appropriate for those Ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;Internet information states that the game was created around 1973.

    "Description": "The Saint Petersburg expansion is actually two expansions in one. It contains &quot;The Banquet,&quot; previously available in Spielbox magazine, and the &quot;New Society&quot;, which adds new cards, plus extra tokens to allow play with up to 5 players.&#10;&#10;The &quot;New Society,&quot; designed by Tom Lehmann, adds replacement cards for some found in the base game, changing their costs or rewards, and adds several new cards to each phase, including an entirely new line of worker: the &quot;New Farmer,&quot; which is costly, but also provides VPs during the Worker phase.&#10;&#10;When playing with five players, the fifth player does not receive a start token for a new phase&mdash;instead, the holder of the fifth token receives two victory points (except on the first turn, when he or she instead receives two rubles) as compensation for not starting one of the four phases. This fifth token is only used in five-player games. Other than this&mdash;and advancing tokens two player positions each round&mdash;the game plays out exactly as before, with four phases per round: Worker, Building, Aristocrat, and Trading.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Banquet,&quot; designed by Karl-Heinz Schmiel, adds cards with special powers that allow players different types of actions on their turns.&#10;&#10;The two expansions may be used separately or combined.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Saint Petersburg&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each pack had 20 sachets and came with one module of the game. There are four different modules, each module consisting of a booklet of thick cardboard pages, which are to be cut up and assembled into skyscrapers and structures. The modules can be played individually or put together to form one big city - New York (structures include the Statue of Liberty and the Chrysler building). &#10;The game is for two players, and one can choose to be either spidey or black spidey. The object of the game is to race around the city and the first player to reach the 'Winner' space wins. The path winds through the city and up and down the sides of the skyscrapers - the pieces can fit into slots in the walls. There are also spaces that allow a player to draw a card and follow instructions like, &quot;Drink Ovaltine, get more power, Jump two steps forward&quot;, or, &quot;Strong wind, all players go back four steps&quot;. A feature is that the die for the game is also included in each module - but you have to cut it out and assemble it yourself.&#10;The text for the rules and on the cards are in Thai and English and the manufacturer of the drink is Thai. Besides Thailand, the packs were distributed in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.&#10;&#10;",

His arms and legs were broken in impossible angles, but he was still alive and moving and&hellip; oh lord. I heard something and looked up, they were coming, all these shuffling people covered in blood and bite marks. Then the kid started squirming, teeth snapping&hellip; I just ran, ran for the nearest house to hide&hellip; the radio said some sort of virus had escaped, and the Coast Guard was ferrying people off the island. I heard a window smash below, I gotta find something to fight with. There are more of them moving towards this house now. If I can only get out of here alive&hellip;&#10;&#10;In a town filled with zombies you move building to building looking for weapons to help you survive and maybe find another survivor to aid you...as well as roving packs of zombies looking to feed.  The game is different every time you play and is only 2 pages.  You will need the rules, 2d6 a piece of graph paper and a pencil to play.&#10;&#10;You can download graph paper free if you look up my Tower of the Dread Mage Game!&#10;&#10;Microbadges&#10; Buy It&#10;&#10; Buy It&#10;&#10;",

Snakes move forward depending on the color thrown on the die; the color thrown becomes the TAIL of the snake and all hexagons situated behind this are moved to the front of the snake. The hexagonal segments must remain in the same sequence throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete whatever course was determined prior to the game starting is the winner (generally snakes start adjacent to their tree and return).&#10;&#10;",

They sit in alternating seats around the board. Each player has a marker placed on the home port and two tokens placed in the pool. The Russian is the aggressor and moves first. Whoever starts rolls and then moves. Different squares have different instructions that must be followed when landed on. If you land on a space that an opponent is on you are repelled back to the space you started your move on and you lose your turn. Many spaces cause you to lose tokens to the pool, lose a turn, return to port etc.  Victory is achieved by the side that has a majority of force in the enemies port at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",
