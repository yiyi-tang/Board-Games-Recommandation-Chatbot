Sadly this was not to be. The events of September 11th, 2001 proved there were still issues to fight over.&#10;&#10;But as the War on Terror ended and the Obama administration transformed America, abdicating its role as sole world peacekeeper, other nations reignited the great power struggle ended in World War II by division of the planet into two blocs.&#10;&#10;Ironically, the environmentalist dogma of declining world resources was the catalyst that launched a new struggle between the world powers; a struggle not for power or prestige, but to control access to the resources that everyone was assured would soon be rapidly depleted. The New World Order is dead. Long live the New World Disorder!&#10;&#10;Fast playing and easy to learn, World War IV is a two to eight player game played on a tabletop where players are leaders of major powers in a struggle for world resources. Conquer earthly resources or pursue a space program to develop off-world colonies and resources.&#10;&#10;The game system emphasizes strategy and places a minimum on die rolling. Rules include weapons of mass destruction, missile defense, cyber warfare, air, ground, and space combat.&#10;&#10;Each major power has its own special rules and pieces including Texas militia, Falun Gong chi-knights, Russian Spetznaz, European robotic panzers, American mobile infantry, South American guerillas, Turkish mujahideen, Japanese armed spacecraft and more!&#10;The game includes eleven sheets of die-cut game pieces and complete rules.

    "Description": "Publisher blurb&#10;Mystic Realm&#10;&#10;Once upon a time there was a great realm, ruled by a wise and powerful sorcerer-king. The land was rich and the people prosperous. Out of their wealth a great temple was constructed, puissant magical items created and many fantastic beasts imported from faraway lands. But as is the way of all things, eventually the king grew old and passed on from this mortal plane.  &#10;His son inherited his realm and magical talent but not his wisdom. Greedy and grasping, searching for greater treasures and power than even his father had amassed, he reached past the limits set by the gods and opened a rift into a dimension of primal chaos. The once prosperous realm was sucked in and lost for millennia.  &#10;But now a new magic portal has opened leading to that mystic realm, or at least to what that realm has become. Overrun by monsters, the few remaining inhabitants are oppressed. The once-great temple is overgrown, the capital city lost in a jungle teeming with cannibals and wild beasts. But golden treasures and powerful magic items still remain, waiting for brave adventurers to discover. &#10;And the greedy prince? He too, remains. Preserved by his wicked magic, he is now an undead master, the Liche Lord. Still ruling the ruined kingdom from his father&rsquo;s throne, his only remaining desire to suck the life force from the bones of anyone foolish enough to enter his kingdom. Are you brave enough to dare his challenge? And are you clever enough to return with the fame, fortune and treasures of a lifetime? &#10;Mystic Realm is a one to ten player game of adventure set in a fantasyland. Players take the role of a heroic character and travel through the realm searching for treasures and encountering dangerous monsters (and sometimes something even more dangerous: the other players.) The player who survives and returns to the portal with the most treasure and fame is declared the winner. There are twenty different character types to choose from, everything from an Amazon to a Ninja to a Witch.  &#10;Easy to play, the game includes: complete rules, five player aid cards, six encounter cards, six sheets of terrain tiles, and one sheet of DIE-CUT playing pieces (including treasures and magic items.) Paper, pencil and some six-sided dice (not included) are required to play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;It has been two years since the cybernetic Toracs invaded. In two days they destroyed human civilization- breaking the strongest fronts of resistance and herding entire populations into their conversion centers to make us into more of them. All that remains of the human race now are the survivors who escaped through the cracks of mankind&rsquo;s ruined civilization&#10;&#10;But there may yet be hope. Hidden away in the ruins of mankind are the keys to possible salvation. Experimental technologies, hidden superweapons, unexpectedly useful devices are all scattered across the globe. The only chance for the human survivors to evict the Toracs from their world is to find these devices and use them&hellip; before the last scraps of humanity are wiped from the face of the Earth!&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a one-to-four player hex and counter game set in the near future (2050 or so) where earth has been invaded by the &quot;Toracs&quot;. Initially the humans are weak- they cannot out run the Toracs and they certainly can't hope to fight them. Their only hope is to exploit the dim-witted intelligences of their converted brothers and sisters to evade total destruction. Only through surviving the Torac reactions to scavenge the ruins of their destroyed civilization can they hope to evict the invaders. They might find weapons, faster transportation, or even leftover superweapons from the 20th century in the form of nuclear devices. The best chance humanity has at removing the Torac (and winning the game) is to scavenge the ruins across the globe.&#10;&#10;However, should the Torac annihilate the human presence on Earth, then their intention to convert Earth into their new homeworld will succeed unabated. For the survival of the human race, the Torac must be defeated!&#10;&#10;This is an entry for the Sneaky Sci-Fi game contest.Until the files are approved, you can get the game on my deviantart account: http://norsehound.deviantart.com/#/d2sulo7&#10;&#10;",

With up to six players, two main play modes (cooperative or competitive), a solo play option and variant multiplayer rules, there is endless replayability.&#10;&#10;During the game players take on the role of one of six heroic characters, adventuring in the wilds of a fantastical medieval Russia sculpted by the legends and folklore of the land.  As you play the game, you are attempting to complete one of six heroic quests by traveling around the board and having encounters based on Russian myths while also dealing with Baba Yaga's perilous minions.  As you have these encounters, you will gather items and allies that will help you by granting you advantages or bonuses to your statistics.  You will also gain reputation as you adventure, but be careful, the great witch Baba Yaga doesn&rsquo;t care for uppity heroes and soon you&rsquo;ll be fighting her off as well as dealing with your individual quest.&#10;&#10;In order to win in competitive play, you must either be the first to complete your quest, or have the most reputation when the game ends.  In cooperative play, all of the players must complete their quests or manage to defeat Baba Yaga before time runs out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Jericho, a strategy game for 2 players&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OVERVIEWNumber of players: two.&#10;&#10;Average duration of a game: thirty minutes.&#10;&#10;Game Board: one octagonal board consisting of two by thirteen (2 x 13) squares and two by thirteen (2 x 13) triangular squares at the edge of the board.&#10;Pieces: sixty-three consisting of two by twenty-five (2 x 25) cylindrical pieces of 5 different sizes and colours.&#10;13 monoliths (&quot;Trumpets&quot;).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;HOW TO PLAYAt the commencement of the game, the board is empty and each player stores his/her 25 allocated pieces on the side. The starting player places one piece on either his/her territory, (the 13 squares in front of him/her) or on his/her opponent's territory (the 13 squares in front of the opponent). Both players then take turns placing pieces on the board. Once on the board, the pieces remain in the some place throughout the whole game. Towers are consisting of single pieces or several pieces piled on top of each other.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;THE TOWERSThe Towers are built with a minimum of one and a maximum of 4 pieces. Each piece in an individual Tower must have different sizes and colours. The Towers belong to the player whose territory they are built on. A player can for example choose to place a Tower on his/her opponent's territory to undermine the strength of the opponent's Towers: this Tower belongs to the opponent.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;THE CONFRONTATIONSTowers confront each other when they are aligned, whether diagonally or frontally. There can be 7 frontal alignments and 6 diagonal ones. When one player has got 2 of his/her Towers on a same alignment, only the strongest one can enter a confrontation.&#10;If none of his/her opponent's Towers are aligned with his/hers, then there is no confrontation. An individual Tower can be involved in 2 different confrontations simultaneously, (one on a diagonal, the other on a frontal alignment). Both confrontations are then solved separately. In order to solve a conflict, the strengths of the Towers need to be assessed.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;HOW STRONG ARE THE TOWERS?The strength of a Tower depends on the size of its highest piece. The pieces can have 5 different sizes, hence the strength of a Tower can vary from I to 5. Whatever its number of pieces, only the highest will account for the strength of a Tower. For example, a two-piece Tower can win over a four-piece Tower. There is however one exception to this rule: one-piece Towers will always lose to higher Towers. When the highest pieces of two confronting Towers are of equal strength, then the piece that comes immediately under it is assessed and so on until the confrontation is resolved.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;THE MONOLITHS (&quot;TRUMPETS&quot;)Monoliths are used to visualize which of the 2 players (at any stage in the game) has got the upper hand. Each time a player wins a confrontation, he/she is given a Monolith to position on his/her side of the board, on the triangle corresponding to the alignment where the confrontation just took place. The monolith remains with the player as long as he/she is a leader. However, if the opponent gets the upper hand then he /she is given the Monolith to place on his/her side of the board. When there is no obvious leader, the monolith is removed altogether from the board.&#10;A Tower can be involved in two different confrontations, hence a player can win, or lose, 2 Monoliths at once.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;HOW TO WIN?The player who wins his/her seventh monolith and does not lose it over to his/her opponent in the immediate next turn, wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;THE ASYMMETRY RULEA player cannot copy the move of his/her opponent by positioning immediately after him/her an identical piece (same size and colour) on the same alignment and at a same level of an identical Tower. At least one of these parameters must differ.&#10;&#10;",

Through the game, the players can also learn to appreciate the importance of racial harmony in our multi-racial society.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game is played on a large paper board with a picture of Singapore island overlaid with a triangular grid. Each player takes a set of four coloured chips with stickers depicting children of different races and places them on the starting positions at four corners of the island. The object of the game is to move these pieces one step at a time to link them up in a diamond shape or in a straight line. Along the way, there are spaces marked with a star that act as barriers. If a player's piece lands on one of these starred spaces, an opponent takes a card from a stack of cards bearing questions about ethnic customs, festivals or practices in Singapore and asks the player the question. If the player answers correctly, the piece is allowed to remain on the starred space, otherwise it must return to the space it had just moved from.&#10;&#10;The game was first printed in 1992.

    "Description": "In Dim Sum Derby, each player is hungry for a particular combination of dim sum.  As dim sum becomes available, players try to eat the dim sum they crave.  Players can rotate dim sum offerings between the players, add more dim sum to the table, add things to the cart, and other perform other manipulations to get achieve their culinary goals....  To quote the rules:&#10;&#10;In summary:&#10;&#10;     A dish can come off the top of the cart in front of you to get onto the table IF there is room for it.&#10;     Once on the table you place a portion marker on the card to indicate you have put some on your plate.&#10;     After the card holds the maximum number of portion markers (see the number and circles on the card) it is scored.&#10;     If you have a Yen card that matches the dish then you place the portion markers on your Yen card.  If not, you discard the markers.  No markers should return to your initial supply unless a Derby card states otherwise.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player either places her last portion marker on a dish, or has at least one portion marker on each of her Yen cards.  You total your scored portions and partially eaten dishes, then subtract then number of Yen cards on which you have no markers whatsoever.&#10;&#10;",

You need AGRICOLA to play this expansion set.&#10;&#10;Over the past years, many small expansions for Agricola were released, mostly in German language. Lookout Games, the publisher, also introduced deluxe wooden pieces to complement the game. The Goodies Expansion contains:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Agricola: X-Deck -- 24 cards with alien encounters all over the farm. Every time a player visits a stone quarry, a card is drawn from the pile. And then? Resistance is futile!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Agricola: &#195;&#150;-Deck -- 12 new Occupations and 12 new Minor Improvements including a wunderkind, the guy with the couch, the singing family from the Alps, and of course that one specific Governor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Agricola CZ-Deck -- 12 Occupations and 12 Improvements.  Based on famous people, places, and historic events from the Czech Republic. Illustrated in the spirit of the artist Josef Lada, this expansion was initiated by the Czech Publisher of Agricola-Mindok.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Agricola: L-Deck -- Nobody knows exactly what the L stands for. Some tend to believe Lookout, others insist on Looneys. Decide for yourself; but don't take it too seriously. Contains L1-L15, minus L11 and L13.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     5 double-sided theme boards -- Western, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Mars.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sticker Sheet (70 stickers) -- 35 adults, 33 children, 1 alien, and 1 werewolf.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wooden Meeples -- Veggiemeeples, Animeeples, and Resourceeples.&#10;&#10;&#10;Since these items have been generally available in Germany, Agricola: The Goodies will be released only in English and Spanish.&#10;&#10;",

You manage a team of warriors (up to four) that you build up, equip and unleash on your opponent. The game is played on a hex-based arena, with stand-up cardboard figures representing the fighters.&#10;&#10;Your fighters are from one of five races, each with statistics that determine their strength in combat, and special skills. Character creation is a large part of the game and is similar to a simple RPG system.&#10;&#10;Combat is similar to many miniature based systems. The turn phases are: (1) Initiative, which determines how many actions you get per turn; (2) Movement, using movement points; (3) Actions &amp; Attacks, when you can perform the number of actions allowed by your initiative roll; and (4) Tests and Withdrawals, when you check to see if your fighter can shrug off his wounds, random events and when you can withdraw a fighter from the contest.&#10;&#10;There are also rules for spell casting, special arenas and managing a gladiatorial team through a campaign.&#10;&#10;Contents are: A rule book, arena map, terrain overlay sheet, two sheets of stand up figures and a bag of plastic stands for the figures.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game that's somewhat of a fusion between Axis and Allies and Risk, finding a relatively simple-to-play compromise.  It plays across a game map that is territory-intensive in Europe and East Asia, with Africa and North America trailing along as close seconds.  The setup is abstractly accurate to the situations of the five powers (Nazi Germany, Empire of Japan, British Commonwealth, Soviet Union, and the United States) around the end of 1939 (with a few liberties taken in South America), and features neutral nations (That Japan, Germany, and Russia can attack), vassal-like allied nations (especially prevalent with Britain and Germany), capitol cities, key cities, research facilities, tanks, bombers, oil, and unique special abilities for each nation.  The objectives encourage playing across the entire map, instead of just Europe, and in fact might be more advantageous to do so.&#10;&#10;Summary of National Situations:&#10;&#10;1) Nazi Germany: Having taken Czechoslovakia, Austria, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Poland, and France; and supported by its allies in Vichy France, Italy, Romania, and Hungary; the Nazi-aligned forces are poised to strike at Greece, Britain, and the Soviet Union (though the latter two are incredibly tough battles).  It has been recently brought to the attention of high command that the British-aligned forces have been building in North Africa, however, and Hitler has ordered Rommel there to advance the African front and take Libya and Egypt.  (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)&#10;&#10;2) Empire of Japan: Having annexed Taiwan and Korea, set up its puppet government in Manchukuo, and advanced down through Northern China, the Japanese Empire suddenly finds itself cut off from trade with the United States, a prime source of its oil.  The Japanese do have some reserve oil remaining, however, and if used sparingly, might be able to last until the Empire can secure its own sources.  There is much debate on whether Japan should declare war on America, and there is much incentive to do so, but there are some who believe that focusing on conquering China and British-dominated Southeast Asia might be a better strategy in the long run, and others still who believe the Soviet Union is an easier target. (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)&#10;&#10;3) The British Commonwealth: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom and its colonies have all declared war on Nazi Germany.  Commonwealth and British troops alike have poured into the battlefields of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as moved in support of British-dominated Southeast Asia and India.  The British Commonwealth also keeps a wary eye across the Pacific to the expanding Japanese Empire, hoping that their Chinese allies can hold off the insatiable Asian power long enough for the Commonwealth to get its bearings.  Sir Winston Churchill meanwhile petitions the United States to join them...&#10;&#10;4) The Soviet Union: Having seen the rapid expansion and great success of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union now seeks to expand its own borders.  The obvious choice is Finland, but Persia and Turkey to the south also seem inviting.  The success or failure of the Soviet Union rests on its ability to conquer and annex territory in much the same manner as Germany, and thus be able to display a strong showing against the remaining great powers of the world.&#10;&#10;5) United States: Haunted by the spectre of the first Great War and rifled with its own domestic problems in the Great Depression, the American people want to stay out of the European War altogether, despite having become the protectors of Iceland.  President Roosevelt sees the danger of a Nazi-controlled Europe, but is having a difficult time convincing Congress of his views.  Although America could possibly get involved in the war on its own, it seems likely that the only thing that could draw the Americans is a direct attack against the United States.  However, there is a more definitive resolve to intervene if the war comes to the Americas... (Note: in a 3 or 4 player game, America is controlled by the British player, who keeps attempting to rouse the sleeping great power against Germany and Japan)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Manual Prologue:&#10;&#10;The Story So Far...&#10;&#10;Shortly after the discovery of faster&minus;than&minus;light travel, humanity reached for the stars and expanded beyond its home solar system to colonize planets throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Hundreds of planets have been inhabited, with the species seeing unprecedented growth and prosperity, all ruled autonomously and under the protection of the Free Alliance of Stars. Man had believed, after almost limitless exploration and colonization, that mankind was unique, and that no other intelligent life of any kind existed outside of human&minus;controlled planets. Then, the Continuum attacked the Sirius system. Human defense forces did not believe there to be a threat in the universe, and were woefully unprepared for the invasion, with nearly every man, woman, and child murdered by the alien menace.&#10;&#10;Three weeks after the last message was received on Earth, the human fleet dispatched from Jupiter Base reached the Sirius system only to find that every colonized planet had been bombarded from orbit, utterly devastating the colonial surfaces. No sign was left of life, human or otherwise, until a small lifeboat was recovered in space with a dying scientist, Dr. Mark Wallace, who chronicled the assault on the colonies shortly before his death. Humans were not alone in the universe, and they were being systematically eradicated.&#10;&#10;30 years later, the war was being waged in every corner of the galaxy, and Humanity had taken advantage of its genetic predisposition of reason and their inherent ability to quickly learn and adapt. They first learned the name of the enemy via decoding communications taken during battles, and later reverse&minus;engineered power sources, propulsion systems, and most importantly, the highly advanced weapons systems that the enemy had used against them. Humanity now had a hope of repelling the invaders, and would stop at nothing until the Continuum was stopped.&#10;&#10;The Continuum is a collective of enslaved worlds, made up of several hundred species native to planets outside of our galaxy, all burning with the sole desire to subjugate all habitable planets and species, or destroy them if they were deemed a threat. The only chance that humanity has to stop them is to travel to the Continuum Homeworld, located somewhere in the Crab Nebula, and to destroy their leadership and command and control structure, defeating the threat forever.&#10;&#10;Epic Engagements is a stand-alone tactical starship combat game that can use included components as well as models from Star Wars Miniatures: Starship Battles or any other models. Players begin on opposite ends of a 24x36&quot; Star Map and using a turn-based &quot;simultaneous action&quot; mechanic wage war on one another using capital ships such as carriers, frigates and fighters to defeat the enemy force.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game system has some unique qualities.  Above all the open sequence of play within each players Operations Phase.  The game system models the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) in some detail and this makes play of the game feel very different from other comparable games.  During this Operations Phase you can perform Maneuver/Fire, Fire Support, Engineering, Intelligence, in any order you desire to support your plans.  During the enemy player turn you have the opportunity to exercise the Air Defense OS, and during other times of the sequence of play you account for Command and Control and Combat Service Support.  There is a lot here to digest and if you want to get closest to being involved in a military Command Post Exercise, this is it.&#10;&#10;This game is going to give you a completely new appreciation for the struggles of the Gross Deutschland Division during the Citadelle offensive.  The attacks timetable was disrupted early on and never got back on track.  The division hit the Pena River, bounced back, slid to the right along the southern bank, and then north toward Oboyan.  The sheer quantity of troops set against them is daunting to have to try and wear down.  But this is the nature of the battle.  And the game does a great job of presenting the situation as a real slugging match.&#10;&#10;Game Scales are:&#10;&#10;     Game Turns are 2 Hours of Daylight and 4 Hours of Night&#10;     Hex Scale is 330m per Hex&#10;     Red Army Units are Companies&#10;     German Units are Platoons and/or Companies&#10;&#10;&#10;Gross Deutschland was the largest German division involved in the battle and was endowed with an abundance of armor.  Unfortunately it was armor (Panthers) that was still too young to work properly and caused everyone lots of headaches.  For this reason it is also the largest game in the series.  Gross Deutschland had the hardest mission as it moved through the center of the area of operations.  Its mission was to spearhead the XLVIII PzK operation and make the main effort up the Oboyan road towards Kursk.  The Division has components of all arms and is a very powerful organization, even without the Panther Battalions.  It is organized the same as an SS Division.  It has a Panzer Regiment with 2 Panzer Battalions (90 MkIII and MkIVs), 2 Panther Battalions (190 Panthers), 2 Panzer Grenadier Regiments each with 3 Infantry Battalions and a Combat Support Battalion, a Panzer Artillery Regiment with 3 Battalions, a Reconnaissance Battalion, PanzerJager Battalion, Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Pionere Battalion, and an Assault Gun Battalion.  YOU have the ability to task organize the Division to make each Battalion a more potent combat weapon by cross-attaching infantry to the armor and vice versa, or even engineers or recon to these Battalions.&#10;&#10;Gross Deutschland - Base Game - comes with:&#10;&#10;        (18) Map Sections of the Pena River Area of Operations (maps B1 to B4, G1 to G4, H1 to H4, M1 to M4, N1 to N2)&#10;        (16) Counter Sheets with over 3000 Units and Markers&#10;        (12) Scenario Cards and a Master Reinforcement/Withdrawals Card&#10;        (3) d10&#10;        Master Rules&#10;        Supplemental Rules Specific to Gross Deutschland&#10;        Order of Battle Cards&#10;        Task Organization Charts for Each Major German and Red Army Formation&#10;        Command and Control Enhancement Built In (2nd edition only)&#10;        Fire Support Enhancement Built In (2nd edition only)&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Grognard games website)&#10;&#10;",

Players place tiles to extend their path from a start point towards a target end point.

They each have four path sections which go from one path entry/exit point to another. When placed side by side, the path sections from one tile join up with those on the adjacent tile, to create meandering paths. There are 35 Wend tiles in a set, which includes one copy of all possible combinations of 4 path sections on a tile. A 36th &lsquo;start/end&rsquo; tile is also included in a set, which is used by some games in the Wend family, including Wend-edge. This tile has 8 short path sections (used as starting or ending points), two on each edge.&#10;&#10;You will find that a single set of 35 Wend tiles is enough for a good game with 2-4 players. There is no hard and fast limit to the number of players in a game, but most players would probably want a reasonable number of tiles, and thus moves in the game. You can use extra sets of Wend tiles to accommodate more players or for a longer and more challenging game with a small number of players. Wend tile sets come with different coloured dots in each corner, so that it is easy to put tiles that have been shuffled together back into sets.&#10;&#10;",

It's your job to supply her with the wool from her flock of happy sheep; the fleece of four sheep will meet her needs.&#10;&#10;However, she only wants wool of one colour- either black or white. And since her sheepdog Fang ran off with a Bichon Frise last year, those four sheep will need to be within arms reach for you to gather them in.&#10;&#10;Will you be the one who gathers the four sheep first, thereby winning Aunt Dolly&rsquo;s biggest smile- and the biggest scone?&#10;&#10;Happy Sheep is a fast, fun game of strategy, memory and bluffing. It takes 15 seconds to set up, two minutes to learn, and five minutes to stop laughing when you trick someone into crying &quot;Happy Sheep&quot; and proving they don&rsquo;t know black from white.&#10;&#10;Includes strategies for gamers and a simple variant for very young kids.&#10;&#10;How to play: &#10;Mix the 20 tiles (10 black, 10 white) face down and form them into a 4x5 flock. On their turn, a player slides out one tile and looks at it. If it's one of the 4 show-off sheep, they show everyone and put it back in the same place. Otherwise, they may rejoin the sheep to the flock face-down wherever they please.&#10;&#10;As soon as any player thinks they know where four sheep of the same colour are in a 2x2 group, they yell &quot;Happy Sheep&quot; and turn over the four tiles. If they're right, they win; if not, they're out and play continues.&#10;&#10;It sounds simple, but with other players moving tiles, bluffing and sabotaging, it's easy to get beaten to the win or tricked into calling incorrectly.&#10;&#10;For strategic players, the backs of the tiles come in with and without daisies, so by some careful calculation it is possible to improve your decisions...&#10;&#10;",

For information on that game, please refer to UNPUBLISHED PROTOTYPE.&#10;&#10;Scramble for Africa recreates the European exploration and partition of Africa in the final decades of the nineteenth century, combining a strong historical theme and the random element of discovery with a simple positional game system. Played on an authentic 19th-century map of Africa, Scramble for Africa includes two scenarios, one historical and one hypothetical, each playable in under two hours. Complexity is easy (about 2/10).&#10;&#10;Play is determined by the triangular grid, which is superimposed over a map of Africa.  The points at which the lines of the grid intersect determine the placement of pieces on the game board in a manner similar to the game of go.  A player action consists of placing one control marker on the map, often in conjunction with moving an army (if in play), playing an event chit, and/or drawing an event chit from the randomizer cup. Event chits add random elements to the game, and include discoveries, diplomatic events, resources, or encounters with native populations. The object of the game is to acquire the most Victory Points, primarily by surrounding and controlling spaces in a manner similar to the game of go.  At the end of the game, players receive Victory Points for their positions on the board, and for resources controlled.  This is added to VP's accumulated for discoveries accumulated during the course of the game.  The player with the greatest score, obviously, is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Installment 4 in the Legends of Time and Space&#10;&#10;From the back of the module:&#10;&#10;Growing up on the periphery is not easy.  It's a tough life, and to survive, to have to know how to deal with ruffians, swindlers and thieves.&#10;&#10;For excitement, and to pay the rent, you make your living as a bounty-hunter.  The risks are great but the payoff can be tremendous.&#10;&#10;Your quarry this time is a dangerous pirate, armed and ruthless.  Initially, his ventures were an irritation to the locals.  But as his greed and daring grew, he garnered the watchful eye of the meagerly-equipped local authorities.&#10;&#10;Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to capture &quot;The Duke&quot; and bring him to justice.  But you must hurry.  The provisional government is weak, and with each of &quot;The Duke&quot;'s raids, society falls further into chaos.&#10;&#10;You must find &quot;The Duke&quot; and neutralize him before it is too late.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;This easy-to-play adventure is designed for solitaire or group play, and is suitable for one to four players, ages 12 and up. This complete game includes the adventure booklet, rules, pieces and game board.&#10;&#10;The player creates one or more characters from the rules, equips them with items they purchase and sends them adventuring by using a paragraph reference system, much like the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; type of game. The player resolves encounters with die rolls and updates his character's status to reflect damage, victories, records key words, and attempts to complete the mission.&#10;&#10;Counters and a map provided with the module, aid in visualizing the relation between character(s) and encounters with animals, bandits, stray robots, drunken gods and what have you.&#10;&#10;This series is strongly inspired by Metagaming's Microquest series: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/24145&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A 32 page booklet for adding fantasy elements such as magic users and their spells and various monsters and their special abilities to your existing set of miniatures rules. The inspiration comes from the popular literature of the time with an emphasis on the classic thematic elements.&#10;&#10;There are three different types of magic users to add to your army:  Druids, Shamans, and Sorcerers.  Each gets 10 spell points to chose from the 25 available spells (cost 1-4 points each) but is limited thematically to what they may chose.  Adding a magic user to your army is expensive however, costing roughly the same point value as a Dragon, Giant, or a Commanding General.&#10;&#10;Twenty different classic monsters are created for your army by following a simple template system.  Here is an example of how to get stats for a goblin character by making conversions to your normal miniatures rules:&#10;&#10;Goblins:&#10;Fight as:  Light, medium or light-medium infantry only.&#10;Movement:  As designated troop type.&#10;Frontage:  As designated troop type.&#10;Special:  Like Orcs, Goblins loose one morale grade for reaction test purposes in bright sunlight.&#10;Limits:  No more than one Goblin unit in an army may be designated as elite.  Goblins may never be classed as regular troops.&#10;&#10;(User Summary)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This are two full size, full color mounted maps that fold to a size that fits in both the Steam and Age of Steam boxes. At first glance, both have similar rules changes: an option to forsake delivery of goods cubes or an increase of locomotive and replace it with a special function that will be key to winning the game. But the differences between the maps and how they are played are substantial.&#10;&#10;California Gold Rush takes place in the mid 1800&rsquo;s in Central California. Pockets of gold have been found, and you need to lay claim to the mines before your opponents. To do so you need to build railroads out to the gold mines and pick up the gold. The mechanics are modified slightly during the delivery phase: you always have the option of picking up any available gold cube wherever your track has been laid instead of delivering a regular good cube or increasing your locomotive. At the end of the game, each of the gold cubes increases your income (VPs in Steam) by 5. California Gold Rush is for 3-6 players.&#10;&#10;Underground Railroad takes place in the years leading up to the civil war all across the Eastern United States. During the goods delivery phase, players may opt to move slaves north to a free city instead of delivering a goods cube or increasing their locomotive. They don&rsquo;t receive any income for doing so. The winner is determined by who frees the most slaves...as long as they don&rsquo;t go bankrupt before the end of the game.  Underground Railroad is for 3-5 players.&#10;&#10;The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 7 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double-sided expansions. These maps can be preordered from Bezier Games and will ship in October 2010. The &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; 7th map is only available through preorders.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Touch, Crouch, Engage Rugby is an easy to learn replay game on rugby, featuring complete statistical data for all the Five Nations and Six Nations tournaments from 1980 till 2010.&#10;Each match is resolved with a few dice rolls and you may able to replay an entire tournament in fifteen minutes!!&#10;It uses a derivation of the system premiered in Dream to end all dreams: World Cup Soccer, more developed to take in account the peculiar key aspects of rugby.&#10;First step is to compare the Attack class of the first team against the Defense class of the opponent (both indicated by a letter on the data sheet for the tournament chosen). Calculate the difference between the higher class and the inferior, divide by two the result (rounding up toward the inferior value) and take this number as a column shift from the higher value toward the inferior value (see the example below, for a clearer explanation). Now, roll 2 6-sided die on the &quot;Tries Table&quot; to see how many tries that team has scored in the match. Then, check the &quot;conversion percentage&quot; of that team and roll a percentage dice (ie. two 10-sided dice, reading one of them as &quot;tens&quot;) for each try scored: if the roll is inside the percentage value, the try is succesfully converted (add two points to team's score); otherwise, conversion kick is failed. Then, check the &quot;Three points&quot; value of the team to see how many penalty kicks/drops have been scored during the match. Roll 1 10-sided die on the correct column of the &quot;3-points Table&quot;, multiply by 3 the number obtained and add that result to the points scored by that team to reach its total for the match. Repeat this procedure for the opposing team and you will get the final result of the match.&#10;&#10;A separate expansion set contains data for all the World Cup and the Tri Nations tournaments&#10;&#10;",

Alchemy is played with one player&rsquo;s basic set of pieces from Symbol, and thus provides a clever way to determine first player for a game of Symbol or can be played as a separate stand alone game for those who want a quick match that is easy to learn, almost impossible to solve, fun, and mathematically very interesting; though a new and unique game, Alchemy shares some ideas and mechanics with other stacking strategy games and members of the NIM family of games.)&#10;&#10;The players represent dueling alchemists trying to make chemical reactions with the Aristotelian elements (earth, water, air, fire), and a fifth, unstable element of destruction.  Alchemists want to create gold, but they never could figure out how to create gold, so instead the players are fighting over a single gold coin by alternating turns making new combinations of elements.  When on a player&rsquo;s turn no new combinations are possible, that player loses the round.  The first player to win two rounds in a row wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

From the iron age Chief to the last King of Portugal, from the Roman Governor to the Arabic Sultan, from Kings to Scientists, from Navigators to Middle Age Writers, all of these have marked their presence in the Castle and their history is vivid in our memories still today.&#10;&#10;In this game, 12 of the most prominent characters that have lived in the Castle dispute a tournament. This tournament happens only each 1.000 years, and the winner will reign over the Castle for the next 1.000 years.&#10;&#10;To win this tournament, each character must walk around the board paths and some secret passages, and collect and preserve 3 S. Jorge Trophies. But be careful with the false trophies, they weight on you and slow you down.&#10;&#10;You also have to be aware of other characters: if they encounter you, they may steal your trophies. Or you may steal theirs. Or you may discard some of your &quot;non-valid&quot; trophies on their back. Or the opposite. Anyway, something may happen.&#10;&#10;And, of course, you have a special ability. Something that only you can do. How to take the most of it, that's your job.&#10;&#10;",

These dice can range from the standard D6 numbered 1 to 6 in one color to any D6 you can imagine, by mixing colors and numbers.&#10;&#10;For example, you can create a die like this: Green 1 - Green 5 - Blue 1 - Red 4 - Yellow 6 - Yellow 6.&#10;&#10;There are 2 types of Nestortiles:&#10;&#10;A-Type: The interlocking teeth are short, so the edges of the assembled dice are flush, suitable for making a single die, for example.&#10;&#10;B-Type: The interlocking teeth are about double in length, allowing you to connect multiple tiles or dice in order to create more complex 3D structures.&#10;&#10;Moreover, you can customize the tiles by drawing on their backs with a permanent marker or by adding stickers, and create your own designs!&#10;&#10;Nestortiles are sold in packs of 60 tiles in 10 colors, (6 tiles per color, numbered 1 to 6), and can only be purchased on the nestorgames site.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introducing the Game&#10;&#10;The successor to the Austrian throne survived Sarajevo assassination and became in 1916 the Emperor Franz Ferdinand. Just a few years passed and in Europe it simmer again!&#10;&#10;At the outbreak of the war, Europe is divided into five blocks, which are: Britain and its Allies, the Russian Empire, France and its Allies, Ottoman Empire and Central Powers.&#10;&#10;The game uses a modified original map of Europe, close to the state in 1914, but reflecting the development of an imaginary continent.&#10;&#10;Key imaginary historical events before the war include the following:&#10;&#10;Britain: In the twenties Britain got into serious conflicts with the Tsarist Russia and left the Triple Entente. From the thirties there was a gradual democratization in the colonies. Scandinavian countries see in the UK its natural protector against expanding Russia and Germany. After the riots in the Iberian Peninsula, Gibraltar outpost spreads to Andalusia and Portugal.&#10;&#10;The Russian Empire: in the late twenties hit the Russian Empire its limits in far Asia. The Grand Duchy of Finland used the growing tension between Russia and Britain to escape from the Russia in early thirties. The abdication of a liberal the Tsar and the emergence new militant faction to power jump-started a new phase of armaments in Europe.&#10;&#10;France: After the failed assassination in Sarajevo, it was France who saved by its diplomatic activity the European peace. In the thirties, France tried to create a large Mediterranean Union. South of the Apennine peninsula and Balkan were hit by neoislamic expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the French plan foiled. Against the traditional enemy - Germany - has France built an extensive Maginot Line.&#10;&#10;Central Powers: Emperor Franz Ferdinand poured into crusty Austro-Hungarian veins new blood. In early twenties he federalized and modernized Austro-Hungary and in the thirties gradually agreed to trade and customs union with imperial Germany. The economic and military power of Central Powers long dampen expansionary ambitions of neighboring states. The Germans built along the lines with France its own line of defense - Siegfried Line.&#10;&#10;The Ottoman Empire: the rapid modernization of the Ottoman Empire, launched by the world's thirst for oil, awoke southeast Europe to a new prosperity. Once Europe's sick man rallied by endless supply of black gold. In the late twenties, after a series of smaller conflicts, Ottomans returned to the southern Balkans and Islamic radicalization in the thirties dominate in large areas of northern Africa and even in southern Italy.&#10;&#10;Each of the Powers thinks only of itself and just like you wants to be the best and win over all. Powers also conclude mutually beneficial agreements, lead diplomatic negotiations to form a military alliances, and so even you can not ignore this part of the game. Occupy all three fields of one power or help push your arch-enemy of its territory. This is not &quot;Ludo&quot;, this is &quot;The War.&quot;&#10;&#10;Goal of the game&#10;&#10;Your task is to occupy the entire territory of any other power (three fields of one color), while keeping on your own territory at least one pyramid.&#10;&#10;You also win when your arch enemy loses his last piece from his own territory. His loss is your victory.&#10;&#10;",
