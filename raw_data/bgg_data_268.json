This continues until he rolls the side of the die with the word &quot;Owzthat!&quot; (a corruption of &quot;How's that&quot;, an appeal in cricket). Then, the other die is rolled. The faces on this die show different ways of being out, such as caught, bowled, etc. On this die are also two ways of being not out i.e. the appeal is turned down. If the player is not out, he continues to roll the first die. If he is out, he continues his innings with his next batsman, as in a real game of cricket.&#10;&#10;",

Maybe there&rsquo;s a maverick inside you; can your friends predict what you will do?  Or will you keep them guessing while you expose their inner selves to the world?&#10;&#10;In every round of Rorschach, each player picks an inkblot that answers a question asked on a card.  To win the game, you must pick the same inkblot as each other player at least once, and you must be the only one to pick an inkblot at least once. Can you figure out whether the other players are giving honest answers?  Or are they trying to pick the same inkblot they think you will choose?  Can you throw them off your scent so as to make a unique selection for an extra point? Subterfuge abounds in this game of skill, timing, and intrigue.&#10;&#10;Rorschach contains 100 new and unique inkblot cards that are large, widely varied, and graphically stunning. The question deck covers a broad range of topics, keeping play fresh every time. One expansion is planned for the game, adding an even larger selection of questions and blots, and additional questions and inkblots will be available to print from www.bucephalus.biz.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Guile is a medieval memory card game of deception and intrigue for two players. Players are either the noble King Arthur or the nefarious Sir Mordred, and the Knights of the Round Table are the instruments of your influence in Camelot. Your chosen knights will advance your schemes as you trace the web of subterfuge and manipulate it to your own ends. The victor will wield the most influence when each Knight's loyalties are revealed.&#10;&#10;The Round Table is formed by eight face-up Knights, with each player controlling four. Each Knight also bears a face-down Influence Card on top of it. On his turn, a player can look at the Influence Card of his Knight-errant or exchange that card with an Influence Card of any other Knight at the Round Table. Play continues in this manner until the turns have circled the Round Table twice. At that time, all of the face-down Influence cards are revealed, and the player who has the highest sum of Influence wins the round. A new round is set up and played again, and the first person to win two rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Who will hold sway in Camelot? And who will hold sway on the morrow? Only time will tell...&#10;&#10;Guile includes the 'inspansion' &quot;Extended Cast&quot;, which adds even more possibilities for treachery and deceit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Alpha Blitz consists of two different games.&#10;&#10;Alpha is a word game for 2 players. there are 98 cards with letters on them and 10 blitz cards showing a lightning bolts. These are shuffled together and six are laid out between the players. Each player gets 3 cards in their start hand. On your turn you try to make the longest word possible with the six letters showing on the table using each letter as many times as you want. For example you could make the word letters with the letters L, E, T, R, and S showing. Each turn you must cover one letter with a card from your hand and then draw another card. You may do this before or after you make a word. If you cover a letter with a blitz card that pile is permanently out so as the game progresses there are less letters to use. You receive 1 point for making a word. 1 point for every letter in the word more then the number of letter piles. You also get 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z you use. The game ends when there are only 2 letter piles left.&#10;&#10;Blitz is a word game for 3-6 players. Each player has a hand of 3 cards. 2 cards are placed face down in front of each player. All cards are turned up at the same time. The first player to call out a word that can be formed with the letters showing gets 1 point plus 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z they used. The second player to call out a word gets 2 points but the word must be longer then the previous word. This continues until all players have called out a word or passed due to not seeing a legal word. Each round is started by covering a letter from your hand. The game ends when one player has both letter piles covered with a blitz card.&#10;&#10;Alpha Blitz was awarded the title &quot;Best Word Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1999.&#10;&#10;",

They are surprisingly like some animals living on our planet and we would like to adopt them all unfortunately, they cannot be tamed and playing is all they ever think about: they run, jump, throw themselves everywhere, thus damaging many things.  We have to prevent them from creating chaos in our homes by catching them.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game comes with five cuddly toys (Phanteus, Octopus, Torteus, Marsupus and Ursinus), 5 cords with a wooden ball, 20 gems, 1 die and 6 stickers.&#10;&#10;The six sides of the die are: Whoopies' color, Whoopies' hair color, Whoopies' name, all Whoopies but one, A Whoopie for everyone, and double points round.&#10;&#10;You roll the die and chose a Whoopie based on the catagory.

Some will frantically seek to flee the city, others will seek to barricade themselves in buildings against the terrible siege. By not getting surrounded, and through the use of both luck and brains(!), you will be able to survive the night.&#10;&#10;In game terms, from a deck of cards containing zombies, items and events, players are dealt a hand of cards. Each turn, players draw a card. If the card's a zombie, the player places it in front of himself; if not, he adds the card to his hand and plays one card of his choice. Certain items give the player a chance to flee. The player who first lays down a predetermined number of escape cards &ndash; or who is simply the last one alive &ndash; wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rock Me Archimedes is a two player abstract game requiring both strategy and dexterity.  The game is named after the ancient Greek mathematician, famous for describing the principle of the lever.&#10;&#10;The game consists of: a wooden board affixed to a rounded base, forming a teeter-totter assembly; 14 white marbles and 14 black marbles; and a specially numbered die.  The length of the board is engraved with a grid of spaces in which to fit the marbles, 16 rows of 3 spaces each. The goal of the game is for the winning player to move at least 4 of his marbles to one end of the board without either end of the board touching the table at any time.&#10;&#10;The game begins with no marbles on the board, and the board balanced level.  Each player receives 14 marbles of one color, and chooses one end of the board as his goal.  On the player's move, the player may choose to either place a marble in one of the two central rows of the board, or to roll the die. The die will indicate a number from one to three.  The player may then move any of his marbles already on the board the number of spaces indicated by the die roll.  The player may move a single marble, or split the move between two or more marbles.  Marbles may be moved in any direction except diagonally.  The player may jump the opposing player pieces, but not his own. If at any time during the move either end of the board touches the table, the player loses and the game ends.  Otherwise, the first player to place four of his marbles in his goal spaces (last two rows on the end of the board) wins the game.  The rules also contain several variants of the basic game.&#10;&#10;",

Nobody wants to go into the water, and so there's a lot of pushing and shoving on the plank. Each tries to stay as far back on the plank as possible and push the others overboard. Finally, a large shark was also spotted happily circling the ship in anticipation.&#10;&#10;16 pirates in four colors stand in rows and columns on the plank. Each player draws a counter out a bag that secretly indicates which his color is. Now each player tries to move the pirates such that at least one pirate of his color is left on board at the end of the game. Players may move all pirates of any color. On a player's turn, he first turns the wind rose. It chooses the first move - if two pirates are exchanged, for example, or move one pirate to the head, the end of the line, or one space forwards, or no action at all. Secondly, a full row of pirates is always pushed on space forwards. So, over the course of the game, pirates fall off the plank - and into the mouth of the waiting shark!&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with his pieces on four adjacent points of the star. Pieces may move from one point to an empty adjacent point, or from the center space to any empty point. A piece may only move from a point to the center space if one or both adjacent points are occupied by an enemy piece. The object is to immobilize your opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Across Africa is a cooperative game for the young players that are just starting their adventure with board games. The game is designed for two to four players of age 6 and up.&#10;&#10;During their African expedition the young players will discover new routes through the wilderness and take photos of the animals they encounter on the way. If they are lucky enough, they will meet one of the legendary diamond seekers and perhaps collect some precious jewels themselves.&#10;&#10;The game consists of players turns, during which each of them rolls the dice and moves his pawn by the shown number of spaces on the board. The pawn may stop on one of the eight kinds of spaces. The player fulfills the action assigned to the type of the space. This may be for example making a photo of animals, moving backwards in the next turn, drawing an adventure card, collecting the diamond, meeting the snake and many more.&#10;&#10;In order to win the game children have to fill up the whole crocodile shaped photo album with photos they took during their adventure and reach the last space on the board.&#10;&#10;Across Africa offers also the alternate mode of playing. This time the players will not cooperate but race to the finish line, trying at the same time to collect as much diamonds and valuable photos as possible.&#10;&#10;",

After having picked up a castle card, the player may take yet another card from the pile, or pass her turn.&#10;&#10;If a player picks up a 'fairy' or a 'diamond' card, it also has to be placed face up on the player's right-hand side. As with a castle card another card may be taken from the pile after having picked up a fairy card, or the turn may be passed.&#10;&#10;Diamond cards can be used to buy castle cards from other players. 3 diamond cards can be exchanged for a single castle card. A player may not refuse to sell a castle card. Furthermore, only a single castle card can be bought in a turn. A player is not allowed to take a card from the pile in the same turn in which she buys a castle card from an opponent.&#10;&#10;If a player picks up a 'witch' card it's bad luck! Then a player must place the witch card, and 3 other cards next to the pile of cards in the center of the table and pass her turn. The 3 other cards can be diamond cards or castle cards, either from the player's right-hand side pile or from her own castle. If a player has less then 3 cards, she must hand in whatever cards she has.&#10;A fairy card can be used to counter the witch card. If countered, both the witch card and the fairy card must be placed on the pile next to the cards in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Whenever there are no more cards left in the pile, all the cards that are next to the pile are taken, shuffled and placed back in the center of the table to form a new draw pile.&#10;&#10;The player who manages to build her own castle completely (6 cards of the same color) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Move your Manager, Intern, and Donut pawns around the board as you sabotage co-workers, mobilize your workforce, and steal, swap, or lose office supplies. After all, what's a little backstabbing among colleagues as you climb that corporate ladder? Fill in real co-workers' names on some of the Drama cards. Did you spread a photo of a co-worker picking his nose? Maybe you left another nasty note in the break room, or told everyone it was someone else who clogged the toilet on Taco Tuesday. It's the ups and downs of office politics as you aim to move a Manager and an Intern into 4 out of 6 departments to gain control and win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Maple Leaf Edition. The ultimate Canadian edition of Monopoly. While gameplay is the same as in 'classic' monopoly, this edition features numerous unique changes, including:&#10;- The box is the Canadian flag motif. &#10;- All properties are Canadian replacing the equivalent 'standard Monopoly' properties (a booklet is included describing the actual streets, railroads and utilities used on the board).&#10;- The insert is formed plastic to hold the money (standard) and slots for the properties to be displayed upright and two troughs for the houses and hotels. &#10;- An embossed gold maple leaf enhances the center of the board. &#10;- The Chance, Community Chest and Properties are non-standard sized and bi-lingual.&#10;- The board replaces the cop with a RCMP Mountie on the Go To Jail (Allez au Houscou) corner. &#10;- all railway spaces show the front of a Canadian train rather than the black Parker locomotive&#10;- The 10 metal playing pieces include 9 original to 'classic' version, and a new beaver token (of course!).&#10;&#10;For the 2000 2nd edition, all the pewter playing tokens were replaced with 8 true Canadian versions, including: Moose, Ski Plane, Bear, Hockey Player, Winter Boot, Sled, Canoe and Train. Other changes:&#10;- The banknotes design is different: In the centre is a maple leave and to it's left and right is a space showing the name of the sponsor Royal Bank.&#10;-Community chest and chance are replaced with bilingual 'Provincial' cards (red) and 'Federal' cards (yellow), both showing the same skyline picture as the box lid. They all show funny drawings with Mr. Monopoly (as Rich Uncle Pennybags will be called from 2000 onwards). &#10;The text on some of these cards have been adapted to uniquely Canadian situations.&#10;&#10;For the 2010 'Electronic Banking' edition of the game, an online contest was conducted in which participants were asked to vote for cities to be on the new board. Unlike the earlier editions, properties were arranged in their final vote order, and are not in any specific geographic arrangement.&#10;&#10;",

First you build the game itself from the provided Lego components, then 2-4 people can play the code game.  Once the game is assembled, players set up their own secret code by placing 4 of the colored jewels inside their treasure chest. Players then take turns rolling the die, selecting colored jewels to 'guess' the codes of the other players. Similar to Mastermind, jewel placement is confirmed as correct/right place, correct/wrong place, or not correct at all. Play continues until all the codes have been cracked; last person standing is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

That player then places one of their cards in front of another player. They may choose a higher-numbered card or a card of the same color from their hand. Alternatively, they may pick up all the cards in front of them, add them to their hand, then choose to play any of the cards in their hand.

Each dial has one of six symbols showing. To access the treasure cards beneath the lid the players alternate turns to twist the dials to show the combination of symbols which match the genie card that is in play. When the genie card has been matched, the player may take as many treasure cards as desired. If a player finds a snake card among the treasure cards taken then the player forfeits all treasure cards taken that turn. Whenever a player is done taking treasure cards a new genie card is put in play and the game continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the final genie card is out of play or the final snake has been found. The player with the highest total in treasure cards is the winner. The game is in German, French, and Spanish.&#10;&#10;This game is also published in an English version from Ravensburger as &quot;Open Sesame&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This CCG actually plays like the computer game with the same name. You start with your castle and a hero and from there you play armies, castles and ruins. The armies go forth upon the play of march cards and try to take over other castles. Castles give you gold to spend. Heroes can also search ruins for gold or cool stuff.&#10;&#10;Different scenarios have different winning conditions such as most gold or control of over half the castles.&#10;&#10;Artwork is OK and it is fairly easy to collect as it can be found fairly cheap.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     CCG Workshop (no longer available)&#10;&#10;&#10;Regarding the publisher, Strategic Studies Group is an Australian company that is in no way connected to the other SSG (who published wargames such as Alaric). Warlords is the only game published, to date, by Strategic Studies Group.&#10;&#10;",
