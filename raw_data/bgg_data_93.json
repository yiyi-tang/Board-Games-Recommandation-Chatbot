    "Description": "Briscola Chiamata (English: declaration Briscola) is the five-player version of Briscola. Every player is dealt eight cards, so that no cards remain undealt. Then, each player, starting from the dealer's right and proceeding counter-clockwise, bids in an auction to declare how many points they will score. A player may pass, and hence cannot bid again in that game. The bid represents the number of points that player believes he is capable of accumulating. Bidding continues until all but one player have passed in a round. This remaining player has then &quot;won the bid&quot; and therefore gets to declare the Briscola, i.e. the trump suit. The declarer also declares a specific Briscola card (example, the &quot;Ace of Cups&quot; if Cups was the declared Briscola) and the holder of this card is then determined to be the declarer's partner. Logically, the declarer would  declare the highest Briscola card he does not already hold in the hopes of creating the strongest combined hand between him and his partner.&#10;&#10;The remaining three players are partnered with each other, without their knowledge. Each player, other than the declarer's partner, acts independently, until it is clear which players are partners. Infrequently, the declarer may declare a Briscola card he already holds (if he feels he has a very strong hand), in which case the other four players are partenered against him.&#10;&#10;Because of the unique method of declaration and blind partnering in this variation of the game, it is considered to be one of the most entertaining variations of the game. Game strategy is often devised to determine which player is partnered with the declarer, whereas the declarer's partner may devise ruses and decoy strategies to fool the other players, such as not taking a trick, or playing points on a trick that will be won by an opponent.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The &quot;advanced&quot; versionThe more advanced and most commonly played version of Briscola Chiamata requires the players to first bid the rank of the Briscola they wish to call. As the bidding progresses, the rank is reduced, all other players pass. If a two (the lowes card) is bid, players start bidding the point total they must earn to win the match, starting from 62 (since 61 is the minimum possible to win during normal bidding). Then, the last bidder may declare the suit of the Briscola. In this version, the objective is for the declarer and his partner to earn at least 61 points, or the amount of points bid by the declarer, if the auction got to that phase.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Many ages have past since the use of magic broke the world. Since then, the races of Oshos have lived in an unstable peace. Yet as memory slips to myth, and myth slips to legend, the &quot;Great Races&quot; once more begin meddling with magic, and the tainted power corrupts the land yet again. Lava swallows up whole villages and a terrible famine spreads. &quot;Lower&quot; nomadic races begin rising up, pillaging and raiding nearby towns for food. Peace is no longer an option. War is here, and only one race can reign supreme.&#10;&#10;Ignite is a dueling deckbuilder where players battle miniatures across a variably built board. Each player has 3 units of their chosen race, each with its own asymmetrical race ability.&#10;&#10;Each unit has 3 hit points. When your unit takes a point of damage you insert a dagger into the back of the miniature. The player who inflicts the last point of damage keeps the unit as a trophy. Whoever has the most trophies at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Each card in your hand can be played for its honor value (allowing you to buy more cards) or for its battle effect (affecting your units and cards). Knowing when to battle and when to invest is incredibly important.&#10;&#10;In the middle of the board is the bazaar. While one of your units is here it may sell a card. Selling a card allows you to trash it (removing it permanently from your deck) and gain honor equal to its original cost, allowing you to buy more powerful cards. The bazaar is powerful, but also dangerous as your opponents are often right there next to you.&#10;&#10;There are 4 special types of terrain in Ignite and you'll have to choose how best to use them.&#10;&#10;     Village: Allows you to purchase a card, but a successful attack against you will do additional damage.&#10;     Forest: Protects you from ranged attacks, but fire attacks will spread through the entire forest.&#10;     Water: Necessary for certain powerful spells, but freeze and lightning attacks will spread through the entire body of water.&#10;     Lava: If you are pushed into lava, your unit immediately dies.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Ignite there is a strength and weakness to everything. Invest too early in powerful magic attacks, and you won't have any honor to purchase more valuable equipment when you need it. Invest in bows and arrows to gain a range advantage over the enemy, but remember, you can only shoot arrows if you also have a bow in your hand. Prefer getting up close and personal with melee weapons? Just be sure you have mounts available to bring your unit within striking distance.&#10;&#10;Ignite comes from our love of deckbuilders. The main complaints against deckbuilders are that they (1) have minimal player interaction, playing a lot like solitaire (2) have an anti-climactic end-game (3) often feel the same after a few games. We built a deckbuilder where negotiation, alliance-making, and begging were legitimate strategies. Where the end of the game is the most exciting part. And where you will never play the same game twice (between the asymmetric race abilities, variably built board, and incredibly varied weapons, items, and spells).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Time heals all wounds, they say, but the sudden death of a loved one sometimes shakes those who are left behind so much that their faith wavers. To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.&#10;&#10;The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!&#10;&#10;UNDO: Cherry Blossom Festival is one of three initial cases of the innovative new game series UNDO. As players travel through the dead man&rsquo;s past and try to give him a future, they gradually explore a touching story about love, loss and family.&#10;&#10;Okayama, Japan, March 2000: A man in his sixties lies lifelessly on the floor of his living room, a broken wine glass and the photo of a young woman in a wheelchair next to him. The deceased wears an old-fashioned blue suit and has no visible injuries aside from a barely perceptible scar above the eye. In his jacket a telephone rings with the melody of &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; and on the table lie cherry blossom branches...&#10;&#10;This title isn't about solving a crime or catching a murderer. Instead, players must embrace their role as disembodied destiny weavers to go through the past of this man's travel to prevent his death. Everyone who leaps through time carries a momentous decision that in the end will determine whether he lives or dies?&#10;&#10;",

When several of the same animals are looking in the same direction, they will escape from the net, while any animals on top of them will slide down (tetris-style), which may lead to other groups of animals being able to escape. After each turn, another animal is added at the top of each column. When a column is seven cards high, all players lose. When all animal cards have been played, players can compare how many animals were left in the net (cooperative mode) or how many they freed (competitive mode).&#10;&#10;The game has a campaign in which difficulty rises in each level. For one, each animal has a special ability. These make the game easier but also more complex. On the other hand, more animals are added, which makes it harder to form groups. Also, garbage cards come into play. These can disrupt groups or stop animals from using their special abilities.&#10;&#10;",

Taking on roles of powerful mystical characters like the Druid, the Shaman or the Wizard, players will brew potions to grow their magical power, while casting spells to stop others from getting ahead. Cauldron is a resource management game that plays with 2-5 players aged 10+ in 1 hour.&#10;&#10;Play revolves around a central set of fields, producing potion ingredients each season (frog legs, spider webs, dragon eggs etc). Each player has potions - way to combine ingredients to score Magik (game's victory points and currency). Players take turns harvesting ingredients, brewing potions and attempting to steal ingredients from competitors. Each player also has a hand of spells - one-time effects that help the player or hinder opponents. Each character has variable powers that modifies the way basic actions are resolved.&#10;&#10;After all ingredients have been harvested, players have a chance to invest some of their Magik to buy additional potions, spells or add fields to the game board. Balancing investment with advancement is a crucial part of the game.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one of the player reaches 35 Magik - that player is the winner. The game has an element of luck and conflict present but the majority of it revolves around resource management, planning and balancing short and long term investment.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A very nice peg-board game, now re-issued. The plastic board has 100 holes, numbered in a oft reversing spiral with 1 in the center. A deck of numbered cards from 1-100 is shuffled and players start with 4 each. You may either play a card and stick a peg in, or draw a card, the hand limit being 4. And of course, you're trying to get five of your pegs in a row to win. Simple, except that playing a card allows you to place a peg in that number, or any empty number above. So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block. Very good fun and nice for non-gamers.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Take 5&#10;    5 in a Row&#10;    Go-Moku&#10;    Renju&#10;    Pente&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Is population a power or a burden?&#10;&#10;if the economy is doing well the population will increase, as the population increase, does it necessary mean that the productivity will also increase? In most worker placement games like Agricola, Stone Age that seems to be the case.&#10;&#10;This game plays like a typical worker placement game. At the first round each player has 2 workers and they take turn placing their workers one by one onto the basic tiles. The basic tiles consisted of quarry(get a card and take first player),mining(get a card), construction(build a building), Education(increase a worker). At the end of each round you'd have to pay your worker salaries. If you don't have enough money to pay for the workers this round, you'd have to sell some of your private properties and it'd become public to cover the cost.&#10;&#10;Here is the most interesting aspect about this game, unlike most other worker placement games, as long as you place workers in the farming/gathering tile the resource for feeding your people is unlimited, they can create enough food for themselves. In this game, the cash flow is limited even if you place the worker in the market tile you can only receive money up to the amount that is available in the pool. The only way to increase the money in the pool is when players cannot pay for their worker and sell their property to bring cash flow into the game, otherwise, there is no way to add more money. At the end of the game, the sum total of the selling prices of all the assets is the victory point.&#10;&#10;in this game, If you want to increase population, you can increase it as you like, but unlike other games, population will not score at all except for the effects of some buildings. On the contrary, if the workers cannot produce they will become a huge burden and consume the economy, making accumulation of wealth absolutely impossible.&#10;&#10;Essentially, this players have to learn to balance between development of population and the economy. Too few people can not maximize profits. However, if there are too many people they will eat up the profit. Initially, increased workers to increase productivity seems to be very attractive, but when the workers begin to be a burden in the latter half of the game. there is no way to reduce the workers. There is no family planning nor natural disasters, major famine, massacre and cultural revolution in this game. Once the population have increased and if the economic development does not catch up, you will quickly understand what it means to be debt.&#10;&#10;",

For now the mountain pass remains secure but our scouts have reported large gatherings in the valley and we're expecting a full scale assault before the season's end. If that wasn't enough to worry about, our neighbors are also preparing for war and petitioning the king for his troops and supplies which are already spread thin. It seems you'll not only be fighting a war of steel, but one of words as well.&#10;&#10;In Dragon Valley, players take turns dividing items such as knights and archers, building materials for blacksmith shops and towers, special powers and even attackers. The attackers consist of dragons, orcs and battering rams that emerge from mountain passes into each player's lands. After dividing, other players select the group of items they prefer and leave the remainder with the player who did the dividing. After that, players use special cards to interfere with each others plans. The last step each round is for players to setup defenses, destroy the attackers or laying siege on the orc strongholds scattered throughout Dragon Valley.&#10;&#10;",

You are astronomy enthusiasts, and you've recently seen something in your evening stargazing that you can't explain. Using your telescope, camera, and computer research, you're trying to track down this Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) to help the global scientific community gain a better understanding of what's out there. While UAPs have been spotted all over the world, you'll be focusing on the edge of space, where it is possible that these objects might be.&#10;&#10;Deduction fans will enjoy new gameplay elements such as variable quantities of objects, analyzing satellites, and major new twists, such as rotating orbits that result in continually changing placement and adjacency. Objects can be next to something, above it, below it, in the same quadrant from it, or even directly across from it. As the Earth rotates, the options continue to expand! Search for and take pictures of satellites, the International Space Station, or the Hubble Telescope to help you track down mysterious UAPs!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the box:)&#10;&#10;La Bataille D'Albuera Espagnol is a simulation of the hardest fought battle of the Peninsular War. The battalions of Imperial France , pitted against a desperate coalition of Spanish, Portuguese and British troops, must rid the field of their enemies, thereby lifting the siege of Badajoz, capitol of Estremadura. All of western Spain hangs in the balance, no to mention the reputation of The Empire!!!&#10;&#10;Played on a 34&quot;x22&quot; period map, over 400 multi-colored, die-cut counters beautifully represent the units that took part in the day's action. Infantry are portrayed in their regimental or battalion organization; cavalry are shown by regiment and/or squadron; artillery by battery or or section. Distinctions are made between line or light infantry and cavalry, grenadier or other elite forces. Important personalities also appear.&#10;&#10;The game is ideal for one-on-one play or solitary study. Each turn represents twenty minutes of real and simulated time.; each hex an area roughly one hundred meters across; each unit individually rated for morale, movement, combat (both fire and bayonet) and range. Players are faced with the same tactical dilemmas their historical counterparts faced, though play balance depends entirely upon their own skill.&#10;&#10;The rules are a revision of the award-winning system developed by the Marshal Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic Battlefield. In-depth historical commentary is also provided. Les Batailles dans L'age L'Empereur Napoleon 1er is the only game series that can claim.... a Marshal's baton in every box!&#10;&#10;scale = 100 m/hex; &#10;time = 20 min/GT; &#10;strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls a city state and tries to be the first to have 16+ population and 10 monuments. This city state is destined to be a glorious power of the Ancient World!&#10;&#10;A game of Alba Longa offers a fine combination of dice selection, city management, and worker assignment (inside your own city), and is spiced up with the ingredient of city combat (soldiers and heroes)! Inside the box are three big variants &ndash; Assisi, A Job Well Done, and Spoils of War &ndash; which can be added and combined at your will and which add even more longevity to this game!&#10;&#10;In prototype form, under the name The Great Pyramid, this design was one of four winners of the 2009 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;, a design competition run by Centre National du Jeu in France. Here's what the jury said about the game: The Great Pyramid is rich with an astonishing number of possible strategies but manages to convey the clarity of the whole mechanism. The choices offered to the players are numerous and present a contentious interaction too rare in this kind of game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The greatest single sports show on earth takes place in South Africa this year (2010). The World Cup Card Game allows players to play through the whole tournament in around 75mins.&#10;The game consists of 65 cards. 32 of these represent all the national teams taking part. Another 32 cards are Action cards which are used to create the scorelines for each match. The final card is a summary list of what the Action cards can be used for.&#10;&#10;All the teams are randomly divided between the players. These are kept face-down on the table in front of the player until required.&#10;&#10;Each group is played match by match. The players controlling the four teams in Group 1: South Africa, Mexico, Uruguay and France now reveal those Team cards.&#10;&#10;Each team card is coloured according to the national football team strip, it also shows the national flag and a note stating their best performance ever achieved in any World Cup tournament. There is also a grey rectangle with the number of cards that team receives in the group stage - this is always 7 or 8. There is also a 2 Goal and 3 Goal symbol, sometimes covered by a cross. Any crossed symbol means that this particular team cannot use that type of card to it's full potential e.g, Argentina have the 3 Goal symbol crossed but the 2 Goal symbol uncrossed, therefore Argentina can only play a 3 Goal card as a 2 Goal card.&#10; The number of cards and the status of the 3 and 2 goal symbols distinguishes the better teams from the lesser teams. Brazil, for example, have 8 cards and no crossed symbols which gives them the maximum options; New Zealand have 7 cards and both symbols are crossed which gives them the fewest options. Despite the small difference between the various teams, the better teams generally have a better chance. However, the differences are not as great as in The World Cup Board Game.&#10;Play continues with the first group games being played in the order on the tournament format in the rules. The first game is South Africa v. Mexico, so each player controlling those teams play from 1 to 4 cards out of that teams' hand. The number of cards should be kept secret until both players have chosen, then they are both revealed. Goals are scored for that team in that match, Defences, Fouls and Offsides can reduce goals whereas Penalties and multiple Attacks add goals. Any spare Attacks and penalties require a card draw from the unused deck to see if they can be turned into goals.&#10;&#10;Each match is resolved in the same way. All scores from all games are recorded - best to use the pre-formatted scoresheet on the www.gamesfortheworld.co.uk/Downloads web page.&#10;&#10;The KO stages are played differently, more akin to the Board game. The Round of 16 is split into 2 sessions with 3 cards dealt to each player involved, irrespective of the number of teams. Cards can be played on any active team until the deck is exhausted and all cards played.&#10;&#10;From the Quarter-Finals onwards all games are played in each round simultaneously.&#10;Draws are resolved by card draws to determine if goals have been scored.&#10;&#10;Easy to play and a great sequel to the Board game.&#10;&#10;",

The presenter will be the director of the Orapamine, and the remaining players will become mineral explorers.&#10;The player who correctly identifies the positions of the minerals (Tangram pieces) placed by the director wins. Players take turns starting with the player seated to the left of the director, proceeding clockwise.&#10;&#10;Elastic Wave Shooting&#10;On the solution sheet, there is a grid of 10 x 8 cells. Choose one of the numbers (1-18) or letters (A-R) along the outer edge of the grid to shoot an elastic wave. The elastic wave travels horizontally or vertically from the fired position, bouncing off each mineral at right angles or horizontally and vertically until it exits the mine.&#10;The director must answer where the elastic wave exits and in what color. Upon hearing the answer, explorers record it on their solution sheets.&#10;&#10;Color of minerals&#10;In Orapamine, there are 4 types of minerals (red, blue, yellow, transparent) and petroleum (black). The elastic wave fired is white, but upon colliding with minerals of color, the color of the elasticwave changes. It can mix colors as it collides with multiple minerals.&#10;&#10;a. If the elastic wave collides with a red and blue mineral, it will come out violet.&#10;b. If it collides with a red and yellow mineral, it will come out orange&#10;c. If it collides with a blue and yellow mineral, it will come out green.&#10;d. If it collides with red, blue, and yellow minerals, it will come out black.&#10;e. A white mineral reflects the elastic wave without changing its color upon collision.&#10;f. Black reflects the elastic wave and does not change its path. &#10;The elastic wave does not bounce off but rather dissipates upon hitting it.&#10;The player who first correctly identifies the positions and colors of all minerals wins. Players can guess the answer even when it&rsquo;s not their turn&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

TCS 4.0 rules.&#10;&#10;The battle depicted here begins on D-Day +2, June 8th, and continues for the next 3 days and was known by the Germans as the First Battle for Caen. The situation unfolds with the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division dug-in on its D-Day objectives. Aware of the resounding defeat that the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered the previous day at the hands of the Hitler Youth, the 7th prepares a Fortress around Bretteville, Norrey and Putot. The soldiers of The Regina Rifles and The Royal Winnipeg Rifles, still under-strength from their D-Day losses, wait their turn for the inevitable encounter with the Grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division. The Canadian must hold their thin red line at all cost as failure to do so could result in a serious set back affecting the invasion time table and loss of the initiative to the Germans.&#10;&#10;This game is a balanced, one-map knife fight between the highly motivated 12th SS Hitlerjugend and the equally matched Canadians determined to preserve and expand their D-Day bridgehead.

    "Description": "Financial simulator.&#10;Players start the game by managing their corporations (1 of 4) and using them as a tool for increasing the value of private property (like countries in &quot;Imperial&quot;). By effective speculation on the stock market, a player may take control of more than one corporation. Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential.&#10;The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.&#10;&#10;THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR.&#10;Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&rsquo; plans.&#10;Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.&#10;&#10;Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.&#10;&#10;The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &quot;Imperial&quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.&#10;&#10;There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible. When an experienced player plays versus a beginner, he/she shouldn`t have a problem with it. Moreover, keeping control of the corporation is useful, because it is a way of generating money for the leader, although speculating by buying and selling shares is a bit more efficient. It is the best to go both ways at the same time, choosing and changing your engagement alternately.&#10;&#10;Well, it is also possible to play without any corporation and increase the value of private property only by playing as a stock market profiteer, but this way is recommended only for very experienced players.&#10;&#10;There is a fixed variant of playing 2 vs. 2.&#10;&#10;",

The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.&#10;&#10;Rules apply to either game:&#10;&#10;Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Adapted from the box:&#10;&#10;The game is a simulation of events within a conjectural future history in which telekinesis is used to move ships through space. It is played on a map which displays 74 star systems in a three-dimensional &quot;sphere&quot; of space measuring roughly 40 light years in diameter, with Earth's home system at the center. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position of pieces.  Pieces' exact locations are not known until they &quot;meet&quot; in the same three-dimensional &quot;hex space&quot;.&#10;&#10;The pieces in the game represent groups of four interstellar spaceships (StarForces) and space stations (StarGates). Each Player maneuvers his pieces (via Stellar Shifting) to engage those of the enemy. Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;Battles take place when units are in the same three-dimensional location.  In the Basic Game, the attacking Player compares the total variable strengths of the involved units and consults a simple probability table to determine the outcome of each battle.  In the Advanced Game, a small tactical maneuver map is used. When enemy forces engage on the main map, they are transferred to the tactical display. Here they move (in three dimensions), attack and defend using a fixed number of action points per tactical turn.&#10;&#10;Combat outcomes result in pieces not being destroyed but being &quot;randomised&quot;; usually to a location far from all the action.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with Outreach and StarSoldier. There are also special rules to use Starsoldier as a tactical game for StarForce.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ocean Crisis depicts a real life environmental disaster in which a million tons of massive plastic waste is poured into the ocean each year, causing ocean life to cease faster than ever before. Players are the defenders of the ocean and will do whatever it takes to stop the formation of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a.k.a., the Ocean Waste Island.&#10;&#10;On each turn, ocean waste occurs on rivers, along seashores, and within the ocean. All players co-operate and place their workers by choosing from two actions: waste clean-up or environmental activity. Roll a die to determine whether a piece of garbage is cleaned up, or place road tiles to launch an environmental activity. At the end of each turn, all garbage flows downstream along the river, and the ocean current board will spin randomly, bringing a piece of garbage from the ocean to seashores, or from seashores to the Garbage Patch!&#10;&#10;Environmental activities are mostly preventative measures, including adding a skill such as recycling or reusable products to a player, researching a certain type of garbage for waste reduction, or designing an ocean clean-up machine that can be sent out to clean ocean waste by itself.&#10;&#10;If players survive a six-turn bombardment of ocean waste without having the Great Pacific Garbage Patch form completely, the ocean crisis seems to be solved (for now), and players win the game together!&#10;&#10;Ocean Crisis also comes with six environmental side missions and scenarios for players to challenge, including dolphin rescue, sea turtle nesting, and shark defender, completing the full picture of ocean protection from an ecological point of view.&#10;&#10;",

There is a good chance that different players will emphasize different aspects of the picture in question. After the placement phase, the &quot;Gods&quot; try to detect the &quot;ignorant&quot; player, while the ignorant player tries to name the picture that was chosen. The right balance between keeping the imposter in the dark and not giving the regular players cause for suspicion has to be struck...&#10;&#10;",

This starter box has fixed content set that includes everything needed for two players to play the game: a force of Ultramarines, a force of Deathguard, Sidekick dice, Basic Action dice, and dice bags for both players. More than twelve characters appear in the set, including the Ultramarines Primarch Roboute Guilliman and Chief Librarian Tigurius, as well as the Deathguard heroes Typhus and Mortarion.&#10;&#10;",

Some want only to survive the night, while others wish to call forth an elder god eager to devour the players... or the world.&#10;&#10;Take on the role of an Archaeologist, Reporter, Warlock, or others as you race against time, and the other players to escape the manor with the most valuable relics. Beware that one or more of the players in the game may instead be working to awaken a cosmic Elder God to devour the world. When the games ends, at least one of you will be driven mad from the sights they have seen.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blocky Mountains is a dexterity game playable with 2-7 players in either a cooperative or with 2-4 players in a competitive manner or as a solo game. The core of the game consists of 3D landscapes that you build with large wooden blocks, after which you try to maneuver a large wooden pawn (&quot;the trapper&quot;) over this course.&#10;&#10;In competitive play, you want to be the first to reach the mountain summit on the score track (&quot;the route map&quot;), and to do so you must master several challenges. Each challenge consists of a parcours built out of the wooden blocks according to the challenge card you draw randomly from three piles: A - C, from easy to difficult. After having built the landscape course, you have to push, pull, lift, slide or swing the &quot;trapper&quot; from the start to the end block. This trapper has a metal eye on top, and you move it with a wooden rod with a hook at its end. Some challenges require an intermediate string between rod and pawn, while others require both hands to simultaneously move pawn and grizzly bear, the bear being another wooden piece. A third kind of piece to be moved is provisions, which you &quot;kick&quot; with the trapper.&#10;&#10;When you master the challenge, the next player decides whether to change to the next parcours or try to master the same one again. Depending on the difficulty of the challenge, your piece can move 2-4 steps toward the summit. If you lose track, fall down, or lose your provisions, you have lost this challenge and must move backward! The game includes other details &ndash; e.g., owls and squirrel tokens for managing your skills and special actions &ndash; but this is more or less the whole game.&#10;&#10;",

By mid-August the Russian offensive crests on the Oder River, laying siege to the fortress of C&uuml;strin. Force marching from Silesia through blazing summer heat, Frederick races to bring about a decisive battle. On 25 August near the village of Zorndorf 43,000 Russians and 36,000 Prussians fight one of the most savage battles of the war. For nearly 10 hours they hammer one another, yet by day's end neither army yields, despite staggering losses - nearly half the Russians and one-third of the Prussians were casualties. Finally, both armies limp away, each claiming victory: the Russians back into Poland; the Prussians to Saxony and a new Austrian threat.&#10;&#10;Zorndorf is the second game in the acclaimed Battles from the Age of Reason (BAR) series. The system presents a detailed simulation of warfare in the age of linear tactics. It is the framework through which players maneuver historic armies while seeking to discover which combinations of units and formations lead to victory, or are a formula for defeat.&#10;&#10;",

Choose from one of five villains, each with unique abilities and weaknesses. First, build a secret base by drafting from over seventy different rooms, such as a Robotics Lab, Massage Parlor, or Torture Chamber. These rooms will attract a motley assortment of henchmen to your lair:  Beasts, Criminals, Scientists, and Mystics. Want more brainy Scientists around? Build rooms that appeal to them (a Planetarium? or perhaps an Intrinsic Field Chamber?). In this way, each player will construct a unique secret base and recruit a unique crew of henchmen.&#10;&#10;Then, assign your henchmen to evil contracts posted around the globe. Become a local warlord in Asia. Steal a nuclear warhead in Europe. Build a floating fortress of doom in South America! Time, however, is a critical resource. The farther away a contract is from your secret base, the more weeks you spend and the fewer contracts that you'll complete in a round. Succeed at contracts to earn infamy and money. Fail, and your henchman might get injured, captured, or serendipitously gain a superpower.&#10;&#10;Build your secret base, recruit henchmen, and complete as many missions as you can. Along the way, hire mercenaries, hatch schemes, and chastise your lackey. Do so, and the history books will remember you as the best of the worst!&#10;&#10;",

But both types of magic are used to bind and banish the demons, imps, fey, possessed animals, and warlocks entering our world.&#10;&#10;Each witch starts with spells that they know, but throughout the game can gain corruption to learn new spells and get familiars and artifacts. But how they choose to use these new cards each hour &mdash; whether as Black or White magic &mdash; will determine the successful completion of the scene (mission).&#10;&#10;In this cooperative card game, each scene (mission) determines the goal of the game. If the scenes are played in order, they form a story arc, but you can play any scene in any order.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The map board depicts the northern half of the island including the fortified American positions around Butt's Hill. There are 64 America, British and Hessian combat units and leaders giving the game a counter density comparable to Saratoga in the series. Although the tactical situation is somewhat straightforward; Americans retreating and British pursuing primarily up two main roads, the nuanced play and game texture is like that found in all the games of the BoAR series.&#10;&#10;To ensure replay-ability, each player has a unique deck of 26 Opportunity Cards that either enhance his side or diminish the enemy. Cards are drawn at-start and occasionally throughout play as governed by the turn track. There are also mechanisms for card draw tied to accumulated casualties or the possession of terrain objectives. Players may also spend Momentum to purchase additional cards.&#10;&#10;The cards themselves may provide DRMs, adjustments to Army Morale, leader replacements, tactics advantages, step losses or step recovery, and additional units introduced into play among other outcomes. There is also the possibility of the game being extended one game turn into &quot;night&quot; wherein the British launch a surprise night attack. There are only a handful of Exclusive Rules to provide chrome including a squadron of British warships which may conduct off-shore bombardment. Players familiar with the core game system will be off and running in no time.&#10;&#10;As a bonus, volume 9 will include a second scenario; The Battle of Newport.  This hypothetical scenario features a second map board depicting the southern half of the island, the city of Newport and the British defensive works that surrounded it as well as the American siege lines. The French army is presumed to have stayed on the island to cooperate in a direct assault upon the town. It will make for a fascinating &quot;what-if&quot; study of the first attempt at cooperation in the war by Franco-American forces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battles of Medieval Britain covers battles fought between the year 937 and 1403. By modern standards, the forces on each side were small in size, but battles were fierce and bloody and were no place for the faint-hearted. In many cases the exact details of the battle have never been fully established, including what weapons were used, the scale of the armies on each side, and even exactly where the battles took place. The battles in this book are representations of the actual battles they depict, and in some cases deliberate changes or additions have been made to add to the play experience. But they will provide some idea of what happened at each Battle, and allow the Player to try to reproduce, or recreate, history.&#10;&#10;The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It provides plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and composition and location of reinforcements.&#10;&#10;This book is a solitaire wargame. You play the game, and the book will provide the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo;. You will need at least 4, but preferably 6, standard six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;In the game, the Player will be commanding various units, often representing many hundreds of men each, seeking to achieve various Objectives. Key battles from different years are included, although all fall into what is generally referred to as the medieval period. The Player will control various different armies and units depending on the battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": " Welcome to the Peanut Club!&#10;&#10;As a famous collector you're invited to a tremendous auction sale wich take place at the cross of disparate universes.&#10;Your goal is to leave the auction sale with the most beautiful collection of objects.&#10;&#10; How does it works?&#10;&#10;Peanut Club is a game based on a twisted bidding mechanism. &#10;To bid you have the choice between three currencies: Camels, Peanuts, and Million Dollars. The rate of each currency is randomly fixed but it may vary during the game.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player will choose a character card with their category symbol and will receive a random set of currency cards for a value of 35. Then, a first collection of 1 to 3 object cards to be sell is revealed and players begin to bid at the same time. Each object card shows the object itself and two category symbols from eight existing.&#10;&#10;The higher bid will win the collection as usual, but the players can use some powers during the bid. For example, they can change the rate of a currency, forbid to use a currency to buy a collection, or use the currencies they want to pay a bid. Of course those powers are one shot! Well, almost.&#10;&#10;After the winner of the first collection has paid their bid, they put the collection in face up in front of them and then the next collection is revealed.&#10;&#10; How does it ends?&#10;&#10;As long as there is still something to bid for and someone has currency cards in their hand, the auction sale continues. However when the auction sale is over the players count their victory points.&#10;&#10;For every 3 identical category symbols it's 3 points, for every Luxury, Antique and player's character category symbol it's 1 point, everything is cumulative. The one with the most victory points win the game.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10; Bienvenue au Peanut Club !&#10;&#10;En tant qu&rsquo;illustres collectionneurs, vous &ecirc;tes invit&eacute;s &agrave; une prestigieuse vente aux ench&egrave;res se d&eacute;roulant &agrave; la crois&eacute;e d&rsquo;univers h&eacute;t&eacute;roclites. &#10;Votre but, repartir de la vente avec le plus bel assortiment d&rsquo;objets.&#10;&#10; Comment &ccedil;a marche?&#10;&#10;Peanut Club est un jeu bas&eacute; sur une m&eacute;canique d'ench&egrave;re biais&eacute;e...&#10;Pour ench&eacute;rir, trois monnaies sont accept&eacute;es : les Millions de dollars, les Chameaux et les Cacahu&egrave;tes. La valeur de chaque monnaie est fix&eacute;e al&eacute;atoirement au d&eacute;but de la partie et pourra &eacute;voluer au cours de la partie.&#10;&#10;Au d&eacute;but de la partie, chaque jour re&ccedil;oit une carte Personnage avec sa cat&eacute;gorie pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielle et re&ccedil;oit al&eacute;atoirement des cartes Monnaie pour un total de 35 en valeur. Ensuite, un lot de 1 &agrave; 3 cartes Objet est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; et les joueurs peuvent alors commencer &agrave; ench&eacute;rir simultan&eacute;ment. On peut trouver sur chaque carte Objet l'Objet en question et les deux symboles des cat&eacute;gories auquel il appartient (parmi les 8 cat&eacute;gories existantes).&#10;&#10;Le plus haut ench&eacute;risseur remportera le lot comme traditionnellement, mais les joueurs auront quelques pouvoirs &agrave; leur disposition pour influencer la phase d'ench&egrave;res. Ils pourront, par exemple, modifi&eacute; la valeur respective des Monnaies, interdire l'utilisation d'une Monnaie, ou encore utiliser n'importe qu'elle Monnaie pour payer l'ench&egrave;re remport&eacute;e. Bien entendu ces pouvoirs sont limit&eacute;s &agrave; une seule utilisation... Enfin presque!&#10;&#10;Apr&egrave;s que le meilleur ench&eacute;risseur a pay&eacute; son offre, il place le lot d'Objets devant lui et un nouveau lot d'Objets est mis aux ench&egrave;res.&#10;&#10;Quand le jeu se termine-t-il ?&#10;&#10;Tant qu'il y a des Objets sur lesquels ench&eacute;rir et au moins un joueur &agrave; qui il reste de la monnaie, les ench&egrave;res continuent. Lorsque la vente est termin&eacute;e, les joueurs vont compter leurs points de victoire.&#10;&#10;Chaque s&eacute;rie de 3 symboles de cat&eacute;gorie identiques rapporte 3 points. Chaque symbole Luxure, Antique, et chaque symbole du type de votre personnage rapporte 1 point suppl&eacute;mentaire. Tout est cumulatif. Le joueur avec le plus de points de victoire remporte la partie!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The towers go up, the towers go down &ndash; that's the flow of the game in Ka-Boom, and whether you want the towers to stand or not depends on whether you're the master builder for the round or a saboteur aiming to cause destruction.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players lay out the 26 tower tiles, with one large tile in the center of the playing area and the remaining tiles placed randomly around it. Each tile depicts a stacked arrangement of blocks as well as a point value. On a turn, the master builder takes the sixteen tower blocks, flips the sand timer, then starts building whichever towers he wishes, with each tower being built on the tile that depicts it. Each other player is a saboteur and has 2-10 ammunition dice that she tries to shoot at the towers with her catapult (which is more like a tiny teeter-totter really). If she knocks over a tower, great! No points for the master builder, although he can use the fallen blocks to rebuild if time remains. If an ammunition die lands on a tower tile, the builder can't build on this tile; if he's started building on this tile but hasn't finished, he must stop and move elsewhere.&#10;&#10;If an ammunition die lands with the &quot;Ka-Boom&quot; symbol face-up, nothing happens. However, if a second die shows this symbol, the player who shot this die gets to slam her fist on the table once; if the ensuing earthquake knocks over towers, too bad for the builder. One player has a giant ammunition die, and this can cause an earthquake all on its own, but saboteurs can't cause more than one earthquake a round.  [Note:  The Blue Orange version of the game removes the earthquake mechanic and giant ammunition die.]&#10;&#10;When the sand timer runs out, the master builder claims any tiles on which he has correctly built a tower that still stands. The next player in clockwise order then becomes the new master builder. As soon as a player reaches 16 points, the game ends and he wins!&#10;&#10;",

Surrounded by natural beauty and gifted with tremendous intellect, the island's residents believed their peaceful lifestyle would go on for all time. But one morning, a fearsome demon broke free and began to drag the island into the depths of the sea. With the end growing near, the king ordered his most loyal retainers to gather as much of the nation's knowledge and as many of the island's treasures as they could, and flee to the northern lands.&#10;&#10;In Pralaya, your goal is to secure island relics and people and evacuate them&nbsp;from the sinking island.

    "Description": "Tough Calls: Dystopia is a narrative and argumentative game set in a series of post-apocalyptic scenarios like an alien invasion, the attack of colossal beasts that have emerged from the depths of the sea or even a drought that has almost completely desertified the planet, making water the most valuable resource.&#10;&#10;Each participant must build a character and try to convince everyone else on how to best manage and survive the adversities of each playthrough. The game's main mechanism is similar to a debate in which each player must confront different complications and events that may happen during a round, trying to find clever ways of surviving in order to prove to your fellow survivors that you are the best choice to lead the colony of survivors.&#10;&#10;Tough Calls is a board game that incorporates some aspects of role-playing games, where the competitive part remains in the background while the immersive and narrative part takes more prominence. This can be seen in the different roles that each participant will take, as well as the choice of the scenario and the unique story that players will tell. The sum of this makes it practically impossible to have two equal playthroughs.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Tough Calls es un juego narrativo y argumentativo ambientado en una serie de escenarios post-apocal&iacute;pticos que van desde una invasi&oacute;n alien&iacute;gena, el ataque de colosales bestias que han emergido de las profundidades del mar o incluso una sequ&iacute;a que ha desertificado casi por completo el planeta transformando al agua en el recurso m&aacute;s valioso. &#10; Cada participante construye un personaje que intenta convencer al resto de como sobrellevar del mejor modo las adversidades del escenario, y demostrar ser la mejor opci&oacute;n para liderar la colonia de sobrevivientes. El juego usa una estructura similar a los debates presidenciales, donde en cada ronda los jugadores deber&aacute;n responder a distintas complicaciones o sucesos del escenario, buscando conseguir los votos del resto. &#10; Tough Calls es un juego de tablero que incorpora ciertas din&aacute;micas de los juegos de rol, donde la competencia queda en segundo plano, mientras cobra m&aacute;s protagonismo la experiencia misma que surge en la partida. Tanto por los distintos roles que tomar&aacute;n los participantes, como por la elecci&oacute;n del escenario o los eventos que sucedan, es pr&aacute;cticamente imposible tener dos partidas similares con este t&iacute;tulo.&#10;&#10;&mdash;descripci&oacute;n de la editorial&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Between Timbuktu and Gao, Tuareg nomads are busy loading their camels with water, gold, rock salt and millet before making the seemingly endless journey to the next oasis. Whoever is able to arrive with the most valuable resources will garner the best profits. But it's not as easy as it first may appear as other Tuareg are secretly hiding their goods in caves and may steal away some of your business when they unexpectedly show up with goods that are more valuable than yours.&#10;&#10;Tuareg consists of two stages in which each player tries to gain a majority of the various resources. At the end of each stage points are awarded for a majority of a resource, as well as for strategically played special cards (donkeys, caves, thieves and maps).&#10;&#10;To set up the game, a number of special cards are laid out face up according to the number of players, and the top two resource cards are placed face up in the market. On a turn, a player can:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw three resource cards from the deck, placing one in the market and holding on to the rest (up to a maximum hand size of four, with excess cards also going to the market).&#10;    Load one of your camels with goods from your hand. Each camel can hold up to four cards, with at most two types of goods. Water can't be mixed with another resource, and a camel can carry no more than two gold.&#10;    Take up to four cards of the same type from the market and load them onto a camel following the loading rules.&#10;    Buy a special card for 3 dinars, paying for the cost by discarding cards from hand or the top of a camel's load.&#10;&#10;&#10;The special cards give you additional places to store cards (donkey or cave, each with different rules), a way to steal cards (thief) and a way to score bonus points (map).&#10;&#10;Once the resource deck runs out, players take one more turn, then sort their resource cards on camels and donkeys and in caves in piles of particular types; whoever has the most or ties for the most of a type scores points. Used special cards are returned to their stacks, and players can optionally cash in unused special cards for one point each (or two points for a map). Players then shuffle the resource cards and play a second stage following the same rules, starting with cards in hand from the first stage. After the resource deck runs out again, players score majority points and special cards once again. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This MB game comes with a plastic &quot;board&quot;.  Its size is dictated by the three randomizing discs embedded in its base, which are used to generate a new playing area every time (there are 1,728 (12^3) different setups possible).&#10;&#10;You buy properties, drill for oil, link properties with pipelines so as to collect royalties and try to be the richest player.  Event cards complicate matters.  Drilling is resolved with a little rig whose plunger is pushed up if it doesn't go through the hidden disc; if it pushes through all three, the well is dry.  Deeper holes cost more, of course.&#10;&#10;Pipelines can be bought once you have 4 producing oil wells on a property; they reach across that property's boundary to another player's property, and are used to siphon royalties from him every turn.  This is a clever mechanic that accelerates bankruptcy and keeps total playing time within reasonable limits.&#10;&#10;Once all players but one are pushed into bankruptcy, the remaining one is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On the morning of 4 June 1942, fifteen TBD-1 Devastator bombers of Torpedo Squadron Eight took off from the USS Hornet to attack the Japanese carrier force operating off Midway Island. All fifteen of them were shot down as they pressed their attack, yet not a single pilot veered away. While Japanese fighters slaughtered the low-flying torpedo planes, American dive bombers passed overhead and began their screaming dives onto the Japanese carriers, sinking three of them and dooming the Japanese Empire. The sacrifice had not been in vain.&#10;&#10;Both Japan and the United States had sought a final, decisive battle for control of the Pacific Ocean. When the Japanese unleashed their MI Sakusen plan to capture Midway Island in June 1942, the U.S. Navy was more than happy to meet them.&#10;&#10;Midway covers the turning point of the Pacific War, with 11 separate scenarios, or game situations. These include the Battle of Midway in June 1942, the Wake Island relief operation of December 1941, the retaliatory raid on Wake Island in February-March 1942 and Pearl Harbor. There are options to allow the Japanese to bring in the forces historically allotted to the Aleutian Islands campaign instead of Midway, and the American battleship force that was not risked there but was available.&#10;&#10;There are 210 &quot;long&quot; playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 280 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers.&#10;&#10;The United States has her entire early-war Pacific Fleet, from the dreadnoughts of Battleship Row to the aircraft carriers that saved the world from fascist-imperialist domination. Aircraft like the F4F Wildcat and B17 Flying Fortress are present, as well as the Devastator.&#10;&#10;The Japanese have their own battle line, headed by the incredible super-battleship Yamato. There's also the First Carrier Fleet of six modern first-line flattops, sporting the awesome Zero fighter and the famous Val and Kate bombers.&#10;&#10;The operational map depicts the seas around Hawai'i and Midway Island.The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship's capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.&#10;&#10;Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.&#10;&#10;The third game in the Second World War at Sea series of naval campaign games by Avalanche Press.&#10;Midway covers the Battle of Midway, the Raid on Pearl Harbor, the Invasion and potential relief of Wake Island and other early war situations in the central Pacific. The map includes Wake, Midway and the Hawaiian islands. The game includes 1/2-inch counters for aircraft, 1-inch counters for ships, a strategic map, a tactical map, rules and charts.&#10;&#10;Original production in 2002, re-printed in 2007 and again in 2014.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hey Waiter! is the first published design from Tichu fan extraordinaire Anthony Rubbo, and while it's not a trick-taking game, it is a game with tricky card play. Each player is a waiter trying to deliver his stack of dishes before anyone else, with the dishes being represented by a stack of colored chips on a face-down card.&#10;&#10;Players each have a hand of cards, a few of which might be special action cards while the majority will be divided into two narrow rectangles. To play these cards, the player chooses two cards and uses the right half of one card and the left half of the other. Thus with a handful of cards, each half of a card can be combined in up to a half-dozen ways. The cards let you take actions like moving a token from one stack to another, with the primary action being to deliver food. When you deliver a dish, however, everyone with that type of dish on top of his stack gets to deliver it, so ideally you can first place a token on the opponent&rsquo;s stack in order to lock down that dish.&#10;&#10;You can also split your stack into two or more stacks, thereby giving you more opportunities to deliver dishes &ndash; but doing so reduces your hand size and limits the chances that you'll be able to do what you want!&#10;&#10;",

And even if they do not run a race, they gladly demonstrate acrobatic exercises or set up themselves in marvelous pyramids.&#10;&#10;After the board has been constructed, players' take turns rolling a special die numbering 1-4 and moves his pig based on the number he rolled. If a black number is rolled the player may get to take another turn. If you land on the same space as another pig you now move with the bottom piglets piggyback style.
