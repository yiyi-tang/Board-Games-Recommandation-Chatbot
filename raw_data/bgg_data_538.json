Each module describes the units and other components needed to play the module.&#10;&#10;Warp Empires modules are generally played on a map composed of irregular areas or territories. Counters are used to represent units, items, and control markers.&#10;&#10;Card play is central to the system. One or more Action Decks are used in each module. Action Cards are played to move units or stacks. In addition, some Action Cards provide benefits in combat.&#10;&#10;Victory conditions generally involve controlling a certain number of territories or destroying all opposing forces, as specified in the individual Warp Empires module.&#10;&#10;The following games use the Warp Empires system:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Babylon 5 Empires&#10;    Conquest of Demara&#10;    Dark Sun Empires&#10;    Doctor Who Empires&#10;    Doom Trooper Empires&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Empires of Mystara&#10;    Europe at War&#10;    Federation&#10;    Land War in Asia&#10;    Lord of the Abyss&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Middle Earth Empires&#10;    Scortch&#10;    Space 1889 Empires&#10;    Star Wars Campaign&#10;    Union & Confederacy&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Warcraft Empires&#10;    War Hammer Space Empires&#10;    War of Independence&#10;    Warp Hammer Empires&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Square tiles are place in 2&times;2 plots that are arranged on a 4&times;4 grid (except for one pair of opposite corners that start with just 3 tiles). The Builder tries to build up two-story &quot;houses&quot; (2&times;2&times;2), while the Destroyer tries completely demolish buildings in order to create empty plots (2&times;2&times;0). On each turn, the players select from a menu of five tile placement/removal options:&#10;&#10;     1-1-1-1-1 (one at each of five different plots) Note: If and only if each player has claimed six plots, meaning only four plots remain unclaimed, this option becomes 1-1-1-1.&#10;     2-1-1 (two at one plot; one at each of two others)&#10;     2-2 (two at each of two plots)&#10;     3-1 (three at one plot; one at another)&#10;     4 (four at one plot)&#10;&#10;&#10;However, after each player has taken one turn, only three are available on any turn, because a player cannot pick a set that has been selected in the previous two turns. Once a plot is completely built or torn down, it is claimed by a player.  The first player to claim one of the following wins the game:&#10;&#10;     four plots in a row (orthogonally or diagonally)&#10;     four plots in a 2&times;2 square&#10;     four more plots than his opponent&#10;     a total of seven plots&#10;&#10;&#10;",

They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.&#10;&#10;",

Snakes are built in various colors, and body sections can be added that match. Players can catch snakes that have a head and at least two body parts, but longer snakes are worth more points. So the idea is to wait long enough to get good points, but not so long that someone else catches the snake you've been building up. The first player to catch a snake gets the &quot;snake bracelet&quot;, and they wear this until a snake of a longer length is caught. The person wearing the bracelet at the game's end gets bonus points in addition to their snake points.&#10;&#10;",

A pack of Chipsmore cookies comes with 3 different random cards, which are in both English and Malay.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to play all your cards. All players start with the same number of cards. There is no limit, except for the minimum of 6 cards. The core game is in the Action Cards, which you use to ask your opponents to do various physical actions, e.g. hopping on one foot.

    "Description": "Mingle - Dice of Diction&#10;Dice of Diction is the slogan that appears on the box top of this made-in-Malaysia letter-dice game.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 8 letter-dice, each letter having its own point-score indicated next to it. There is also a 3-minute sand-timer and a pad of scoring diagrams for players to use.&#10;&#10;Two games may be played with this set (and one of these two games may itself be played in two ways).&#10;&#10;Mingle-Crossword makes use of the scoring diagram - each player gets one sheet of score pad with a 17 X 17 square grid on it (and space for writing down the scores). Each turn, the 8 dice are cast and the timer started. Players then have until the timer runs out to form a word using two or more of the eight letters showing. This first word must cover the centre square. Play continues, with each player forming words that intersect crossword-style with existing words on their own diagram. The diagram contains shaded squares that when used result in double or quadruple letter scores or double or quadruple word scores. After a fixed number of words (say 25), players total up their scores and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Mingle-Listing is simply a game of anagramming letters that come up on the eight dice when thrown. The first way to play is simply to throw the dice, set the timer going and for each player to list out as many words as he/she can. The player who lists the most words, wins. The second way of playing is to have players take turns to state a new word that can be formed from the dice. When a player cannot state a new word, he/she loses and drops out. The remaining players cast the dice again and play continues until only one player remains.&#10;&#10;This game is probably no longer in print as it is not mentioned in SPM's current website.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Heineken Spin-sation! Game was used as a premium gift in a marketing campaign by Heineken in Singapore during the Christmas season (17 Nov to 21 Dec) in 2007. People who bought Heineken beer gained points and these points could be exchanged for premiums like T-shirts, bags, sound speakers, calendars and this game.&#10;&#10;The game itself is completely random. Players spin a cardboard wheel affixed to a board; the board also has spaces to place 4 stacks of cards. Depending on which segment on the wheel ends up next to where the picture of the beer bottle is pointing, the player who spun the wheel draws a chance card, which gives the player positive or negative points. The card may also have instructions or forfeits for the player to follow.&#10;&#10;The four types of cards are:&#10;&#10;1) Let's celebrate cards&#10;These all give the player +40 points. There's also a date of some festival on the card with some advice for the player.&#10;&#10;E.g. +40 points. February 5th (2008) Mardi Gras, New Orleans. Don't come back without some beach.&#10;&#10;2) Oops! cards&#10;These all give the player -10 points and have an action for the player to carry out.&#10;&#10;E.g. -10 points. Collect an Oops! card from every girl.&#10;&#10;3) Spin-sation! cards&#10;These all give the player =10 points and have a forfeit for the player to perform.&#10;&#10;E.g. -10 points. Tell a joke that no one in the room has heard before.&#10;&#10;4) Heineken cards&#10;These all give the player +20 points and have an action for the player to carry out (always a good thing).&#10;&#10;E.g. +20 points. Take 3 Heineken cards from the player on your right.&#10;&#10;The game ends whenever any stack of cards on the board is used up. Players then tally their nett scores and the player with the most points wins. The player with the least number of points has to perform the Ultimate Forfeit (sic), which the winner decides.&#10;&#10;",
