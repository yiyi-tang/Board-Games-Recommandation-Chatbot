However, if you can successfully acquire angel cards under certain conditions, you can recover your life points. The game ends when even one player has 0 life points. Wonder how to avoid getting devil cards.&#10;&#10;",

Henry's daughter, Empress Matilda, believed she should rule by succession. However, the late king's favorite nephew, Stephen de Blois (&quot;blue-a&quot;), was quicker to the throne, and with the help of his brother, the Bishop of Winchester, was crowned king.&#10;&#10;Those loyal to the empress were enraged by Stephen's coronation and would not accept him as their new ruler. Over the next eighteen years, England saw a breakdown in law and order as civil war spread throughout the country. This conflict came to be known as &quot;The Anarchy&quot;...&#10;&#10;In The Anarchy, players take on the role of English nobles loyal to King Stephen. Over five rounds, players must build their domain, defend their castle from attacks by the approaching Angevin armies, and storm strongholds loyal to Matilda with their own crafted siege weapons. The player who can accumulate the most bravery, loyalty, influence and might &mdash; while avoiding discontent &mdash; will prove to King Stephen they are his most loyal ally, thereby earning his largest earldom.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fictionary is a game played with a dictionary. Each player takes two sheets of paper.  One will be used for definitions, and each player writes their name on top of it; the other will be used for guesses.  One of the players takes the dictionary and looks for an obscure word that they think none of the players will know (i.e. eguzla, exarch or jabot).  That player spells out the word and announces what kind of word it is (verb, name, adjective, etc).&#10;&#10;Each player must now imagine and write down a plausible and convincing definition for this word.  The player with the dictionary writes the true definition.  When all players have written their definition down, the player with the dictionary takes all sheets, shuffles them and reads aloud all the definitions.  If necessary, definitions may be repeated. Each player apart from the announcer must then write on their guess sheet who, in his opinion, has written each definition.&#10;&#10;When all players have written their definitions, the player with the dictionary unveils the truth and tells who wrote what.  Each player scores:&#10;&#10;     2 points if they chose the dictionary definition&#10;     1 point for each other player they correctly identified&#10;     1 point for each player who was tricked into thinking their definition was the dictionary's one&#10;     If no one guessed what the true definition was, the player with the dictionary scores as many points as there are players.&#10;&#10;&#10;When all players have scored their points, the player with the dictionary gives it to the player on his left.  Play goes on until each player has had the dictionary once or twice.&#10;&#10;Fictionary is also described at Wikipedia.&#10;&#10;Balderdash is a popular commercial version of this game&#10;&#10;",

This was a good thing, for you drew solar power from the ten suns, making you invincible.&#10;&#10;Alas, a mortal hero called Hou Yi appeared and began shooting the Suns down one by one with his golden bow. With the demise of each Sun, your power fades. You realize your seat of absolute power is at risk. In order to stay at the top, you must quickly form alliances with the Gods, build grand palaces in your name, influence lands to worship you and repel mythical monsters to gain prestige - all before the suns disappear forever! Welcome to Ten Suns!&#10;&#10;This is a 'blind bidding' game that revolves around the legendary archer from China, Hou Yi, who shot down 9 Suns and saved China from scorching heat. Players are Primordials who draw their energy from the 10 Suns. Before the Suns all disappear, players rush to gain enough prestige to secure a permanent position among the Gods. The game features famous locations in China like the Great Wall, Xi An, and many others. It also features other Gods and legends of ancient China, including Chang'E and the Jade Rabbit.&#10;&#10;At the start of every turn players have a specific amount of energy to bid with, towards an ever-changing pool of cards known as the Mortal Plane. This amount is equal to the current number of Suns in the sky. However each time Hou Yi appears, more Suns will be shot down and players will have lesser and lesser energy to bid with. Players can tap on other forms of energy, such as Lunar energy from the moon, or other Gods - basically engine building.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "They say the town of Wode Ridge has been cursed ever since Amos Wode founded the place way back in the 1800s. The sleepy, Colorado tourist trap looks plum peaceful in its postcards, but there&rsquo;s a darkness about the town you can&rsquo;t quite put your finger on. Some even say the town has an &ldquo;other side&rdquo; where the crazy roams unchecked, but I can&rsquo;t speak much to that.&#10;&#10;By the 1980s, things had gotten especially weird--at least until a bunch of kids started snooping around trying to get to the bottom of the town&rsquo;s supernatural goings-on. While the adults were worried about their Tupperware parties, these youngsters were out tracking down clues and finding trouble before it found them. And rumor has it they found some kind of creature in the woods too which might explain all them FBI fellers around here asking questions.&#10;&#10;And here they come now, riding around town on their bicycles. I just hope they figure things out soon. Looks like some kind of dark cloud is rolling in right behind them.&#10;&#10;Overview:&#10;Take on the role of a group of kids and their newfound alien friend, and explore Wode Ridge looking for evidence of the town&rsquo;s supernatural happenings. But be wary, the Darkness knows you&rsquo;re on to it, so it&rsquo;ll be trying to get you before you get it. Find enough evidence to figure out what monster is currently ailing the town and then defeat it before time runs out and the Darkness overtakes you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Fratricide is one such issue that is included in the game mechanics and discussed in the historical notes included with the game.&#10;&#10;The game box is rather heavy because of the historical notes included with the game.

It depicts James Graham, the Marquis of Montrose, and his legendary string of victories over the Scottish Covenanter government during the First English Civil War (1642-1646), that would later go down in a crushing defeat. The Royalist player must recruit a Highland army and either replicate Montrose&rsquo;s victories or march into England. The Covenanter player must overcome factional infighting to defeat Montrose. Both sides must manage the tendency of conscripted units to disband after every defeat or victory.&#10;The game uses a modification of the Hand of Destiny series rules. Each player has a unique set of campaign cards generating historical events such as defection, plague, and the terrifying Highland charge, all of which affect recruitment, movement, and combat. Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical procedure in which units take turns attacking one another.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once the symbols of a group match one or more enemy cards, the player can send this group to battle to win them. The group is then discarded.&#10;&#10;On their turn a player can either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play one companion card to one of their groups and, if possible, attack.&#10;    Start a new group and, if possible, attack.&#10;    Draw one card from the deck.

    "Description": "Face your rival in a simple, smooth, cool and relaxed way. Pichenotte Hockey is a surprising dexterity game for 2 players.&#10;The goal of the game is to bring the puck (blue disk) in the opponent&rsquo;s net by ricocheting the red disk against the puck. If the puck is behind all the discs it can be directly flicked forward.&#10;To win, you need precision in the angle and in the strength of the shot and sometimes a little luck!&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;The first player to score three goals wins !&#10;&#10;The idea of Pichenotte Hockey was to make a simple, unifying and accessible game for all. Pichenotte Hockey is a unique product with a sleek design, designed and manufactured in Quebec.&#10;We&rsquo;ve managed to create a very simple flicking game on a board that has the exact proportions of a Hockey rink. &#10;The three rink formats are respectively 1/100, 1/150 and 1/200.&#10;An elastic circles the game board around to hold the pieces of the game and serves as a seat to the board on a table.&#10;A precise laser cut and engraving offers a perfect smooth finish to the curves of the wooden board.&#10;The perfectly finished wood provides a smooth contact between the disks and the surface.&#10;The three format of Pichenotte Hockey are lightweight to facilitate transportation and storage. &#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;The game can be hanged on any wall or left on a table ready to play for hours of fun!&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Le Grand Empire simulates the Napoleonic wars from 1800 to 1815 at a strategic level. Two maps cover Europe and North Africa from Caucasus to Ireland and from Sweden to Egypt. 780 counters personify land and naval units as well as every corps-commanding leader of that time. The combat units are army corps and fleets, and sometimes entire armies. Their content varies with the player&rsquo;s will and the contingencies of that era; Guard, line infantry, Elite, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, militia, Cossacks, and so on. The game turns are season-based and interactive, including a variable number of impulses. A budget phase occurs every fall.&#10;&#10;The game can involve two players (one French and one anti-French), or five players (France, Great-Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria), or even seven players (Spain and the Ottoman Empire have their own player). Of course, victory conditions vary accordingly.&#10;&#10;The operational part of the game points out the importance of leadership and line of communication; attrition can be very high. Evasive actions and interceptions lead to the deployment of armies followed by battle. Battle occurs in the same hex; troop quality, tactical choices and leader values are taken into account in the issue of the battle.&#10;&#10;At the strategic level, the players are responsible for their unit&rsquo;s production and maintenance. Diplomacy is the key point in creating alliances with other powers, major or minor. Moreover, many random events improve the Napoleonic flavor of that time.&#10;&#10;The overall purpose of the Grand Empire is to provide a strategic Napoleonic game that takes into account historical, military and diplomatic sights, and that can be played in a short period of time (one year is four turns and can be played in two hours) with a reasonable amount of rules.&#10;&#10;Contents :&#10; * Two maps&#10; * 3 countersheets (260 double sided counters each).&#10; * one rulebook and one scenarios booklet.&#10; * 2 dice.&#10; * Tables and charts&#10;&#10;",

The citizens - united in an anti-fascist front - prepared to resist, barricading themselves the neighborhoods of Oltretorrente and Naviglio.&#10;&#10;Una Vittoria Impossibile: Le Barricate di Parma del 1922 (&quot;An Impossible Victory: The Parma Barricades of 1922&quot;) tells the story of those days of resistance. You will lead the people of the city in repelling the attack of the fascist squads.&#10;&#10;Only by cooperating with each other, providing for the needs of the city and by building barricades to repel the fascist squads you can hope to achieve an 'Impossible Victory,' to be consigned to history and legend.&#10;&#10;",

With two players, one takes on the role of General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, while the other player assumes the role of General George C. Meade, commander of the Union Army of the Potomac.  With more players, each assumes command of one or more corps.  According to the publisher, the game is most enjoyable with between four and six players.&#10;&#10;While not overly simple, the game is not complex, and experienced wargamers will have little difficulty with the mechanics of play.  There are six scenarios, including a campaign scenario that simulates all three days of the battle.  The publisher suggests that the four-turn &quot;Assault on the Round Tops&quot; scenario be played first in order to become familiar with the game turn sequence and the line-of-sight rules.  Depending on the scenario selected, playing time is between 2 and 18 hours.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Assault on Gallipoli is a two-player strategic wargame that covers the key battles of the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915. The first edition of the game sold out in December 2022. A second edition was published by Hexasim in 2024.&#10;&#10;One player controls the Australian, New Zealand and British forces (ANZAC player) while the other controls the Ottoman forces (Turkish player).&#10;&#10;Each turn represents one day, units represent battalions, companies and individual ships. Players take it in turn activating groups of units in an area. Once they are activated to move, fire or dig a trench, the units are flipped over to their Exhausted side. At the beginning of each new turn they are flipped back to their Fresh side.&#10;&#10;Game design by Kieran Oakley and Russell Lowke. Game art by Jose Ramon Faura. Rules editor and TableTop Simulator module by Rolf Grein.&#10;&#10;HISTORICAL BACKGROUND&#10;&#10;After months of stalemate on the Western Front, the British and French decided they would open a second front by attacking Germany&rsquo;s ally &ndash; the Ottoman Empire. In March 1915 they sent a fleet of battleships through the Dardanelles in an effort to reach the Turkish capitol, Constantinople, and force the Ottoman government to surrender.&#10;&#10;However, the Dardanelles were well defended by forts and sea mines and the Allied fleet suffered heavy losses. The naval campaign was abandoned until the forts could be captured by amphibious assault.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) sector of the campaign; thus, it does not cover the British and French landings at Cape Helles or Suvla Bay.&#10;&#10;The board presents one of the narrowest sections of the Gallipoli Peninsula, from ANZAC Cove to Mal Tepe and Khetia Bay. The ANZAC goal was to capture this area and cut off the Turkish forces fighting the British and French at Cape Helles further south.&#10;&#10;The heights of Chunuk Bair and Mal Tepe were considered especially important because they provided observation of both sides of the Peninsula. From here the ANZACs could capture the forts which dominated the Narrows and thus allow the battleships of the Royal Navy to sail up to Constantinople. At least that is what was supposed to happen.&#10;&#10;In fact, the British commanders had seriously under-estimated the Turkish resistance. The Turkish soldiers were veterans of the Balkan Wars, armed with modern, German-made rifles and artillery. Inspired by the leadership of Colonel Kemal and Lieutenant Colonel Sefik, they stopped the ANZACs in their tracks. The ANZACs only managed to establish a small beachhead, which was repeatedly counterattacked by the Turks.&#10;&#10;In August 1915, the British and ANZACs made another attempt to seize the ridges of Sari Bair. The New Zealanders and Gurkhas managed to capture the heights for two days but were eventually overwhelmed by Turkish counterattacks. In December, after eight months of fighting, the ANZAC forces were evacuated.&#10;&#10;In the words of Australian war correspondent, Charles Bean: &ldquo;ANZAC stands for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance that will never admit defeat.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;So what went wrong?&#10;&#10;To quote the 'Gallipoli 1915' Facebook page: &quot;At Gallipoli, inexperienced troops, led by untested commanders, supported by staffs that had yet to learn their jobs were sent with wholly inadequate artillery, ammunition and logistical support to perform one of the most challenging operations of war: an opposed landing on an enemy shore. Add in the nature of the terrain and we can begin to understand how it was that 4,000 Australians landing that early morning of 25th April 1915 were held up by a force that, initially, numbered only around 80 Turks.&quot;&#10;&#10;Lest we forget.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player moves one Boomer in a straight line on the game board grid, moving it as many spaces as they wish. After this, he may use this Boomer and one of the opponent's Boomers to place cornerstones on the game board; these cornerstones are placed on the intersections where these two Boomers would meet, should they move toward one another. (If one of the Boomers couldn't reach an intersection point due to another piece being in the way, that cornerstone is not placed.)&#10;&#10;Chains of cornerstones form borders on the game board, and at some point these borders will close off certain areas from the rest of the game board. If Boomers of only one color are in an area, this area/homestead belongs to the owner of those Boomers.&#10;&#10;The game ends once all Boomers have their own homestead.

    "Description": "&quot;Revolution Road&quot; presents the first two conflicts between Britain and her American colonials in 1775 which ignited the American Revolutionary War. Two complete games are included, BOSTON TO CONCORD and BUNKER HILL. These are fast, tense battles. Card driven, area movement, low counter density, quick play and simple to learn, all make REVOLUTION ROAD a wonderful introduction to the American Revolution and to war-gaming. Its wealth of historical information makes it an ideal teaching tool.&#10;&#10;Although the scale between the games is decidedly different the same rules apply with only slight differences. BOSTON TO CONCORD is a game of maneuver, very chess-like. For the Patriot player it involves alarming the countryside with night-riders, mustering militia and trying to fend off the best infantry in the world. For the British it is playing hide and seek with Patriot Arms caches as he ferrets out Sons of Liberty troublemakers and then tries to make it back to waiting reinforcements as the Patriot forces grow to unmanageable size.&#10;&#10;Bunker Hill is a different animal altogether, a basic slug-fest. The Patriot player faces a growing tide of redcoats who threaten to overwhelm his defense works on every turn. Patriots face disappearing ammunition, flanking, panic and optional rules for alternate British landing sites. As casualties mount historic leaders try desperately to rally their men and bring about the miraculous result reflected upon by British General Henry Clinton when he declared &quot;It was a dear-bought victory; another such would have ruined us.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Specifically, this game includes the invasion of Tinian, Engebi, Parry, Eniwetok, Guam, and Angaur Island as part of the U.S. goal of establishing bases that would allow American bombers, for the first time, to launch within range of the Japanese home islands.  Accordingly, the Japanese intended to deny the islands to the Americans, or at least make cost prohibitively expensive in terms of lives, as well as buy Japan as much time as possible to allow the Japanese home islands to be continually strengthened and fortified for the inevitable invasion that the Japanese leadership anticipated.&#10;&#10;Forgotten Pacific Battles, while developed as a solitaire game, it can be just as easily played as a two-player game, using the standard Fire &amp; Movement (F&amp;M) rules and a series of exclusive rules covering each scenario.&#10;&#10;There are individual scenarios for the islands of Engebi, Eniwetok, Parry, Guam, Tinian and Angaur. Each scenario can be played separately or as part of two different campaign games.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: variable from 1 to multiple days&#10;    Hex: 0.3 miles / 500 meters for all scenarios (except Guam 1 mile / 1.61 kilometer)&#10;    Units: Platoon to Battalion&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;    One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 16-page rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 30 minutes to 3 hours&#10;&#10;Published in &quot;World At War&quot; magazine issue #71 (April/May 2020)&#10;&#10;",

You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the 40 scenarios.  Design is by Panzer Grenadier veteran Mike Perryman (Workers and Peasants among many others).&#10;&#10;In this game the German Army wields new weapons for its long-planned offensive. Panther tanks, Ferdinand tank destroyers, Goliath explosive tanks and more are in the German arsenal. The Soviets counter with masses of the excellent T-34 medium tank, plus Lend-Lease Churchill tanks, T-70 light tanks and much more.&#10;&#10;There are four semi-rigid mapboards, just like those found in August 1914 or 1940 - The Fall of France. Plus 517 scorchless and sootless playing pieces. And 40 scenarios.&#10;&#10;This game and its companion, Kursk - South Flank are exactly the games for which the Panzer Grenadier series was intended. These are the ultimate tank battles that every Panzer Grenadier player will want to fight.&#10;&#10;",

Since there are only 24 nests, the center of the board is left empty.  The 5th color of each stash is used for caps (generally black, the opaque color).  The players move caps to cause eruptions to capture pieces, but also have the option each turn to execute a Power Play: return a previously captured piece to the board.  The game ends when one player has captured 3 monochrome trios--that player wins.&#10;&#10;Although Caldera originated as a variant of Volcano, its &quot;Fiesta Caldera&quot; variant is now the canonical version of Volcano.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dawn of Battle is a hex-and-counter wargame allowing players to refight historical battles from roughly 1500 BCE to 1500 CE or 3000 years of combat. Players take the roles of the great commanders of history, including Xerxes, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Saladin, and William Wallace.&#10;&#10;The game system is straight-forward and action-packed, as players depend upon the quality of their army&rsquo;s leadership to provide activation points allowing them to maneuver their armies and strike against the enemy. The better an army&rsquo;s command, the more flexibility it has to move, rally, and attack.&#10;&#10;Also included are supplementary rules that cover free deployment in scenarios, barbarian charges, command control and impetuousity, elephant panic, and random events.&#10;&#10;Each of the twenty included scenarios indicate the disposition of each army that engaged at that historical battle. Units include a variety of infantry types (including hoplites and the Macedonian phalanx), cavalry (including chariots and mounted archers), missile units (including slingers, longbows, and even early gunpowder weapons), and special units such as elephants and war wagons.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s primary engine is comprised of an action deck used to determine command, the randomly determined outcomes of actions, and melee combat. Additionally, action cards provide special effects that players can use to enhance their units&rsquo; abilities as well as the narrative of the gaming experience. The action deck provides a unique means of resolving a battle in an experience that will never be duplicated.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

These include mandatory offensives and the loss of Soviet momentum, Stavka reserves, German Superiority rules that ebb away with Soviet victories, and the counterbalance of Von Manstein in securing German reinforcements against the wilder impulses of the Fuhrer.&#10;&#10;The game has many characteristics similar to other hex and counter wargames, but it also has notable differences such as the highly variable effects of weather, the absence of zones of control when moving, and the importance of nearby HQs for keeping units in supply. Combat is very punishing for both sides, reflecting the terrible attrition witnessed during the battles of this campaign. It rewards careful positioning to take advantage of breakthroughs, and the use of support counters at the right time.&#10;&#10;The full campaign will take several hours to complete, but the shorter scenarios can be played in an evening. The game is also very suitable for solo play and online play using Vassal.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rules: &quot;For decades, reporters from around the world have been on the hunt for the Loch Ness monster.  But lately reports of sightings of Nessie have been increasing.&#10;&#10;&quot;Such reports naturally have drawn such reporters as the attractive Belinda Viewing from New York, the half-Belgian Claude McMirror, the clever Filosa Sharp, as well as her Londoner competitor Jack Nesstee, and even Nils the Blitzen from Denmark to the Loch.  Equipped with the most modern equipment and techniques, these daring reporters have traveled to Scotland, in order to capture the elusive Nessie on film for their newspapers.&#10;&#10;&quot;But the 5 will experience some surprises . . .&quot;&#10;&#10;In Loch Ness, players compete to get pictures of Nessie.  In turn order, players place or move their photographers on the board as they try to anticipate the movement of the Loch Ness monster.  The movement of the monster is determined randomly by drawing move cards from the first three players, each card having a number from 1 to 5.  The cards are not revealed until after the photographers have been placed.  When they are revealed, the monster moves the total number of spaces and players score points based on the value of their photographers placed in the area where Nessie emerged.  In addition, the players whose photographers were directly in front of Nessie select photo cards that will award points at the end of the game, especially if sets are created.&#10;&#10;Beginning in the second round, players will select an action space each round that gives them a unique power to use for for the round.  Placement also gets more challenging from the second round onward as a player is required to move a photographer, perhaps opening up spots for opponents.  Each round, some of the players do have a limited knowledge of how Nessie will move each round.  When a player draws a movement card before positioning his photographers, he is allowed to look at it, giving him one-third of the movement for that round.  However, movement varies tremendously and only three players draw movement cards each round.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the round in which a mini Nessie figure reaches space 65 on the score track.  This figure moves the same number of spaces as the main Nessie figure in the game board each round.  The player with the most points, scored during the game and from the photo cards at the end, wins the game.  The rules include two optional variants that can be added individually or together with the base game.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with the 2010 Walter Obert game with the same theme, Loch Ness.&#10;&#10;",

It is played in rounds of 12 points and the first side to take two rounds wins. For each hand, players are dealt three cards from a French 32-card deck. A hand is initially worth one point, but the active player may propose a raise in stakes before answering each trick. A hand is won by taking the majority of tricks or by making the opponent(s) fold to a raise. Only ranks of cards are important in Le Truc, not suits. If two cards of the same rank are played in a trick it is &quot;spoiled&quot; and not counted for either side. The first trick of a hand is particularly important, because it acts as a tiebreaker when both sides win an equal number of tricks.&#10;&#10;There is a Brazilian variant know as Truco that also includes a card value to have higher in-game value than others. This value changes at each trick by drawing a card.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player takes two actions (possibly the same action twice) from this list of options:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a land tile adjacent to any existing tile.&#10;    Place a worker adjacent to any of your workers already on the game board.&#10;    Move one of your workers to an adjacent empty space.&#10;    Jump an opponent's worker and land on an empty space, removing that worker from play.&#10;    Remove two of your workers from the board to remove an opponent's worker from any space.&#10;    Remove two of your workers from the board to place one of your workers in any empty space.&#10;    Remove one of your tower layers from the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;If at any time during play you have a circle of six of your workers surrounding an empty space, place the first layer of one of your towers in that space. Your ring of workers must remain in place for two additional turns for the remaining two layers to be added to the tower; if your ring is disrupted, you can complete it later to continue the tower-building. If you completely surround an opponent's tower, you can remove the top level of that tower from the board.&#10;&#10;In addition to building three complete towers, a player can also win by eliminating all of the opponent's workers from the game board.&#10;&#10;",

In medieval England times are hard, and to feed your family you will be forced to trek into the countryside, where you hope to slay the mysterious beasts that seem to be plaguing the tiny town of Hamlet. You have heard tales of the wretched creatures regurgitated from the Hamletsmaw, and though travellers shout of their horror, they also whisper through drink-numbed lips of the treasures that may be found within their guts.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is simple; be the player with the most loot once every player is dead. The journey there is not such a simple one though.&#10;&#10;Each round of gameplay consists of a day and night phase. Creatures are drawn from a deck and placed in a grid at the centre of the table, where during the day players will choose which to face. Many things will affect the outcome of this combat, such as ammunition type equipped, creature health, defence, and number of attacks, and player health and items. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, and if the player survives they may receive a loot reward. These rewards can be sold for gold, crafted into better items that will be worth more in the future, or eaten to stave off death.&#10;&#10;While players have control during the day, once the sun sets and night settles across the land, the creatures in play will follow them back to camp, setting upon the doomed adventurers. No loot can be won during the chaos of night, leaving survival the only reward to a successful defence.&#10;&#10;At the same time, all players are competing to become the richest hero, so back-stabbing, betrayal, theft, and murder will be in abundance. The most important thing to remember is that death is inevitable, so take joy in your friend's suffering, and race to meet them on the other side!&#10;&#10;",

Providing service to Antwerp, linking international markets, fostering the steel industry in Luxembourg and obviating the Albert Canal are important features to this game. The late appearance of electrified railways has a big impact. For 3-5 players, one needs a copy of the Avalon Hill 1830 game to provide the trains and tiles, although 4 special tiles are provided with 1834. The player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

You and your friends pit your imaginations against each other as you dream up ways to overcome unlikely challenges (...now an eerily well-coordinated horde of angry jelly fish begins to rock the boat until it tips precariously from side to side...) with an even unlikelier set of resources (...and all you have is an ice axe, ten coconuts, a set of snow tires, one pound of leg hair, and a complete collection of Hitchcock films).&#10;&#10;In each round, the players are all presented with the same challenging situation, but each player has different objects that they can use as their resources to resolve the situation. Each player comes up with a story about how they'll solve the situation using exactly three of the five objects in their hand, and then everyone takes a turn pitching their story to a judge. A winning story is selected, a new player becomes the judge, and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;",

As an important urbanist, compete against other players to build the best districts of Chang'an and to get the favors of the court.&#10;&#10;Players will carefully project their plans by placing cards on the top part of their personal boards (the gates). Then they will move them into the city districts to build amazing buildings and to welcome influential characters in the neighborhood. Every new card built into the districts will provide players with different types of privileges and a certain number of victory points.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you perform only one of the three main actions: research, play and/or move cards on the gates to produce resources and activate character effects, or build.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player gets nine or more cards built in the districts of their City board (cards at the gates are not considered).&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points will be declared the best urbanist of Chang&rsquo;an.&#10;&#10;",
