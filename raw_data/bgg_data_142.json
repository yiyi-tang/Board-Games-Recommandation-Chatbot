    "Description": "A board wargame of the European and North African theaters in World War II. The War (&quot;TW&quot;) is a hex-and-counter strategic-level game which aims to provide the challenge of a monster game with the ease of play of a moderate complexity war game. Experienced players should be able to play a campaign game in a weekend.&#10;&#10;The game includes several scenarios designed to be fun, challenging mini-games in their own right, each playable in an afternoon. An array of variants and optional rules offers enough scope to make TW most replayable.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Compass Games website)The War: Europe 1939-1945 (TW) is Compass Games&rsquo; new WWII strategic level game combining all the best features of the genre into an intuitive, challenging new game. While offering all the expansive features of the WWII Monster Game genre (such as U-Boat warfare, diplomacy, espionage, strategic bombing, jets, rockets and numerous variants for each Major Power), TW also offers tremendous scope in its 12 scenarios (see below).&#10;&#10;Although not a card driven game (and thus a good candidate for solitaire play), TW includes card play for the U-Boat War, Strategic Bombing, Espionage and Counter Espionage and naval warfare. The cards add elements of bluff and surprise more traditional hex-and-combat-table games cannot. But they&rsquo;re optional, so TW can be played solitaire in a way CDG&rsquo;s and block games cannot. Between two (or more) skilled players, no two games are ever likely to be the same. For multiplayer games, up to five gamers can play Campaign Games as Italy, Germany, France, the U.S., Britain and USSR.&#10;&#10;For the hard-core military and naval history buff, TW addresses the details of WWII strategy: what if the Germans really built the carrier Graf Zeppelin; what if Mussolini had upgraded the quality of Italian forces; what if Stalin hadn&rsquo;t shot many of his best generals during the purges; what if the U.S. had entered the war earlier&hellip;or later; what if the British had been able to mobilize the Empire and the Dominions more effectively; what if the U.S. had developed the atomic bomb early enough to use in Europe, and so on.&#10;&#10;Although the game is the result of extensive research by its designer, TW isn&rsquo;t a simulation and isn&rsquo;t intended to be. It&rsquo;s a &quot;gamer&rsquo;s game&quot; with quick, user-friendly combat systems on land, in the air and at sea. Veteran gamers familiar with classic WWII strategic level games should pick up the game very quickly. For new recruits, the short scenarios teach the basics, but can be played as stand-alone games in their own right. Both realistic and playable, TW should present a rewarding challenge for any WWII strategy game buff.&#10;&#10;Scenario List for The War: Europe 1939-1945:&#10;&#10;    1939 Full War Campaign&#10;    1941 Campaign&#10;    1942-43 Turning Point Campaign&#10;    Poland 1939&#10;    Norway 1940&#10;    France 1940&#10;    Barbarossa 1941&#10;    North Africa 1941-43&#10;    The Atlantic Lifeline 1939-45&#10;    Bolshevik Hordes 1944-45&#10;    Regia Marina&#10;    D-Day to VE Day 1944-45&#10;&#10;&#10;Complexity: High (about 8 out of 10)&#10;Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Good&#10;&#10;Designer: Ernie Copley&#10;Developer: Paul Shackleton&#10;Artist: Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    2 maps&#10;    9 full sheets of 5/8&rdquo; counters&#10;    Approximately 20 full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cards with various displays, tracks, reminders, tables, charts, worksheets, etc.&#10;    1 rules booklet&#10;    1 scenario booklet&#10;    1 deck of variant cards&#10;    2 dice&#10;    1 full color box and lid &ndash; the big 3&rdquo; deep box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

These cards include icons representing different treasure items. Whoever first notices which icon is repeated the most times on these revealed cards needs to name this item out loud; if they're correct, that player collects all of the cards played by the players. If more than one icon is present multiple times, then the player who grabs the chest first gets the cards.&#10;&#10;Dragons are sometimes hidden in the graphics of the cards. When one of those cards is revealed, everybody needs to put their hand on top of the shield. The last one to do so must pay all of the cards they have collected so far that include the symbols indicated in the dragon's card. However, that player can avoid making this payment by producing a chicken card since dragons love chicken and are happy to forfeit all treasure as long as they can get a tasty meal.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever has the most treasure cards in their stash wins!&#10;&#10;",

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.&#10;&#10;From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).&#10;&#10;It works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.&#10;&#10;",

Also, the peace negotiations which followed the war revealed deep underlying tensions between the Americans and their European allies; some of the more paranoid came to believe the next war would be between Europe and America.&#10;&#10;U.S. Navy Plan Gold is based on these plans. American officers believed the seat of conflict would be the same as that of the undeclared naval war against France in the 1790s: the Caribbean Basin.&#10;&#10;U.S. Navy Plan Gold includes the ships projected by the Armee Navale but never built due to the Washington Naval Treaty: the large Gilles and Durand-Viel battle cruisers, Normandie and Lyon class battleships, and the very odd &ldquo;croiseur de combat&rdquo; battleship/carrier design. And of course the Americans receive a number of new ships, such as the &ldquo;alternate Omaha&rdquo; large scout cruiser design.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Napoleonic 20 #18&#10;&#10;Following his failed invasion of Portugal in 1810, French Marshal Andr&eacute; Mass&eacute;na fell back into Spain with Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese Army in cautious pursuit. Assuming the wretched state of the French would allow him time to capture the key border fortress of Almeida, Wellington settled in for a leisurely siege. But Mass&eacute;na quickly reorganized his forces and advanced on the British positions in an effort to resupply the beleaguered fortress.&#10;&#10;Advancing on Almeida on 3 May, 1811, Mass&eacute;na encountered Wellington's army in strong defensive positions along the Dos Casas River. Heavy fighting erupted, with the British barely managing to hang on to the key terrain. The next day, Mass&eacute;na scouted the area and discovered that the British right was dangerously weak; that evening he conducted a daring night march that put strong forces into position to roll up Wellington's flank. When the French attack struck on the morning of 5 May, the British right nearly collapsed, and only the sacrifice of the British cavalry and heroic performance of Craufurd's Light Division barely managed to save the day. The savage nature of the fighting and the peril to the British position was revealed in Wellington's statement after the battle, &quot;If Boney had been there, we should have been beaten.&quot;&#10;&#10;Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro 20, by designers R. Nicasio Garcia and Jack Gill, allows players to examine this tension-filled battle of the Peninsular Campaign, fought along the Spanish-Portuguese Border. Featuring the same system as GMT's popular &quot;Fading Glory&quot; game, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro 20 has low unit density (20 pieces or less on the game map) and modest complexity. The game focuses on dramatic, fast-playing turns and creates a strong historical narrative through the use of random event cards and the tracking of army morale providing a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of Napoleonic grand battle. Lead your troops forward into action to see if you can break your opponent's morale at bayonet-point before he puts your army to flight.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 7 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 division, each hex is 1 mile from end to end, and each turn roughly 3-4 hours of real time.&#10;&#10;",

The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated or could have participated.&#10;&#10;Two games included in this issue are: BUDAPEST 1956, covering the ill-fated rebellion in the Hungarian capital in late 1956; and BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA, the clashes between Cuban and South African mechanized forces in Angola in 1987 and 1988.&#10;&#10;There are two players in each game. In BUDAPEST 1956 one player controls the Hungarian Rebels and possible NATO &quot;what-if&quot; reinforcements, the other controls the forces of the Warsaw Pact. In BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA one player controls the South Africans and their UNITA allies, the other the Cuban and MPLA forces.&#10;&#10;In the Budapest game each hexagon on the map represents half a kilometer across, and each game turn represents one day. Soviet maneuver units are mostly battalions, with regiments for their artillery and assault guns; Hungarian rebel units are ad hoc groups; and NATO intervention, when playing that special alternative history scenario, are represented by US &quot;Pentomic&quot; battlegroups.&#10;&#10;In the Angola game each hexagon on the map represents eight kilometers across, while each turn represents anywhere from one week of intensive combat to four weeks of refitting. Units on both sides are mainly battalions or equivalent groups of irregulars.&#10;&#10;The game system is low-complexity (totaling about 13,000 words) and compares to the one used in last year's Middle East Battles: Suez &#039;56 &amp; El Arish &#039;67. There are 280 NATO-style (with some iconic) half-inch counters. Playing time between two experienced opponents of roughly equal skill levels will be about three hours per game. Designed by Joseph Miranda.&#10;&#10;Cold War Battles: Budapest '56 &amp; Angola '87 was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #235.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On 9 September 1940, the Italian 10th Army marched across the Egyptian frontier with visions of Roman glory quickening their step. Six months later, General Erwin Rommel would push German troops to restore all that the Italians lost, and then capture those parts of Egypt that were part of the original Axis plan. The British and their Commonwealth allies recovered and twice forced Rommel back to his starting point. The armies of both sides maneuvered and intertwined in ferocious battles at soon to become famous locations, including Tobruk, Gazala, Halfaya Pass, Buq Buq, El Alamein and others. The pace of mechanized warfare would sweep the Western Desert no less than 5 times in what would be defined as the most elastic theater of operations in WWII, where supply drove the tempo, and the open flank beckoned one more offensive!&#10;&#10;Desert Victory: North Africa, 1940-1942 is a low-complexity, high-detailed wargame set in eastern Libya and western Egypt during the formative years of WWII. Following on the heels of Battle for Kursk: The Tigers are Burning, 1943 found in C3iNr34, it is the second volume of the C3i Combined Arms Series and uses many of the same mechanics. In DV players manage their supplies and maneuver their forces to achieve victory in a game where both sides rapidly switch between offense and defense. Not familiar with the Western Desert campaign? No problem, as the Turn Record Track shows exactly what happened historically, allowing players to learn history and compare their game progress to actual results. Of paramount importance is the capture of coastal towns that allow a side to move their Supply Head forward to enable more efficient movement and combat. Furthermore, displacing an opponent&rsquo;s Supply Head may frustrate their plans and capture much needed fuel. Supply, reinforcements, and replacements are all set at historical levels, and it&rsquo;s up to the players to assess the correlation of forces and decide the opportune moment to press forward in search of the elusive automatic win; can you formulate a plan to achieve Desert Victory before your offensive power expires?&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Units: Brigade, Division or Corps &#10;Map: 1 Hex = 25 miles &#10;Turns: Quarterly Turns (three months per turn)&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 3 hours&#10;&#10;",

The game also includes dissertation cards that show various combinations of cards: numerical straights of length 5, 7, 9, and 11; three pairs; four pairs; three- or five-of-a-kind; and so on, with multiple copies of some dissertations. Players are dealt 3-5 cards based on player order, with everyone then discarding down to three cards in hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, take one of three possible actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Research: Either draw two cards, add one to your hand, then discard the other; or add the top card of the discard pile to your hand.&#10;&bull; Present a dissertation: Take cards from your hand that satisfy the requirements of a dissertation, then place those cards on display in front of you, placing the dissertation on top. You can claim a specific dissertation at most once.&#10;&bull; Conduct a peer review: Select a published dissertation (from any player) that has two or more cards underneath it, then add one of the cards to your hand. If a dissertation has only one card underneath it, the paper has been accepted and (1) it is now worth points for its author and (2) it can be cited by future dissertations.&#10;&#10;How do you cite an accepted dissertation? You present a new dissertation and pretend that the card under the accepted dissertation is one of the cards that you played; you can cite multiple cards in a dissertation, but you must play at least one card from your hand. For example, you can play two pairs of cards from your hand, say 3s and 8s, then &quot;cite&quot; a 6 from one of your accepted dissertations and a different 6 from another player's dissertation. You'd then claim the &quot;three pairs&quot; dissertation and place only the 3s and 8s underneath it. When you cite another player's dissertation, you must give them a card from your hand &mdash; ideally something useless! &mdash; as a thank you for their previous work.&#10;&#10;Accepted dissertations are worth 1-9 points, and when a player has 15+ points, the end of the game is signaled. If this player has any cards in hand, they claim the &quot;end flag&quot; dissertation that's worth 1 point, then place one card from their hand underneath it. (If they have no cards, the game end is still triggered; they just miss out on the bonus point.) Continue play until each other player has completed two turns and the person who triggered the ending has completed one turn. The player with the most points from accepted dissertations wins; in the event of a tie, the tied player with the fewest accepted dissertations wins.&#10;&#10;",

Fueled by booming exports of grain, cattle, coffee and rubber, Brazil and Argentina saw their economies grow rapidly and at one time both stood among the world's ten wealthiest nations.  All that cash led their leaders to seek the prestige symbols of the day: dreadnought battleships. Argentina, Brazil and Chile all built dreadnoughts just like the Great Powers, but none of them ever fired a shot at a foreign enemy.&#10;&#10;Cone of Fire is a boxed game for both the Second World War at Sea and Great War at Sea series. The fleets of Argentina, Brazil and Chile plus those of Peru and Uruguay are added to both series, along with ships from Germany, France and Britain. Most of the scenarios, or game situations, are based on hypothetical situations arising from the actual war scares between the South American nations and sometimes European interlopers, and the war plans with which they addressed them.  There are also scenarios based on the actual conflicts which took place in South American waters: the hunt for Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee's German cruiser squadron in 1914, and the hunt for the cruiser that bore his name 25 years later.&#10;&#10;Alongside the ships actually operated by the South American naval powers, there are also ships they ordered and did not receive, or contemplated but did not order. The Brazilians have several projected classes of battleships that they never completed, as well as the modern warships they sought from the U.S. Navy during World War II. Argentina and Chile have their projected battleships, carriers and cruisers as well. And there are the actual jet aircraft flown by Argentina and Brazil.&#10;&#10;There are six maps, three at Second World War at Sea scale, and three at Great War at Sea scale. These cover the region from south of Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the Americas, to well north of Rio de Janeiro. There are huge stretches of ocean as well as the narrow, winding channels of the Chilean coast.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's OGRE implemented in Diceland!&#10;&#10;The game consists of one 4-inch die (the Ogre Cybertank) and a set of 16 smaller dice representing lesser units. One side plays the Ogre; the other side picks 30+X points of units, where X is the cost of the smallest unit.&#10;Each turn (starting with the non-Ogre player - call them the Defender), the player may either activate a die on the table or throw a new die onto the table and immediately activate it. Each die has 8 sides with variable levels of attack and defense, as well as special powers. Facing matters when attacking, but range only matters if one potential target is closer than another.&#10;When a die attacks: if its Attack value is greater than the target's Defense value, the target die is destroyed and the player scores its point value. If the Attack Value is lower (even an Attack of 1 agains the Ogre's 40+), the target shifts one side (effectively losing 1 of its 1d8 hit points).&#10;Instead of attacking, a die can move, rotating on its edge for a better firing position or to expose a better face. The Ogre can both fire and then move, making it hard to kill.&#10;If the Defender can get several dice on the table, they have a Command Post which can activate every die, bringing the Ogre down quickly. The Ogre also has a 'systems card' like the old Steve Jackson game, allowing its weapons and treads to be attacked.&#10;The winner is the first to score 50 points; the Ogre is worth 50 points and the Command Post isn't worth any (destroying it is not the goal).&#10;&#10;List of Diceland sets and armies&#10;&#10;Related to the Game: Ogre / G.E.V..&#10;&#10;",

With 5150 you&rsquo;re only limited by your imagination. If you can imagine it you can do it.&#10;&#10;5150 provides a changing universe to campaign in. Not only your actions but also the actions of those beyond your control help shape your life.

Gain experience and skills as you successfully move through the galaxy. Find friends; make enemies, its all there in 5150. As time passes challenges change and it will take a combination of tactics and strategy to succeed. And a little luck won&rsquo;t hurt either!&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;ve played Chain Reaction: Fast and Furious Firefights 2.0, All Things Zombie, or Nuts! to name a few the mechanics in 5150 will be familiar but if you haven&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t worry. 5150 is a stand-alone game, easy to learn and fun to play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "To celebrate King Louis' birthday, royal p&acirc;tissiers are busy preparing macaron gift boxes for the royal family and guests. At the end of the celebration, the p&acirc;tissier who has made the most boxes will win and become the most prestigious p&acirc;tissier in France &mdash; so you must be watchful for dark currents underneath the cheerful p&acirc;tissiers and colorful macarons as an allergen might slip into your box and ruin the pastry. Are you ready to make some macarons?&#10;&#10;In the 1-5 player trick-taking game Macaron, players are French p&acirc;tissiers preparing macaron gift boxes. In every game, a number of rounds will be played, and each round ends when thirteen tricks have been played or a player has prepared at least eight boxes. Players receive victory points (VPs) at the end of the round based on the number of boxes prepared.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck will contain 5-7 suits of macarons based on the number of players, and these macarons are put together into 3-4 groups, e.g., almond and pistachio are in group A, while strawberry and blueberry are in group B. Each round, one group will be determined to be &quot;royal&quot;, and the 1-2 suits in that group are trump for the round. In addition, one flavor (not group) of macarons will be the allergen for the round.&#10;&#10;Standard trick-taking rules are used, with the leading player being allowed to play anything and with other players needing to follow suit. Whoever wins the trick scores 1 box &mdash; or 3 boxes if the trick was won with a 1. If a trick contains an allergen, then no boxes are scored, except if the trick also contains a 2, which negates the allergen. Players track boxes won on a scoring track, and they also use this board at the start of a round to bet on the number of tricks they expect to win, with players winning or losing points based on how well their bet matches reality.&#10;&#10;Macaron lasts a number of rounds until someone passes the VP threshold established at the start of the game. The solo rules have you compete against an AI player, Emma, who follows particular rules for deciding what to play.&#10;&#10;",

You need to &#239;&#172;&#129;nd the tastiest food, but watch out for dangerous predators that hope to eat you! Play your cards carefully, escape from the tigers, and keep an eye on the sky in case a vulture is watching you &ndash; after all, little animals make a great dessert!&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical deck of 22 animal cards; at the start of the game, players shuffle their decks, then draw six cards as a starting hand. Someone shuffles the plant deck, then lays out plants until at least one (regular or famine) card is available for each type of plant and at least 3-7 plant cards are available (with the number depending on the number of players).&#10;&#10;Each turn the starting player lays down two cards &ndash; one face-up and the other face-down &ndash; then each other player does the same. Players then reveal all their cards and work their way down the food chain: Bats attack herbivores, weakening them and making them eat more slowly; snakes scare away the strongest animal; elephants, tigers, buffaloes and monkeys then eat (one card) in order of their strength, from high to low; elephants eat nuts, or bananas if no nuts remain; tigers eat the highest-valued buffalo or monkey; buffaloes eat herbs, then bananas; monkeys eat anything but prefer bananas; warthogs eat last but consume two items; the animal young copy the animal they're played with and eat at the same time; vultures feed on buffaloes and monkeys that are forced to eat famine cards &ndash; or any such animal that fed. (They're not that choosey, really.) Animals can also be played in matching pairs, which prevents them from being eaten but restricts them to only one food card.&#10;&#10;After the round ends, each player draws two more animal cards from his deck, the plant selection is replenished, then a new round begins, with the player who ate first in the previous round playing first now. As soon as players have only four cards in hand or the plant selection can't be refilled, the game ends, and the player with the most food points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Le Mans offers the choice of twelve different car specifications that detail the number of spaces the car travels in each gear and which gears the cars can safely negotiate turns.  Also, the different car types have different braking characteristics.&#10;&#10;The game includes two tracks printed on the same board, Monte Carlo and Le Mans.  Each track is only two lanes wide, and the spaces on the track are only a half-car-length, so a car takes up two spaces at once.&#10;&#10;The cars move in order of track position. Each turn, a car may either remain in the same gear, shift up one gear, or shift down according to the car's specifications.  It must then move the exact number of spaces required by the particular model of car in the specified gear.&#10;&#10;When cornering, if a car exceeds the gear specified for the particular model of car, it must &quot;take a chance.&quot;  The driver must roll the die to determine if the car safely cornered, spun out, crashed, or damaged the car such that a pit stop is required.  If a car spins out, a &quot;wet track&quot; marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.&#10;&#10;If a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.  Collisions require that the involved cars make a pit stop for repairs.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include guidelines for slipstreaming, over-revving to move an extra space, and details of team, solo, and timed play, and &quot;Le Mans-style&quot; starts.&#10;&#10;The game is a revised version of Wright-Mudge Enterprises' Grand Prix: A Sports Car Racing Game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "World War 2 was the largest and most violent extended naval war in history. From September 1939 until the surrender of Japan, the high seas were a global battle zone filled with mighty battleships, nimble cruisers, silent hunters, and flat-tops bristling with planes. Before our eyes, we witnessed the changing of warfare on the high seas as the thunderous old guard fell to air power and submarine Raiders prowled the open waters and the carrier showed its true diversity and adaptability.&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder not only allows players to re-create the Atlantic or Pacific theaters of the war but to see how challenging the entire picture was for their leaders. How do you protect a globe from German raiders? How desperate was it for Britain when France fell and they were left to fight Germany and Italy alone on the high seas? What is the right balance for the Soviet fleet split between four distinct fronts (Baltic, Black Sea, Arctic, and Pacific)? If the Mediterranean force weakens for the allies, from where do they draw ships? Does Japan strike quickly or play for attrition when they arrive on the halfway point? Will America fight in two fronts, three, or four?&#10;&#10;In Seas of Thunder, players will experience the tension of too much sea to cover with too few ships, the frustration of being caught unprepared, or the intensity of a vital stand contesting a high-value sea area. Victory is neither sudden nor guaranteed. In each battle, a flight of Catalinas, the lack of ASW, the improper distribution of air power, or even a missing minesweeper could be the difference between success or failure.&#10;&#10;What's in the Box&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder may not have every ship in the conflict, but it has the ones you know.&#10;&#10;1 Mounted Map (Double-Sided with pre-Pearl Harbor scoring on one side and post-Pearl Harbor scoring on the other)&#10;&#10;1200+ Combat Ship counters (Capital ships down to Destroyer Squadrons, Submarine Grops, and Mine-sweeping Flotillas)&#10;&#10;132 Convoy &amp; Utility counters&#10;&#10;14 Port Cards (1 per side for each of 7 scenarios)&#10;&#10;Combat Sequence Cards for tracking combat&#10;&#10;Plus sundry dice, rules, scenario details...the usual.&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder is every bit a full-force strategic-level representation of the conflict on the high seas during World War 2. Players have to manage a global disposition of their warships with frequently too much ocean to cover and not nearly enough ships to cover it.&#10;&#10;Each nation has access to the historical ships that sailed in the conflict. Each country's fleets have advantages and disadvantages that are unique to them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The object is to make your theater the most spectacular in the city by booking the greatest and most diverse roster of acts that you can find (and afford!).&#10;&#10;You win the game by having the highest score on the Success Track, which represents public approbation and goodwill. While money is an important part of running a successful theater, there've gotta be easier ways to make a living than dealing with a never-ending procession of ventriloquists, jugglers, and trained animals! No, you're in this business because greasepaint is in your blood, and you can't imagine a world without limelight.&#10;&#10;In each of four turns, players bid on the right to select acts first and place those acts in their theaters. After your theaters are booked, you tally up scores to see who was the most successful. Good shows will drive up the reputation of your theater and influence the popularity of the types of acts that you book, but a flop can always set you back!&#10;&#10;",

But the place is already occupied by lost souls which have been in confrontation for ages. The Standish cannot escape from this haunted house and will be the collateral damage of the conflict.&#10;&#10;In Phantom, the four areas of the house &ndash; Garden, Basement, Ground Floor and First Floor &ndash; are placed in a line, with the areas divided into two sides. Each player controls Ghosts in half of the house, and he must make Spectres, Souls and other Spirits appear in front of the different areas of the house in order to frighten the Occupants before the other player. Each turn, a player can play a card &ndash; Ghost or Place &ndash; in order to increase the Scare level of his corresponding apparition; each Place card must be played in front of its corresponding area(s); for example, the Attic must be played in the First Floor,while  the Stairs can be played either in the First Floor or in the Ground Floor. (Note: In Europe, the first floor is customarily the initial floor above ground level, while in the U.S. the floor at ground level is the first floor.)&#10;&#10;The Ghost cards can be played in front of any areas. Each of them creates a special effect:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Squatter takes a Place from the opponent's apparition.&#10;    The Charmer makes an Occupant come in the area.&#10;    The Howler puts Occupants off the area.&#10;    The Knocker discards a Ghost from the opponent's apparition.&#10;    The Queen takes a Ghost of his family from the opponent's apparitions.&#10;    The Invoker gets a Ghost back from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;&#10;Unfortunately for you, the adults of the family can kill off some vulnerable Ghosts, and a family of Ghosts is vulnerable to each of the adults. Some Places protect the Ghosts from the adults.&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, the Scare level of the apparitions in the different areas are compared to the Fear threshold of any Occupants located there. When a player's Scare level is higher or equal to the Fear threshold of an Occupant who is alone in the corresponding area, this player takes this Occupant and wins the corresponding Victory points. After his turn, the player draws Ghost/Place cards until he has five cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Each adult is worth 3 victory points (VPs), each child 2 VPs, the baby 4 VPs, and the Priest adds 1 VP to the last Occupant of the house. As soon as a player has collected 11 VPs, the game ends, with him as the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sealion: The German Invasion of England, September 1940 is a wargame that simulates a hypothetical German invasion of England in late 1940 (circa September) and assumes that the Germans had achieved air superiority over the Royal Air Force. This game incorporates an unabstracted level of detail and, therefore, both air and naval operations, as well as all facets of land operations (operational and strategic). While it is to be assumed that the British had already lost the eponymous Battle of Britain, the RAF is not completely out of the fight just yet, and the Royal Navy still presents a credible threat to the Germans&rsquo; amphibious landings and supply conduits across the English Channel. On the ground, the Germans have operational superiority, but the British Army can rely on their interior lines of communication and defensible terrain, including a crude network of hastily constructed fortifications that had been built before the invasion.&#10;&#10;Components: 22x34 inch map, 280 die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;World at War #52 - February-March 2017 issue.&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the dice cards, then deal two to each player. On a turn, a player plays one die card (which shows values from 1 to 6), then either starts a new row of cards or adds to an existing row.&#10;&#10;&#10;    To start a new row, take the card showing this number from the display and place it in front of you; when starting a row, you can choose to play both die cards instead of only one.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    To add to a row, add the die value played to the number on the top card of one of your rows, then take this card from the display.&#10;&#10;&#10;If another player has used a desired card in one of her rows, steal it from her row and use it for yourself. You can have at most three rows in progress. At the end of your turn draw back up to two die cards.&#10;&#10;When you play a die card to place the 40 card on a row, you then score the row, earning one point for each card in the row plus one point for each star on cards in that row. Record this score on paper, then return these cards to the display.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player scores 30, 35, or 40 points, with this total being dependent on the number of players: 2, 3, or 4.&#10;&#10;",

First you roll for ranged attacks and compare rolls to your DF string.  Each roll that meets or exceeds a number of the string hits so it possible to score multiple hits with one combatant.  The defender then gets to fire back in the same manner.  After DF is resolved you go to Close Combat.  Close combat is handled much the same way except you also have a blocking string so it is possible to block hits.&#10;&#10;Special mention must be made of the artwork on the cards.

Let's have flowers on the mountain and sheep at the houses, while laying rails to link people in villages with the most prosperous village being named after the flower Alpenzian.&#10;&#10;Alpenzian is a reimplementation of the game Sunflower Valley, with this re-design originating from the Japanese publisher's discussions with designer Wouter van Strien. In addition to changes in the components, such as an original die with icons and different player sheets with new patterns to allow players to adjust the balance of the game, the gameplay has changed, with updated scoring rules and added variant rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;In more detail, Alpenzian incorporates dice-drafting and drawing systems into a fun game. Draw pictures on your player sheet according to the icons on your chosen dice rolls, and gradually build up your village with flowers on the mountains and rails linked all over the place. After all the players have filled their player sheets (i.e., their villages), they tally their score, which depends on the combinations of icons.&#10;&#10;Aside from the score, it is most important for each player to complete and build their wonderful village. You are free to draw however you like, according to each icon. Let's see how you can build your one and only village creatively!&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#143;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#148;&#186;&#10;&#233;&#157;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#232;&#138;&#177; &rdquo;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&rdquo; &#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#146;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#186;&#147;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#178;&#180;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#143;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#10;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#190;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#183;&#154;&#232;&#183;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#10;&#232;&#177;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152; &quot;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Patrons are placed and move through the park based on ride exits, and each patron generates money for the different ride owners. Using the unique abilities of rides and park improvements, players move patrons, block exits, and most importantly, add danger in the form of vomit, pests, flooding, electrical failure, and more in order to influence die rolls. High rolls show satisfaction and keep patrons on rides. Low rolls create additional danger and force patrons out to other rides. Additionally, insurance policies can be taken to benefit from certain poor outcomes, encouraging direct sabotage for profit. When the park finally closes due to poor quality, rides closing, or patron injury, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Take the biggest risk, snatch the biggest reward, and get away with it in Danger Park!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

After these are revealed remembering that players cannot duplicate a card played by someone previous, players move forward down the road. Each of the cards allows for a certain number of road tile placements from your supply, a number of maneuvers per turn, and the damage your current speed will inflict should you careen into another car. Additionally, a percent of the tiles have special actions associated with them, which give the car on them the ability to jump, or hit a semi-truck, or skid out of control, or just plain slow down 'cuz there's a Smokey comin' on his flipside... The game is over when a car reaches the edge of the table, which gives the game a variable ending.

    "Description": "&ldquo;Sixteen Thirty Something&hellip;&rdquo; is a game based on the changing political and military situation during the early Seventeenth Century, the time of the Thirty Years War. It deals in an abstract manner with the formation of factions, campaigns, warfare and internal power struggles.&#10;&#10;As a player you take on the role of leading one of the new financial dynasties that arose during that time, with a portfolio of investments across the continent and some influence with the Crowned Heads of Europe. You and the other players use your influence in different nations to sway the Crown into taking action that you hope will improve your fortunes or perhaps hold back your competitors.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;112 Cards&#10;154 counters&#10;Game Board&#10;Rules&#10;You will need some 6 sided dice, preferably 4 although you can get away with just 1.&#10;&#10;The Files section contains a revised and downloadable version 2 of the game, with pdf files that will allow you to print out and assemble the complete game for yourself.&#10;&#10;",

This fast-paced word-building game uses &quot;SmartLink Technology,&quot; which allows the five electronic tiles included in the game to &quot;talk&quot; to each other. When the Scrabble Flash tiles are lined up to create a new word, the tiles will light up and beep. Scrabble Flash tiles also keep time and score. This groundbreaking technology allows players to compete individually against the game and try to earn the highest score possible.&#10;&#10;Three unique games can be played with Scrabble Flash. In the &quot;Flash&quot; game, players try to find as many three- to five-letter words as possible using the letters shown on the tiles. Five seconds are added to the play clock for every five-letter word formed. &quot;Five Letter Flash&quot; has players rushing to find the one five-letter word that uses the letters shown on the tiles. The game continues if the correct word is unscrambled. Play Scrabble Flash with a group in &quot;Pass Flash&quot; where players take turns forming five-letter words.&#10;&#10;Game 1: Scrabble Flash is a solo game that allows you to play 3, 4, or 5 letter words.&#10;Game 2: Scrabble Five-Letter Flash is a solo game that only lets you play 5 letter words.&#10;Game 3: Scrabble Pass Flash is a multi-player game that only lets you play 5 letter words.&#10;&#10;",

Expansion can be achieved through rapid peaceful occupation, but you must also use the military resources at your disposal to seize enemy outposts and to protect your own. Although this is new territory for you and your competitors, a variety of alien species are native to the newly-charted sectors... earning their loyalty will go a long way towards deciding who will be the master of the Galaxy's Edge!&#10;&#10;Your overall objective in the game is to score the most points at the game's end. Points are mainly earned for building colonies in the many star systems of varying value. Bonus points can be won by earning the loyalty of various alien species while satisfying their specific requirements.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game you will need to support your colonization efforts with military strategy, which in turn will allow you to conquer valuable opposing colonies and thus score more points. Obtaining&mdash;and keeping&mdash;alien loyalties will be an important factor in determining a winner, and the diverse Event cards can be used to further your goals in a number of ways.&#10;&#10;",

To achieve this, you will need to build armies and fleets to increase your military might, expand trade routes, conquer islands and provinces, develop your military skills, economic efficiency and culture, while always keeping an eye on the wealth, happiness and stability of your people.&#10;    &#10;The game is played in highly interactive micro-impulses. The heart of the game system is the action cycle: The players choose one of the eight possible actions. Actions chosen by a player can&rsquo;t be chosen subsequently by the next player. The number of possible actions is limited each turn.&#10;&#10;War or peace: That is your decision! You can expand your empire by leading your people to war! But war is costly and the outcome is uncertain. You can lead your empire to the golden age of civilization by keeping the peace and bringing stability and wealth to your people without following the path of war. Offer terms to aggressive enemies to distract or delay them, but always be prepared to defend your empire.&#10;&#10;You will move your 3D wooden playing pieces (representing fleets and legions) across the beautifully illustrated map from the center of the Hellenistic world to the shores of Persia in the east and the sandy beaches of Sicily in the west to expand your trade network and increase your trading status.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Gesundheit und Ern&auml;hrung &quot; contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Too Many Cooks is a co-operative hidden information card game about fussy chefs cooking soups together. It is played in 3 rounds of 5 minutes. You can play in one of 3 difficulty settings; easy, moderate &amp; hard, or you can play through all of them in an hour long session.&#10;&#10;You are chefs working together on a delicious soup that satisfies shared culinary tastes. The catch is, each chef has secret personal tastes which must also be sated!&#10;&#10;The game starts with a soup base of 16 vegetable card ingredients laid out on the table. Rising to the challenge, players take it in turns to change or move the soup ingredients to satisfy as many tastes as possible before the time runs out.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may either: &#10;Change just one aspect of a card - ie its vegetable or colour, by swapping it out for a spare card.&#10;or &#10;Rotate a row or column of vegetables 1 card in either direction.&#10;or &#10;Pass - if your personal tastes and all shared tastes are satisfied.&#10;&#10;Of course changes to the soup may upset or satisfy other chef&rsquo;s secret taste sensibilities too! So, players vocalise their satisfaction or dissatisfaction and rotate their taste cards in hand to indicate how happy or unhappy they are after each change to the soup. But they cannot say exactly why. Eg &ldquo;Ewwww, that&rsquo;s disgusting!&rdquo; is fine, but not &ldquo;Ewww, I hate mushrooms!&rdquo; Watch what other chefs seem to be working towards, and try to make changes that make everyone as happy as possible.&#10;&#10;Play fast to get your soup kitchen up to a 5 star rating over 3 rounds at your chosen difficulty level. Each of the 3 rounds gets a little harder starting with 7 tastes to solve, moving on to 9, and ending at 11 tastes divided between the players as secret personal tastes (2 each max, or 3 each in the 2 player game) with leftovers placed face up as shared tastes all chefs can work towards together.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BOARD: there are twelve triangles on the surface of the circular board. Only one stone may reside on a space.&#10;&#10;STONES: There are a total of 24 stones (12 red &amp; 12 black). Each player chooses one color, red or black. There is one pair of six different kinds of stones for a total of 12 stones per player. They vary in kind:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Stone of 1&#10;     Stone of 2&#10;     Stone of 3&#10;     Stone of 4&#10;     Stone of 5&#10;     &quot;Old Stone&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;MOVEMENT: There are only two actions a player can perform - placing or removing a stone from the board.&#10;&#10;RULES: When you place a stone in a space on the board, your opponent must place or remove one of their stones (# of spaces - according to the value of the stone you placed) away from your stone in either direction on the board - to the right or left of your stone. The same rule applies when removing a stone - the logic is the same.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Old Stone&quot; is unique. When placing this stone, your opponent MUST place a stone in the nearest vacant space to it. When removing this stone, your opponent MUST remove their nearest stone to it.&#10;&#10;ADDITIONAL RULES (&quot;The Precepts&quot;):&#10;&#10;&#10;     First Precept: players are not allowed to touch each others stones.&#10;     Second Precept: only two of each kind of stone is allowed on the board at the same time.&#10;     Third Precept: when you remove a stone from a space, that same kind of stone may not be put back in that same space on your very next turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: &quot;Return to the Way&quot;:&#10;&#10;This occurs when your opponent is unable to place or remove a stone.&#10;&#10;",
