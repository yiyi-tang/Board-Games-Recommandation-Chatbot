So, what is the most reliable and effective way to distinguish a nobleman from a peasant? Oh yes! Duel! Instead of wearing full plate armor they wear equally charming elegant suits. Instead of fighting on the tournament arena, they meet in the underground of secret club called The Suits. Join this elite society and fight for your prestige and ...........*&#10;&#10;&#10;    ) Enter your deepest and darkest desire that you want to fight for (or die for, but it wasn't in the agreement)&#10;&#10;&#10;And remember that the first and last rule of The Suits Club is - you do not talk about The Suits Club.&#10;&#10;This season is different. Why? Because this time female characters are entering to the club.&#10;&#10;This is the 5th season of the Suits. This time memmers of the club will face dark cultist, creatures from the deepest nightmares and Cthulhu himself. For the first time players will have option to play multiplayer game. Three against one. In the box players will find three new characters that can be mixed with those from other seasons and Ancients Ones from the H.P.

It shows the bravery and doggedness of the British against the abilities of the fledgling Americans Rebels. In their leaders, Howe must attempt to overwhelm the enemy, while Prescott had to organise a defence against them out of nothing. To achieve this, we have written a set of rules to showpiece the distinctive way this battle was fought.&#10; Each side has a unique set of circumstances and using miniature forces on hexes, manoeuvreing, dice rolls, fire and melee the players must face the problems the leaders of the actual battle had to overcome. In this particular case, the Regular British Line must overpower the semi trained Revolutionary Militia of 1775 in their defensive terrain.&#10; The core of the game is aimed at the players, this means that all players should be involved throughout the game. Not having to wait until one player has finished all their moves and firing. The action should be continuous for all players. Just because you have the best soldiers you should not automatically win. The game should be enjoyable and everyone should have a chance to win.&#10;&#10;A set of rules that showpieces the distinctive way this battle was fought and highlights the bravery and doggedness of the British against the emerging abilities of the fledgling American Rebels. Lead the American Militia to defend the works on Breeds Hill or send your doughty British Regulars into attack again and again!

    "Description": "Blarney Stones is a betting game.  The board has 10 spaces with a 3 letter word on each.  The words all begin with P, end with either T or N, and have vowels as middle letters.  3 D6 letter dice are thrown to make one of the words on the board.  One die has all Ps, but includes a different number on each face.  The second has either an N or a T.  The third has the five vowels and a blank.  Before the dice are thrown, players bet on which word will come up.  They may bet multiple chips on one word or more.  (The chips are all one color, so players need to note how many they played on each word.) The dice thrower is the banker who does not bet.  The banker pays the winner(s) the chips they bet multiplied by the number showing on the P die, but collects the chips from the non-winning spaces.  Should a blank be thrown on the vowel die, the banker pays all players, but only chip for chip.  When this occurs, the banker position rotates to the player on the left.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, no win condition is stated, though one, such as last man standing, can easily be made up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Frontier Valley you will hire workers, learn about their abilities and employ them as farmers to produce goods on your land, as craftsmen to make the building material you buy with your produce and as townsfolk to make use of your new facilities. You will need to make sure to make good use of the land so you are the player to better satisfy the market's demands. But beware: one misjugded applicant, one thoughtless land lease or one greedy building project could be all that is needed for the luck to turn towards your opponent!&#10;&#10;Frontier Valley is a two-player 18 card game of deduction, market manipulation, building structures and powerful one-time actions. Each round you choose one worker card from your hand to use. This might sound easy, but as in Hanabi, you do not see your own cards, only the ones of your opponent, so make sure you make the right pick even when you do not have perfect information! You then use this worker as farmer to plant new crops and thus changing the price of produce on the market, as builder to erect new structures (if you can sell valuable goods) that bring victory points or as townsfolk to use powerful one-time actions on your already standing buildings. Then you will have to give your opponent some hints of her choosing toward the cards in her hand. Will you manage to outsmart your opponent by manipulating the supply of farming goods such that you always have the most valuable produce? Will you be able to hire a sought after seasoned architect to build the most impressive town buildings? Whoever has the buildings with the most victory points in total will be the winner of Frontier Valley.&#10;&#10;The game features a beginner mode for learning the interactions of hints, the type of workers there are and the market dynamics. Once you played this at least once, feel free to add the one-time actions of townsfolk to the game for added complexity and challenge.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

He has demanded your participation in a grueling set of trials against the foulest creatures in the kingdom. The deal is simple: Survive the test and the king will grant your freedom. In order to maximize the king's enjoyment, you will not be alone and you will be allowed time to prepare.&#10;&#10;King's Eye is a cooperative, drafting battle simulator for 2-4 players. Choose a character, draft a deck full of upgrades and equipment, and battle through 7 waves of mobs.&#10;&#10;King's Eye is played in 2 major phases. In phase 1, players draft upgrade decks in a traditional pass drafting format using 3 &quot;packs&quot; of 9 cards per player from the 120 included upgrade cards. These cards improve character stats and add new abilities/actions that players will be able to utilize in phase 2. At the end of the draft, players have a 27 card deck full of exciting enhancements with which to power-up their character.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 is a cooperative battle through 7 waves of mobs. Each round a number of mobs equal to the number of players joins the battle, players take their turns, and then any remaining mobs take their turns. The 7 waves are split into 3 waves each of basic and intermediate mobs, followed by a boss mob wave at the end. Throughout the wave battle, players are becoming stronger and stronger as they seek to stay alive and dispatch the enemies. Once the boss mobs arrive, players have 3 rounds to clear all enemies. Any player that is still alive after all of the enemies have been defeated shares the victory, earning their freedom and the joy that comes from seeing the shock in the King's Eye.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw a card from your upgrade deck and choose a card in your hand to play. Then you can choose 2 actions to perform from you list of available actions.  Everyone has certain action options: draw a card, play a card, perform a basic attack. Each character, and many upgrade cards offer additional action options for players to utilize.&#10;&#10;",

They then each secretly use their location dials to declare their intended meeting point.&#10;&#10;The Mods, in a short amount of time, then have to determine where they expect the Dissidents to meet by inferring their intent from a book of every possible code set the subversives could use, and agree upon a location to direct a state raiding party.&#10;&#10;Once they've agreed on a location, the Dissidents each reveal their location dials. Depending on whether the majority of Dissidents have successfully coordinated at a single location, or the Mods have caught them in an attempt at subversion will determine whether that location becomes 'hacked' or 'moderated'.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, moderated locations produce potential accomplices for the Dissidents to recruit, as undesirables are driven from now sanitized districts. However, as the Dissidents progress their mission to 'hack' as many locations as possible, the Moderators strike back with increasing numbers of surveillance outposts, installed to limit the Dissident's ability to move around the city undetected.&#10;&#10;NewSpeak: Deluxe Edition includes the NewSpeak base game and two expansions - Rated and Sabotage - all packaged inside one box.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Candidate is a two-player loosely-themed abstract game played on a 5 x 5 grid.  Each player has a set of the same 5 pieces in their own color.  There are 3 types of pieces; 1 candidate, 2 party, 2 media.  These pieces are square, with numbers along each edge.  The game begins with each player's set against that player's side of the board with the orientation and placement of each piece as described in the instructions.  In the course of the game, the players try to move all their pieces to the opposite side of the board with the first one doing so winning the game.  In a turn, one piece is moved one space or rotated 90&deg; during each move.  When a piece from one player is moved adjacent to one of the other, an Overpowering Move occurs, where the piece having the higher number on the touching side allowing that player to push the opponent's piece one space in any direction.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

When a square containing neutral frames is created, frames are automatically placed on top of the square only if the remaining three frames have the same color.&#10;     Automatically placed pieces will create new squares, and if 3 or 4 of the squares are occupied with the same color, pieces will be placed automatically as well. In this way, pieces are stacked in a chain reaction. The pieces to be stacked may not only be the pieces of the active player, but also the pieces of the opposing player.&#10;     In this way, the person who put the piece in turn alternately and who finished all his pieces first wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each game is either fully cooperative or one-versus-all, only you have no way of knowing which one..&#10;&#10;The game is for 2-5 players where one player plays as a spirit with unknown intentions. The others play as the visitors, who need to work together to determine whether the spirit is on their side, while also trying to find out what it wants. The visitors will try to work together while struggling with darkness, isolation and the constant haunting of the spirit, who in turn either tries to earn their trust or secretly plan their demise.&#10;&#10;A Game About Trust&#10;Regardless of the intentions of the spirit-player the trust of the visitors is valuable to its goals. A benevolent spirit needs their trust to play its more powerful actions. If it does not believe that they will manage in time it can instead turn on them and win by other means. A vengeful spirit can bide its time, sabotaging their efforts in hidden ways and use their trust to make the visitors expose themselves. Then, when they are vulnerable it can reveal its true nature..&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics&#10;The visitors are represented on the board while the spirit moves through the house ethereally and can be in multiple locations at once. While visitors are limited by doors and passageways, the spirit can move freely, surrounding them.&#10;&#10;While the spirit-player may have very limited means to communicate, the visitors have an even tougher choice to make. If they separate and go different ways they will not be able to speak at all. Then, they can only watch on in horror as their friend must make a perilous choice with no support.&#10;&#10;The actions of the spirit leave clues as to its true intentions, and when the secrets of the house are gradually revealed the visitors may realize what they think they know is fatally wrong..&#10;&#10;",

Children can then use the lily pad counters to add the two numbers by counting, before they progress to the tried and tested number line method of basic addition. The higher the answer to your sum is, the further you can move your frog up your board! Reach the frog party first to win the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own board in this fun frog-filled game, which develops both counting and addition skills.

    "Description": "Secret Societies is a social deduction drafting game where player&rsquo;s loyalties are not only hidden, but also ever-shifting in this quick and addicting game of adaptability.&#10;&#10;This game features simultaneous play, fast and simple turns, and light social deduction elements that allow those players who get &lsquo;caught&rsquo; to actually be at an advantage. Each turn brings 2 choices with a single action: which faction do you become committed to, but which faction do you help win. You can only be loyal to 1 faction by the end of the game, so you must adapt!&#10;&#10;Secret Societies revolves around a single deck that includes different amounts of cards for each of the 3 factions competing for power: The Order, the Chaos faction, and the faction of Secrets. Each turn, players will draw 2 cards from the deck, choosing 1 to keep and 1 to display in front of them. The cards the players keep affect their loyalty based on the majority of symbols of each faction's type in hand. The cards they display not only give a little insight to what that player did not keep, but those displayed cards will also get reshuffled back into the deck at the end of a cycle. Once the deck is depleted, players will discuss and vote for a player that then must reveal cards from their hand. Some cards may get returned back to the deck this way. The currently displayed cards now get gathered into a new, smaller deck and a new cycle begins. After the second cycle and voting session, the displayed cards get gathered 1 final time, and players will complete 1 final draft, keeping 1 card that permanently solidifies their loyalty, and displaying 1 final card. Those final displayed cards determine the winner(s) of the game.&#10;&#10;First, if any player ends the game loyal to Secrets, they win, along with anyone else who has Secret cards in their hand. This is not an easy feat, however, for how few Secret cards are in the deck.&#10;&#10;Second, within the deck are Bribes, tempting those hungry enough to be willing to do anything to be the sole winner. If all Bribes have been taken, and no Bribe cards are displayed at the end of that final draft, the 1 player with the most Bribe cards in hand will win alone.&#10;&#10;Third, The Order wishes to remain in power and they want to keep their Scrolls that are in the deck safe and out of player's hands, even if that means abusing their power to invade player's privacy. So, if there is at least 1 Scroll and at least 1 Order card displayed at the end of that final draft, all players loyal to The Order win.&#10;&#10;Last, The Chaos faction wishes to overthrow The Order by stealing all the Scrolls from the deck. So if there are no Scroll cards or no Order cards displayed at the end of that final draft, then all players loyal to Chaos win.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Fight this war fair and square, or use covert operations and unorthodox tactics to gain the upper hand over your foes! You can also use diplomacy and trade to further your goals! Whatever playstyle you and your friends may choose, the Peace Treaty has it covered! But only one faction can win in the end!&#10;&#10;The game takes 60 to 90 minutes. It can be played with 2-5 people. the game ends after 10 turns, or after 12 peace treaty bills have been drawn onto the table and 1 climax bill has been drawn onto the table.&#10;&#10;Every turn players go though a number of phases. The First phase is the Allocate war budget phase where players will allow money to show how much they will spend on war this turn.&#10;&#10;The Second phase is the peace treaty phase, where players will vote on bills that will change the value of tiles on the map and add or remove rules, players vote on bills by reaching their hand into a cotton bag, and at the same time drawing out coins to place on 1 of three sides.. Pass, Ban or Veto, Each side does a different thing depending on the card and the side with the most money gets put into play.&#10;&#10;The third phase is the war phase, where players look at a list of actions which include, moving their armies, attacking other players, sending out airstrikes or even committing unethical actions~. Unethical actions are actions which in all senses are better than normal war actions but force the player to collect unethical cubes, which do nothing at the start of the game but may punish players harshly if certain cards have been put into play.&#10;&#10;Lastly, is the income phase, where everyone collects income from owning land, 1 coin per 3 tiles + whatever card rulings after collecting income, players draw the next peace treaty card and do it all again until they reach the end of turn 10 where they will count up victory points and whoever has the most wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Be the first to arrange tiles in such a way that an unbroken line of your chosen color connects the outer tiles of the (three-by-three) grid. You will be placing, replacing, switching, rotating and blocking tiles during play. It is a puzzle to solve and a race to solve it first.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing tiles on an imaginary invisible grid of three by three (3x3) with the goal of connecting the lines on the tiles. You want to connect the lines of your color around the outer edge of this imaginary grid. And at the same time preventing your opponent from connecting theirs.&#10;&#10;As you place a tile, if there are tiles on the table, you must place it adjacent to another tile, horizontally or vertically. As soon as there are three tiles in a row or column, this sets the outer limits. The end result should be a three-by-three square of tiles.&#10;&#10;As you play, you could do other actions instead of placing a tile, like rotating a tile, switching place between two tiles or replacing a tile. In addition to these four actions (placing, replacing, rotating and switching) you may always lock a tile at the end of your turn. You do this by placing your player marker onto the tile in question.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first to have an unbroken line of their color connecting all of the outer tiles of the grid.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this fast moving 2-4 player tile game you compete to complete large triangular 'frames' using four smaller triangular tiles to score.&#10;&#10;Each triangular tile has a number in each corner (1, 2 or 3). The corners of the four tiles must match each other when they go into the large frame.&#10;&#10;A players turn consists of two parts: completing frame(s) and scoring.&#10;&#10;To complete their frames, a player either 'draws' two facedown tiles from the tilepile or 'swipes' one faceup tile from another players uncompleted frames. A swiped tile gets a 'swipe token' put on it to keep it from being swiped by another player. Each player only has two swipe tokens to work with, so be judicious on the swiping.&#10;&#10;Scoring is done once a frame has all four tiles placed in it. That makes it 'complete', and the tiles become un-swipe-able. The player moves their completed frame to the center of the table to corner match with other frames already in the center. The numbers in the center of the matched edge do not need to match, but there is a bonus if they do. Once a frame is moved to the center, any swipe pawns are retrieved by the player to be used again later.&#10;&#10;The game is over at the end of the turn when the tilepile is emptied. Each player subtracts one point for every tile infront of them in uncompleted frames. High score wins.&#10;&#10;Strategy hints:&#10;Generally it is better to draw than swipe unless you are completing a frame.&#10;&#10;If you are way ahead on points, it is better to draw down the tilepile to bring the game to an end.&#10;&#10;Frames are scored on the corner numbers, so when possible put your higher numbers in the corner of the frame.&#10;&#10;Always be building your frames with an eye on the frames in the center of the table. It does you no good to complete a frame if there is no place to put it and score.&#10;&#10;There are six of each of the eleven unique tiles. Towards the end of the game you can look around to see whether the tile you really need is still in the tilepile, or whether you need to swipe it from another player.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tac-Tik is a board game similar to Pachisi or Tock. It is most popular in France.&#10;&#10;Players have to race their four wooden pawns around the game board to be the first to finish getting them all home. Movement of the pawns is determined by dealt cards instead of by dice. Each turn, players can play a card, and the value of this card determines how can they move their pawns. Some cards have special effects (1 or 10 can be used to place a new pawn into play).&#10;&#10;",

Two players, Red and Blue, share a set of tiles, red on one side and blue on the other.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Place or flip tiles, but not bothPlayers take turns placing or flipping tiles starting with Red. You either place one tile with your color showing or you flip one or more enemy tiles to your color. You never both add and flip tiles in one turn. If you have a placement or flip available you must do one of them. Otherwise you must pass until you do have a move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Tile placementYou can place a tile adjacent to an enemy tile or adjacent to nothing. You must never place a tile adjacent only to your own tiles. You must never place a tile that reduces your number of groups.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Tile flippingFlipping a tile must accomplish two things. It must decrease your number of groups and decrease the total number of groups - yours plus your opponent&rsquo;s. Flipping is not mandatory, unless part of a multiple flip sequence (see below).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Multiple flip sequenceWhen you flip a tile, and while it&rsquo;s still your turn, you may be required to flip additional tiles. If it&rsquo;s possible to flip any tiles subject to the preceding section, &quot;Tile flipping&quot;, which are adjacent to a tile flipped earlier in the same turn then you must flip one of them. If it&rsquo;s still possible to flip more tiles adjacent to tiles flipped earlier in the same turn, you must flip another one, and so on. Your turn concludes when no more tiles adjacent to currently flipped tiles can be flipped. Tiles can be flipped in any order in a multi flip sequence. Which tiles get flipped in a multi flip sequence is not necessarily predetermined. Sometimes a player has a choice.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Object of the gameThe game concludes when there are no more legal moves available. NOTE: Tiles can still be flipped after the board has filled up. The object is to have the most tiles on the board when the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

Every round a Headline card is revealed as a new crisis strikes the American public. Each headline builds on the last - creating more and more bad luck for everyone. The only way to stop them&hellip; toilet paper, of course. Player turns are comprised of three phases: Escape, Hoard, and Quarantine.&#10;&#10;Players begin their turns by drawing from the Escape Draw Pile to &ldquo;escape&rdquo; the active Headline cards. &#10;Players next must hoard as much as they can by drawing from the Hoard Draw Pile. Hoard cards include all the stereotypical American essentials needed to survive like toilet paper, frozen dinners, cbd gummies, essential oils, coffee, chocolate, wine, gloves, tv, computers, puppies, guns, masks, and much more.  Finally, players end their turn as they are forced into quarantine by drawing from the Quarantine Draw Pile. Inspired by the countless 2020 memes, players read out-loud the embarrassing and awkward scenarios while their opponents enjoy a good laugh at their expense.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, bad Luck is stored in a player&rsquo;s Crazy Stash or Sick Stash. The Crazy Stash represents a player&rsquo;s declining mental state while the Sick stash represents their failing health. The player with the most bad luck points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
