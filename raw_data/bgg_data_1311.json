Whoever discards a card may lie about the object of the card, but must declare that the cards are all of the same family (for example: &quot;two elves'; &quot;two wizards'; &quot;two witches'; &quot;three fairies'; &quot;three ogres'; &quot;three jesters&quot; and so on ... ). lf no one challenges the truth of the declaration, the cards are put in the discard pile and the game passes to the next player who continues to discard cards of the same family as those declared by the previous player (for example if the previous player had declared &quot;two fairies'; the next player can declare to discard, for instance, &quot;four fairies&quot;).&#10;&#10;When it's their turn, each player can play the exchange token that allows them to change the card family to be discarded from the one declared by the previous competitor. The exchange token, once played, must be set aside.&#10;&#10;After a player discards and declares the family group of their cards, any of the opponents may, if they believe the declaration to be false, call out &quot;Bluff!. At this point the truth of the declaration is verified by checking the discarded cards with two possible outcomes: if the declaration is true, the player who called out &quot;bluff&quot; will be penalized by getting all the cards from the discard pile. If the player's declaration was false, the player who lied gets all the cards from the discard pile. &#10;&#10;The player who discards all their cards first wins.&#10;&#10;",

The colour card ejected from the square is removed and set aside. The goal is to replicate on the square one of the sequences shown on the three target cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player finds one of the three target sequences in the square, they win the target card, draw another target card from the pile and place it face up above the square so that there are always three target cards showing. When the pile of colour cards runs out, players draw from the discarded colour card piles. it is evident that, by shifting the rows and columns on the square, each player must consider the new position of the colour cards that can then allow the representation of one of the target cards.&#10;&#10;The winner is whoever earns 15 points first, summing the value ofthe target cards won (or more, if the players decide differently before starting the game). Target cards are worth 3, 4 or 5 points based on the number of colored squares in the sequence. Before starting players could also decide that the player with the most points wins when all the target cards (or a certain number of them established by the players) are drawn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Escape Math is an observation game based on calculations and &quot;quick thinking':&#10;&#10;Set up: Shuffle the white number cards and arrange them to forma 5 x 5 square. Shuffle the target cards and arrange them in piles next to the card square. The card in the center of the square marks the starting point. The aim of the game is to get out of the number square-maze.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a round, a target card is drawn and shown to all players. At this point, each player looks for a &quot;mathematical path&quot; on the grid starting from the card in the center and leading towards the edge of the square. Additions and subtractions of the numbers shown on the cards must result in the number shown on the target card.&#10;&#10;By mathematical path we mean the passage from one card to an adjacent one by making a mathematical operation of addition or subtraction on each passage. The target cards, green or red, determine two game modes: if a green target card is drawn, the mathematical path must include at least one subtraction; if a red target card is drawn, the mathematical path must include at least two subtractions. As soon as a player finds a valid path they say &quot;DONE!&quot; and show everyone the path found by pointing at it with his/her finger.&#10;&#10;If the math path is correct, the player keeps the target card. If the path is incorrect, the player is out for the rest of this round and the other players continue to look for their solutions. The winner is the first to get 5 target cards or a number of target cards previously decided on by all players.&#10;&#10;Every five rounds, the cards on the square can be reshuffled. Error card The player who miscalculates is given the error card and sits the rest of the round out. lf, in the meantime, another player says &quot;DONE!&quot; and he/she is wrong too, that player will get the error card and sit the round out while the previous player with the error card can rejoin the game.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever identifies a pair must quickly take the discs of that colour.&#10;&#10;For example, if a player finds a pair of red dice, he/she must take the red discs. The beige dice works as a wild colour dice; that is, it can be added or subtracted from the other coloured dice: In this case, the final number is obtained using three dice, two of the same color plus the beige one. The game continues until  one of the players, asserting that there are no more useful calculation combinations, takes the black &quot;stop&quot; disc. At this point, the players proceed with the verification of the calculations and point counting.&#10;&#10;Final scores and game goal For each correct calculation, a player receives 1 point for each disc taken using the beige dice and 2 points if they did not use it (i.e. using only two dice of the same colour). The player who takes the black token also collects 2 points, but if he/she also took other discs, this is worth 3 points! For each incorrect calculation, the player loses 1 point, or 3 if she/he took the black disc, too. The game continues in the same way until a player reaches 15 points becoming the winner! If two players tie at 15 points, a tiebreaker round will follow to determine the final winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

If the mysterious object is a pair of TROUSERS and the uncovered card represents a LEMON, the metaphor or riddle could be: &quot;it's a LEMON made of fabric&quot; or &quot;it's a LEMON that is peeled by unzipping it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Both the player who guesses correctly and the narrator earn one point.

For yes or no questions, A is yes and B is no.&#10;&#10;All players who correctly guessed the subject&rsquo;s answer move ahead one space for every option on the question card (if there were two options, they move ahead two spaces; if there were three options, they move ahead three spaces; and if there were four options, they move ahead four spaces). The subject moves ahead one space for every player who predicted his or her answer correctly (if one person predicted correctly, the subject moves ahead one space; if two people predicted correctly, the subject moves ahead two spaces, etc.).&#10;&#10;Ask Again, Switch Places and Just Kidding cards can make the player move forward or back as well.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the Finish space, wins.&#10;&#10;The Game Includes: 1 Question Box with 432 Questions,&#10;8 Sets of Answer Cards (A, B, C, &amp; D),&#10;8 Playing Pieces, Game Board and&#10;Set of Instructions&#10;&#10;",

Variant rules improve the game by adding a doubling cube, cards in hand, a full deck and five contested areas instead of three.&#10;&#10;The basic game is played with a 32 card deck (7 to Ace in four suits) with three active areas in which players build competing poker hands (using one shared card in each of the areas). A player wins the game if they win at least two of the three hands. Alternately, the game can be played to any point total one wishes. At the end of each game, a player would win 1 point for winning with two of the three hands, or 2 points for winning all three hands.

    "Description": "Impro the Board Game is a twisted party game. The game combines insightful questions and the pitch-black humor of the therapy world.&#10;&#10;The game is prepared by setting up the game board on the table. The hourglass along with the Psychiatric Hospital-card are placed next to the board. The category cards are placed on separate decks on the table. The five different categories: Emotion, Creativity, Mental Health, Self-knowledge and Task.&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts and the game proceeds clockwise. The players move their pawns on the board according to the die and depending on which category they land, they pick a card and read it out loud. The category depicts how the player will execute the card: verbally, artistically, using their body language, facial expressions, or their wild imagination.&#10;&#10;Depending on the correct guesses and/or successful execution of the card, the player and the co-players can move forward on the game board. The die is used in the beginning of one's turn until the homestretch, the rest of the way is moved forward only by completing the categories or guessing right. The player who reaches the finish square first is the winner. If two or more players get to the finish square in the same round, the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

With this game, players will be able to recreate the famous assaults on the farms of La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont during the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815. It hopes to demonstrate how ferocious the fighting was around these iconic locations that even today bear the scars of that famous day.&#10;&#10;Indeed, the capture of these two farms became an obsession for the French, and thousands of Napoleon&rsquo;s men would become casualties trying to wrest control of them from the smaller Anglo-Allied garrisons. The fighting was intense, often involving hand-to-hand combat, and raged for hours through woods, orchards, and finally into the farms. Both the attackers and defenders demonstrated incredible bravery and their efforts helped in no small way to determine the outcome of the battle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But watch out: both the city guards and your fellow robbers will try to stop you! Fights, arrow shots and action cards will animate the game...&#10;&#10;Gadianton is a board game. To win, you have to be the first to bring back all your stolen crowns in the lush forest surrounding the city. By choosing the number of crowns, you control the duration of the game.&#10;&#10;Players move their thief figure and depending on the result of the dice, one of the city guards during the same turn. They can attack in hand-to-hand combat or by shooting an arrow to prevent another thief from fleeing with his crown and taking the advantage. Action cards spice up the game: break your opponent's bow to prevent him from shooting at you!&#10;&#10;A bit of strategic thinking, surprises, dynamism and a lot of interactions between players for a successful game and good moments shared by up to 4 players.&#10;&#10;An instruction booklet in English /French / German is included in the box. It can also be downloaded in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. However, the action cards have no text on them: the illustration is clear enough, so language will not be a problem when playing. And kids can play even if they can&rsquo;t read yet.&#10;&#10;",

They took this gift and created the Z-Ball games, a tournament that shows the world of Dunion who the greatest team and winning glory and also retaining the cosmic Z-Ball until the next games.&#10;&#10;Z-Ball is a 1 to 4 Player lightweight super fast-paced, competitive, deck constructor game with a quick dice chucking mechanic.&#10;&#10;Captain your an Animal team in 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 Co-op and 3 player games. Racing to win the best of 3 games, with each game decided by scoring 5 Strikes before the opposing team.&#10;&#10;Z-Ball also includes intelligent mechanical solo decks that provide a formidible challenge to the solo player. Each AI Deck having its own flavour and built-in strategy. AI Decks can also be used as a fellow player to create dynamic 3 player games.&#10;&#10;The Season 1 Z-Ball boxed game contains 4 playable teams, the Blue Coast Raiders, Jade Forest Swayers, Goldskin Chargers and the Grey Lake Predators, as well as 3 AI Deck teams.&#10;&#10;Players can construct their 25 card team decks from adding 5 characters from any of the Z-Ball teams or keeping the pre-set Z-Ball teams.  Each team is constructed from 5 Z-Ball characters, each elemental animal character brings 5 action cards each containing / showcasing elemental moves and tactics, some common and other more special action cards considered rare.&#10;&#10;On your turn you simply draw 1 action card to your hand and play 1 action card onto the table / field.  Each action card could bring some Earthy Defence, slowing and stopping your opponent's Strikes, or it could Strategically be like Water allowing you to draw from your team deck - adding more avaiable actions to your team.&#10;&#10;To win a Z-Ball game you need to Strike 5 times before your opponent or if one player runs out of cards the game ends, the one with the highest Strikes wins the game.  Each match of Z-Ball is played over the best of three games, with the potential of the Golden Strike game (if both players end on a draw after three games).&#10;&#10;Striking is made by playing an action card that showcases the Strike / Fire icon symbol.  This allows the player to throw the Strike Dice into the custom Z-Ball Stadium (the beautifully illustrated inside of the top lid of the core game) and rolling a total result of a 6+.  To reinforce and increase the chances of Striking the player can add Electrical Focus by stacking it on the table before Striking - each icon adding +1 to the result, the your opponent could of been stacking a large amount of Defence which reduces the result by -1 for each icon. So are you feeling lucky rolling a 'Cheeky Six' or play it cool and have +5 Focus (roll a 1, I think I can do that!!).&#10;&#10;One of the most unique aspects to Z-Ball is the 2 vs 2 co-op team games.  Playing and creating a flow with your team partner, adding Focus and passing through the Air to your team partner to smash in a powerful Strike!  With the AI decks you can even add in a 'quieter' partner allowing Z-Ball to be played even with 3 human players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gatekeeper is a game where players pick a hero and attempt to capture gates with the goal of becoming the Gatekeeper. To do this players must use die rolls, abilities, and spells to capture the center gate. Once a player is gatekeeper they will then become very powerful, and the rest of the players must team up to destroy the GK. One unique aspect of the game is that the board turns, giving players a plethora of strategies to get an edge on their opponents. Each board position gives way to new paths and opportunities. Use your hero's strengths to your advantage to devise a plan to capture and hold the center gate so that you will be deemed victorious... but do not get to eager, as any game of Gatekeeper can turn in an instant. With a bit of luck, wit, determination, and the roll of a die, you could kill the gatekeeper and conquer the gates yourself.&#10;&#10;The game is a fantasy game where you pick a hero and attack gates to get bonuses and ultimately capture the center gate. Once you capture the center you must survive against the rest of the players as they team up to take the center gate from you. If you survive you win!&#10;&#10;Each turn you will take your hero's trait card and roll a die to see what trait/ability you get to use this turn. Then you will have the opportunity to roll your dice to attack a gate. Your hero will have bonuses on some gates and will destroy them easier than others, if you capture a gate you will unlock abilities that can be used to further attack more gates on other turns. Your turn ends when you attack the gate.&#10;&#10;When a player captures the center they become Gatekeeper, then for the next three turns all of the other players team up and try to kill them. To do this they can use special gate abilities called keeper attacks. To increase your chances at winning, you need to be prepared for the Keeper attacks that will be used against you. If you survive the three rotations you win the game, if not, you are out of the game and players reset the board and attempt to capture center again.&#10;&#10;To win, you need to survive or be the last man standing!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
