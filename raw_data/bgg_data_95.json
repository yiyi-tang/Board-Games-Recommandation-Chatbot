Each campaign takes place in a different era, so your weapon options change with each campaign.&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You get to decide how your Hornets are to be armed, and which pilots are best for the mission based on their Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground skills.&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved with the priority placed on speed and realism. Hornet Leader II has retained all the key decision-making aspects of the original game, while greatly streamlining the game mechanics.&#10;&#10;While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices, the more suppression munitions, you haul to the target, the safer your pilots will be, but the less likely you are to destroy the target.&#10;&#10;Available in two formats:&#10;&#10;- Virtual Tabletop Game using the Vassal Engine&#10;- PDF files to download and print.&#10;&#10;(http://www.dvg.com/.sc/ms/dd/Vassal%5E2FPDF%20Games/3/Hornet%20Leader%20II)&#10;&#10;Hornet Leader II was a nominee in the Charles S.

Which buildings you can build are displayed on the building market. Unlike the base game of Alhambra, the buildings are not printed on the tiles, but instead players draw a tile and then a chip which tells them which of the wooden buildings is placed onto the tile. In each of the three scoring rounds, players will receive points if they have the most of each building type, as well as points for their longest connected wall segment.&#10;&#10;When buying a tile, players check for guard icons on the walls, placing one guard on each icon. The guards do two things:&#10;&#10;     Guards standing on your longest wall give you bonus points during scoring.&#10;     They can be discarded to do powerful extra actions during your turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Note: All existing expansions for Alhambra can be added to Red Palace except currently the tile based expansions from the Mega Box are not compatible due to the different size of the tiles (45mm vs 50mm)&#10;&#10;",

And they did not have to wait long - in fact, far too short to build up the RAF to a strength that would be able to match the German Luftwaffe. But besides its fighters, the RAF has other weapons to help deal with the &quot;Huns&quot;: a chain of RDF (radar) towers along the British coast, and an elaborate system of communications, signal evaluation and fighter control and guidance. If those are used skilfully, the resulting economy of Fighter Command operations might just be able to offset the sheer power of the German Luftflotten (&quot;air fleets&quot;).&#10;&#10;You are in command of all four RAF Fighter Groups to match them against the incoming raids.

    "Description": "Early Glories: Rivoli &ndash; Z&uuml;rich &ndash; Montebello &ndash; Marengo&#10;&#10;Rivoli 1797 is the conclusion of a maneuver in a centralized position, brilliantly carried out by Bonaparte. Though outnumbered, the French won a decisive victory at the cost of the bloodiest fighting of the entire Italian campaign (1st edition: VaeVictis #18).&#10;&#10;Zurich 1799: at the head of the last French army still in a condition to carry out an offensive campaign, Mass&eacute;na profited from a favorable position to save the Republic. The maneuver of Z&uuml;rich and its results figured among the most glorious pages written by the soldiers of the Revolution (1st edition: VaeVictis #29).&#10;&#10;Montebello 1800 is a clash between advance guards. The French columns hurled themselves against Austrian advanced posts and the battle expanded. The two leaders, wanting to seize the opportunity to shine, ended up committing the greater part of their reserves  (1st edition: Canons en Carton).&#10;&#10;Marengo 1800: an intense battle that the French were losing for a long while was transformed into a stunning victory when the French were able to reconcentrate and strike hard against the over-confident Austrians. Desaix and Kellermann thus brought a fresh title of glory to the young First Consul Bonaparte (1st edition: VaeVictis #35).&#10;&#10;Early Glories places the players at the head of small or medium-sized armies which had to fight over broken terrain or terrain cut by numerous obstacles. The fighting took place over one or several days. With your back to the wall, can you do as well as Bonaparte, Lannes or Mass&eacute;na and find ways to defeat the armies of their adversaries?&#10;&#10;Units: 1 strength point equals 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 cannons&#10;Scale: demi-brigade or regiment, battalion&#10;Complexity : 7 / 9&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&bull; 4 maps, 59 x 41 cm&#10;&bull; 432 die-cut counters and markers&#10;&bull; 1 rulebook&#10;&bull; 1 battle book with 4 battles and 14 scenarios&#10;&bull; 1 player aid card&#10;&bull; 10 storage bags&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "How long has it been since last you cast your gaze upon the world?&#10;&#10;Mortals always were such feeble things, and mortal memories doubly so&hellip;&#10;&#10;Doubts swarm in every place they make their homes, stones that once formed temple-walls now line their hearths, and all your earthly offspring slumber.&#10;&#10;No matter. It should be short work to cast out the doubts, rebuild the temples, and awaken some of your old allies. Only a few faithful acolytes remain, but they will suffice.&#10;&#10;After all, you are not some feeble mortal, and who could defy the will of a God?&#10;&#10;&#10;In Theurgy, you and up to five others take on the role of half-forgotten gods and compete to have temples built in your honour. A player wins if, at their end of their turn, they have met one of three winning conditions:&#10;&#10;Become the Official Faith: Build X temples, including one in the Capital.&#10;Fulfil Your Calling: Build X+1 temples and meet your secret objective.&#10;Spread Across the Land: Build X+2 temples anywhere on the board.&#10;&#10;The exact number of temples you need to build for the winning conditions varies with the player count.&#10;&#10;In many ways, Theurgy is a classic area control strategy game in which you must carve out your territory and undermine the territory belonging to your rivals. However, to achieve this, players must also manage and draft cards wisely. By performing incredible miracles, unleashing epic combinations of monsters, and cleverly utilising their deity&rsquo;s unique power, players can find ingenious ways to give themselves a surprising edge.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of choosing one of the following four actions:&#10;&#10;Pilgrimage: move acolytes and followers from settlement to settlement. Along the way, your acolytes can preach to convert the resident population or fight off monsters to protect your following from the ill will of your rivals.&#10;&#10;Spread the Word: place (or replace) a faith token to mark your growing cultural influence in the surrounding settlements. It will be far easier to construct temples if your religion is already deeply rooted in the region's culture.&#10;&#10;Divine Intervention: perform a miracle by playing a card from your hand or choose a monster to summon from the cards available in the central area. A player may also activate the abilities of monsters they have already summoned, so that the larger a player&rsquo;s horde, the more powerful their interventions become.&#10;&#10;Test the Faith:&nbsp;trigger an anomalous event in a settlement of your choice to see which god the locals turn to when their faith is tested. The distribution of followers in a settlement, each deity&rsquo;s cultural influence, and the level of scepticism present there all play a role in determining which religion's temple will be constructed &ndash; and which torn down&hellip;&#10;&#10;The most successful deities are those best able to time their interventions and use their turns to sneak their influence under the radar and establish followings in the most unlikely of places.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each card is sleeved, and within the sleeve on its back is a rule explaining how this card can be swapped with another card: swap it with a red card, a card with an even number, a card with a higher number, and so on. You can look at all the rules on cards in front of you, but you cannot communicate to others what those rules are. You cannot change the order of cards in front of you.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must swap one of their cards (following that card's rule) with another player's card, then someone records that move on a chart. Blanks are considered to be 0 and an even number for the purpose of swaps. When one of your cards is swapped, you can look at the rule on the card you receive. You can suggest moves to others or ask questions of them, and they can respond with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answers as long as they don't identify the rule on any of their cards.&#10;&#10;If you place all the numbers in numerical order (disregarding blanks) in either clockwise or counterclockwise order before you would need to make a 25th move, you all win the game. Your team's score is &quot;Great&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Horrible&quot;, etc. based on how many moves it took you to win. If you don't win, then you must all be worse than horrible, which is very bad indeed.&#10;&#10;In the game's expert mode, you cannot speak at all and you cannot undo a player's swap on your next turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Risorgimento 1859, the Second Italian War of Independence, covers the second such war, the first, in 1848, having resulted in heavy defeats at the hands of the Austrian/Hapsburg armies. But the 1859 war was different. The Piedmontese, the Italian province pressing the issue, had gotten Napoleon III and the French Army to help them. Garibaldi and his partisans were most effective in creating havoc. And the Austrians were woefully weak in high command ability and unit morale.&#10;&#10;Risorgimento 1859 is a big game, yet easy to play. The battle games are very enjoyable with lots of maneuver and combat. The Campaign game uses a point-to-point map system. The focus is on coordination and concentration, the ability to guard avenues of approach, and the capability of units to engage in combat.&#10;Battles and Campaigns&#10;&#10;Players fight the two major battles of the campaign, Magenta and Solferino (one of the largest battles in European history). The rules are relatively short and very accessible, as the battle system is designed for ease of play. For example, combat units do not have any numerical Strength! However, they do differ in Morale.&#10;&#10;Magenta&#10;A wild battle fought in the vineyards, where no one could see anything. Reinforcements coming from all corners of the map, as the French have to cross a major river to take the important rail center.&#10;&#10;Solferino&#10;The Austrians and the French literally stumble into each other in teh difficult and hilly country south of the Lombardian lakes. The battle that followed, pitting 4 French corps against 7 Austrian corps, was one of the most brutal in modern history. So brutal that it led directly to the founding of the Red Cross. The French, having started first, get to attack an Austrian-held position that takes advantage of every hill and valley.&#10;&#10;The Campaign&#10;Play out the entire Campaign and see if you can avoid the mistakes the Austrians made. This version uses a point-to-point system and some very unusual mechanics to model one of the first military campaigns that used railroads.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     1 hour per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     325 yards per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Battalion &amp; Regimental (battle); Division &amp; Corps (campaign)&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS Richard Berg (Battle game) and Peter Perla (Campaign game)&#10;DEVELOPERS David Fox, John Alsen, and Richard Berg&#10;ART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

When dealt cards, players cannot rearrange the cards in their hand. The starting player leads a card or set of cards with the same value &mdash; but they can play multiple cards only if the cards are adjacent to one another in their hand. If cards have been played on the table, to play you must play the same number of cards with a higher value or a larger set of cards, e.g., 2 &lt; 5 &lt; 3,3 &lt; 6,6 &lt; 2,2,2 &lt; 1,1,1,1. When you overplay someone, you pick up the cards you beat and add them to your hand where you wish.&#10;&#10;If you cannot or choose not to play, you must pass, drawing a card from a facedown pile and adding it to your hand. These cards have two values on them, e.g., 1/2 or 5/6, and can be played as either number.&#10;&#10;If all but one player pass, clear the table, with the player who last played leading to an empty table. When all but one person has emptied their hand, the last player loses one of their two lives. After four rounds or a player losing all of their lives, the game ends, and whoever has the most lives remaining shares victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Violet and the Grumpy Nisse, one player is Violet and the other is Torech, the very grumpy nisse (a creature from Nordic folklore similar to a gnome) who has been kicked out of every single household in the village and taken shelter in the woods, which he claimed as his own domain.&#10;&#10;Now, Violet is setting out to meet with her friend Ordep, the friendly troll, a journey that takes her right through the woods that Torech has claimed for himself. After being kicked out of the village, Torech cannot stand the idea of a human invading his home, let alone a human who is friends with a troll! So he is out to make Violet's journey as unpleasant as he possibly can, playing all sorts of tricks on her.&#10;&#10;Violet and the Grumpy Nisse is a two-player trick-taking game. Players take different approaches on how to play this game depending on who they are playing as:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Violet has control over the pacing of the game, but is also more vulnerable to losing tricks as she has to manage her lantern, making sure it's always fueled so that she doesn't get lost in the darkness of the woods at night. She also wasn't expecting a nisse to cross her path; this can be scary, and she has to manage her fear so not to be overwhelmed by her own paranoia.&#10;    Torech has very little control over the pacing of the game, but he does has a few tricks up his sleeve. As Violet's fear of him increases, he becomes bolder and sets out more and more traps that make it harder for Violet to reach her friend. Also, unlike Violet, losing a trick is not nearly as bad for Torech as it is for Violet. He, after all, is the master of tricks!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends with a win for Violet if she reaches the end of her journey. Torech wins if Violet's lantern runs out of fuel, or if her fear sneaks up on her before she gets to Ordep.&#10;&#10;What's unique about this trick taking game:&#10;&#10;     It's highly thematic and instead of keeping track of scores on a pad, you will have Violet's pawn advancing on a map, that displays her progress and how close/far she is from winning the game.&#10;     Torech has two tracks on the board he will be focusing on and that display how close/far he is from winning the game: Violet's fear, which he threatens with each trick he successfully plays on her (wins), and Violet's Light track, which he wants to run out as quickly as possible so that she gets lost.&#10;     Trump will change over the course of a game as Violet journeys through the different parts of the landscape. Because Violet controls the pacing, she will be able to speed through them, or stay for a little longer to take advantage of a certain suit.&#10;     Most cards have a special ability, however, a card's ability is triggered only if it isn't used as a trump (trump is determined by Violet's location on the map).&#10;     Thanks to the many different traps Torech can use, each game will have different events play out at different timings, depending on how early Violet becomes a victim of her own fears.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You and your fellow voodoo spirits have traveled back in time to poke a little fun at the hepcats of the 1950s cocktail culture. Your mystical influences will link these lounge-goers into social cliques that give you access to the coolest party-people that all the hipsters want to be near. Mix a few drinks, rack up the magical monkey points, and crown yourself king of the Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge.&#10;&#10;Score monkeys to hang on your martini glass by adding Jivecat contacts to your clique and claiming Trend cards through skillful manipulation of your lounge contacts. Be the player with the most monkeys at the end of the round in which a player scores their fifteenth monkey and be crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of four cards and on their turn use those cards for their face value to claim low-brow contacts in the lounges or use the card's special powers to claim Jivecat contacts and cast spells (Zombie, Rada, Cheval, and Voodoo).  For example, a 4 Zombie can be used to claim a &quot;4&quot; contact in the Lava Lounge. Card values can be added and subtracted from each other, allowing players to pinpoint just the right contacts to advance their plans.&#10;&#10;However, the player could use the card for its Zombie spell, instead. By paying a skull, they can place the card in their tableau as an extension of their hand allowing them to use that card's value for many turns in the future.&#10;&#10;In these ways, players create &quot;cliques&quot; of linked contacts in and among the four cocktail lounges (Lava, Cocoa, Tiki, and Neptune) trying to schmooze their way to the Jivecat contacts that score points. The contacts are limited though, so several players may be angling for a specific Jivecat.&#10;&#10;During play, a series of Skull Cards allow players to gain skull token reward that power their voodoo spells, and a Trend Card track presents players with monkey rewards for achieving specific contact configurations. The Trend cards also provide special bonus abilities to the players if they can maintain the required configurations.&#10;&#10;Each player has a martini glass to hold the contact chips and scores are kept through hanging cocktail monkeys on the rim of the player's glass. Orange monkeys are 1 point and blue monkeys are 5 points.&#10;&#10;Game end is triggered when one player reaches fifteen monkey points. The round is completed, bonus monkeys are rewarded for trends that have been maintained, and the player with the most monkeys wins.&#10;&#10;To add to the cocktail themed fun, each card also has a different cocktail recipe for adult players to mix and enjoy.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!&#10;&#10;Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;In Adventure Games: Expedition Azcana, you will travel to somewhere new...&#10;&#10;",

Makeshift towns cropped up around rich mines of copper, silver, gold and other precious commodities, only to fade away as the resources ran out. Now only ghost towns are left as testament to the community that once lived there. While the lucky ones made their fortunes; most folks barely scratched out a meager existence in these harsh and lonely towns. Some died lonely deaths in these places far from home, and now their souls wander around these ghost towns haunting them until the day when their soul can return home to achieve final peace. The ghost trains are these lost souls&rsquo; ticket to rest. These spectral trains glide majestically along ethereal rails looking for lost souls and give them passage homeward. You are the engineer of a ghost train. Your job is to find lost souls in various ghost towns and deliver them to their home towns so that they can achieve final peace&#10;&#10;Players are Engineers of Ghost Trains traveling through the American Southwest. Each player uses their standard set of Ether cards (1-4) to move, picking up souls and delivering them to Ghost Towns. As you move, you expend Ether to lay track behind. Other players can move along on your Ether track for free, but you may never travel along your own Ether.&#10;&#10;As you lay down more track, your old Ether disperses -- you can pull up your track to clear the way for yourself or to leave someone in the lurch.&#10;&#10;A portion of the game revolves around managing your discard pile, as you only get half of your ether cards back each turn.  But most of the game comes down to proper planning along with timing your movement to take advantage of what other people have left you, while trying to disallow easy passage for others.&#10;&#10;",

When Frederick II led his army into Silesia a long duel began between a still fragile Prussia and the first class power that was Austria. Featured here are eight battles from the fearsome contest: Mollwitz, Choutusitz, Hohenfriedburg, Kesseldorf, Kolin, Leuthen, Hochkirk, and Liegnitz. The game closely aligns with the Hold the Line system, but includes more advanced command rules, more detailed cavalry rules, optional rules for each warring nation&rsquo;s units, and much more.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Prussian army is well drilled and led by a bevy of talented generals, including Schwerin, Zieten, Leopold von Dessau, and of course Frederick the Great. The Austrian army is slightly weaker, but is aided by fearsome light infantry units and in later scenarios are led by such capable commanders as Daun and Loudon.&#10; As Prussia can you humble the Austrians and make your kingdom a first-class power? As Austria can you weather the Prussian storm and halt the first steps towards decline? The enemy approaches, the sound of cannon deafens, men shout commands, smoke fills the air. You must HOLD THE LINE!&#10;&#10;For each scenario each player receives a number of command points to activate the units in his army for movement, close assault, and fire combat.  Each side also receives a random number of command points for the same, but never knowing how many creating a battle field chaos that makes the game highly replayable.  Scenarios take approximately 1 hour to play so you can get in multiple plays in an evening.&#10;&#10;",

A roll-to-hit system enables air and (optional) naval combat to scale from the small dogfights of the Fokker Scourge to the mighty clash of dreadnoughts at Jutland. On land, corps entrench by flipping which opens up an in-hex dimension for every trench battle to simulate the tactical ebb and flow that animated the front even during strategic &quot;stalemate&quot;.&#10;&#10;Since victory hinges on territorial control, the opposing sides feed men into the mill hoping to win a war of attrition before accumulated demoralization triggers a domestic political crisis to upset their balance. The prospect of a &quot;breakthrough&quot; to the green fields beyond motivates ceaseless attacks, but it's ephemeral until tanks and planes arrive in numbers. The presence of specific admirals and generals, including the U-boat ace Lothar von Arnauld de la Periere, makes the game personal.&#10;&#10;A haggle-based diplomacy system enables history buffs to recreate the land-swap politics of the period, or players can opt for a simpler, streamlined schedule of neutral entry with a dash of randomness added for surprise. Production is as simple as 1-2-3 to avoid excessive math while enabling players to comprehend the &quot;cost&quot; of their losses. In the end, victory goes to the side that beats its historical record.&#10;&#10;Link to VASSAL http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Balance_of_Powers&#10;&#10;Link to Zun Tzu module&gt; http://www.mediafire.com/download/hrl36m0iko6by9c/Balance+of+Powers.ztb&#10;&#10;",

The players collect points in two ways: by completing the edicts and by connecting the various icons in their kingdoms.&#10;The game is divided into 9 turns during which the players perform actions simultaneously. The players simultaneously pick one card and play it on the table. Next, they pass the unused cards to the player on the left. Using the received cards, the players play another card and add it to their kingdoms. The game continues to the moment of playing the ninth, final card.&#10;Each played card makes your kingdom grow. You just have to follow 3 simple rules:&#10;&#10;     Apart from the first card, each following card must be placed adjacent to the card which is already on the table.&#10;     Your kingdom has to form 3x3 square.&#10;     The cards can be added freely and don&rsquo;t have to match the ones already added to the kingdom.&#10;&#10;&#10;After completing their kingdoms the players go to the scoring phase. Firstly, the players receive the edict cards, starting with the &bdquo;Kingsroad&rdquo; edict. It goes to the player with the longest connected road in the kingdom. Next, the rest of the edict cards are handed to the players who met their requirements.&#10;Additionally, the players score points for the individual terrains in their kingdom.  The terrains with the highest number of different symbols generate points, which are then indicated by the scorecards. &#10;The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Note: The Kickstarter edition included both Expansions and Variants expansions.&#10;&#10;",

Unconfirmed, gossip cards only last one round and then are shuffled into the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Players can also use their servants' powers against other players, use their fortune to buy status and bribe other players to stop gossip.

This game challenges you to lead one of the iwis (tribes) who settled there. Explore the islands, take control of territory, accumulate mana (honor) for your iwi, and claim your place in history!&#10;&#10;In Karekare, 2 to 4 players become leaders of different Maori iwis that reached Aotearoa in search of a new home. The players explore the territory by adding new land tiles, which gives them the opportunity to perform specific actions that will help their iwi expand and settle new lands. When a player lays a tile on the table, that triggers a reaction depending on the other tiles adjacent to the freshly placed one. These reactions will generate resources, will allow players to place control tokens on the board and eventually grant them mana points. The winner is the player whose iwi can acquire the most mana before the end of the third era.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Materia Prima places players in a medieval world where mysticism and science are inseparable in alchemy. In search of the philosopher's stone, recipes must be researched and resources mined. The competitive sandbox game combines various mechanics, such as dice rolling while fighting, deck building while recipe exploration, grid movement on a modular game board, pick up and delivery while resource mining, resource management while crafting items and area control by creating little helpers, the Homunculi.&#10;&#10;Materia Prima is a highly immersive game about alchemy and how to create the Philosopher's Stone. Each alchemist must look for long lost recipes and research in old libraries of the cities to create the stone. The elements for this must be mined on hexes, which are distributed on the game board. Alchemy has a centuries-old tradition and its masters come from families, schools and guilds whose history is as old as the records that tell of them. An Alchemist is therefore not a blank sheet of paper. Some have a special alchemical codex, others act out of love or revenge, and there are those who have gone mad by the power of the Philosopher&lsquo;s Stone and want to plunge the world into chaos. Every single biography results in a secret quest. However, this secret should be guarded, since the competitors will exploit every weakness. The game can only be completed when the first one with the help of the Philosopher&lsquo;s Stone fulfills this quest.&#10;&#10;The two central game mechanics are a turn and action based move system and a resource based crafting system.&#10;&#10;     The alchemists have a certain number of possible actions (moving, fighting, dismantling, buying, transmuting, etc.) on each turn, depending on the hexes they are currently in. Both the possibilities of action and the number of actions increase in the course of the game, depending on which equipment or homunculi an alchemist transmutes. This immediately leads to the second game mechanic, the crafting system.&#10;     Not only the Philosopher's Stone, but also equipment and homunculi are transmuted with a crafting system. The required elements can be mined on the game board and then improved or transmuted. Meet the enemies heavily armed with sword and shield! Be the wisest and defeat your enemies with the power of alchemy! Be cunning and lead your opponents on the wrong track! Be a strategist and lead your helpers into battle. With the crafting system you turn the game into your game. &#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;Video-link for the assemble of the card-board-tray:&#10;http://www.materiaprimaboardgame.com/.cm4all/uproc.php/0/.VID_20190519_155022.mp4/video.mp4?_=16af45436e9&#10;&#10;",

This is the Christmas themed edition of our wildly popular hand-slapping party game, Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza!&#10;&#10;The premise of these games is simple - say the next word in the pattern (in this version, &quot;Santa, cookie, elf, candy, snowman&quot;) and at the same time flip a card from your personal deck. If it matches the pattern word you said then everyone slaps the card pile. Whoever is last takes the pile and adds it to their personal deck. Similarly, special cards require everyone do a specific action and then not be the last to slap the deck afterwards. The game ends when one player successfully plays all the cards in their personal deck.&#10;&#10;This festive game includes new cards and special actions to add to your game night merriment. It's fast, fun &amp; friendly...the Dolphin Hat way!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Last Battle: Ie Shima, 1945 is a two-player game that simulates Operation Indispensable, the American invasion of the Japanese island of Ie Shima (Iejima or &#228;&#188;&#138;&#230;&#177;&#159; &#229;&#179;&#182;), April 16 to 21, 1945.&#10;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iejima&#10;&#10;The American player has plenty of well-trained infantry at their disposal.  What they do not have in abundance is time.  The island and its vital airfields must be conquered quickly to allow the 77th Infantry Division to be transferred to Okinawa as soon as possible.  Even so the American side must achieve its mission with no more than a modest number of casualties otherwise the 77th will be in no condition to relieve the 96th Infantry Division on Okinawa as it did historically.  An economy of force approach must be adopted and assets such as air power, armor, artillery, and the American Navy all used to maximum efficiency.&#10;&#10;The Japanese player has a mixed bag of forces ranging from regular army units to airfield construction personnel to island civilians.  Defeating the invasion at the landing beaches isn&rsquo;t the goal so much as making the invaders pay as high a price as possible.  With this in mind the Japanese player must focus their defense on the best terrain&mdash;primarily Mount Gusuku and the urban areas adjacent to it&mdash;but always be on the lookout for opportunities to upset the American timetable with judicious placement of machine gun nests and pockets of civilian resistance behind American lines.  The island&rsquo;s artillery possesses the capability to inflict attritional losses on the invaders, and the threat of a kamikaze attack on the 5th Fleet is something the American player must account for.  The arrival of night each turn opens the door for small Japanese assaults which, along with satchel charges, might produce a local victory as happened historically at Bloody Ridge, or at the very least see the American player surrendering control of the advantage marker to demand a reroll.  Changes in the weather are random, but the arrival of rain benefits the Japanese side, as does the appearance of rubble in urban areas.&#10;&#10;An optional rule allows players to experience the uplifting presence of Ernie Pyle being close to the front and the leadership provided by Major Igawa personally joining the combat, though at the risk of seeing these historical figures killed in action.&#10;&#10;Game components: one cover sheet, one 22&rdquo;x17&rdquo; unmounted map, one countersheet of &frac12;&rdquo; counters, and a rulebook; all in a bag.&#10;&#10;",

In a few short years, this group of brokers would be known as the New York Stock Exchange, one of the greatest and most influential pillars in the global economy.&#10;&#10;Exchange is a stock trading game of strategy and wit. Players carefully plan their strategy, phase by phase, trying to cash in big in a constantly changing market. However, playing the market is only half the battle- the only thing harder to predict than the stock market might just be the players sitting at the table with you. The one who can best match wits with their opponents will reign victorious in this fast-paced battle of social elite.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 rounds, and each round is made up of 3 phases; 1.) The Stock Selection Phase, 2.) The Buy/Sell Phase, &amp; 3.) The Market Influence Phase.&#10;&#10;During each round players make their selection by putting the desired card face up in the phase sleeve and then placing it face down on the table. When all players have made their decision, all players reveal simultaneously before moving on to the next phase.&#10;&#10;This lets players see what other people are doing so they can adjust their strategy during the following phases. However, the phase sleeves only reveal part of the information, so while you may find out what that a player is selling a specific stock you will not know how much.&#10;&#10;Finally players get adjust the market, by moving the price of a single stock up or down. A Market Forces card will also be drawn, which produces a random effect on the market.&#10;&#10;After the price for each stock has been adjusted, players complete their transaction with the bank at the new price, being mindful of the Market Bubble which can flip the price of a stock if the price gets too high or too low.&#10;&#10;At the end of 5 rounds the player with the highest net worth (value in stocks + cash) wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Moves are made by taking more than one seed and 'sowing' them along the row of holes. Depending on where the last seed is placed, you can take the seeds from that hole and continue the sowing, possibly capturing seeds from your opponent in the process. The aim of the game is to empty your opponent's front row of seeds or make it impossible for him to move.&#10;&#10;",

The continent has been bought and broken in two by experiments of a powerful corporation Cerbero. Now it kneels divided waiting for the fall. The government is non-existent and so are any laws of men. Desolated wastelands are roamed by mutated beasts, decades-old machines running on corrupted software and degenerate humans who are  even more dangerous. In those few pockets of civilization left people are more interested in survival than in progress. Values like compassion and responsibility are scarce &ndash; even scarcer are fuel and ammo needed to face new reality. But things are about to change as there are still those who care. Will you muster enough hope to fight for better future? Will you stand tall and shine the beacon of your courage in this darkest of times? The Waste is calling &ndash; better be ready to answer&hellip;&#10;&#10;Waste Knights is a post-apocalyptic adventure game for 2-4 players set in dystopian Australia now called the Waste.  Each player becomes a hero who travels around the continent fighting monstrous enemies, accomplishing Tasks to acquire new Gear Cards and hoping to gain enough Reputation in order to fulfill the Mission being played. All players share a common goal set by the Mission, but only the quickest and the most cunning will manage to win!&#10;&#10;Waste Knights features unique rules&rsquo; systems. Players need to manage 4 different resources: Fuel, Ammo, Health and Radiation as reaching a certain level in any means almost certain death in the Waste. They move using different Vehicles, face threats shown on Wasteland Cards and explore various locations on a modular, hexagonal map that is formed of 37 hexes. Combat is both deadly and rewarding as players set the range, utilize Combat Cards with different maneuvers and have various melee and ranged weapons at their disposal. Additionally the Waster, the person opposite the active player, controls the game to some extent choosing threats and making combat decisions for enemies.&#10;&#10;But Waste Knights is not only about fighting and moving. Players progress by accomplishing Tasks &ndash; short quests given by inhabitants of the Waste. Some of them require tactical acumen, others are based on Skill tests or getting certain goods. Finally, a unique barter system allows players to trade Gear Cards of different colors as in the post-apocalyptic future there is no currency system whatsoever. Thanks to this some players will win by strength while others by brains &ndash; and all will have a good time playing!&#10;&#10;",

This is done through putting pressure on the Republic by territorial conquests, by exacerbating the tensions in the Republic, forcing it to utilize the services of new, potential Sullas to counter your armies in the field, or by taking Rome itself!&#10;&#10;As the Republic, you must defeat and neutralize Sertorius quickly, before he can conclude an alliance with Mithradates VI and cause a two-front war. However, the levying of too many troops to fight the enemy coupled with the utilization of ambitious generals can bring on the very circumstances you are trying to avoid, collapse of the Republic. In addition, care must be taken with Italy itself because in the background, civil war looms in the guise of Lepidus, and even worse, a slave revolt under the able gladiator-leader, Spartacus.&#10;&#10;Both sides can battle their adversaries using conventional forces, conduct guerrilla and pacification operations with the intention of denying your opponent control of strategic spaces and provinces, and attempt to hasten or delay the political collapse of the Republic. The central mechanism that influences all actions in the simulation is the Republican Crisis Track, which monitors the level of crisis in the Republic. All actions on the battlefield, the state of the empire, the strain of recruiting legions and utilizing ambitious generals, and the use of power politics, are ultimately reflected on the Crisis Track. The Sertorians hope to move the track towards heightened crisis while the Republic hopes to keep it well away from a political collapse. In the end, if the Republic manages to avoid collapse, it can still lose by having a strong, Sertorian presence on the board.&#10;&#10;Spartacus requires the player to successfully exercise many facets of military-political acumen in order to defeat his opponent while preserving the most precious asset of all, survival.&#10;&#10;",

Continue as long as you dare &ndash; but like the stonecutter of legend, who was never satisfied, you may find yourself with naught, right back where you began. The wise will distinguish ambition from reaching beyond one's means.&#10; SUTAKKU is beautifully crafted with classic Japanese design aesthetics and features hand-inked brush art characters on premium engraved dice. These twelve dice are &frac34;&quot; on a side, perfect for stacking. The game also includes a cloth dice bag, stacking board, and scorepad.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dark Deeds is a darkly humorous card game of skullduggery and suspicion for 2 to 5 players. In Dark Deeds players take the role of minions in service to a powerful, mysterious, and clearly villainous, patron. The Patron wants deeds of infamy, violence and coercion committed and you are the ones who must avoid the authorities, the do-gooders and, most of all, each other to perform them. Rich rewards beckon, along with horrific punishments for failure. So are you the kind of malevolent minion the patron needs?&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;street&rsquo; deck for the minion&rsquo;s prospective targets &ndash; clerics, artisans, and merchants and their protective guards from the city watch. Then there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;tavern&rsquo; deck with potentially useful loot and plot cards to help the minions get the job done. The implacable hand of evil is revealed by the nemesis cards in the street deck &ndash; princes, politicians, and do-gooders the player&rsquo;s evil patron wants eliminated. The tavern deck includes &lsquo;Dark Deeds&rsquo;, specific missions to take out particular nemeses (that&rsquo;s the plural of nemesis in case you&rsquo;re wondering). Picking up a Dark Deed is a very mixed blessing. A rich reward is earned for completing it, but it can&rsquo;t be discarded and the patron will exact a heavy price for any incomplete Dark Deeds held at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The masterful touch is how the street deck is laid out to create a constantly moving scene of different characters. Each turn the street moves along, the card closest to the end leaves and everyone else shuffles up with empty spaces filled from the deck. Minions enter from one end of the street and have to get past any intervening guards to reach their targets.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blitzkrieg is one of Avalon Hill's earlier releases, and is a classic hex and counter board game. The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major antagonists.  Units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, artillery, fighters and bombers. Naval action is included but abstracted. &#10;Rules are introduced at three levels: the basic game, the advanced game, and a tournament game, as well as optional rules players can include as they choose. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.&#10;&#10;&#10;The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hex and counter games, so once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game is not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics.  Once you learned one game all of the others played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.&#10;&#10;The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had ratings printed in large print on the piece, (&quot;chits&quot; or counters as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, higher odds will favor that side.&#10;&#10;Also in combat, terrain affects combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).&#10;&#10;When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.&#10;&#10;In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seemed to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The guests are here, and they're hungry, so try to be the best waiter at this caf&eacute; by making sure that all the guests get their Just Desserts!&#10;&#10;In this card game, each player starts with a hand of three dessert cards while three guest cards are placed in the center of the table; each dessert card shows 1-3 tastes that it satisfies, such as chocolate, fruit, or pastry, while the guest cards show what they crave as well as what they refuse to eat. On a turn, you draw a dessert card, add a guest card to the table from the deck, then take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Serve (and claim) one or two guests by discarding one or more dessert cards to give them what they want (while avoiding what they don't want); if you give a guest their favorite item, you get tipped with an extra dessert card.&#10;    Draw one more dessert card.&#10;    Dump as many dessert cards as you want, then drawing that many cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, discard guests from the table so that only one guest of each &quot;suit&quot; is still waiting to be served &mdash; but the guest heading out the door (on top of the discard pile) can still be claimed by any waiter. If at any time you've served three guests of the same suit or five guests of different suits, then you win!&#10;&#10;Just Desserts includes game variants that allow you to steal guests from another waiter by sending more sweets their way, to force other waiters to each give up one guest, and to hold a surprise party to claim a guest out of turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As soon as a coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs&quot; &mdash;Johann Tetzel, 1465-1519&#10;&#10;Mea Culpa is a paradise-and-pandemonium gamer's game that&rsquo;s all about sins and sinners. Be it at the brothel or at the market, men such as the Pope or the Emperor can be seen hard at work at any time of the day. Even the most miserable miser, though, would be well advised to also strive to get hold of enough precious stones and wine to make sufficient donations towards the Lord's cathedrals. After all, it is through pious generosity that a poor soul can gain the all-important letters of indulgence and be pardoned for a life of greed and lust. When all is said done, what matters is to have sinned just enough to have achieved all goals and gotten away with it, while others took the fall.&#10;&#10;In more detail, to win, players have to end the game with their &quot;poor souls&quot; closer to heaven's gate than their opponents. Alas, throughout the game these poor souls pretty much exclusively move in the opposite direction, i.e., towards Hell. Only at the very end of the game might players climb back towards heaven, depending on the letters of indulgence that they managed to collect up to that point.&#10;&#10;The accumulation of these letters of indulgence is each player's primary goal. To this end, they take on the roles of different people: the Pope, the Emperor, the Merchant, or the Little Sinner. Each round, these roles in turn grant them access to different special actions. On their turn, players buy or sell goods on the market, visit the brothel to benefit from personal connections, or secretly donate money and goods to the church. Meanwhile, the construction of the game's three cathedrals proceeds. As soon as a cathedral is fully erected, the church will hand out the all-important letters of indulgence. However, only those who have donated the most in either of three categories will actually receive anything.&#10;&#10;Many perks that can be used during the game require the players to &quot;sin&quot;. Sins are tracked by means of a tally stick and will move the player's poor soul closer to hell. The player who strikes the right balance and picks the right roles at the right time will be able to collect the most valuable letters of indulgence and might stand chance at winning the game. If a player has burdened themselves with too much sin, though, all will ultimately be for naught.&#10;&#10;",

Each hexagon represents an area approximately 100 meters across. The armies which fought on this ground are represented by over 700 multi-colored playing pieces. Infantry are in regimental or battalion organization. Cavalry are shown as regiments. Artillery is deployed by battery. Distinctions are made between line or light infantry, guard and other elite forces. Various leaders are also portrayed.&#10;Each unit is individually rated according to its number of men or guns, its morale, its ability to initiate combat though gunfire or m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, its movement and, where appropriate, its range.&#10;The game is ideal for solitary study or team play. Each turn is twenty minutes of real and simulated time, play balance depends entirely on the skill of the players.&#10;The rules are a revision of the award-winning system developed by the Marshal Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic Battlefield.

    "Description": "Victory in the West: Plan Yellow, The French Campaign 1940, is a realistic two-player game that accurately recreates the 1940 campaign in all its aspects except one: the outcome is totally up to you. The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.&#10;&#10;10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.&#10;&#10;Six weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.&#10;&#10;But, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course. But which ones would have changed the outcome?&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 6.8 miles / 11 kilometer&#10;Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One 17 x 22&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (720 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Victory in the West rulebook&#10;One 8-page Victory in the West Example of Play booklet&#10;One 4-page Victory in the West Design Notes booklet&#10;Five dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;One 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 hours&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: David James Ritchie&#10;DEVELOPER: Kevin Boylan and Gene Billingsley&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Kirche &amp; Staat&quot; contains historical events related to church &amp; state, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",
