    "Description": "Each of the players represents a Nuclear Power.  The aim of the game is to maintain world peace and avoid nuclear war.  An &quot;Arms Spiral&quot; is in the middle of the board, representing the arms race.  When the &quot;BOMB&quot; arrives at the end of the Arms Spiral, world peace is over and everyone has lost!  However, if all players work together in such a way that one reaches the &quot;World Peace&quot; space, then the arms race is over.  All players have won and the one who has contributed the most to maintaining world peace is declared winner.&#10;&#10;To prevent destruction each player must simultaneously pursue his own goals as well co-operate with the other players to maintain peace.  Each one can pursue his personal selfish goal to come to a victory, but this promotes the arms race.&#10;&#10;The American version of this game is called Star Peace: Anti Nuclear War.&#10;&#10;",

If there are fewer players, specific cards are removed. Each player is dealt 12 cards.&#10;&#10;The start player calls a colour. Each player puts a  card in front of him/herself, face down. If you have a card of the called colour, you have to put down a card of that colour. If not, you can choose any of your cards.&#10;&#10;When all players have put down a card, each player decides if he/she wants to reveal his/her card, starting with the start player. You can only reveal your card if it is of the colour that was called. But if you have played a card in the called colour, you can choose to pretend you didn't and thus don't reveal your card.&#10;&#10;If nobody reveals a card, the caller stays in control. If any cards have been revealed, the player with the highest card takes over control.&#10;The player in control can choose between&#10;&#10;     continuing&#10;     ending the round&#10;     doubting a player.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the player in control continues, the same colour stays active and all players put a second card on top of the previous.&#10;If the player in control ends the round, the biggest liar is determined: the unrevealed cards are revealed and the player who played the highest card in the called colour gets an egg card. Then all played cards are put into a stack next to the player.&#10;If the player in control doubts a player, that player has to reveal his/her played card. If it is of the called colour, the doubted player must take all the played cards. If the player in control incorrectly doubts a player (i.e. they played a card in a different colour), the doubter must take all the played cards. Some cards have fried eggs printed on them, which count as negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last card has been played.&#10;Each egg card is worth 3 points, each fried egg on one of the cards a player has received counts as -1. After five games, all points are added up and the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The experts sent out has built six home bases to explore the planet and its resources.&#10;&#10;By mistake one expedition takes with it the complete set of ignition keys to the space rockets on the planet. Without these keys the rockets cannot be started and thus it is not possible to leave the planet. The expedition is closely monitored by all bases, but what must not happen still happens - the expedition vanishes without a trace!&#10;&#10;As a player you must form a rescue team and be the one to find the missing keys.&#10;(Translated from the Swedish rules text)&#10;&#10;Each player puts together a rescue team that braves the dangerous planet surface in order to move to the six scattered key sites of a lost expedition carrying the keys to all the rockets used to leave the planet. When you have found one of the three pairs of matching keys, return to any home base and point out the two identical key counters to win the game.&#10;&#10;For your expedition you may choose 4 different members. You can choose between a captain, a doctor (who may heal wounded members), a technician (who may repair the terrain car), a zoologist, a geologist, and up to three soldiers (who collect food). Bringing along a varied team increases the chance your expedition contains a member with a chance of overcoming/avoiding the various hazards (terrains and events) you encounter on the planet.&#10;&#10;Each turn you may you do one of the following:&#10;- Move &#10;- Hunt for provisions (only if there's at least one living soldier in your expedition)&#10;- Repair the car (only if you brought along a technician and he/she is still alive)&#10;- Perform surgery on a wounded expedition member (only if you brought along a doctor and he/she is still alive)&#10;&#10;&#10;     If you choose to move (drive the car), draw an event card. &#10;     If you move into difficult terrain, stop, and draw a terrain card. &#10;     Each turn, roll a die. If you roll 1-3, one piece of Provisions have been used up.&#10;&#10;&#10;Terrain and event cards generally contain hazards that are bad for you: your car takes damage, a member of your expedition becomes wounded, you lose one turn, etc. Most cards specify one or two types of crew that is given a chance of negating the effects, should your expedition contain it.&#10;&#10;Event cards can also mean you found scattered objects from the missing expedition. Collect enough and you are given a chance to look at and memorize one of the six key counters regardless of where your expedition is.&#10;&#10;The game only exists in Swedish.

Each player control one army (or sometimes 2 if you are 2-3 players) and tries to move any of his characters to Naboo, throwing 2 dices per turn, each for one character. When getting doubles, all four characters can be moved. On the way can you attack your opponents and with luck and skill render them harmless. But be careful, so your not attacked and eliminated yourself.&#10;&#10;Armies from the same side are allies during the game and has to cooperate, ie to open a gate to Naboo, as the planet is protected by a shield. It's done when 2 allies from different armies meet at an alliance field, where 'Star Wars' is stated. Throwing 4 dices and adding attack value, they must get at least 22. Enemies cannot go trough the opened gate.&#10;&#10;The combat system is simple, by adding attack values and defence values of each character to the dice throws. Regardless who attacked, the player who got smaller number, loses the character. The lost character can be conquered back if ventured in the enemy base and both characters are moved back to own base.&#10;&#10;When character reaches Queen Amidala, player takes control of it and tries to move it back to allied base. If Queen loses battle, the winning character is moved to center and control of the Queen is changed.&#10;&#10;The game is based upon the the movie &quot;Star Wars Episode I&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game does probably only exist in Sweden, Norway and Finland.&#10;&quot;Kampen om Naboo&quot; = &quot;Fight for Naboo&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

During each session, five elections take place followed by the formation of the government. The goal is to advance as far as possible in the parliament. Advancement comes, on the one hand, through luck (namely, your cards) and the way you use it, that is, playing the right cards at the right time, and, on the other hand, through skillful negotiation with your fellow players about posts and their related points. &#10;Success is measured in points. Each player has a sixth of the game field (the plenary hall) in front of him, his points are marked in the track of his color. After 15 elections, the strongest party-chairman wins; that is, the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;",

But even better hunters.&#10;&#10;A day's journey downriver, at the edge of the forest there, live the men who call themselves the Treg. They have learned to reap the bounties of the water. They harvest&#10;the river with nets woven of soft, pliable reeds and roots; and make stories out of symbols painted on hides.&#10;&#10;On the broad open plains to the south live the Marmar. Who plant seeds, and raise animals for work and food. They are a peaceful people, desiring only to be left alone. And the strong walls they have built around their village do much to help them maintain their solitude.&#10;&#10;Lastly are the Dermen, who are a tribe of raiders. They know the land well, being so traveled -- getting direction from the patterns in the stars. They go wherever the warmth of the sun and the wealth of nature lead them. And if they cannot find food enough for themselves, they simply take it... from others.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the World of Nomad...&#10;&#10;Nomad is a game based on the life and times of the early tribal societies at the dawning of the Neolithic Age. It is the story of their growth and expansion, their struggles against the elements of a harsh and unforgiving, prehistoric world, full of rivals and predators; every day, a walk through the borderlands between perseverance and&#10;extinction.&#10;&#10;As the chieftain of one of these early tribes, it will be your job to make the decisions that lead your people to prosperity. Will you lead them into the new era, or will&#10;you simply become history?&#10;&#10;",

Your cue ball may travel any distance in a straight line before hitting a neutral (or another cue ball); at that moment, its momentum is transferred and the ball hit moves the same distance.  Should you hit a row of balls, only the farthest one moves (as in a Newton's Cradle).  All balls bounce off the play area's walls, either straight back when hitting head on, or reflected when hitting at 45 degrees.  Note that a move that doesn't hit any balls is illegal.&#10;&#10;Includes solitaire problems where the object is to find the least number of moves required.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Briefly: Scrabble with poker hands.&#10;&#10;Deal Me In is a board game in which players collect tiles (which represent playing cards) and attempt to lay them on the board so as they form poker hands. The higher the hand, the greater the score. The poker hands interlock in the same way as the words on a scrabble board, so it`s possible to score for more than one hand on a turn. When a player scores, he/she takes score chips from the box. the player with the highest scoring number of chips when the cards run out is the winner.&#10;Simple, fast and fairly enjoyable; but very lightweight. An opener/closer.&#10;&#10;The bits: One board, comprising an 11x11 grid. most of the spaces are blank, but some have representations of playing cards on them; these are bonus squares, a la scrabble.&#10;&#10;56 &quot;playing cards&quot;. These are actually good quality cardboard tiles.&#10;&#10;30 No Entry tiles.&#10;&#10;4 playing racks&#10;&#10;Poker chips in various denominations&#10;&#10;Each player starts with chips worth 150 and 7 tiles. These are placed in the playing rack.&#10;the four joker tiles are laid on the Joker squres on the board.&#10;&#10;Players must, on their turn lay at least one card on the board to form a legitimate poker hand, or failing that change one or more tiles at a cost of 10 per tile.&#10;&#10;Tiles laid must extend hands already played, again in the same way as scrabble. &#10;Players do not have to lay five cards at a time. For example, a player could form four of a kind simply by laying three tiles of the same denomination next to a previous tile with that denomination.&#10;&#10;bonuses are scored by laying tiles on the special bonus squares on the board. Again, these squares have representations of playing cards on them and in order to score, you must lay the tile of the same denomination as the bonus square in order to score.&#10;When a five card poker hand has been formed on the board, it can no longer be extended, so a No Entry tile must be laid at either end of the hand to stop any further tiles from being added.&#10;If a hand is played so it covers a Joker tile, this tile is taken up and added to the players` hand.&#10;If a Joker is laid as part of a hand, it may be replaced with the correct tile which it represents on a later turn.&#10;When a player lays a hand down, he/she takes poker chips to the value of the hand. This varies from 10 for a pair, to 1000 for a royal flush.&#10;When the cards run out, scores are totted up and the player with the highest value in chips is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Other similarities include an extra turn when doubles are rolled, two decks of cards (&quot;Production&quot; and &quot;Exploration&quot;), income tax, income upon passing the start space and even incorporation of the unofficial &quot;Free Parking&quot; variant, here called the Slush Fund.&#10;&#10;Different is an interior board path and an elevated 6x6 drilling board. Landing on an outer board space usually offers the chance to lease a plot on the drilling board if not already leased. Travel on the interior board, possible only by landing exactly on its entrance or possession of a plastic permit token (obtained by landing on other spaces), permits drilling once one has a drilling company. This is very much a costly hit-and-miss affair, especially when drilling without any other proven oil fields nearby.&#10;&#10;If the player does not go bankrupt, eventually his plots should be populated with a lot of black plastic pegs indicating gushers rather than the yellow ones which signify dry holes. Then each time a player passes the start, he is paid based on the number of barrels he is pumping.&#10;&#10;Unlike Monopoly, the idea is not to drive others into bankruptcy, but to be the first to reach one million dollars. While there is a good atmosphere of real drilling situations, there is also much chaos in the dice, cards and spinner.&#10;&#10;",

This game is very similar to the standard Mayfair Empire Builder games except that it was a limited edition game for the Huntington Museum of Art as part of their exhibit entitled &quot;Agent of Change: The Railroad in West Virginia&quot;.  Aspects of this game that makes it different than the other Mayfair crayon games is the use of the load sheet, the ability to build coal mines, and the extremely mountainous terrain.  Instead of load cards, the game uses two dice and a load sheet where the player rolls dice and reference the master load sheet to determine the available contracts.  Building coal mines involves building rails through coal mine spaces which causes a load of coal to be available at the nearest coal city.  Since West Virginia is naturally mountainous, the competition for the best routes is extremely competitive, even in a two-player game.&#10;&#10;",

Therefore, it is perhaps better to let the bomb blow up beforehand - if you believe that the evil will not be so bad.&#10;&#10;Courage to take a risk, the skill to bluff, the ability to see into the future and a great amount of luck - more than you do not need - for our party cracker.&#10;&#10;",

The active player then rolls two dice to determine two or more fields (such as 31 and 13, for instance - special rules apply for rolling doubles). All dwarves on these fields lose their rings and are kicked out of the cave. The first player who carries two rings out of the cave is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is entirely dice driven, there is no decision-making involved.&#10;&#10;",

The first 6 rows are safe and each player has their own along with a pit for prisoners. There are then 5 circular rows that anybody can move into and a pit in the middle for scoring.  To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.&#10;&#10;When one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over. Each piece captured is worth 5 points and each piece in the middle pit is worth 10 points.&#10;&#10;",

You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.

Many of the games are pure strategy with no randomness, just like Chess itself; many of them have an element of luck; and many of them introduce other game elements into Chess, including bluffing, hand management, resource management, gambling, push-your-luck, trick-taking, auctions, etc. There is something here for everyone--including the serious Chess player.&#10;&#10;In every game, a player's possible moves are determined, to varying extents, by the cards available to that player. Sometimes, a king will appear to be threatened, but will actually be safe, if the attacking piece is unable to move. As such, check and checkmate have been removed from these games entirely; a player may willingly enter or stay &quot;in check.&quot; The goal of every game is simply to capture the opposing king.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This db spiele game can be translated to &quot;Hops and Malt&quot; in English.  The goal of the game is to brew the best beer using ingredients associated with the German purity law:  Malt, hops, and water.  There is a card deck associated with each of these 3 ingredients:  a malt deck, a hops deck and a water deck.  Players have a limited amount of money to purchase ingredients for their beer.  Ingredients in each deck are valued from 1 (worst ingredients) to 6 (best ingredients).  The decks are shuffled separately and the 3 decks are placed face down in the table.  The top card of each deck is turned over.  In turn, each player may buy any of the 3 ingredients with their money.  This continues until all the ingredients are gone or the players run out of money.  Now, players sell their beer at market.  To make beer, you must have 1 hop card + 1 malt card + 1 water card.  The value of the beer is the sum of the value of the cards.  Contracts valued between 10 and 100 are turned over 1 at a time.  Players use once around bidding with their beer to buy the best contracts.  The total value of the contracts purchased determines the winning player.&#10;&#10;",

All players must answer questions truthfully, but are not required to provide more information than asked.  An exception is the murderer who may lie freely. Accusations are made at the conclusion of the final chapter, the winner being the player who guesses the author's solution correctly.  The setting of this particular mystery is Rome in the year 1985 where an American citizen has been found dead in one of the catacombs. The roles in the game are the son of the deceased, the son's wife, the wife's parents, the secretary of the deceased and the   lawyer of the deceased. A 33 and a third phonograph record is included to provide a sense of atmosphere.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game is a distant relative of &quot;Survive!&quot; which introduces a number of interesting twists.&#10;&#10;You are Noah's helpers and are competing to bring the best variety of animals on board before the waters rise too much.  The board and bits are very nice plastic, except for the animals which are cardboard (and whose bases tend to fray after a while).  There is a big Ark sitting in the middle of the board that acts as a four-slotted piggy bank.  A whole bunch of four-squares bases shaped like lightning bolts come in three colours and represent the cool (white), temperate (green) and hot (yellow) continents.  Each of these bases can hold an animal.  The bases and animals are deployed semi-randomly at the game outset by all players (this could need to be better constrained by the rules as the set-up has considerable consequences on the game's outcome); the restriction is that each continent must form a single land mass.  Although the bases come in three heights, this is ignored in the rules.&#10;&#10;The animals are colour-coded at their bases to indicate on which continent they belong.  They all come in pairs.  Some animals are predators, with a red background.  You must deploy them so as to split the pairs.  Your little boat has room for two animals on board.  You cannot carry a predator and a prey at once, but all other combinations are OK.&#10;&#10;You roll a six-sided die to move; on a one, a continent base sinks (is removed) instead; you do not move.  The flooded base cannot have an animal on it, so if there are no floodable bases, you reroll.  Otherwise, you must use the exact die roll to move with --diagonals aren't allowed.  Once beside a continent, the die roll is used to send an &quot;expedition&quot; to catch an animal, which again must be reached by exact count.  If the trail goes through another animal  as well, you have the option of capturing it too.  You go back to your two &quot;berth&quot; spaces beside the Ark to drop the animals off --this also gets you a free second move.&#10;&#10;Once the last animal is removed from the land, the game ends instantly.  All animals in transit (on board players' boats) are discarded and those in the Ark are scored.  Prey are worth one, predators two.  A pair of animals doubles in worth.  If you have animals from each of the three continents, your score doubles.&#10;&#10;As the Ark hides the animals dropped in its compartments, there is an element of memory involved --you should try to remember what each player has brought back so far to have an idea of who's in the lead.&#10;&#10;The movement system is annoying because diagonals aren't allowed (so parity conservation is enforced) and actually makes the game drag a bit at the end; it'd suggest playing that exact rolls aren't required --or that diagonals are allowed.&#10;&#10;",

The re-invented warp (hyperdrive) technology is crude and a little hazardous.  Power crystals are relics of the fallen empire, still impossible to create anew, and can be integrated into the engines and computer systems of the ships to make them much, much better performing.&#10;&#10;You are a power crystal smuggler, or Star Runner.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first to smuggle six power crystals to the Para system.  As the locations of the crystals are unknown at the outset, you'll first need to accumulate Clues.  For every six clues, you find a crystal --that is, you roll to deploy one; although you're the only one who knows where it is, you still need to get there and back...&#10;&#10;There are three basic strategies: One At A Time, where you find and fetch each of the six crystals in sequence; All At Once, where you locate all six before attempting to retrieve them; and Piracy, where you lie in wait of those who have found crystals...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Energy Quest, each player is the president of an energy corporation, developing energy sources so as to sell the output.  Two basic types of property are on the board: raw materials (coal, oil, etc.) and power sites, where energy can be produced (electric stations and the like).  World Oil Price will rise steadily if unpredictably as the game progresses, making some propositions profitable in the later stages.&#10;&#10;There are two sets of currency: dollars and kilowatt-hours (kWh).  You buy energy from a player when you land on his developed power site, but the real victory condition is accumulating kWh &quot;receipts&quot; whenever you land on your won power sites or pass &quot;Take Off&quot; (e.g. &quot;Go&quot;).  Money and property are not counted at the end, so you must gauge carefully how much money to invest in kWh receipts as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Medical Monopoly, each player is a doctor with a hospital to run.  If you are successful in having the right supplies (medicines, organs, etc.) on hand and in diagnosing illnesses, your hospital fills up --the first player to fill his hospital with patients wins.&#10;&#10;Oddly enough, this victory condition isn't clearly stated in the rules.  The game has elements of a Trivia game to it, as you must often recognize an illness from a list of symptoms and remember the appropriate cure (if any).  This lowers the replay value somewhat, but the game does have an educational vocation, so this is excusable.&#10;&#10;",
