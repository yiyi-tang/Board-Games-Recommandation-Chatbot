    "Description": "In The Incredibles: Save the Day Game, you become a member of the Parr family and become responsible for the safety of Metroville.&#10;&#10;All players start the game in the middle of the game board, and three problem cards are revealed at random from the deck. The game board includes cut-out pieces, and you flip the areas related to the problems to show what ability &mdash; speed, agility, defense, or strength &mdash; is needed to solve the problem.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the movement die, then reveal a new card if the alarm symbol is visible on the die. Sometimes the cards introduce new problems in the city or a roadblock that cuts off your movement; at other times, Frozone shows up to solve a problem on his own, Edna Mode shows up to rescue Jack-Jack (who starts on the game board and is represented by a die), or Jack-Jack teleports somewhere in the city.&#10;&#10;After resolving the card, you optionally move, then if you're on a problem, you roll your die to see whether you get the ability needed to solve it. If someone previously landed on Jack-Jack's space or Edna found him, then you roll the Jack-Jack die as well. Flip the problem card face down on the track if you solve it.&#10;&#10;If an unresolved problem ever reaches the end of the track, then you all lose the game. If all of the current problems have been resolved (i.e., are face down) and Jack-Jack is with the family, then you all win!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.&#10;&#10;These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.&#10;&#10;There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.&#10;&#10;When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.&#10;&#10;Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:&#10;&#10;1) Purchase properties, as described above;&#10;&#10;2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or&#10;&#10;3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.&#10;&#10;Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.&#10;&#10;As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.&#10;&#10;",

Goods are divided into five categories, with five different items in each category. Players can see which categories of goods their opponents are holding by the symbols on the backs of the cards, but do not know the specific item the cards represent in those categories.&#10;&#10;This isn't your typical trading game and player interaction can get raucous and intense as players get creative with their haggling! The player with the highest value of talent coins at the end of the game wins. The marketplace is dynamic and ever-changing.

    "Description": "In Overlords of Infamy, you take on the role of an Evil Overlord with a personal goal of making your subjects as miserable as possible, while other overlords are doing the same to their subjects. You accomplish this by harvesting a variety of materials to complete myriad Nefarious Plots ranging from &quot;Steal Candy from Babies&quot; and &quot;Make Everyone's Socks Slightly Damp&quot; to &quot;Blow up the Moon!&quot; and &quot;Divide By Zero&quot;. All the while, an annoyingly righteous Adventuring Hero from the Kingdom of Good crusades around trying to thwart each Overlord's plan. You'll find that your actions have consequences as the World's tension builds up and culminates in a random global event that can either be catastrophic or beneficial. And if that isn't crazy enough, the other Overlords will be committing acts of espionage against you! Complete your plots, stave off the competition, and repel the Adventuring Hero and you just might be denounced the Overlord of Infamy!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A race game between eight fantasy monsters selected at random from a deck of 25 (e.g., medusa, cyclops, vampire, zombie, centaur, dragon, griffin, djinni).  Players get secret agendas, listing the order they want the monsters to finish according to colored mover bases for the cards.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, they move a monster toward the finish line. All monsters move forward a die roll but if you are moving a monster that doesn't score high for you, you can waste its movement by zig-zagging or wandering into non-native terrain.  Each monster must move once per round, so even those that no one likes will get moved (and present bluffing opportunities for clever players).&#10;&#10;A monster can attack once per move -- a great way to slow down a monster you don't like is to beat it unconscious.  Each monster is rated for the number of custom attack dice (marked with just 0s and 1s) they throw to find damage.  Monsters also have special powers, some active all the time and others that only kick in when a custom &quot;wacky die&quot; shows sword or shield icons.&#10;&#10;The game includes reversible mapboards with different terrain patterns (brush, rock, water, etc.) to create a wide variety of maps.  Monsters move into their native terrains as if they were blank squares and get a defensive bonus as well.  Some monsters can fly, ignoring terrain except where they land.&#10;&#10;The race ends when three monsters have crossed the finish line.  Everybody counts up the points listed on their secret agendas for those three monsters.  Example: the dragon, doppleganger, and hare finish in that order. My agenda says dragon 8, doppleganger 5, and hare 3 so I score 16 points; the monsters I had listed for positions 7, 6, 4, 2 and 1 didn't finish.&#10;&#10;Note that this description is for the 2014 edition of the game.  The original used regular dice, counters rather than cards, scored all eight finishers and had players set their own agendas (both of which stretched out the game considerably).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kampen om Norge (&quot;The Battle of Norway&quot;) is a strategy board game about the German invasion of Norway in 1940. Each player takes control of the armed forces of either Norway, The Allies, or Germany. Using plastic soldier playing pieces that represent armies, and cards that represent war ships, bombers, fighters and special actions, the players battle for control of the six victory cities on the board. Managing the resources you get from your playing cards is crucial to succeed.&#10;&#10;The game is fast-paced and has a quick set-up, yet offers a wide range of strategic options and variations. The starting point of the game and the resources available to the different factions are based on the historical conditions, but the players have the chance to change the course of history. Kampen om Norge is suitable for 2&ndash;3 players (or teams) and is playable in 2&ndash;3 hours.&#10;&#10;&#10;Den 9. april 1940 overfaller tyske stridskrefter et n&oslash;ytralt og d&aring;rlig forberedt Norge. Felttoget i Norge er h&oslash;yt spill, men Hitler har bestemt seg for &aring; legge landet under jernh&aelig;len. Norske og allierte styrker mobiliserer og nekter &aring; gi seg uten kamp. Klarer de &aring; stanse det tyske storml&oslash;pet?&#10;&#10;Dette er utgangspunktet for strategispillet Kampen om Norge, et spennende brettspill om den tyske invasjonen i 1940, som gir spillerne mulighet til &aring; ut&oslash;ve historiekunnskap i praksis. Tidenes f&oslash;rste norske strategi-krigsspill er lekkert utf&oslash;rt med naturtro brikker, realistiske spillekort og et detaljert kart.&#10;&#10;Hver spiller p&aring;tar seg rollen som &oslash;verstkommanderende for de milit&aelig;re styrkene til Norge, de allierte eller Tyskland. Ved hjelp av brikker, terninger og spillekort utkjemper spillerne en kamp seg imellom p&aring; brettet, der Norge og de allierte sammen m&aring; fors&oslash;ke &aring; stoppe Tysklands frammarsj p&aring; norsk jord og hindre at Tyskland okkuperer alle de viktige byene. Spillerne m&aring; ta strategiske valg, forvalte ressursene p&aring; spillekortene, flytte sine bataljoner omkring p&aring; spillebrettet og kjempe mot motstanderen om landomr&aring;dene. Den som velger den smarteste strategien, har best sjanse til &aring; vinne, men det hjelper ogs&aring; &aring; v&aelig;re venn med terningene.&#10;&#10;Kampen om Norge kan spilles i to vanskelighetsgrader.&#10;&#10;",

This edition should be called 20 Answers because you get 396 cards with 20 answers and the players in turn ask the Reader a number, and from that clue try to guess the answer. For each attempt a chip is paid, when the Guesser gets it correct, the Reader scores the chips paid, the Guesser scores the remainder. So getting it correct early scores you loads, getting it late scores the Reader loads. The board has a scoring track and there is an element of beating the Guesser too.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, there are no pre-defined rules for 'strength order of numbers' or specially powerful 'trump cards' that are involved in winning or losing tricks.&#10;&#10;Players are obligated to win tricks at all times while changing these rules to be consistent with past win-loss results. Failure to change the rules without inconsistency will result in altering the past - taking unfavourable cards as negative VPs. Try to limit the number of negative VPs you get and win the game!&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#142;Uchronicle&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#145;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#230;&#175;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#185;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#191;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#150;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#136;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#142;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#159;&#155;&#231;&#155;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#230;&#155;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#190;&#169;&#229;&#139;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#159;&#155;&#231;&#155;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#230;&#155;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#142;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#148;&#185;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#149;&#226;&#128;&#149;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#149;&#226;&#128;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#138;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Buying castles in Scotland can turn out to be excellent business. Even more so when, at the same time, you can provide tourists with these lands attractions: natural beauties? Oh no, no, rather offering them scary ghost infestations!!! Some eccentric characters fight in an auction to be assigned castles and manors. This, in the hope that presences will not be too numerous! Even if a castle without ghosts may be found useless, on the contrary one which is too &ldquo;populated&rdquo; will end up terrorizing tourists and being valueless...&#10;&#10;Every player, after having seen the various castles, can declare what was seen, by showing his signs &ldquo;picture&rdquo; or &ldquo;ghost&rdquo;.&#10;Were there gloomy presences or only old and powdery family portraits? But beware, not all declarations are reliable: many players could lie... or perhaps all of them?&#10;&#10;In the first phase players must decide whether in that very turn they will lie or tell always the truth.&#10;Mrs Truelight could help everyone to find out actual results of such decisions, but she is greedy and therefore she will reveal precious indications only to best bidders.&#10;&#10;Caution is vital: the ones who pay more money too early will turn out having less funds to offer in the second phase auction for castles. Shall we have enough money to steal best ones to our competitors? Every castle has a score according to the number of ghosts by whom it is haunted.&#10;&#10;The player who succeeds in guessing where ghosts are and their exact number will achieve optimum business, becoming able to buy what he/she wants in a fairly relaxed mode and allowing himself/herself even the luxury to mislead adversaries with fake offers.&#10;&#10;Ghost for sale is a clever deductive game, with a subtle bluffing component, for 3 to 5 players, suitable for all the families, but with a strategy component that will not leave indifferent even most experienced gamers. In the box there are 8 special cards to be used for &ldquo;special auctions&rdquo;, which constitute a set for playing advanced rules games and which, randomly combined to the various castles and manors, guarantee rounds which are always exciting and different.&#10;&#10;English, German and Italian Rules available for download here&#10;&#10;",

Their goal is either to gain 10 VP or to destroy all SkyNet units and factories. Victory points can be gained while exploring, by locating human survivors in pacticular.&#10;&#10;And one player takes control over SkyNet forces. They have to either destroy all resistance units or to find and kill all survivors (which are usually found by resistance itself). SkyNet can also explore territory just to find anything usefull for Resistance and destroy it for nothing.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, one random map token is placed for every map area hidden. Later these tokens can be explored with different results. One SkyNet factory and a few units placed in one of six ruined cities. Resistance starts in 3 different random cities. Human units are generally weaker than SkyNets' (both sides have 4 types) but better for exploration and interception.&#10;&#10;Movement, exploration and other actions can be done by playing action cards from hand. Cards also can be traded for new cards.&#10;&#10;Combat can be initiated either using specific cards or when units of one side enter area with enemy forces (interception takes place if defender desires). In both cases initiator gets first shot using dice, then remaining units fire back once.

    "Description": "Patton&rsquo;s First Victory is an all-new echelon of wargame, providing a simple, yet accurate, simulation of World War II&rsquo;s Tunisian campaign and featuring a mere four pages of rules that elegantly recreate the battles fought between Allied and Axis forces.&#10;In addition to its simplicity, Patton&rsquo;s First Victory is marvelously accurate, featuring the full order of battle of historic divisions that were engaged during the struggle for Tunisia, as well as allotments of &ldquo;support assets&rdquo; that can be assigned to those divisions to increase their combat strength. Should the Axis player assign his few support assets to his best divisions to form powerful strike groups, or should he use them to augment his light units desperately defending the ridges?&#10;Patton&rsquo;s First Victory portrays all the elements of the actual campaign. The terrain is historically accurate; every town and airbase is precisely correct, and every unit is rated with precise combat factors. You will see why the 10th Panzer Division was so formidable, and how Patton was able to defeat the vestige of the famed Afrikakorps.&#10;The entire Tunisian campaign can be played in a couple hours, yet Patton&rsquo;s First Victory remains a game requiring operational skill. The Allied player must maintain the momentum and keep pressure on the Axis, fighting for a breakthrough to capture enough of the important Tunisian harbors to win the game. The Axis player must manage his scant yet potent army and air force to repel the attacking Allies, all the while watching for opportunities to counterattack and throw the throw them back in disarray.&#10;Patton&rsquo;s First Victory is a quick and easy game of the 1943 campaign between Allied and Axis forces in North Africa during World War II. It&rsquo;s spring 1943; the Allies have arrived to liberate Tunisia from the Axis, but the Axis soldiers are experienced and commanded by some of the best generals of the war. If Axis forces can hold on in the Tunisian mountains, they can delay the progress of the war in the west indefinitely. If the Allies can capture the Tunisian harbors, they will cut off the Axis from all supply and escape.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;17 x 22 (43 x 56 cm) terrain map&#10;114 die-cut counters&#10;One Rules booklet for this series&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Captain's Gambit is an asymmetric Shakespeare-inspired hidden role game.&#10;&#10;Your secret objective depends on which alien captain you're given - for example, the technomancer Prospero must stockpile power, brainmother Lady Macbeth must bloody her hands, and Hamlet must assassinate a specific target.&#10;&#10;Each player has one captain card and two permit cards. Permit cards correlate to permit actions, which are powerful moves that can be bluffed. Since permit cards stay face-down, players can declare any action they would like - but other players can challenge that declaration if they're doubtful.&#10;Whoever loses the bluff call takes 3 damage!&#10;&#10;Since each captain's win condition is different, this means players can form unlikely alliances or make intriguing offers to get ahead. Captain's Gambit encourages players to engage in a high amount of table talk and persuasive efforts in order to win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Almost all of the different ranks of cards have special effects, such as &quot;remove all number cards from the table&quot;, &quot;counter an effect just played&quot;, &quot;take any card from the scrap pile&quot;, &quot;see your opponents cards&quot; etc.&#10;&#10;The game is somewhat similar to Magic: the Gathering but likely much older.

During the campaign the Vistula River and the Carpathian Mountains proved to be effective geographic barriers.

Each player receives fifteen tiles. Each tile shows a monster on one side, and another monster on the other side (each possible duo of six monster types once). Each round, a card is drawn, that graphically shows which monsters have been invited to the party, such as: &quot;exactly two large red monsters&quot;, &quot;at least one small blue monster&quot;. In higher difficulty levels the tasks are fuzzier, such as &quot;more yellow monsters than red monsters&quot; or &quot;just as many blue as fat monsters&quot;.&#10;&#10;After revealing a card with the task description, all players attempt to flip their tiles in real time, so that the invited monsters are shown. The first player that succeeds in doing so collects the most valuable diamond. Other players can still score, too, if they manage to complete the task within the alotted time, started by the first player who (thinks he) fulfilled the task.&#10;After nine rounds, the player who collected best-scored diamonds is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game comes with six difficulty levels, each level having 18 tasks on the cards.&#10;&#10;",

The British launched an expedition to avenge that defeat, and that led to another campaign in Central Asia&rsquo;s Great Game. Khyber Rifles is a two-player game of that fateful year in Afghanistan.&#10;&#10;One player commands British forces, including the regiments and battalions forming the armies of Gens. Nott, Pollock and Elphinstone. The other player controls various Afghan tribal contingents, led by Akbar Khan. The point-to-point map covers eastern Afghanistan and India&rsquo;s Northwest Frontier area, including the famous Khyber Pass.&#10;&#10;Khyber Rifles is part of the Hand of Destiny mini-game series. Each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate movement abilities, combat bonuses and historical events. Accessing the right card at the right time lets the player concentrate forces to win that great victory against all odds&mdash;or perhaps go down to inglorious defeat. Some of the cards include: Ambush, Jirga Loya, Mad Dash and Relief Force.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. There are special rules for: elite British units, fanatic Afghan Ghazis, camp followers, Shah Shujah&rsquo;s army, and irregular units such as Broadfoot&rsquo;s Pioneers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Turtle Race Mini, players race turtles to be the first to the finish line.&#10;&#10;Arrange all turtle tiles in a row. Each player gets a secret color (black is neutral so it does not get assigned) and 5 movement cards (no lettuce cards, also included in the deck).&#10;&#10;Play one card and perform the action, then redraw. Motion cards let you move the given (color or wild) turtle 1 to 3 steps forward or back. Moving means you place your turtles above other turtles and possibly move whole stacks(turtles on top of turtles are also moved). Do not move further than the front or end of the row. Shaking cards let you drop all turtles from the back of the selected turtle (place them behind the turtle). Lettuce cards are placed in front of the turtles. Game ends as soon as the third lettuce appears on the table. The player whose turtle is in the lead (or on the bottom of the stack if tied) wins.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game variant, the first two turtles are taken out of the race and the remaining ones take part in the next race. You separate the turtles in the stacks by placing them in a row behind the turtle at the bottom in the same order as they were in the stack, with the lower ones first. The advanced game ends as soon as two turtles of the same color have finished the race.&#10;&#10;Part of the &quot;backpack games&quot; series from Egmont Polska.

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;In early November 1942, American and British forces stormed ashore in French-ruled Morocco and Algeria, beginning a campaign to press the Axis into a small bridgehead around the ports of Tunis and Bizerte in Tunisia. The U.S. Army had its first exposure to combat in the European Theater, while fresh British forces joined the veteran Eighth Army against the Axis. French troops fought first against the Allies, then with them. Inside the shrinking perimeter, German and Italian units continued to offer fierce resistance.&#10;&#10;An Army at Dawn is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles.  The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with many others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too).  There are 517 playing pieces: ultra-thick, scorchless, sootless laser-cut. You do not need any other game to play any of its 40 scenarios. Design is by Mike Perryman, creator of Liberation 1944 and Kursk: Burning Tigers among other titles.&#10;&#10;",

To win, the Stormcast Eternal player must first find the Winch tile, and then activate the Hyshian Luminator, banishing the undead. The Chainrasp player wins if all the Stormcast Eternals are slain.

First installment in Moments in History's &quot;T3&quot; series, which has subsequently become the &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot; series for GMT Games. Hallmarks of the system are ease of play and the &quot;fog of war&quot; element.&#10;&#10;Contrary to the playing time above this game takes about 6 hours to play unless their is an earlier sudden death decision.&#10;&#10;Features C3I points used to generate the number of units that can be activated to move and the number of attacks that can be made during each segment.  There are three segments per turn in which each player must begin by deciding whether they will move and then attack or attack and then move.  Not only is combat strength compared but also a unit's tactical rating when resolving combats.  The side with the higher tactical rating gets to draw more random chits most of which have beneficial drms for that side. To a limited extent combat losses can be converted into retreats and enemy retreats can occasionally result in an additional advance for the attacker.  Occasionally, extreme die rolls allow additional spontaneous activities.  ZoCs are hard except friendly units allow tracing supply through them.  Loss of supply reduces unit effectiveness and can result in attrition.  Victory is determined mostly by units losses but also the Soviet control of objective cities and the presence of even one friendly unit on the other players side of the Donets river provides a healthy number of VPs.  Both players begin with units in this position and so cancel each other out.&#10;&#10;All in all it is a tense game.  The Russian player with the benefit of hindsight can avoid many of the hazards of the original campaign by not over extending himself.&#10;&#10;Republished in Command Magazine Japan #56.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "SGK Veto 2ed is the second edition of this title and the first Polish CCG game set in the historical times of the 17th century. Basically this game is a duel, but the rules introduce also other ways to win - dimplomacy, intrigues and using military force. At once up to 5 sides - factions - can play.&#10;&#10;The plot of the game is settled in the historical reality of the 17th century, Poland's heyday, the times of the gentry, covering Europe and Asia. The designers also referred to the Polish historical and contemporary prose, like Henryk Sienkiewicz (Nobel prize winner) and Jacek Komuda.&#10;&#10;In 2009 Ku&#197;&#186;nia Gier became the publisher of the game. This new publisher reprinted the basic decks designed by Wydawnictwo Imperium and added a new starter deck of Osmanowie (the Ottoman Empire - this faction was introduced by the Casus Belli expansion in boosters). Ku&#197;&#186;nia Gier released their first own expansion in 2009 and further two in 2010. The line is constantly expanded with new products.&#10;&#10;Veto CCG has now seasons of the game (each season starts with releasing a set of sarter decks and contains next three expansions), which is connected with rotation of legal cards in the organized tournament system. So far Veto has had three full seasons: basic season (Veto 2ed, Charakternicy, Casus Belli, Ogniem i Mieczem), Warcho&#197;&#130;y i Pijanice (eng. &quot;Dipsos and Troublemakers&quot;, inlcuding Ogniem i Mieczem (partly), Do szabel, R&#196;&#153;baj&#197;&#130;owie, Krwi) and Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci (&quot;Spies and Dimplomats&quot;, including W niewoli, Spiskowcy, Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo). The current season is called Czarty i Upiory (&quot;Devils and Ghosts&quot;) and will introduce a supernatural element to the otherwise historical game.&#10;&#10;In July 2014 Historical Games Factory became the new publisher of the game.&#10;&#10;In Veto 2ed. there are 5 factions - decks (in the first edition there were only 4):&#10;&#10;- Awanturnicy&#10;- Dworscy&#10;- Radziwi&#197;&#130;&#197;&#130;owie&#10;- Wi&#197;&#155;niowieccy&#10;- Osmanowie (added by the Casus Belli expansion and fully present in the game until Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo, now illegal in most organized tournaments)&#10;&#10;SGK Veto 2ed. has also several expansions with brand new cards:&#10;&#10;Basic season:&#10;- Veto 2ed.&#10;- Charakternicy&#10;- Casus Belli&#10;- Ogniem i Mieczem&#10;&#10;Warcho&#197;&#130;y i Pijanice:&#10;- Do szabel&#10;- R&#196;&#153;baj&#197;&#130;owie&#10;- Krwi&#10;&#10;Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci:&#10;- W niewoli&#10;- Spiskowcy&#10;- Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo&#10;&#10;Czarty i Upiory:&#10;- Cmentarzysko&#10;- Danse Macabre&#10;- Malleus Maleficarum&#10;&#10;Potop:&#10;- Initium Calamitatis Regni&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s been a ruff day and your dogs are barking. As one of the local dog walkers, it&rsquo;s time to get these pooches back to their homes.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, it sounds like the friendly neighborhood mutt is on the loose again and he loves to play! If you want to get home before everyone else, you&rsquo;ll need to give that good boy a bone to distract him or wind up chasing your dogs all over the neighborhood.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;&#10;The game is played over three rounds (for a faster game, just play one round). Each round, you&rsquo;ll take turns playing cards until someone goes out by playing their last card.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you must play either a dog that matches the number, color, and/or breed of the dog previously played, or an action card. If you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll have to draw a card! If you are quick, you&rsquo;ll even be able to play certain cards when it&rsquo;s not your turn! At the end of each round, points are tallied for cards remaining in each player&rsquo;s hand. After three rounds, the player with the fewest points wins and is chosen as The Most Paw-some Dog Walker!&#10;&#10;It's a howling good time for everyone!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Story so Far&hellip;&#10;    &#10;        Your squad of Special Ops soldiers has been sent on a Top Secret mission to a remote part of South America. Before you can reach your Landing Zone, your chopper crashes, many kilometers away from your destination. Salvaging what you can from the wreckage, armed with a GPS uplink, your wits and weapons, you must fight your way through an unknown and hostile jungle. Your only possibility for survival: &#10;Get to da Choppa!&#10;&#10;About the Game-&#10;    &#10;Get to da Choppa! is a solo dice game that&rsquo;s free to print and play.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to get your Squad through several areas (called Zones) of the wild jungles of South America. However, this area of the jungle has fallen victim to a number of hostile forces. Drug Lords, UFOs, invisible alien hunters, Nazis, zombies, headhunters, dinosaurs; any jungle action movie trope you can think of you&rsquo;ll have to face and try to survive. You will need to balance moving, stealth, foraging for supplies and combat to survive. The only way to win is to Get to da Choppa before your squad is wiped out.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you roll nine dice and can re-roll and keep any dice you like up three total rolls. You place the dice on your Squad sheet to follow the turn's order and show how many dice you have placed to a certain activity that turn. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of where all the dice rolled are placed, and what they mean.  &#10;&#10;     Enemy Contact- Your Squad encounters an obstacle or enemy that needs to be dealt with.&#10;     Salvage- Some of your Squad forages for supplies and ammo.&#10;     March- Your Squad moves along your path towards the next Check Point.&#10;     Stealth- Your Squad attempts to move slowly and avoid detection from an Enemy Contact.&#10;     Engage- Your Squad readies for combat! Lock and Load!&#10;     Command- Can be used as an additional die during each of the Salvage, March, Stealth and Combat phases. They can also be used to re-roll any single die on the Salvage, Combat, Injury, Recovery or Supply Shortage tables.&#10;&#10;&#10;The drama of the story unfolds by balancing the lives of your squad with the risks and combat you are willing to get into, as well as ensuring enough resources. Each turn brings you closer to the next checkpoint, where you will need to rest, restock, and heal up. The game ends by reaching the fourth Zone's Checkpoint where the extraction Chopper is waiting to take what's left of your squad back to safety. Victory conditions are calculated by a simple number of Squad members survived, or a slightly more involved scoring system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Results of the 2020 Solo PnP Design Contest for Get to da Choppa!&#10;&#10;Best Overall Game: 19th&#10;Best Easy to Build Game: 9th&#10;Best Original Artwork: 10th&#10;Best Game Designed in Contest Timeframe: 5th &#10;Best New Solitaire Designer: 8th&#10;Best Push Your Luck/Survival: 3rd&#10;&#10;",

While all actions from the player boards eventually get executed, the order of action execution is usually not easy to predict. Players will have to place cards carefully to try and maximize their chances!&#10;&#10;Every round, after a roll of two dice, all players execute two actions on their boards based on the roll result. Indicated actions get marked so that they cannot repeat until a reset happens. If in a subsequent round, the action in given row is already marked, player marks and executes the first available action to the right. When a row is fully marked, player removes all the markers from the row to start over!&#10;&#10;During the game, players are often allowed to mark and execute additional actions on their boards to get more resources and possibilities. Also, while players move along the score track during the game, they reach different regions with nearby towns. Trading with a town is another way of managing the tableau and scoring points, but sometimes, one will also have to face a villain!&#10;&#10;Once the game is over, the one who has collected the best set of cards with buildings, animals, and scoring symbols is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Kiwara, two groups of animals compete for space in the savanna, claiming points when they dominate a territory, but the value of a space depends on who's in it!&#10;&#10;The game board features six territories &mdash; two each of three, five, and seven spaces &mdash; with rivers dividing all of the territories. Each player has fifteen animals tokens in their color. One player places the totem on a space outside the 6x5 board, then players alternate taking turns. On a turn, a player:&#10;&#10;&bull; Places one of their animal tokens in an empty space in the row or column adjacent to the totem.&#10;&bull; Moves the totem 1-3 spaces clockwise. (If all spaces in these rows or columns are full, the player moves the totem to the first row with an empty space.)&#10;&#10;If a lion is placed orthogonally adjacent to zebras or gazelles, then the zebras are turned face down (yum!) while the gazelles are returned to their owners. If a player must place a zebra or gazelle adjacent to a lion, these tokens are placed face down.&#10;&#10;If you place a crocodile across the river from a gazelle, you can exchange these tokens. (The crocodile attacks, and the gazelle bounds to safety.) You can swap the location of a crocodile many times this way.&#10;&#10;Whoever places the token that fills the first savanna claims the Okapi card, which is worth 5 points at game's end. Once the board is filled, determine who has the most tokens in each territory; face-down tokens are counted to determine majority. Whoever wins a territory scores points equal to the value of all face-up animals in this territory: zebras 6, gazelles 2, elephants 5, lions 1, and crocodiles 0. Whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;While the base game of Kiwara is the same as the earlier Dr&ocirc;les de Z&egrave;bres, the game includes a double-sided game board. If you use the &quot;free play&quot; side of the board, to set up you use the river sticks included to create six territories of sizes 3, 5, 7 or 9, thereby creating a fresh layout for each game.&#10;&#10;Instead of using the Okapi, you can shuffle the ten-card reinforcement deck and give the player who completes the first savanna a random card; the player can use the bonus action on this card at any point during the game. With players of differing skills, the more inexperienced player can start with a card or two at random to level the odds.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "PARKS Memories is a strategic matching game for two or more players offering simple and flexible gameplay. Parks are represented in tiles laid out in a grid across the table face down. Gameplay includes four simple steps: reveal two tiles; choose one of the revealed tiles and place it in front of you; add a new tile to the board; lock one of the tiles with the hiker token. Gameplay passes from person to person until one player or team has collected three sets of matching park tiles in front of them.&#10;&#10;Memories captures a depth of strategy in player abilities which can be activated by finding matches of PARKS resource icons when you reveal tiles. There are a variety of ways to enjoy the game. Play a head to head game, or on teams. Expand the grid size for a bigger challenge, or simplify the game to a memory game without player abilities for younger gamers.&#10;&#10;PARKS Memories: Plains Walkers is one of three editions of PARKS Memories, highlighting the national parks of the plains region of the United States. It features a uniques set of player abilities. Collectively all three editions showcase every US national park.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Part of TSR's minigame series.  From the rulebook...&#10;&#10;&quot;They've Invaded Pleasantville&quot; minigame is a two player wargame of secret invasion by Space Invaders.  One player, the Alien player, moves the Alien-controlled and uncontrolled pieces, and the other player, the Town player, moves the Town-controlled pieces.  There are 12 game turns in this game. In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.&#10;&#10;The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she &quot;takes over&quot; more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.  The Alien player, in short, will try to create a large army of townspeople-zombies, eliminate any opposition, and occupy Pleasantville as a base of operations.  The Town player will try to convince the townspeople that there is an alien menace in the town, and will attempt to fight any Alien-controlled townspeople encountered.  With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlled&quot;zombies&quot;, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.&#10;&#10;The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control. Each turn, the alien player may use misdirection and bluffing to fool the town player as to where the alien mind control is taking place. Real townspeople are &quot;swapped out&quot; with alien controlled ones and the town player must stop the spread of control sooner than later. A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars. Especially entertaining is the random Townsperson Movement table that simulates the day to day migration of unsuspecting townspeople as they go about their business in Pleasantville.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "7 is a simple war game for two players based on the mechanics used in the boardgames 111: Alarm dla Warszawy and 303. The game takes us back in time to the Polish-Soviet war in 1920. One of the players is the commander of the 7th Fighter Escadrille &bdquo;Tadeusz Ko&#197;&#155;ciuszko&rdquo; (combined mostly by American pilots) defending Lwow during the Battle of Lvov in the middle of August 1920. Polish player has access to three Ansaldos A-1 &bdquo;Balilla&rdquo; fighters trying to push back waves of Soviet cavalry. He uses special dice to attack soviet units and bombs that he can refill in three airbases. Every time the cavalry is hit the unit spreads and loses turn. Soviet player is the commander of 1st Cavalry Army, he uses ten cavalry units to reach his goal of taking Lvov and spreading the communism throughout Poland and then as the next step whole Europe. The cavalry has limited options of attacking aircraft although by using on movement he can defend during the attack and fire one shot at attacking Polish fighters, with a little bit of luck he can even destroy it. Polish Air Forces mission is to defend Lvov  by delaying the attacks of cavalry till the end of  18th August when the Soviet Army decides to withdraw and continue their attack towards Warsaw. The game ends when the Soviets are out of time or they managed to capture Lvov. The name of the game &ldquo;7&rdquo; evokes one of the escadrilles, which pilots where mostly American airmen, lead by Merian C. Cooper&mdash;the man who later created the iconic &quot;King Kong&quot; movie&mdash;volunteering to serve and protect Poland during the Soviet war. This makes &ldquo;7&rdquo; the prequel of 111 and 303, showing the beginning of Polish Air Forces.&#10;&#10;The game includes two variants: basic game and additional rules for intermediate and advanced players, allowing tallying of points and comparing scores.&#10;&#10;",

All other players have the option of discarding their penguins or keeping them in a face-down pile. Players then draw 0, 1 or 2 cards to refill their hands based on the number of cards they played: 0, 1 or 2+.&#10;&#10;When the game-ending floe is revealed, the game ends and players discard their hands. Players then compare their ice floe total with their penguin points (the cards collected face-down). If the totals match, the player's score is the sum of penguin points. If the player has more floe points, he subtracts the difference from his penguin score; if he has more penguins than floe, he subtracts twice the difference from his penguin score. High score wins, with the number of floe cards in hand breaking ties.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "During the so called Spanish Golden Age, some of the most influential literary figures gather in Madrid. They are here to compete for acceptance amongst the general public and gain admiration and respect from fellow writers.  Success within these circles requires extreme levels of merit, however Lope de Vega has organised a public competition, in honor of San Isidro, so that novice poets can rub shoulders with the greats and perhaps even earn a place amongst them.&#10;&#10;In El Soneto players take the role of these novice poets who aspire to win Lope de Vega&rsquo;s competition. In order to do this, each player must choose letter cards that are displayed within the famous gossip mills of Madrid, and with them they must create words for three rounds whilst respecting the grammatical rules that each of these rounds permits. Prestige will be given in a number of ways to players for their words: direct points for the number of letter cards used; favor of the benefactors if the word begins with one of the three letters that the benefactors have asked for; support of the writers if the word has employed one or more of the permitted literary devices; or they can advance on the Soneto marker if their words rhyme.&#10;&#10;The literati and the benefactors that each player has earned throughout the game will be awarded additional prestige points at the end, in addition to the level reached on the rhyme marker. He who achieves the most prestige points is declared the winner of the competition.&#10;&#10;Description in Spanish:&#10;En su Viaje al Parnaso, adem&aacute;s de a Lope de Vega, Quevedo o G&oacute;ngora, Miguel de Cervantes fue reclutando a otros muchos literatos para luchar contra los malos poetas; &iquest;te habr&iacute;a gustado formar parte de semejante grupo?

    "Description": "The boy did not seem completely normal. Very pale and paranoid. Vigilant citizens were concerned and contacted police, who followed the boy to a nearby townhouse.&#10;&#10;During the game, you must imagine that you are a plainclothes police officer. You have entered a house without a warrant, although the boy seemed a bit reluctant to let you in. He looks to be around 12 years old and seems to be home alone.&#10;You just want to have a look around and, perhaps, chat with his parents.&#10;&#10;The Home Temple is a free 18-card mini-game, that is available at game conventions, in stores, and as a download for print&rsquo;n&rsquo;play. It serves as an introduction to the 50 Clues universe.&#10;&#10;50 Clues is an immersive puzzle game that offers the experience of an escape room, but in a format that can be played at home. You combine objects, solve puzzles and decipher codes to complete the story. A smartphone or tablet keeps track of the solutions and provides multistep hints if the need arises.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Ravenous River, each player takes the role of an animal trying to cross the river. The roles are hidden, so you don't know which players are predator or prey. Be careful not to end up on a boat with the wrong animal, or you'll end up as its lunch! Use your feral cunning to trap your prey on the same boat for a tasty treat while you cross the river. The player who scores the most points by crossing the river, eating their prey, and avoiding being eaten themselves wins!&#10;&#10;In more detail, Ravenous River includes seven animals, with each animal (e.g., horse) having a predator (bull) and a prey (hound). At the start of each round, each player secretly receives an animal card, and they want to feed that animal and get it safely home. Shuffle seven animal cards, then place them face down in a row on the riverbank. Place two boat cards near this bank; each boat can hold at most two animals. Deal each player two action cards. On a turn, a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Places an animal: The player looks at animal card, then either places it face up on a boat or discards an action card and places it face down on the riverbank again.&#10;    Moves an animal: The player discards an action card, then either moves an animal from a boat to the bank or from the bank to a boat.&#10;    Plays an action card: The player discards an action card and performs that action.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player has no cards in hand at the end of their turn and both boats are full, players simultaneously vote on whether to end the round or not. If they do end it, players first see who eats whom on the riverbank, then who eats whom on each boat, then they unload the animals at home on the far side of the river, then again see who eats whom. Each animal scores 1 victory point (VP) for each animal eaten, unless it was eaten in turn in which case the point passes to its predator. Surviving animals score 1 VP on the bank and 2 VP at home.&#10;&#10;If a single player has 6 or more VP, the game ends and that player wins. If no one has more than 6 VP or multiple players are tied with 6 or more VP, then the game continues for another round.&#10;&#10;",
