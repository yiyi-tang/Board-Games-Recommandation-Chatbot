The game has a deck of 40 cards ranked Ace to 10, in four suites; Fuel, Bio-chemistry, Securities, Grain. Every card also has a Bonus or Penalty. Some cards have a special ability, activated when in a player's hand or when showing as a table card. Otherwise, text on cards is for flavour.&#10;&#10;This game also has a secondary pot, the Bank. The winner of a round gains a bonus from the bank, the losers (players who didn't fold, still active in the round) pay penalties to the Bank. The bonus and penalties depend on table cards. Therefore, in this game, players are allowed to fold whilst others check, since a player may want to get out of the round when they see the penalties.&#10;&#10;The Bank also serves as the game timer. There are three Banks made at the start of the game. Each time a Bank is depleted, the next Bank starts but the minimum bet is raised. When the third Bank is exhausted, the game is over.&#10;&#10;The text on the cards is fairly simple (for example: 'you don't have to pay the penalty as the loser' or 'the bonus values for Grains is doubled this round&quot;. So whilst a player might use a crib-sheet, this would give away their Poker hand. Using paste-ups on the cards would be better for foreign players.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;Themed on investors. Game mechanics based on Texas Hold-em poker. One major feature is, in addition to players' bet, you may gain bonus chips or pay penalties depending on your hands and/or community cards.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#155;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#179;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#231;&#172;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#153;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#190;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's a Gilded Age of unmatched prosperity. A growing merchant class and restless nobility demand even higher levels of craftsmanship. It also doesn't hurt that gold was just discovered in some nearby underground caverns.&#10;&#10;In this age of new wealth, the Queen is more popular than ever. Queen Gertrude has even announced that non-royal versions of the recent Jubilee gifts may be made available to the public. An enthusiastic spirit of pride fills the realm, blinding citizens to a much darker element creeping into the kingdom...&#10;&#10;King's Forge: Gold adds lustrous gold dice and luxurious new items to King's Forge. In addition to new golden items, all 30 of the original Queen's Jubilee expansion items have been re-balanced and ranked for the main deck. In total, the Gold mini-expansion adds 39 items to the main crafting deck (the most added by any expansion, even over the base game&mdash;which adds 33 items). Some of these items even have crafting requirements above 6+! Additionally, 9 new Gather locations represent the age across three themes; 3 gold-related (Fool, Gilder with an anvil icon, and a Gold Mine Docks card), 3 prosperity-related (Brewery, Warehouse, and Wishing Well), and 3 nefarious elements cards (Dark Forge, Rogue, and Sorcerer).&#10;&#10;Modular rules and scenarios introduce new and different experiences that can soften the game for casual play (addressing loss aversion/wasted effort), speed up play (e.g. everyone starts with a Gold die), or modify decision space (e.g. new win conditions&mdash;crafting for a Guild, or racing to craft a Dragonfly Charm). This expansion is aimed squarely at fans of the base game and new players looking for an exciting entry point to King's Forge with a major boost of items and new ideas.&#10;&#10;",

They are claimed by players and are worth gag points. In order to be claimed the player must move his pawn onto that card and discard 2 Kid cards of the indicated type. &#10;-   The Kid Deck - There are 2 basic types of Kid Cards: main characters and Peanut gallery.  There are 4 sets of main characters: Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy, with 10 identical cards in each set.  There are 12 Peanut Gallery cards each listing one supporting character.&#10;&#10;The board is a 6 X 6 grid with each space containing 1 face-up gag card. As gag cards are claimed during play they are replenished from the Gag Deck. The game ends when a gag card needs to be replaced on the board, and there are none left in the Gag Deck.&#10;&#10;Players start with their pawns in separate corner spaces of the board and with 2 Kid cards in hand.  Players take turns, with each turn comprising 5 phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Draw Phase&#10;-   Draw 2 Kid Cards from the top of the Kid Deck and put them in your hand. If your pawn is adjacent to any opponent&rsquo;s pawns, you may trade Kid cards from your hands. Trades must be agreeable to both parties.&#10;&#10;2.  Roll Phase&#10;-   Roll one die.&#10;&#10;3.  Move Phase&#10;-   You may move your pawn a number of spaces equal to the number you rolled in roll phase OR less. Moves may be orthogonal or diagonal. You may not land in the same space occupied by another pawn though you may move through (past, over) other player&rsquo;s pawns.&#10;&#10;4.  Claim Phase&#10;-   You may claim the Gag card in the space your pawn currently occupies. Each Gag card lists 2 Kid cards that must be discarded in order to claim it. Place the claimed card into your Gag pile.  Replace the gag card you just claimed with the top card of the Gag deck. If there are no Gag cards left, the game ends.&#10;&#10;5.   End Phase&#10;-    Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The secondary character cards in the Kid Deck have a variety of extra uses: &#10;&bull;    Discard 1 card to increase the result of a roll by 1 or 2. &#10;&bull;    Discard 2 cards to draw 3 Kid Cards and discard any 2 from your hand. &#10;&bull;    Discard 2 cards to cause a target Gag card on the board to be discarded and then replaced. &#10;&bull;    Discard 1 card to get a second move roll.  &#10;&bull;    Discard 1 card after you have made a Claim to get an extra Roll, Move, and Claim phase.&#10;&#10;The player with the most gag points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

We do not regard them as the last word by any means, and will always be glad to receive criticism and suggestions based on a reasonable amount of playing experience.&#10;&#10;The rules have been adopted by the Worthing Group for the 1969 Wargamers Championship, and references to the particular requirements of the Championship will be found in the text.  We recommend that the basic points values system be adopted for choosing forces, without course keeping to the 800 points maximum which is the limit for the Championship armies only.&#10; - From the Rules Intro&#10;&#10;User summary (for the second edition):&#10;The Second Edition was published immediately after the first edition, titled War Games Rules 1000 B.C to 500 A.D (1st Edition) and were updated during the Worthing Group for the 1969 Wargamers Championship to expand the applicable eras and associated armies for use in the 1970 and 1971 National Wargames Championships.  &#10;Most of the changes are minor rules changes and clarifications for army unit types in the expanded eras (notably the Egyptian and Assyrian).&#10;&#10;",

Take the role of a master builder and square off against fellow scientists and engineers in a battle of robo-supremacy in KILLBOTS!&#10;&#10;There's a small catch though...&#10;&#10;Each robot has a positive and negative action. Every time a robot attacks it could deal damage, heal a fellow robot, or even steal another player's cards. But maybe something will go wrong and your robot will attack you, or switch sides, or simply explode. Robots are unpredictable - they're more of an art than a science, really. This element of chance keeps the action dynamic and unpredictable, as well as leveling the playing field a bit for new players. Players able to better manage their robots in play and anticipate these events will ultimately come out on top!&#10;&#10;Killbots is a competitive tabletop card game for 2 to 6 players where each player builds and controls an army of imperfect killer robots. The functions of each robot are determined by a custom 8-sided die - effectively making all moves calculated (or uncalculated) risks and keeping gameplay fresh.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns rolling a die and writing the number rolled in any open box--including an opponent's.&#10;&#10;The two numbers in a player's battle zone are multiplied together to determine that player's strength in that battle zone. The player with the highest strength in a battle zone controls it.&#10;&#10;When all twelve boxes are filled, the player who controls two out of three battle zones is the winner.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;Players start with a blank Land, Air, &amp; Sea score sheet, a pen, and a twelve-sided die. (If you don't have a twelve-sided die, any die will do.)&#10;&#10;Play&#10;&#10;In turn, each player rolls a die and writes the number rolled in any open box on either player's side. (Hint: Put high numbers in your boxes and low numbers in your opponent's boxes.)&#10;&#10;When both boxes in a player's battle zone have numbers in them, multiply the numbers together and write the result on the &quot;Strength&quot; blank.&#10;&#10;When both players have a result for Strength in a battle zone, circle the higher number. (Cross out both numbers if there's a tie.)&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;&#10;When all twelve boxes are filled in and all six Strength numbers written down, the player who has higher Strength numbers in at least two battle zones wins the game.&#10;&#10;If each player controls one battle zone and the third is a tie, then the game is a tie.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Valour at Casa Berardi covers the actions around Casa Berardi by the only all French-Canadian unit, the Royal 22nd Regiment.  Commonly called the Vandoos, this unit distinguished itself during World War II.  Casa Berardi features a historical map and 4 scenario mini-campaign.&#10;&#10;This four-scenario pack is played on an 18 x 24, 1&quot; hex custom map, revolving around the French-Canadian Royal 22&eacute; (Vandoo) Regiment's advance towards the &quot;CIDER&quot; crossroads and their valiant defence of Casa Berardi against the Fallschirmj&auml;gers of the 1.Fallschirmj&auml;gersdivision.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;CASLO-1 Onwards: The Vandoos were tasked with advancing up the Orsonga-Ortona Road and capture the &quot;CIDER&quot; crossroads. The Vandoo's C Company, under the command of Captain Paul Triquet led his men towards the crossroad, when they came under heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. Unable to move, the Vandoos were raked merciless by the unrelenting fire and soon casualties began to mount.&#10;&#10;CASLO-2 The Only Safe Place: Supported by the tanks of the Ontario Regiment, the Vandoos set out towards their objective of the &quot;CIDER&quot; crossroads. In their path were men and panzers units of the elite German 1st Fallschirmj&auml;ger Division, who raked the Vandoos with heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. As the Vandoos' casualties started mount, Captain Triquet ordered his men to the only safe place - the stone manor house of Casa Berardi.&#10;&#10;CASLO-3 They Shall Not Pass: Captain Triquet and what was left of his company, along with three Ontario tanks, and Royal Canadian Horse Artillery's FOO, Lieutenant McDonald gathered about the stone manor house of Casa Berardi ready to receive the Fallschirmj&auml;gers attack. Wait long the French-Canadians did not have to wait. The Germans launched piecemeal attacks from the north, east, and out of the gully to the south.&#10;&#10;CASLO-4 Valour at Casa Berardi: At 07.30 hrs, the Vandoos started out for Casa Berardi under heavy shellfire, crossing the &ldquo;Gully&rdquo; at a point deemed &ldquo;its least formidable&rdquo;. Once across, &ldquo;C&rdquo; Company, under the command of Captain Paul Triquet, was ordered to perform a right flanking manoeuvre, which would enabled the remainder of the Battalion to attack Casa Berardi from the front. &ldquo;C&rdquo; Company, apart from Captain Triquet himself, was reduced to a fighting strength of two sergeants and fifteen men, armed with small arms, and a woefully low on ammunition; while the accompanying Ontarios, under command of Major &ldquo;Snuffy&rdquo; Smith, had four tanks left- two of them bogged in the thick mud nearby. Captain Triquet decided that with the Germans to the front, on the flanks, and in behind them, &ldquo;The only safe place was on the objective itself!&rdquo; and with these slender resources, organized his defences against a counter-attack; issuing the order Ils ne passeront pas (They shall not pass!). Surrounded, the handful of men drew back from the crossroads; however, the battle was not yet done. The Germans persisted in trying to overrun the handful of French- Canadians lodged around the farmhouse; launching infantry and tank attacks piecemeal against the Vandoos, as they arrived..&#10;&#10;",

You win and go out of the game with that player. Otherwise you discard and redraw your hand and the game goes on.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#172;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#230;&#133;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#172;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Your HQs can attempt to alter this sequence.  This recreates the random chaos of battlefields.   Players must watch for timing opportunities / threats; and be able to adapt their plans to battlefield conditions. You can order your troops forward but you can&rsquo;t be certain WHEN they will move.&#10;&#10;There are no hexes or areas in this game.  Pieces simply move mini style across the terrain.&#10;&#10;No CRT.  Players simply roll dice to score hits in combat.  Normally, you resolve combat at the end of each turn, after all units have moved.  French Guard and Cavalry units have the special ability to resolve combat immediately during the turn after they move.  Combined with Napoleon's ability to easily alter the turn sequence, this becomes a very dynamic and dangerous weapon.&#10;&#10;The French are badly outnumbered in this battle.  The Austrians have a 4:1 artillery advantage.  The French must exercise patience and caution at first.  A French Cavalry and Guard charge can shatter the Austrian army in one blow, IF unleashed at the right time and place.&#10;&#10;You can play in multiplayer teams (up to 8 players) with each player controlling 1 Corps with restricted communication.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In Pub Battles: Antietam, players fight in this final battle of Lee's 1862 invasion of the north. This system is know for:&#10;&#10;&#10;     fast play time (1.5 hours)  &#10;     simple rules (1 page quick start rules)&#10;     stunning components (real canvas period map with hardwood kriegsspiel style blocks.)&#10;&#10;&#10;Units move by Corps in random order (chit pull).  Your HQs can attempt to alter this sequence.  This recreates the random chaos of battlefields.   Players must watch for timing opportunities / threats; and be able to adapt their plans to battlefield conditions. You can order your troops forward but you can&rsquo;t be certain WHEN they will move.&#10;&#10;There are no hexes or areas in this game.  Pieces simply move mini style across the terrain.&#10;&#10;No CRT.  Players simply roll dice to score hits in combat.&#10;&#10;The Confederates are badly out numbered but in good defensive terrain.  With their backs to the uncrossible Potomac river, there was only 1 route of escape to the south.  If the Federals can cut this link, Lee's army will be forced to surrender, ending the war early.&#10;&#10;-&quot;Antietam  was a blast!  This battle is like a bare knuckle, back alley brawl!&quot;&#10;&#10;You can play in multiplayer teams (up to 14 players) with each player controlling 1 or more Corps with restricted communication.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the designer:&#10;&#10;Solitaire Gin Rummy is a solitaire card game that can be played anywhere because you hold all the cards in your hands. It was described in Games Magazine, June 1998. Unlike other solitaire card games, which require the cards to be laid out on a flat surface, Solitaire Gin Rummy can be played in line at the grocery store, in a theater while waiting for the movie to begin, on a windy beach or on the bus. If you are interrupted, you can bundle the deck into your pocket without losing your place in the game, and take it up later.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed to be as close to Gin Rummy as possible. Your opponent is the joker. Your goal is to &quot;go gin&quot; before the joker appears.&#10;&#10;Place one joker in the deck, and remove the other joker. Shuffle the deck thoroughly. Deal yourself ten cards. Hold them in one hand, and either set the rest of the deck, face down, beside you, or hold it face down in your other hand. This is easier to do if you use miniature cards. If the joker appears in your hand, you can either say you lost that hand, or you can just reshuffle and start over.&#10;&#10;Draw the top card from the deck and put it in your hand. Discard one card from your hand, so that you still have ten cards in your hand. Place the discarded card on the bottom of the deck. The goal is to form &quot;melds&quot; in your hand. A meld is a set of three or more cards that are either all the same kind (eg. all threes) or form a numerical sequence all in the same suit (a straight flush in poker.) If all the cards in your hand are in melds, you have &quot;gin&quot; and have won the hand. If the joker appears before you go gin, you lose.&#10;&#10;Optional scoring and knocking&#10;&#10;If you would like to make the game more like real gin rummy, you can keep score for several hands. The first player (you or the joker) to get 100 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;If you have a gin hand, turn over the cards in the deck one at a time until the joker appears. The number of cards you turn over is your score.&#10;&#10;If the joker appears before you have a gin hand, add up the values of cards you have in your hand that are not in melds, counting number cards at face value and court cards as ten. The total is the joker's score.&#10;&#10;If your hand contains ten or fewer points in unmelded cards, you may &quot;knock&quot;. Stop play and figure the two scores as described above. The one with the higher score recieves the difference in scores. For example, suppose you knock when you have a three and a five unmelded in your hand. Your hand counts eight points for the joker. You count the cards in the deck until the joker appears, and there are ten cards, which counts as ten points for you. Instead of giving ten points to you and eight to the joker, just give yourself two points, (ten minus eight.) If you scored and the joker scored ten, you would give the joker two points.&#10;&#10;If you knock and the joker turns out to have the higher score (that is, there are more points in unmelded cards than there are cards above the joker in the deck), the joker receives 25 bonus points for &quot;undercutting the knock.&quot; If you get gin while playing with this rule, you recieve 25 bonus points.&#10;&#10;I usually don't keep score; it's more fun for me just to play a quick hand. But because there's so much chance involved in where the joker will be, keeping score over several games would give you a better idea of how well you're playing in general. You could have a goal of improving your average over time.&#10;&#10;",
