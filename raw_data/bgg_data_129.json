    "Description": "Zimby Mojo is a co-opportunistic game for 2-8 players that also supports solo play. Each player is the all-powerful shaman of a tribe of ferocious, conniving, vicious little cannibals called zimbies, and each player has a single goal: to become the new Cannibal King. To achieve their goal, each player will have to use their zimbies to infiltrate the current King&rsquo;s compound, kill him, take his Crown, and carry it safely to their tribal board before a rival zimby tribe can do so first.&#10;&#10;In solo play, the player must use their zimbies, scrolls, and strategy to defeat the Cannibal King, evade his thugs, and bring the Cannibal Crown to their tribal board before time runs out. In a multiplayer game, the players must work together to gain access to the Cannibal King&rsquo;s sanctum before they can confront him. Once they kill the King, however, it&rsquo;s every tribe for itself and the player that reaches their tribal board with the King&rsquo;s Crown immediately becomes the new Cannibal King and wins the game!&#10;&#10;Keep one eye on the Crown.  Keep the other on your back.&#10;&#10;WHAT'S A ZIMBY?&#10;Zimbies are vicious, conniving little cannibals.  They are small, stubborn, anti-heroes in a game of control of a land of nasty little creatures.  They are not human: each zimby tribe has followed its own cultural and evolutionary path -- there are humanoid zimbies, avian zimbies, aquatic zimbies, simian zimbies, ursine zimbies, arachnid zimbies, the list goes on!  That's why there's a bunch of reptilian-eyed, orange-skinned, clawed, stick-haired creatures on the box!  The name &quot;zimby&quot; itself derives from a play on words on the word &quot;zombie&quot; and the designer's love of the cartoon character Invader Zim, who he feels exquisitely exemplifies zimby behavior and fanaticism.&#10;&#10;MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CONCEPTS AND ELEMENTS&#10;Each player plays the shaman of a different zimby tribe.  Zimbies are nasty, unruly, conniving little cannibals that follow their shaman with fanatical loyalty.  Each player&rsquo;s goal is to bring about the death of the Cannibal King, steal his fallen Crown, and get the Crown to his tribal board so he can become the new Cannibal King.  To do this, the players will have to:&#10;&#10;1. Get some zimbies onto the main game board (you can&rsquo;t get the Crown without a zimby to grab it and carry it home),&#10;2. Cooperate with at least one other tribe to activate a sigil (you can&rsquo;t kill the King unless you can get to him),&#10;3. Kill the Cannibal King (that&rsquo;s the only way he will give up his Crown),&#10;4. Get the Crown and deliver it to your tribal board (you win the game by becoming the new Cannibal King).&#10;&#10;Part 1 of the game is completely cooperative.  Part 2 of the game is completely competitive.&#10;&#10;CREATURES&#10;There are four creature types in the game: zimbies, obnoxious little cannibals that do a shaman&rsquo;s bidding with ruthless (sometimes inept) fanaticism; zombies, undead meat-puppets; thugs, the Cannibal King&rsquo;s dim-witted, fervently devoted brutes; the Cannibal King, the sadistic yet cowardly overlord of the zimby tribes. Shaman are players and don&rsquo;t count as creatures.&#10;&#10;MOJO&#10;Mojo is &quot;a power that may seem magical and allows someone to be very effective, successful, etc.&quot; (Mirriam Webster).  It is the inexplicable, mystical energy than allows shamans to both impel their zimbies into action and release the powerful magical spells bound in the scrolls they raid from the Scroll Library!  But be warned, mojo is drawn from shamans and zimbies!  The more zimbies a shaman sends forth to kill the Cannibal King and steal his Crown, the less mojo that shaman has available!  Every turn, each player (shaman) generates a small amount of mojo and may also draw forth mojo from zimbies on their tribal board, thereby depleting them of energy for the remainder of the turn and rendering them useless. A shaman may also cannibalize (yes, eat!) their own zimbies for more mojo... Of course, eaten zimbies are dead and gone...&#10;&#10;STACKING&#10;Multiple zimbies can stack to form columns which count as single, giant creatures.  The more zimbies in the stack, the stronger they are but the slower they move.  And the shaman whose turn it is fully controls the column...&#10;&#10;SCROLLS, MOVEMENT, AND COMBAT&#10;Shamans may use mojo to empower scrolls to cast one-off rituals, long-lasting incantations, and blindingly fast witcheries.  These cast magical effects -- beneficial and detrimental -- on the shaman themselves.  Shamans also use mojo to move their zimbies on the main board -- so, the more scrolls a shaman uses the less mojo they have available for movement. Combat is a simple 1d6 &quot;roll-off&quot; with the combatant making the higher die roll dealing a number of wounds damage equal to the difference in the die rolls to the combatant making the lower die roll.&#10;&#10;TIMING&#10;Many of a player's actions are limited to the player's turn, such as spawning new zimbies, turning zimbies into zombies, movement and combat.  Players may extract and use mojo at any time on any player's turn.  So, scroll use is always an option!&#10;&#10;FIRST MOVER STRATEGY&#10;At the end of the round, after all the players have gone, the player with the most undepleted zimbies on his tribal board becomes the first mover on the next round.  That player goes first and play proceeds clockwise from them.&#10;&#10;SOLO&#10;There is also a solo mode, which is not only a fully realized game but also very useful to hone the strategies that you will use in your multiplayer games. But be warned: solo play is limited to 12 turns and your score gets lower the more turns you take.  It's not too hard to win, but it's tough to get a high score!&#10;&#10;HAVE FUN WREAKING HAVOC!&#10;&#10;",

The warring factions are Terra Corps, Scion Imperium, Neo Human Republic, and Feng. With Earth in near ruins, 581 provides the chance for a second Earth, but who will rule? Who will be the first to build a Wormgate and transport their armies through it to conquer the dust of 581?&#10;&#10;During the invasions of 581, the factions built large, interstellar bases to house, control, and deploy troops. These bases are known as Hives. As a player, you take on the role of a commander of one of these Hives, from which you deploy your forces in the fight for control of the ancient alien artifacts and dominance over 581 itself.&#10;&#10;Lost Empires  is a head-to-head, card-driven area control game with a focus on tactical movement and deck design. Each player chooses a faction to play, and using the cards available to that faction, constructs an 18-card deck with which you do battle. You earn artifacts by controlling objectives and destroying elite enemy units augmented with alien technology. Once you have collected sufficient artifacts,  you use them to construct a Wormgate. The first person to build a Wormgate, wins the war for the new sun.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On the morning of July 1st, 1863 a column of Rebel soldiers from Brig. Gen. James Archer&rsquo;s brigade of the Army of Northern Virginia headed down the Chambersburg Pike from Cashtown, PA towards the town of Gettysburg in search of provisions. Since JEB Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry was nowhere to be found, the Confederate column was actually being led by the cannons of Pegram&rsquo;s Artillery Brigade in a rare 19th century deployment of &ldquo;recon by fire&rdquo;. Archer&rsquo;s Division commander, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth, was not worried however &ndash; he had it on firm authority that only militia was in the area and that &ldquo;they would run as soon as we appeared&rdquo;. Upon their approach up to Herr&rsquo;s Ridge to the west of Gettysburg, the dismounted Union cavalry pickets of Buford&rsquo;s 1st Cavalry Division began harassing the approaching butternut columns. As they were driven off and the Rebs crested the ridge, they were confronted with a far larger cavalry force than they had anticipated and they were now hotly engaged in an unexpected encounter. Archer&rsquo;s men, along with the quick-marching soldiers of Brig. Gen. Robert Davis&rsquo; brigade, began a coordinated advance on Buford&rsquo;s horse soldiers. The blue-clad troopers were hard pressed but their carbines allowed them to fire rapidly and from cover. Relief finally appeared at about 9:30 am when Maj. Gen. John Reynolds of Ist Corps rode up to Buford at the Lutheran Seminary. He then famously asked Buford, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, John?&rdquo; Buford&rsquo;s reply was &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s to pay!&rdquo; And from such inauspicious beginnings started one of the greatest battles of history. This first day was to set the tone of the entire three-day Battle of Gettysburg &hellip;. a first day in which ultimate victory or defeat for either side could be traced to the decisions, maneuverings and fighting performances of each army&rsquo;s soldiers and leaders during these initial critical hours.&#10;&#10;The Devil&rsquo;s to Pay! is a game depicting not only the actual events of July 1st at the Battle of Gettysburg, but also what could have happened on that fateful first day. Two players will each command either the Confederate forces of Lt. Gen A.P. Hill and Lt. Gen. Richard Ewell or the Union forces of Maj. Gen. John Reynolds and Maj. Gen. Oliver Howard. The game is played on a gorgeous map of the battle area designed and drawn by Rick Barber, with each hex equaling 250 yards. Formations are multi-counter brigades, with each Strength Point representing about 100 men, with each unit counter representing a group of regiments, apportioned as they were deployed at the battle. The system is a new version of the Blind Swords system, with this implementation emphasizing ease-of-play and accessibility while maintaining the popular spirit of &ldquo;historical chaos&rdquo; represented by the other games in the Blind Swords family. The system utilizes a unique chit-pull mechanic that will keep players on their toes and engaged throughout the entire game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

You&rsquo;ll discover long-lost secrets on uncharted icebergs, sail the seas to find adventure and sunken treasure and delve into perilous caves to find precious crystals and battle fearsome monsters.  Despite the dangers ahead, you won&rsquo;t be alone in your travels. Always at your side, your loyal familiar may help gather resources or jump into the fray to turn the tide of battle. During their travels, heroes will also gain helpful allies, powerful abilities, and rare items. In time, heroes may also build shrines across the map, ensuring their legacy will be long remembered. However, always beware of the cold. Venturing into the icy wasteland is perilous: almost everything heroes do outside the safety of the village will cost them warmth. From time to time, they will need to return to the village to warm up, improve their homestead, purchase upgrades, and prepare for their next big adventure. Will you be the boldest explorer of them all?&#10;&#10;&#10;FLOE features a unique region-to-region movement system that allows heroes and sailboats to navigate the realm with ease; only the natural shapes of the ice and seas are used to determine movement, so you never need to count squares on a grid.&#10;&#10;Additionally, after each game, players unlock Floe Stone stickers they use to track Village progress. By reaching certain milestones, they can open envelopes and unlock new gameplay experiences that expand the realm and reveal long-lost lore about the Crystal Kingdom.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is being distributed by ASGgames.&#10;&#10;SherCo was the first of its kind to be played on a game board representing a composite stadium with a 28 x 28 numbered square grid. It also was the first to rate every player who played in at least one game in a season; and it was the first to provide its unique rating formulae so that customers could rate their own players and teams.&#10;&#10;Each player is rated for batting average, home runs, triples, clutch-hitting, walks, strike outs, hit by pitch, base stealing speed, throwing arm, and fielding range and average; and each pitcher is rated for his ERA, innings of effectiveness, number of complete games, K/BB ratio, and home runs allowed. In the SherCo Plus versions, pitcher ratings include batting average against ratings to further refine pitcher vs. batter control and the accuracy of statistical outcomes.&#10;&#10;All versions of SherCo GrandSlam Baseball (Plus and Classic) still have all of these unique features (including a wind factor; automatic umpire; artificial turf rules; injuries, hit and runs, special and freak events, and error charts; and playing pieces representing the ball, fielders, batter, and base runners so that you can position players exactly where you want them to play and watch every play unfold right before your eyes. There are also Fast Action Charts included with each season to get one-roll accurate results for games between other teams as you complete a season for your favorite team.  The new SherCo Plus variant has expanded pitcher-batter-runner ratings and offers many more realistic play results per chart, including rarities such as catcher's interference.&#10;&#10;Each dice-activated result allows a patented &quot;stop-action effect&quot; to visually occur when a probable hit or probable out batted ball is plotted on a specific square on the stadium's playing field.  As the runners advance, the fielder moves to the ball, fields it and throws to where you want the ball to go in a quick, seamless sequence of turns.  A ball may drop in for a hit or become an out depending on where it is hit, the strength and direction of the wind, and where a defensive player is positioned. Depending on where you are playing, a long fly ball may be caught or go over the fence for a home run, or ricochet off the wall for a double or possible triple. We've even added an optional rule that measures the &quot;hang time&quot; of a fly ball to the outfield.(e.g., will it drop in or will the fielder have enough time to make a fantastic catch?).&#10;&#10;A solitaire or head-to-head game takes only 30-45 minutes to play, depending on the score. SherCo has also re-released its rules supplement for setting up SherCo Leagues of Baseball Simulation (a/k/a SLOBS) for short-season (e.g., 24-game) leagues that you can play with family and/or friends.  Additionally, SherCo offers another set of rules for &quot;Olde Tyme Base-ball&quot; for those interested in playing 1870-1920 seasons.&#10;&#10;Historical and all modern day ball parks have been beautifully redone to include features such as the fountains at Kauffman Stadium, McCovey Cove at A&amp;&amp;T, Fenway's Green Monster, the fans swimming pool at Chase Field, and even the Big Apple Home Run display at Citi Field. Each year (on/about Jan. 1st) SherCo includes the most recently-completed big league season. Also available are many specialty sets of vintage old-time teams, famous world championship series, greatest also-rans, and entire early seasons rating every player who had at least one at bat or pitched to one batter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Crisis: 1914 is a game of international brinkmanship - if you back down too soon, you lose. If you back down too late you lose.&#10;&#10;But you also have hawks and doves in your cabinet and in your government, and out of these conflicting views you must somehow formulate a coherent response to the crisis to win the day and prevent war.&#10;&#10;Designed for 1 to 5 players with a solitaire engine, and playable in under 2 hours.&#10;&#10;There are 3 interrelated concepts at the heart of Crisis: 1914: Prestige, Tension, and Diplomatic Pressure (DP).&#10;&#10;Prestige is how you win. The player with the most Prestige at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Diplomatic Pressure (DP) is how you score Prestige. Every card has a DP value. You apply DP by playing cards.  The player with the most Prestige at the end of a turn earns Prestige points. There are other ways of scoring Prestige points too, but this is the most important one.&#10;&#10;Tension is how you lose. If you end a turn in the red zone on the Score Track you are also creating Tension for your opponents which reflects how close you are to provoking them into mobilizing for war. If you provoke them too far war starts and you lose.&#10;&#10;Cards drive the game.  There are various card types that affect the game as follows:&#10;&#10;Assertion Cards- which uses your nation's power to increases your Prestige&#10;&#10;Consensus and National Interests  Cards- these allow your nation to play more cards&#10;&#10;Diplomatic Back-Channel Cards  - these let you increase DP without increasing Tension&#10;&#10;Caution Cards - allow more cards to be drawn&#10;&#10;In addition, some cards have recurring effects on  Momentum, which stops players from performing certain actions and Reduce Tension which lets you lower Tension in your country.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You and your rivals are competing to land a job that will ask you to create a diverse cityscape for vampire and animal life, provide plenty of blood banks for your citizens, secure contracts, and bring aboard the best specialists in the industry. The race is on to present to the Vampire Council the most organized plans for the city to renovate Transylvania into Siliconvania!&#10;&#10;In SiliconVania, players bid on building tiles and multi-use specialists that provide either one-time bonuses or end-of-game scoring. Players take the building tiles they win, and place them in their 4x4 city grids, juggling different scoring opportunities, and collecting vampire and pet meeples that are looking for places to live! Each round you:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bid on a pair of building tiles to add to your grid. Be careful as once they're down, they're hard to move.&#10;     Bid a specialist card for its ability and to get a new specialist card. Cards with stronger bids have weaker abilities, and vice versa.&#10;     Commit a specialist card for its scoring condition, earning points, but revealing to your opponents which kinds of buildings you really need.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends after eight rounds, at which time everyone's city grid will be full. You score points for having each of the seven building types, a wide network of blood banks, and proper housing for the vampire meeples your specialists bring to town. The vampires also want to make sure all this technological advancement doesn't destroy the biodiversity of their home, so you get points for having a variety of animals and animal meeples on your tiles.&#10;&#10;Your specialists also provide special scoring conditions. Players will also be competing to develop innovations, find artifacts, and build castles and train stations to make their cities even more attractive to the rising vampire population.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They can help their masters to do away with surplus quests, or cause trouble for the other gods by imposing more quests on them. However, take care when you do this because all such acts remain in memory as bad karma. If you manage to complete all of your quests, your accumulated bad karma will be ignored, but if you fail and have quests remaining, they will become a heavy burden.&#10;&#10;You will need to determine when to silently do your chores and when to use your servants to increase your chances of success.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Annual 2011 Issue&#10;&#10;BEYOND WATERLOO is a two-player strategic level game of the Napoleonic Campaign of 1815. Players take the sides of France or the coalition of Allies. The game opens with Napoleon&rsquo;s arrival at Paris following his return from Elba, and includes his efforts to restore France to a war footing, the Allies&rsquo; struggle to revive their anti-French coalition, and the military operations that ensue. BEYOND WATERLOO is played on a mapboard that includes France plus relevant portions of the Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy.&#10;&#10;Where most games on this period focus in on the famous Battle of Waterloo, BEYOND WATERLOO takes in the full scope of the politico-military possibilities inherent in the 1815 situation. The Allies must re-defeat Napoleon. The French must avoid that outcome.&#10;&#10;BEYOND WATERLOO is a full strategic simulation encompassing military, economic, and diplomatic developments. It also introduces new design concepts for a game of this nature. Because of the complexities involved, these rules adopt a layered approach. Initially, the Combat Game introduces only the Battle Development Sequence, which affords a way to conduct combat in a strategic game that is nuanced for the Napoleonic era. This level of rules enables the player to learn the combat system using a scenario that covers only the Battle of Waterloo itself. At the next level, the Basic Game, rules introduce the full movement and administrative systems for a Napoleonic campaign. The scenario involves the military action, economic factors, and force mobilization in this last Napoleonic War. The Advanced Game adds diplomacy, strategy, political action, and emphasizes the mobilization for war. In this long-form, the game begins with Napoleon&rsquo;s return to Paris and the sides must prepare for war before conducting it.&#10;&#10;BEYOND WATERLOO is played on a mapboard divided into areas that regulate the movement of game forces. Pieces represent prominent Commanders on all sides, and armies, corps, and divisions. The players accumulate Resource Points (RPs) and Victory Points (VPs) as the game progresses. RPs procure fresh forces. The VPs influence events in the Campaign of 1815, as well as determining the winner of the game. In the Advanced Game, players also engage in diplomatic and political activity intended either to prepare for war or shape the conditions that will affect the campaign.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Red Dragon/Green Crescent (RDGC) is a strategic-level, intermediate-complexity wargame, with operational undertones, covering hypothetical future conflicts around the southern and eastern peripheries of Asia. The timeframe is the near future, between 2013 and 2021. The game has been designed by Bruce Costello using the CSR Award winning system that first appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics no. 250. It&rsquo;s adaptable for two player, multi-player and solitaire play.&#10;&#10;RDGC expands the original game into a two-mapper covering the Indian Ocean and Middle East, areas strategic to both the US and its allies and the Peoples Republic of China and its allies.&#10;In the game, Chinese forces that may be initially deployed into the Indian Ocean area are few, but they also have one solid ally at start: Myanmar. Besides Myanmar, there are other question marks for US planners. For instance, would Pakistan stand idly by if India allied with the US, given the existential threat they perceive of a US-Indian victory in a war with China? And what about Iran: if that country is ever to make a move to achieve dominance in the Persian Gulf, what better time than during a major war while its winners aren&rsquo;t yet clear? There&rsquo;s also the rest of the troubled Middle East (Egypt-Syria-Lebanon-Israel). That collective totality makes for a wonderfully varied gaming situation. Besides the main scenarios, there are numerous variants and options, adding new dimensions and giving literally hundreds of new possibilities for play.&#10;&#10;Most of the ground units in RDGC represent brigades (&ldquo;brigade combat teams&rdquo; or &ldquo;BCT&rdquo; for the US). The exceptions are the Singaporean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, Philippine, and Yemeni armies. There is additionally one new corps of marines for the PRC. Aircraft are mostly represented by mixed-type combat-wings, though only one aircraft type is shown on each counter. Long-range bombers have their own mono-type units that can&rsquo;t combine operations with the other &lsquo;tactical&rsquo; air wings. Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groups of vessels such as SAGs, subrons or individual capital ships.&#10;&#10;Game turns represent varied amounts of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the &ldquo;operation&rdquo; presently being conducted, from one to three days. An entire match encompasses the first month of the wars being examined. Scenarios include partial and two-map games, some centered on the Korean peninsula, others on the Indo-Pakistan area, and others taking in the entire, huge, arcing region from the Red Sea to Alaska.&#10;&#10;This special edition includes 2 maps (22x34 inches) and 352 counters.&#10;&#10;",

It was developed by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg.&#10;&#10;All Jokers, red face cards, and red aces are removed from the deck. The remaining cards serve as monsters (spades and clubs), weapons (diamonds), and health potions (hearts) valued from 2&ndash;14 (with face cards being valued 11&ndash;14). The rooms of the dungeon are created by laying out cards in groups of four. Progress is made through the dungeon by resolving three of the four dungeon cards in each room. The fourth card serves as the foundation for a new room. Rooms can be deferred if needed, but never twice in a row &mdash; and the player will eventually need to come back to deferred rooms.&#10;&#10;Weapons may be equipped to attack multiple monsters, as long as each defeated monster is of lower value than the last monster defeated with that same weapon. To attack a monster of higher value, a new weapon must be equipped. Monsters can also always be attacked barehanded, but this depletes the player's health for the full value of the monster. Health potions may be used to recover life points up to the maximum starting value of 20. Playing a second potion in succession nullifies the effect of the second potion.&#10;&#10;The game ends in a loss when life points reach zero or in a victory if the player manages to clear all rooms of the dungeon.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dear Vegetagent...&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Welcome to the garden!&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Beetroots have infiltrated our territory, and as skilled vegetagents, we must discover them.&nbsp;They will use different tricks, but we must remain impassive... With teamwork, we will be victorious in this difficult mission! Only one side will remain.&#10;&#10;To start playing, each player takes a private card from the role pile. This card will designate their role (beetroot, vegetagent, or rotten turnip). After this, a single card is drawn from the mission pile that, together with the role card, will designate the current mission (the word we are playing with).&#10;&#10;Now, in order, every player has to say a word related to the mission. While vegetagents will try to find each other, beetroots will try to camouflage themselves as vegetagents, and rotten turnips will try to be the center of attention, as they want to be expelled from the garden (they are special vegetables ^-^).&#10;&#10;After everybody has said a word, a vote takes place. In order, each player can choose either to pass or to expel someone from the garden. The most voted player will be expelled. Rounds of words and votes will be repeated until any of the conditions to end a mission is met.&#10;&#10;After this, everybody receives legupoints according to their performance. The number of missions played determines the length of the game.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The one who has the most legupoints wins the game!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;[ES]&#10;&#10;Querido Agente Horticultor...&#10;&#10;&iexcl;Bienvenido al huerto!&#10;&#10;Las remolachas se han infiltrado en nuestro territorio y, como h&aacute;biles agentes horticultores, debemos descubrirlas.

A continuaci&oacute;n, se coge una &uacute;nica carta del mont&oacute;n de misiones que, junto con la carta de rol, designar&aacute; la misi&oacute;n actual (la palabra con la que estamos jugando).&#10;&#10;Ahora, por orden, cada jugador tiene que decir una palabra relacionada con la misi&oacute;n.

    "Description": "La Glace et le Ciel is a cooperative game for 2 to 4 players, lasting for about 20 minutes. Players will really depend on each other (no one can lead the party) and that there will be tension crescendo during the part... Just be aware that it will be a question of balance between the elements of water (hydrosphere), the Earth (lithosphere) and Air (atmosphere), as well as the Biosphere at the intersection of all three.&#10;&#10;Players will play each their turn in a clockwise direction. On their turn, the player must put one of his cards where they want, provided that the level of the element (Air at the top, Earth in the middle and Water at the bottom). As long as there are still empty spaces on the line of an element, they must be filled, as the next card will be laid over the cards already in place.&#10;&#10;A player can never move a card that has already been placed, however they may cover it with another card. As soon as the placing of a card completes the goal of one or more players, or on the contrary destroys their goal, it is revealed. These are the only clues that are given!&#10;&#10;When the 12 cards of the first generation are played, players reveal their Objective cards and points are scored. We look if there is=f there is a Co2 card in the ice returning as many ice cards as there are CO2 cards visible. Then we look at the sky level: you add up the number of unbalanced objective cards and subtracting the number of those out of balance to obtain the score. The 2nd sky card with the same value to observe the evolution of the CO2 in the sky.&#10;&#10;The philosophy of the game was very largely inspired by the book by Claude Lorius: Voyage dans l'Anthropoc&egrave;ne.&#10;&#10;",

The American player may also control French and Spanish units if those nations enter the war. Instead of the full campaign game, players may also choose to play the shorter scenario that ends in 1779.&#10;&#10;Each inch on the area map, which covers all of North America from the Mississippi River east, including the Caribbean, equals 100 miles. Each brigade-sized unit represents two to four battalions (about 1,500 to 4,000 men). Each game turn represents one year. All the game&rsquo;s charts and tables are printed on the mapsheet.&#10;&#10;The rules contain a total of 13,000 words, which works out to allow two experienced players to finish a game in four to five hours. The system can be fudged for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Rules cover such things as: initiative, rabble rousing, revolutionary political progress, colonial loyalties, the European balance of power, mobilizing new units, forced march, supply and forage, enlistment expirations, leaders, fog of war, fleets, French and Spanish alliances, Hessians, Indian sovereignty, fortresses and sieges, partisans, militia, overrun, massacre, political vs. military victory, frontier warfare, honors of war, grenadiers, light troops, detachments, regulars, and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;Reprinted in Command Magazine Japan #128 in 2016 April.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(Note: The title changed to Rabbit Island in December 2016, thanks to lots of crowd input. Original title was Bunny Island.)&#10;&#10;In Short: Tile-laying modular board game; main mechanic is territorial control.&#10;&#10;In Full:&#10;&#10;You are a rabbit --  one of a wandering band of rabbits in search of a new land to call home. After many months at sea, you and your companions discover a beautiful, uninhabited island. Splitting up into your separate tribes (Blue, Red, Yellow, or Green), you will each set out from Founder's Hill to explore the island, discovering new areas to build up and plant carrots. It is up to you to lead your tribe into the unknown and develop the largest and most successful civilization on the island!&#10;&#10;While it looks cute at first, Rabbit Island reveals itself as a very competitive and multi-faceted game. The primary aim is territorial control, and there are several supporting mechanics that increase your strategic potential, including Action Cards and Harvest Groups.&#10;&#10;Each player starts out with a rabbit pawn, 100 Carrots in Carrot Tokens, and 25 Building Tokens. There are three phases to the game - Explore, Build, and scoring (Conquer!). The main goal of the game is to gain the most Victory Points by the end of 20 rounds of play (or 10, if playing a short game).&#10;&#10;During the Explore Phase, each player lays down the uniquely shaped Map Tiles to create the board and form the Pathway Arrows. Players also get the chance to build their first Camps (lowest building level) on the Territory Tiles.&#10;&#10;During the Build Phase, players now follow the Pathway Arrows around the Island until they reach the Rabbit Holes, which take them right back to Founder's Hill to start following the paths over again. They will Harvest new carrots from their established Territories, and continue to upgrade their buildings - from Camp to Village, and Village to Town - for more Victory Points!&#10;&#10;By upgrading an opponent's Territory, you can wrest away control to become the new Territory Owner! All players will receive Victory Points for each building level they establish, so build build build - but watch out for Earthquakes, Poor Harvests, and more, from the Action Card deck!&#10;&#10;Harvest Groups are two or more adjacent Territories owned by the same player; these areas equal big Harvests for their Owner.&#10;&#10;The Conquer Phase is the scoring phase, where players count the number of Victory Points each building level has netted them. There is one extra point awarded to the player with the most Carrot Tokens, and another point awarded to the player with the largest Harvest Group.&#10;&#10;Who will come out on top at the end? Conquer your opponents and feast with your tribe!&#10;&#10;",

Each feather color has similar scoring conditions, with slight variations from feather to feather. Some may want feather sets, while some may want odd or even numbers of feathers of a certain color. The more complex the card is to score, the more points you can earn.&#10;&#10;During the game, you swap cards to affect both your hand and the central nest, perhaps taking a card an opponent wants, perhaps bluffing desire for a card so that someone else takes it, thereby revealing what you actually wanted. The game ends as soon as the last card is drawn from one of the two draw piles, with players competing in either a single game or a three-game &quot;Pauly's Feather Tournament&quot; as desired.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game where 2-6 people are dueling it out in fencing matches.&#10;&#10;You have poise points which keep track of how &quot;good looking&quot; a character is. When you lose all of your poise points, and are a staggering mess, you can be stuck with a sword for the final blow and be killed.&#10;&#10;You can regain poise by doing things to help make you look better, such as wiping your brow, or tucking in your shirt. You can play cards to enhance your attacks or to defend against an opponents attack. Such as parrying or &quot;strong arming&quot; your way through an opponents defense.&#10;&#10;There are also weapons and items which can be played to affect the game in different ways.&#10;&#10;Similar to a re-themed version of the company's Kung Fu Fighting.&#10;&#10;",

Higher value artifacts will let you play and also pick a summoning card before your opponents, while lower value artifacts will provide additional options during your turn.&#10;&#10;When you choose a summon card, you can place the corresponding creature standee on the board. It also tells you how many and how far your creatures can move this turn.&#10;Each of the 50 unique creatures has its own ability and interacts differently with the other creatures.&#10;Very quickly, the board will be filled with creatures and it will be difficult to guide your friends through the different paths to the tavern.&#10;&#10;These paths are double-sided and can be combined in many different ways. But be aware, more dangerous than the paths are the creatures of your opponents.&#10;Don't worry, if one of your friends gets slain or poisoned in all the chaos, nothing will happen to you. For every friend you lose, you'll get pity power to speed up one of your other buddies.&#10;So stay in the lead or win the game from behind, both are possible.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

(If your card is lower than the lowest number or higher than the highest, place it between the lowest and highest card, then add one of those cards to your display.)&#10;&#10;You can have up to three rows in your display. When you place a second card in a row, you must decide whether the cards in that row will be placed in ascending order or descending, and you stack the cards accordingly. If you cannot or do not want to place a card in a row &mdash; following the ascending or descending order you set up &mdash; take all the cards in a row of your choice, flip them face down into a personal discard pile, then start a new row with your current card.&#10;&#10;To end your turn, draw a card from either pile inside the ring. Once all the cards in the game have been played, score your rows. For each row, multiply the number of cards in that row by the number of cards in the most common color in that row. For each card in your discard pile, score 1 point. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;Germany, 1919. Jan. 1: The opening of the Paris Peace Conference is imminent, but unrest and violence are already spreading throughout Germany and Italy as well as in many other European countries. Communist forces are marching to power, following the example of the Bolsheviks in Russia. The murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht is still a possibility. Will the German Social-Democracy make an evil pact with the proto-Nazi Freikorps to eliminate the two revolutionary leaders from the political theatre? Extreme left and right parties face each other creating disorder and putting the Social-Democratic and Liberal governments under pressure to bring peace to Europe. Democratic forces have about fifteen years to save the Old Continent from the maelstrom of tyranny and totalitarianism. Will they fail as happened in history? The economic crisis of middle classes, the loss of monetary power and wealth, hyperinflation, the never-ending clash with the proletarian forces and the Great Depression ... will all such factors bring the liberal European countries to the verge of bankruptcy? Or will Mussolini and Hitler be left out of the history books?&#10;&#10;Rise of Totalitarianism is an interactive simulation enabling you to explore all such questions. A card-driven strategy game, it reproduces the ideological conflicts and political struggles that led to the establishment of totalitarian dictatorships in Europe throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The game covers the period 1919-1933 and is designed for three players. Each takes the role of one of the three Ideologies &ndash; Social-Democracy, Fascism and Communism &ndash; that struggled for power during the timeline of the game.&#10;&#10;Rise of Totalitarianism offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by 90 game cards. Players exploit historical events and political actions to achieve political supremacy and must face the major crises that upset the European countries of the era. Game cards provide political points that are used by players to plan secret actions on the map by using action chits. Action chits are revealed simultaneously and players can then perform their reactions and activities (propaganda, conflicts, laws and reforms) to influence society, public opinion, political orientation, the economy and the stability of governments.&quot;&#10;&#10;Some more details on the game-play:&#10;&#10;GOAL OF THE GAME &ndash; In Rise of Totalitarianism each player takes the role of an Ideology (Communism, Fascism or Social-Democracy) and has the goal of controlling, for as long as possible, the Governments of the Major Powers represented in the game (Germany and Italy) and of as many Minor Nations as possible (Austria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Yugoslavia). Players earn Victory Points (VP) mostly through the control of the Governments of Major Powers and Minor Nations.&#10;To achieve control of Minor Nations, players try to influence the political allegiance of such countries, or they attempt to destabilize and overthrow their Governments. In both cases players are aiming for the same goal: to draw the ideological orientation of the Governments into their sphere of influence.&#10;To achieve control of Major Powers, on the other hand, players must use deeper and more complex mechanisms. One Ideology controls the Government of each Major Power at any time, with the other two Ideologies working in the background to influence public opinion and destabilize the Government. This causes the Government to fall and force new Elections, which are then won by the Ideology thanks to the shift of mass support towards it. In addition, Social-Democracy has the task of preserving Democracy by ensuring that the Governments are always determined by Elections. Fascism and Communism, in contrast, must attempt to put a totalitarian Regime in power &ndash; each Ideology has its own means and mechanism for doing this. Putting a Regime into power means that Elections will no longer take place in the nation &ndash; thus keeping the Government in power forever &ndash; unless the economic conditions and the stability of the country become so bad that the Regime is overthrown and new Elections can take place.&#10;&#10;GAME-PLAY FUNDAMENTALS &ndash; All activities performed by players (Actions) to pursue their goals in Major Powers and Minor Nations are planned secretly by using Action chits. But planning these Actions is costly. Players pay these costs both by expending the Political Points (PP) provided by Game Cards (see below) and by using cubes, which represent the Funding granted to their Ideologies by bankers, industrialists, agrarians, foreign states, or more simply the political support of bureaucrats and institutions. Funding fluctuates with the fortunes and disgraces of the major political parties represented by the Ideologies, but also with the wealth of nations where these parties operate. Furthermore, Actions can be supported by Leaders, which represent the politicians and statesmen that historically emerged in the period and that are present in the game. Each Leader provides a bonus to the effectiveness of the Action he or she is tasked to accomplish. Such effectiveness is measured by Action Points (AP), that enable the Primary Goal of the Action and a set of additional Bonus Operations to be performed.&#10;&#10;GAME CARDS &ndash; Game cards are a core element of the game-play. There are three types:&#10;&#10;1. Crisis Cards represent the most important historical events that generated troubles &ndash; or opportunities &ndash; during the timeline covered by the game. These cards trigger the Crises that must be resolved by players.&#10;&#10;2. Strategy Cards are at the same time the engine and the fuel of players' operations. Each Ideology has its own Strategy Cards Deck. Strategy Cards provide the Political Points (PP) used by players to plan Actions, but they also enrich the game-play with Events, Political Actions, Laws and further Crises. Events are cards whose effects are applied immediately after the card is played. Political Actions are endeavors performed by players using a card whose effects are applied only after a successful Political Action Attempt (die roll with various modifiers). Laws are cards whose effects cause a permanent change in the game rules. Laws come into effect only after a specific player's Action has been planned and successfully performed, i.e. the Law is &quot;promulgated&quot;.&#10;&#10;3. Coup Cards form an additional deck that is used to simulate a sort of &quot;domino effect&quot; throughout Minor Nations when a minor country's Government is overthrown. These cards add further Crises and Events.&#10;Political Points (PP) are also provided by Crisis Cards and Coup Cards.&#10;&#10;SEQUENCE OF PLAY &ndash; The game is played in Turns, each Turn representing a period of time spanning from one to four years. Every Turn is played according to a strict procedure called the Sequence of Play, which is divided into four Phases:&#10;&#10;1. Players must first determine their Funding. The Funding allows players to choose their position in the Order of Play, which determines the order in which Actions and Reactions are performed.&#10;&#10;2. During the Card Phase, players refill their hand of cards, and reshuffle and add new cards to the decks if required by the Turn.&#10;&#10;3. The Political Phase is resolved in one to three Rounds, depending on the length of the Turn (usually the number of years). During each Round, a Crisis Card is drawn and resolved, players secretly choose and then simultaneously reveal Strategy Cards, apply their effects, plan and resolve Actions and carry out Reactions. At the end of each Round, a Crisis check is performed to verify the outcomes of every Active Crisis.&#10;&#10;4. The Cleanup Phase ends the Turn. Besides the normal end-Turn management activities, during this Phase players must check the Economy of Major Powers and the Stability of Minor Nations and Major Powers. A good Economy (growth, profits, foreign capitals) or a bad Economy (economic crises, depression, debts, war reparations) will, respectively, improve or worsen the Stability of Major Powers.&#10;If a Stability Check fails in a Major Power, Elections must take place to decide on a new Government Coalition in the Major Power. If a Regime rules the Major Power, the Stability check can fail only if the Economy is in the worst condition possible.&#10;If a Stability Check fails in a Minor Nation, the Government is overthrown and the political allegiance of the Minor Nation shifts towards the Ideology that contributed most to the change of the ideological orientation of the Government.&#10;&#10;",

One minute before close, the door swings open. Outside, you see parked school buses and a line of people all the way to the street corner! The high school girl&rsquo;s volleyball tournament has just gotten out, and everyone is craving a smoothie for the ride home. Becca cuts a deal: whoever blends the most smoothies tonight gets free smoothies for a month!&#10;&#10;The Blend Off has begun, and only one can win. There&rsquo;s just one problem: Kevin. Skittish at best on normal days, he flies into a frenzy, grabbing fruit for you from the fridge at random. Grab the fruit, complete the Orders, and blend your way to victory!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OverviewBlend Off! is a game of skill and speed for two to four players from designer Scot Eaton. Master Mixers roll the die (Kevin) to collect fruit to fill Orders from the deck (Becca). When a Master Mixer's fruit matches the Order, they can blend the ingredients and claim the Order for gold stars. There are no turns; everyone plays at the same time in a race for the finish. The winner is the player with the most gold stars at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplayThe actions the player may take at any time are: Collect, Blend, Dump, and Blunder.&#10;&#10;Collect - Roll your die to send Kevin to the fridge for fruit. You may take one of the fruit from the table and put it on one of your Blenders. You don&rsquo;t have to take the fruit; you may reroll the dice until Kevin brings you what you want.&#10;&#10;Dump - You may dump the fruit out of one of your Blenders. Because the fruit is already mixed together, you may not dump just one or two ingredients; you must dump the whole Blender. You may, however, choose to dump one Blender into another, combining ingredients.&#10;&#10;Blend - When the fruit in one of your Blenders matches the recipe on one of the faceup Orders, shout out &ldquo;Blend!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Blunder - If you catch another player make a mistake like calling &ldquo;Blend!&rdquo; with wrong or extra ingredients in their Blender, shout &ldquo;Blunder!&rdquo; They must correct their mistake by dumping their Blender and, returning the Order card for their botched recipe to Becca&rsquo;s deck.&#10;&#10;",

Austria and Russia, when united, have strong armies while England rules the waves and buys influence and allies.

(From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is 1861, and the USA is wracked in Civil War. Great issues are at stake &mdash; slavery, states rights, the preservation of the Union &mdash; but as a British arms manufacturer, you don't care!&#10;&#10;As a profiteer, your aim is to make as much money as possible by supplying the troops needed to fight the war with your factories and by speculating in the bonds issued by the Confederacy and the Union to finance their war effort.&#10;&#10;Profiteers is a strategic speculation game. Players seek to accumulate gold and bonds (the value of which varies according to the progress each side in the war). Players can choose to invest money in arms factories, which give them more bonds and greater influence over the outcomes; simply speculate; or buy up businesses such as coffin makers and hope for a bloody and prolonged conflict. Ultimately the only thing that matters is the final amount of cash in hand when the war ends.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between three and seven turns, in each of which players first make their investment and production decisions, and then (in reverse order) contribute troops to the outcome of one of the great battles of the US Civil War. The battles are simply resolved and allow for a bit of bluff and negotiation, but they do not attempt to replicate the tactics of the conflict. Those looking for a simulation of &quot;Pickett's Charge&quot; at Gettysburg should probably not buy this game.&#10;&#10;The game is fast paced and highly interactive as the ability to anticipate or influence other players' strategies is crucial to victory. A long game (where the war is finely balanced and lasts the full seven turns) can take up to 45 minutes; shorter conflicts are finished in less than half an hour.&#10;&#10;",

You have no equal...aside from your sibling.&#10;&#10;As half-god children of the Olympians, the deathless have posed a contest to determine the greatest of their mortal offspring: sack three cities where the gods have hidden powerful Kraters, each infused with their own divine power.&#10;&#10;From soldiers and beasts to seers and muses, mustering forces to sack these cities is only a few coins away. While recovering the Kraters lies at the heart of the Gods' contest, they may also be impressed by the triumphs you accomplish at the city steps, and the company you keep might help to sway their choice of a victor.&#10;&#10;The Immortals stand at the precipice of Olympus; breath held, attention turned to the mortal realm. Only one will join the Olympians, while the other will fade into antiquity as another forgotten spawn of the gods.&#10;&#10;Banks of the Styx | Omen Game 2 is a standalone card game for two players.&#10;&#10;Like the other new Omen games, this standalone game features 22 Unique Unit cards and 6 Unique Krater cards, each offering new Traits and abilities, and is fully compatible with all new (and unreleased) Omen games.&#10;&#10;Each Omen game is played over a series of player turns and ends when all three Cities have been destroyed (or when a player has a certain number of cards in their Rewards). Each City is comprised of 2 Krater cards. Players spend Coins to play Units to these Cities, and once a City is Sacked, the City is resolved and the player with the most Strength at that City gains 1 of the Krater cards at that City (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Krater's ability).&#10;&#10;The turn structure is broken into five Steps:&#10;&#10;WEALTH: The active player receives 3 Wealth Actions. Each Wealth Action is used to draw a Unit or gain a Coin. However, if a player spends all of their actions on the same resource, they receive a bonus resource!&#10;&#10;SURGE: The active player spends their coins to play Units from their hand to their side of the Cities. Unit cards with certain Traits can also be discarded during the Surge Step for an ability. Cards played to a player's side of a City boost their Strength in that City.&#10;&#10;PORTENT: The Active player will follow the abilities of any Units on their side of the Cities with the Glean Trait.&#10;&#10;WAR: Any Sacked Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is Sacked if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).&#10;&#10;OFFERING: The Active player can discard 1 card from their hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.&#10;&#10;While this game reimplements Omen: A Reign of War, it is not compatible with any previous Omen: a Reign of War title or expansion.&#10;&#10;",

Little do either team realise that their rivals are far from the only danger waiting within&hellip;&#10;&#10;The thrilling game of sci-fi skirmish battles enters a new season as operatives clash amongst the claustrophobic corridors of a massive drifting spacecraft, and Kill Team: Into the Dark is the perfect place to jump aboard.

All landscape tiles feature an emblem to show how they must be oriented when played.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either play a helper tile from your hand and score 10 points, or play a landscape tile that extends at least one path already on the board, without cutting off any paths. After doing this, you score points equal to the number of contiguous tiles of the landscape type you just placed multiplied by the number of edges that your just-placed tile touches. For example, if you place a forest tile next to two other tiles, and it's now part of a group of six forest tiles, you score 12 points. To end your turn, draw a tile.&#10;&#10;If you have three tiles in hand, with at least one of them being a helper tile, you can play out of turn. If another player scores a landscape type present on a helper tile in your hand, you can discard that helper tile to score as many points as the active player. On your next turn, you do nothing but draw a tile.&#10;&#10;Once all the tiles have been played, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls a group of adventurers attempting to sneak into the Lonely Mountain (Erebor) and steal as much loot as possible. However, they must escape before Smaug the Dragon awakens, discovers their trespasses, and slays them all. The game takes place relatively soon after Smaug attacked and drove out the Dwarves in Third Age 2770. At that time, Smaug had not yet sealed all of the minor entrances to Erebor, and he considered the entire inner complex of rooms and tunnels to be his &quot;lair&quot;. Thus adventurers can enter (and hopefully leave) in a variety of ways. A raid such as the one this game depicts could have been the event that caused Smaug to close all the minor entrances and to gather most of Erebor&acute;s loot into one huge pile.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board representing the inner complex of rooms and tunnels where Smaug and most of the &quot;treasure&quot; of the Lonely Mountain reside. The board is highly abstracted and simplified to make play quick and easy. Four of the available groups of adventurers represent the interests of the four major races of Middle-earth: Dwarves, Elves, Men, and Orcs. The &quot;Freebooters&quot; are an independent group of adventurers out for glory and loot. Each group has the same mix of 10 characters: 1 Mage, 1 Animist, 1 Bard, 1 Ranger, 2 Scouts, 2 Archers, and 2 Fighters.&#10;&#10;",

The game is fast, chock full of choices and player interaction.&#10;&#10;There are six different card types: Valkyrie, Cogdrives, Actions, Assaults, Locations, and Emblems. Each of the first four card types are included in the main deck. Each card has a Clan Emblem (this is the clan it belongs to), a Recruit Cost (this is in the gray), a Strength Value (this is in red), and a special ability which can be used during either the player&rsquo;s Recruit Turn, or during his Conflict Turn.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game, each player selects an Emblem. Every card recruited by the player is worth 1 point. However, cards of the clan of the player's selected Emblem are worth an additional 1 point. Emblem also grant the player a special once per Conflict ability and a chance to score bonus Conflict cards during the Recruit Turn. Each Engagement, the player who started the War chooses which location the Conflict will take place in. Each Location has an overall effect for the Conflict.&#10;&#10;",
