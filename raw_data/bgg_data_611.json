    "Description": "In Realm, four tribes inhabit a land of chaos and turmoil. It is a land of war, shifting alliances, capture, and rescue as each tribe struggles for supremacy.&#10;&#10;In this game, played on a Checkers board, pieces never leave the board. Pieces should be double sided with a pawn on one side and king on the other. Pieces move as in Checkers; kings one space diagonally in any direction and pawns one space forward.&#10;If you can, you must jump. A jumped piece is tucked under the jumping piece. When a pile is jumped, the top piece is tucked under the jumping piece, leaving the rest of the jumped pile intact.&#10;If a player has no moves on their turn (ie none of their pieces are on top of any piles), their turn is skipped until one of their pieces is uncovered (through other players jumping).&#10;The object of the game is to have only your own pieces on top of every pile. Once each pile is topped by pieces of a single color, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Realms draws influence from Laska&#10;&#10;",

The Wastelander plays very differently from The Burn-Out Guru; and The Prophet or the Talking Ape play very differently from Granny or the Grease Monkey... and there are many more to choose from...&#10;&#10;Make friends with any or all of the four big towns that frame the landscape:  The Mutants, the US Military, The Scientists, or The Overmen.  The more loyalty your Driver has in a town, the bigger the weapons you can get there.&#10;&#10;The rest of the time, run cargo and fight as you blast your way through Asphalt Monsters, Gamma Scorpions, Dust Pirates, and your fellow players.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for the Eurogamer to win by delivering cargo most efficiently and the Ameritrasher to win by blasting them to hell.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is dealt 9 cards, and after that they bid how much tricks they can take. The highest bidder plays then against the two other players.&#10;&#10;The game represents a battle of the 17 th. with it's officers and troops, so it can be said it is the first card wargame.&#10;&#10;It's a game original from Spain known firstly as &quot;Triunfos Hisp&aacute;nicos&quot; later circa 1700 it was known as &quot;Juego del Hombre&quot; or &quot;Mediator&quot;. Again circa 1800 changed his name into &quot;Tresillo&quot;, and from that time is known as &quot;Rocambor&quot; in the former spanish colonies of latin america where today is still played.&#10;&#10;In Spain almost no one plays it any longer, as before was a gentelmen game and became unpopular in the 20 th. century, but it carries to be played in Lima.&#10;&#10;Funny enought there are as well clubs in Dennmark were it is known as &quot;L'Hombre&quot;. It is my personal opinion that the spanish ocupation army of Dennmark in the age of Napoleon comanded by the Marquis de la Romana have something to do with the expansion of this game in Jutland!!&#10;&#10;Tensh&#197;&#141; karuta, Unsun karuta and Sunkun karuta are all rooted in Ombre&#10;&#10;",

If it has the same picture as the first, the player can keep it. If not, both are put back. If the first piece doesn't stick to the second one, it is put back immediately.

The idea is to absorb the opponents pieces into your own by surrounding them with at least 1 more piece value (so a 2 piece stack would be absorbed if surrounded by 2, 2 piece stacks, or a 3&#10;piece stack and a 1 piece stack). When you absorb the pieces, you turn them over to your color and add them to the capturing stacks. The first person to reduce their opponent to 3 pieces or less wins. In developing the game it has become a balanced and subtle game; very simple to learn, but potentially complex in strategy.&#10;&#10;",

The King is more powerful than a single noble or churchman but less powerful than two.  Combat is resolved by dice with the player controlling the most land having an advantage.

    "Description": "A modern twist on the classic game of chess        &#10;Welcome to the realm of Crusade &amp; Conquer! Be wary of flying dragons, defending flag bearers, and the castle&rsquo;s move-restricting levels. A fantastical world where a modern twist on the classic game of chess feeds the eternal feud between King Ulric and King Montfort, the realm of C&amp;C is a place that knows no grandmasters and players enjoy the luxury of an entirely new endgame&hellip; what's your endgame?&#10; Game Rules&#10;&#10;Playing Crusade &amp; Conquer is similar to chess... well kind of.  While many of the characters and their movements mirror classic chess,  the new board, castles, and game pieces have introduced twists and turns that will make even the most strategic and advanced players think twice.   But this game is not just for the masters.  Anyone can learn... and once you do you'll never turn back.&#10;The Castle&#10;&#10;The Castle has two levels or floors. The upper level is where the King and Queen begin the game; with the King always starting on the X. Remember, the game is lost if the opposing Flag Bearer reaches your King&rsquo;s starting X.&#10;&#10;Game pieces cannot jump up or down more than one level in a single movement and must stop their movement as soon as a level is traversed. There are two exceptions to this rule:&#10;&#10;&bull;Castle Exception #1: the Knight is allowed to complete the L-shape movement as long as it only moves one level per turn. If the Knight must move up two levels to complete its L-shape movement, the move is not allowed.&#10;&bull;Castle Exception #2: because it can &ldquo;fly&rdquo;, the Dragon&rsquo;s movements in and around the Castle are not restricted. However, the Dragon can only move more than one space in a single turn if it is flying over teammates.&#10;&#10;Dragons&#10;&#10;A Dragon may move one space per turn in any direction. A Dragon may jump its teammates in any direction for as many spaces as they are in a straight line. A Dragon cannot jump opposing game pieces, even if they are between teammates. With the exception of the Flag Bearer, a Dragon may kill any opposing game piece by moving in any direction. A Dragon may also kill any opposing game pieces (except the Flag Bearer) by jumping teammates to complete the move. A Dragon must end its move as soon as it kills an opposing game piece. A Dragon may traverse more than one level of The Castle in a single move only if it is jumping over teammates.&#10;&#10;Flag Bearers&#10;&#10;A Flag Bearer may only move one diagonal space per turn. A Flag Bearer cannot jump teammates or opposing game pieces to complete a move. A Flag Bearer cannot kill any opposing game pieces but can only be killed by the opposing King. A Flag Bearer must end its move as soon as it traverses a level of The Castle. A Flag Bearer can win the game by reaching an opposing King&rsquo;s starting position.&#10;&#10;&#10;Winning Crusade &amp; Conquer&#10;&#10;There are two potential endgames (ways to win the game) in Crusade &amp; Conquer. The first endgame is to kill the opposing King. The second endgame is to get your Flag Bearer into the opposing King&rsquo;s starting position (the opposing X).&#10;&#10;",

No dice, cards, or record keeping are needed and scores are kept on the score track as the race progresses. Each player controls a team of four cyclist which one is a leader in each team. The leader has one bonus action that can be performed during the race which may be played out of turn. The leader also gets bonus points if he finishes the race first among his own teammates, more challenging than it sounds. The team with the highest score wins. The heaviest hitters in gaming should find this game enjoyable and challenging along with everybody else that enjoys a good race game. Warning: The slowest rider's are penalized with negative points at the finish so don't forget about those drifting back. I hope to do a small print run at some point and plan on working on a final design within the next year. Race On and on and on!&#10;&#10;The release date for Cycle is indefinite.&#10;&#10;",

The game folds up and seals with velcro; once opened a small ramp flips out while two straps hold it somewhat less than open.  Set it down and you're ready to go.  Increase the distance to increase the challenge.  The game includes 7 wooden balls (6 white; 1 red); the red ball scores double so when to use it is always a tactical decision on the part of each player.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a simple dice game, supposedly taking place in a Las Vegas casino.&#10;&#10;There are 3 dice (green, blue, red) with corresponding rows on the game board; at the start of a turn, each player in turn places their pawn on one of the 18 possible results, and all the dice are rolled. A pawn on the right number of the right colour wins the bet times 2, a pawn on the right number but wrong colour gives wins the bet times 1, and a pawn on a completely wrong space wins nothing and loses the bet also. Multipliers are cumulative, so the maximum is 4, if all three dice show the same number and the player has his pawn on that very number.&#10;&#10;The game includes 100 chips of three different denominations, for use in betting. Each player starts with 10 &quot;marks&quot;, minimum bet is 1 mark, and the game ends when there are no more chips in the bank.&#10;&#10;The rules actually suggest a gambling variant for adults, where the players &quot;buy&quot; the starting chips with real cash to form a bank which is then shared between the players in relation to the value of the chips they won during the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "I think to lose Kentucky is nearly to lose the whole game.  - Abraham Lincoln, September 1861&#10;&#10;At the dawn of the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Kentucky was officially a &ldquo;border state&rdquo; (neither Union nor Confederate) by decree of the state legislature, but due to the state&rsquo;s strategic location and the divided loyalties of its citizens neither side treated the state as neutral territory.  By the fall of 1861, both Union and Confederate forces occupied Kentucky and, despite the fact that the state had not seceded from the Union, the Confederate States of America had set up a temporary state capital in Bowling Green, installed a governor and added a star representing the state to its flag.  Not surprisingly, a campaign to wrest control of the state from the Union, the &ldquo;Confederate Heartland Offensive,&rdquo; was launched by Generals Kirby Smith and Braxton Bragg in the summer of 1862.&#10;&#10;The small town of Perryville, located in the central portion of the state, was an unlikely site for the culmination of the campaign, but as the Union forces of General Don Carlos Buell pursued Bragg's Army of the Mississippi eastward under severe drought conditions in early October, both sides made their way to the town in search of the water promised by the Chaplin River and its tributaries.  Once the forces collided near Doctor's Creek on October 8, the Battle of Perryville, the biggest battle fought in Kentucky and, for the number of soldiers involved, one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, had begun.&#10;&#10;By nightfall, the Confederates had scored a tactical victory, as Bragg&rsquo;s army had managed to push Buell&rsquo;s forces back over a mile, but both sides had suffered extensive casualties (over 6,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were dead, wounded, captured or missing), and Bragg, having realized that the number of Union forces in Perryville had been greatly underestimated, would withdraw from the town that night as part of what would ultimately be a total withdrawal from the state.  (Kentucky remained in the Union column for the remainder of the war.)  Buell, roundly criticized for his failures in leadership during the battle (including his failure, due in part to a phenomenon known as an &ldquo;acoustic shadow,&rdquo; to recognize the severity of the battle until very late in the engagement and, therefore, to provide needed &ndash; and readily-available &ndash; reinforcements), found his military career effectively ruined at Perryville despite his strategic victory there.&#10;&#10;Perryville:  Bragg vs. Buell, Oct. 8, 1862, a card-driven war game, gives two players the chance to step into the shoes of these generals.  The players must balance military tactics with hand management to determine the fate of the Commonwealth.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The whole game&rdquo; is at stake &ndash; who will be victorious?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Syzygy Four is the game of strategic alignment and maneuver for two to four players.  Arrange the tiles into one of an endless number of 8x8 configurations.  Then follow Syzygy Four's unique rules of movement as you maneuver your four glass stones into the &quot;syzygy&quot; that is shown on the card you have drawn.  Score by creating your syzygy on tiles of the same color.  Your opponents will try to thwart you by blocking your path and &quot;swapping&quot; your stones off to far-reaching corners of the board.  Lots of skill and a little bit of luck are required if you are to successfully beat your opponents to the final round, which is double score.&#10;&#10;",

The partnership with the more valuable combination takes the trick.&#10;&#10;In the other game (Bellum) every player gets all the cards from one suit. Then they simultaneously choose and play one; the largest one takes the trick. However, if the defference between the largest and the second largest is at most one, then additional cards are to be played. Also in certain cases the 1 (the Fowl) wins against larger cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players then roll dice and move their tokens along the roads on the board that connect the cities. At its core, this is a roll-and-move game, where players have to roll two dice - one ordinary pipped six-sider and an action die, which shows symbols that affect play. The action die might give extra pips to speed up your travel, cause a flat tire and force you to miss a turn, allow you to switch destination cards with another player, roll the pipped die again and add to your original roll, and even cause everyone to transfer their whole stack of destination cards to the player on their left. The first player to visit all their destination cities wins.&#10;&#10;",
