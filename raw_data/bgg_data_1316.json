    "Description": "In West Africa, facial injury has been used to identify ethnic groups, families, individuals, and also to denote beauty; wounds were thought to beautify the body. It was also done in girls to mark the stages of life: puberty, marriage, etc. These scars helped women to make men more attractive because they appeal to looking as well as scars, as evidence that women can withstand labor pain. It is believed to bring people good luck and protection from evil.&#10;&#10;In Scrape, the rules within the tribes will determine the rules of the game and the symbols will determine the meaning of the game. While playing, you will both have fun and experience the difficulties of the tribal life.&#10;&#10;The player whose turn it is opens from the symbol card on the playing field and finds the symbol on the playing field according to the color of the card. Whoever finds it first gets the symbol.&#10;&#10;The player who gets 12 symbols wins, starts the next game as the chieftain with 2 symbols.&#10;&#10;All parts are prepared by hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Time is like a sword; if you don't cut it, it cuts you&quot;&#10;(Arabic proverb)&#10;&#10;Asedio a Al-Andalus: the Legend of the Wolf &amp; the Serpent (1150-1213) is a medieval strategy, geopolitics and diplomacy boardgame for 3 players that tries to represent the political, ideological and military conflicts that took place in the Iberian Peninsula and its areas of influence between the second half of the 12th century and the early 13th century, in an exciting time of crusades, epic battles and court intrigues.&#10;&#10;This is a crucial 63-year interval in the history of Spain, Portugal and the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by a balance of power between the Christian world of the north and the Muslim world of the south: the first, fragmented into five different kingdoms (Portugal, Navarre, Aragon-Barcelona, Leon and Castile) but with a clear expansive and conquering vocation since the turn of the millennium, and the second, reinforced after the rise to power of an austere and powerful North African dynasty with a rigorous vision of Islam (the Almohad Caliphate). However, there was also a third peninsular power, autochthonous Hispanic Islam, heir to the cultural splendor of the extinct Umayyad Caliphate of C&oacute;rdoba and now, doubly threatened by the Christian crusade and the Almohad jihad, desperately trying to fight for its own independence (the Sharq Al-Andalus, represented by the Levantine emirate of Murcia-Valencia, under the Banu Mard&aacute;nish dynasty, and by the Pirate emirate of Mallorca, under the Banu Ganiyya dynasty).&#10;&#10;In the game, each player will take the role of one of the three main powers (Christian Kingdoms, Sharq Al-Andalus and Almohad Caliphate) that vied for power, hegemony and survival in the Iberian Peninsula during those troubled years. Whether through military force, political cunning, seductive diplomacy, commercial wealth or cultural splendor, the player's objective will be to accumulate the greatest number of victory points to become the peninsular power with more fame and glory.&#10;&#10;Mechanically, the game uses a card-driven system, consists of 7 turns and each of them represents a period of 9 years, beginning in the year 1150 and ending in the year 1213. At the same time, each turn is divided into 5 different phases. The game is completely asymmetrical, as each power has its own geographic position, resources, rulers, courtiers, military leaders, allied factions, and totally unique and specific thematic minigames. The game ends if one of the following conditions is met: that a player reaches 50 victory points, that the end of turn 7 is reached (the player with the most victory points wins) or that the Sharq Al-Andalus is annexed (in which case the Christian player or the Almohad player will win, depending on their victory points).&#10;&#10;The conquests of Alfonso VII of Leon &quot;The Emperor&quot;, the Almohad invasion, the Mediterranean takeoff of Catalonia, the resurgence of an independent Al-Andalus in the peculiar figure of the libertine emir &quot;The Wolf&quot;, the Castilian civil war between the feuding families Lara and Castro, the appearance in Navarre of Richard &quot;The Lionheart&quot;, the French influence in Occitania-Provence, the commercial relations with the maritime republics of Genoa and Pisa, the last blows of the Byzantine Empire, the offensives in the Maghreb of the ancient Vikings from the Kingdom of Sicily and the Ayyubid Egyptians of Sultan Saladin, Majorcan piracy led by his corsair emir &ldquo;The Serpent&rdquo;, the Arab and Berber revolts in Ifriquiyya, the construction of the Seville mosque, the recovery of Aristotelian philosophy by Ibn Rush, the political intrigues of Queen Eleanor Plantagenet, the II, III and IV Crusades in the Holy Land, Simon de Montfort's crusade against the Cathars, the consolidation of the Camino de Santiago, the publication of the Song of the Cid or the epic battles of Alarcos and Navas de Tolosa, are just some of the many national and international historical events that the player will be able to relive in first person throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Welcome to a world of swords and shields, castles and sieges, knights and pirates, kings and courtiers, emirs and caliphs, bishops and imams, ambassadors and pilgrims, merchants and philosophers, cathedrals and mosques, holy wars, palace conspiracies, and even, maritime expeditions to the exotic Orient.

What are we saying, it was built for Smooth Ride (which allows you to reduce the penalty of moving when firing) and aggressive players that want to get the most out of this tank should look no further than commander Edward Crane who will grant you additional initiative in the movement phase for every two crew on the tank with his Mentor skill AND if you are feeling confident, gives you the opportunity to roll one less attack dice to modify a hit to a critical thanks to Eagle Eye.&#10;&#10;",

The terrain your town is built on is often plagued with horrific and deadly disasters. As the newly elected mayor, you must push past the obstacles that lie before you and prepare your town for the impending doom. No one has succeeded thus far, but we believe in your ability to lead!&#10;&#10;You must increase your cities' population, ensure that your citizens are well fed, and provide them with financial security. Will you overcome the challenges that lie ahead of you as mayor of this unfortunate town? Can you prepare your town and survive the imminent disasters that come your way?&#10;&#10;AdverCity can be played with either 3 or 4 people. A 3 player game consists of 18 turns and a 4 player game consists of 14 turns. On each turn, a player rolls the dice to determine the resources everyone gets from their buildings on that turn. Once the resources are distributed to everyone, the player can buy more buildings, trade with others, and feed their population. Disaster rounds occur throughout the game dependent of the number of players. In order to win, a player must end the game with the highest population by protecting their citizens from various disasters. So, go out and save your town!&#10;&#10;",

He draws from the Lawen deck the number of the cards indicated by the Wenu and adds them to his Yapaq (bag) and takes a step or two, otherwise stays still.&#10;     The player must move his Machi token trying to get in touch with the Ngen (Cosmic spirit), that is being in correspondence of the dashed line at the end of which the Ngen token is positioned, in order to trigger the colour of the Rewe for his turn.&#10;     Once moved, each Machi chooses the number of Lawen cards indicated by the Wenu scale and play them.&#10;     A specific combination of Lawen corresponds to each Rewe or sacred place.&#10;     In order to get the Lif (purifying agent), a sufficient number of Lawen is requested.&#10;     The Machi checks if the combination occurred which generates the Lif.&#10;     He chooses to store it in the Ruka space of his board or places it on a polluted territory.&#10;     At the end of the game, the Machi who gets more Final Points (bonus, lif cubes, and regenerated Rewe) wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What a hustle and bustle! In Happy Hopping, the frogs jump into the ponds left and right. Everyone is on the hunt for colorful mosquitoes. Whose frogs can catch the most of them?&#10;&#10;Over the course of eight rounds, the players try to complete tasks to collect chips. There are speed rounds, in which you need to be quicker than the other players, and normal rounds, in which all frogs may perform one jump. If the goal of a round is met, players gain frog chips &ndash; with the fastest players gaining a ladybug chip on top. They show mosquitoes in different colors. After the last round, a scoring tile determines which mosquito color scores points. Whoever has the most mosquitoes of that color, wins.&#10;&#10;Happy Hopping cleverly integrates the game box into the game and jumping aids makes it easier for younger players to perform good jumps.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Midnight Market is finally taking place again! But only adult wizards and ghosts are allowed to visit. Bad luck for the students from the nearby school for magic because it is the only place to buy wonderful delicacies and magical pets. You can even find the rare Vanishing Stars there. Ghosts use them to make themselves invisible. &quot;I would love to make myself invisible too!&quot;, says Anna. Amir has an ingenious idea: &ldquo;We could just dress as ghosts to sneak onto the market and mingle with the visitors!&rdquo; The others think it is a great plan. &ldquo;This way, we won&rsquo;t stand out. Maybe we can get hold of these Vanishing Stars? We can pull a lot of pranks with those!&rdquo; The students create teams of four and off they go.&#10;&#10;In Midnight Market each player receives a team marker showing the associated students who have disguised themselves as fake ghosts and the team number. These numbers can be found on the bottom of the ghost figures, but they still secret at the beginning of the game. With the help of a color die, the ghost figures can be moved across the playing fields of the market. If two ghosts meet at a booth, the player who moved the second ghost receives one or two magical chips. In addition, chips are given to those players whose team the ghosts belong to. It is therefore worthwhile to keep in mind all the numbers that are revealed over the course of the game &ndash; not so easy when the ghosts are constantly on the move!&#10;&#10;Midnight Market expands the popular wizarding world of Wizardry to the power of three, Fabulantica, Mary Magica and Hexenhochhaus. The ghostly memory game includes a three-part scoring so that more than one person can win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A Fortress consists of three Towers, each with 200 hit points, or Wall Points.  The first player to bring their opponent's Towers to 0 Wall Points each has breached the Fortress and won the game.&#10;&#10;Commanders deploy Creatures as their main attack force, each with a set of Attack Points, Guard Points, and Health Points.  Creatures attack each other by comparing Attack Points to Guard Points, and the difference is dealt as damage to the weaker Creature's Health Points.  Creatures are placed on a Battlefield, a 3-by-2 grid that allows or restricts attacks depending on placement.  A Creature that has not been deployed the same turn, occupies a certain space on the Battlefield, and has no opposing Creatures directly in front of it, has a chance to directly attack the opposing Towers.&#10;&#10;Commanders change the flow of the game with Sorcery cards, each with its own category and level that dictates their effectiveness.  Commanders equip weaponry in the form of Armory cards to their Creatures, modifying their effectiveness in the game.  And Commanders change field conditions with Field cards, granting advantages and disadvantages to Creatures depending on a variety of stats and classifications.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The last player with at least one square, one cross and one circle on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 15 pieces, grouped into 3 different types &ndash; 2 squares, 4 crosses and 9 circles. Play begins with the pieces arranged in a checkerboard pattern at the center of the board.&#10;&#10;Assign a color to each player and decide who goes first.  Then continue playing, alternating turns with your opponent.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may slide any of your pieces one square in any direction (orthogonally or diagonally), pushing along any pieces that lie in the way.&#10;&#10;You may not move any piece to a square that it vacated on your opponent&rsquo;s last turn.&#10;&#10;If a piece is pushed off the edge, it is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;In addition, if the pieces are splintered into two or more disconnected groups (so that no piece of either group shares a side or a corner with any piece of the other group), the largest group remains on the board and all other groups are removed.  If the groups are of equal size, the player who caused the splinter decides which group is removed.&#10;&#10;If a player runs out of any type of piece, the game ends and the other player wins.  If both players run out of any type of piece at the same time, the game ends and the player with the most pieces on the board wins.  If both players have the same number of pieces on the board, the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;Click here for official rules and diagrams: https://splinterboardgame.blogspot.com/2021/06/splinter-is-two-player-abstractstrategy.html&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The result was a victory for the Austrian forces, led by Prince Josef Wenzel - Prince Franz Josef I and Louis-Joseph de Montcalm were among the notable combatants.&#10;&#10;The War of the Austrian Succession (1740 - 1748) was a dynastic war, initiated by the European powers to counter the legitimate claim of Maria Theresa Habsburgs (1717-1780) to maintain control of all her family possessions, when her father, the Emperor Charles VI, died in 1740.&#10;&#10;Federick II of Prussia was the first to act. He invaded Silesia as he wanted to reach a glorious military success and the beginning of his reign. Maria Theresa reacted prompted, and two alliance sides formed for the war with all the major European countries and many minor states involved.&#10;&#10;In 1745, the war extended to Italy, where France and Spain were in arms against Austria and her ally, Savoy. After a sound defeat near Alessandria, the following year the Austrian side soundly defeated the French-Spanish army at the Battle of Piacenza, which marked the end of the French-Spain attempts to defeat Maria in Italy: &quot;I want to hope that this event will dispel from the minds of my enemies the desire to totally banish myself from Italy&quot;&#10;&#10;Highlights:&#10;&#10;     regimental-level warfare in the Age of Reason&#10;     highly interactive sequence of play, focused on manoeuvre&#10;     formations move in &quot;linear mode&quot;, the typical way of fighting a battle at that time&#10;     a 22&quot; x 25&quot; fine-art map , based on ancient map of the battle&#10;     detailed order of battle&#10;     limited play time&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     22&quot; x 25&quot; map of Piacenza and its southern area&#10;     216 5/8&quot; (large) die-cut counters&#10;     Rule booklet&#10;     Charts&#10;     Boxed&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege. Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent&rsquo;s plans by denying them chances to attack.&#10;&#10;&quot;Year 5 - Shadow Tactics adds 6 operators to the base game. All of them being from the fifth year, or the fifth season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment&#10;&#10;For attackers, we have Iana with her Gemini Replicator. She creates holo doubles and sows confusion among enemies. Ace, from Norway, is a demolition specialist who can crumble floors and ceilings, making some spaces impassable. On top of that, this season sees Zero return! Zero as the famous (or infamous!) Sam Fisher himself&hellip; With his Argus cameras, he will force opponents to move a certain way.&#10;&#10;On the defenders&rsquo; side, Oryx&rsquo;s charges are a force to be reckoned with. He can run and crash through walls! Melusi and Aruni add traps and countermeasures on the field thanks to Banshee Sonic Defences or Surya Lasers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&quot;&#10;&#10;",
