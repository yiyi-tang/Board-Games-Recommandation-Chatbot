Use these elements to form your Shield, and to strike other players' Shields. A pair of elements will allow you to use your Adventurer's Ability. If the pair is a native element of your Adventurer, then you may use your Adventurer's Native Ability. You may also double strike with a pair of element cards. You may also deflect strikes by discarding one of your native element cards.&#10;&#10;Standard play has one player play as Death against the other three players. Death has four cards in their starting hand and two actions per turn while the other players have three cards in their starting hand and one action per turn. As players are eliminated, the other players playing against Death level up, first to utilize a 4-card hand and next to take two actions per turn. The last player standing wins the game and may become Death in the following game, if they wish to.

    "Description": "Theme: Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency&#10;&#10;Game-play: Each player has a token (game piece) and &quot;wallet.&quot; The wallet is used to keep track of the players cash, bitcoin, and possibly bitcoin cash (if it gets forked into the game). Each player travels around the bitcoin playing board while trying to deal with positive news, negative news, and board spaces that lead to both positive and negative outcomes.&#10;&#10;Object of Game: Travel around the Bitcoin Logo board and be the first player to amass a wallet size of $200,000 in fiat currency (US Dollars or one of 6 other currencies Euro, British Pound, Euro, Yen, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar, and Australian Dollar).&#10;&#10;The ideal number of players is 3-4. There are 3 roles in the game. The main drivers of the game are: your decisions on buying, selling, and hodling bitcoin(bitcoin term for holding) and news cards that can dramatically affect the price of bitcoin both up and down.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for ages 12+. Although the real bitcoin has many complex characteristics, Bitcoin The Board Game only focuses on the elements that a teenager can understand and grasp. The game is meant to be enjoyed with friends and family in a casual setting.&#10;&#10;If you're like me, the 2017 holidays (US Thanksgiving and Christmas) were spent talking about bitcoin. This year, play the game! It will be available in time for the 2018 holidays.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The unique gameplay is that players don't win by scoring points, you win by announcing how many points you will score, and it can be 0 !&#10;&#10;An extract from the beginning of the rulebook : &#10;The Bastard one is a thrilling and mysterious card game.&#10;Some  claim  that  a  primitive  version  originated  in  the  North  of India and arrived in Venice via Asia Minor, from where it spread through Europe. It is also told that it owes its name to the illegitimate  daughter  of  a  Syldavian  prince  who  introduced it to  his father&rsquo;s court.&#10;Others  maintain  that  three  Portuguese  sailors  brought  it  back from much further afield. &#10;But nothing is less sure...&#10;&#10;In this game, there are no teams, it is every person for themselves. &#10;3 to 8 players can play.&#10;&#10;Draw  to  designate  the  dealer  (highest  card).  Next  round  the  dealer  shifts clockwise.&#10;&#10;Deal the cards face down, one by one.&#10;A  &ldquo;rubber&rdquo;  is  a  set  of  games  made  up  of  several  &ldquo;hands&rdquo;  all  dealt  in  the same way.&#10;&#10;After  each  hand  is  dealt,  the  players  look  at  their  cards  and  announce in advance the number of &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; that they think they will win. This is called &ldquo;bidding&rdquo;.&#10;In this game you never pass. Each player bids on each round. &#10;The  bidding  system  leads  all  the  players  to  agree  on  which  &ldquo;suit&rdquo;  is  the &ldquo;trump&rdquo;, if any. &#10;There  are  6  possibilities:  all  cards  are  trump,  spades  are  trump,  hearts are  trump,  diamonds  are  trump,  clubs  are  trump  &ndash;  or  there  is  no trump.&#10;When playing with trump, the order of the cards is different.&#10;&#10;",

The turn passes to the next player.&#10;If you find a tile showing all 5 bees... what a pity! Something scared them away and made them fly away! For this turn, you can&rsquo;t try to make anyone fly.&#10;When you complete an entire line of 6 tiles of the same type compared to those with just one image, you win, well done!&#10;&#10;The Advanced Version is for 4-year-old kids.

A fun and colorful memory game.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;The player whose turn it is turns over  two memory cards, one after the other.&#10;&#10;Do they show the same picture?&#10;Excellent! Keep these two memory cards. You may then turn over two more cards.&#10;&#10;Do they show different pictures?&#10;What a pity! After everyone has seen the memory cards, turn them back over again.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the cards have been turned over and therefore all the pairs have been found. Stack your own memory cards. Whoever can build the highest card tower wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

You and your opponent each bring a 14 card deck to the table.  There are a total of eight possible colors of cards to make your deck from.  On your turns, you can play as many cards of two colors as you want, and once per game you may switch you hand and your deck.  This means that you could play all of your cards on your first turn (if you made a two color deck).&#10;&#10;However, you would lose the game.  To win, you must cause your opponent to have zero cards in her deck.  This means that you have to strike the right balance in how many cards you play and when you play them.&#10;&#10;The game has full color cards for print and play, printer friendly cards, and a Tabletop Simulator module.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of each round, the presidents at the front of each player's line will engage in battle. The victor continues battling, and the rest are removed.&#10;&#10;To ensure your president's victory, there are numerous underhanded strategies you can employ.  You can give your presidents special bonuses that increase their strength, or you can give your opponents terrible bonuses to put them at a disadvantage.&#10;&#10;You can also play cards to rearrange the order of your line, allowing a stronger president to compete, or rearrange the order of another player's line, forcing them to use a weak president.&#10;&#10;Facedown cards can be employed to give your president a secret point bonus or ability, so you can never be sure which player is in the lead.&#10;&#10;Action and instant cards allow you to mess with another player's strategy or swap your weaker presidents for stronger candidates.&#10;&#10;The round continues until all players but one declare they are ready for battle by passing on their turns instead of playing cards. Players can gain a strategic advantage by delaying their actions until later in the round, but waiting too long might cause the battle to start before you've made your move.&#10;&#10;",

Under the wise guidance of Dahlgaard&rsquo;s Heir, the city has once again become a bustling, flourishing center of magic and illusion, with a new generation of aspiring young Magicians on the rise.&#10;&#10;But now, without the power of the Trickerion Stone, the Great Dahlgaard is dying. In his last will, he entrusted his Heir with a grandiose task: he donated his old manor to be restored as the Academy of Magoria, a center of the education and perfection of magic tricks and illusion.&#10;&#10;The Heir issues a public call for contributors among Magoria&rsquo;s aspiring Magicians: the Academy shall be restored as a common effort, but the most successful contributor&rsquo;s name will be remembered forever as the Patron of Magoria.&#10;&#10;Dahlgaard&rsquo;s Academy expands the magical world and gameplay of Trickerion with a slew of exciting new features:&#10;&#10;A new Location - the Academy: Join the common effort to renovate the Academy! Each Renovation action awards Fame proportionately to the Coins spent on it, and opens up new Classrooms and Practice Rooms, where Academy markers can be placed. Academy markers in Practice Rooms give the performed Tricks increased Yield or other special placement abilities, while the Tricks taught in the Classrooms will be passed on to the new generations - they can no longer be performed, but grant a useful passive yield each turn. The Academy is also a place to train your Proteg&eacute;, a new member of your team.&#10;&#10;A new Specialist - the Proteg&eacute;: Each Magician will now start with the Proteg&eacute;, a new type of specialist. The Proteg&eacute; is more than just a worker - they will accompany your Magician on their path to greatness, constantly developing in the process. By Visiting the Academy, Proteg&eacute;s can acquire powerful new abilities that also increase their Action Points - and their salary as well! A fully developed Proteg&eacute; will have 3 Actions points, just like the Magician, with some very powerful abilities to boot!&#10;&#10;A new quartet of Magicians: Magoria&rsquo;s new Golden Age attracts aspiring young Magicians from all over the world, eager to prove themselves, and maybe one day become the Patron of Magoria. Each school of illusion (Mechanical, Optical, Escape, Spiritual) will receive a new, charismatic Magician, with their own personal backstory, powerful special ability.&#10;&#10;Solo Mode: Dalhgaard's Heir: This expansion will also feature a solo mode, with an elaborate story setting. Take a journey to a possible future of Magoria, where Dahlgaard&rsquo;s Heir couldn&rsquo;t resist the immense power of the Trickerion Stone, and dabbing into the supernatural has eclipsed their sanity. Magoria&rsquo;s Golden Age is over - now the Heir controls it with an iron grip, and it falls to you to prove your superiority and remove him from power the only way the city knows - through magic and illusion. This solo mode features Dahlgaard&rsquo;s Heir as a fully automated, intricate opponent with variable difficulty levels - a worthy foe to even the most seasoned Trickerion veterans!&#10;&#10;",

When the Night swept through, he was feeding the hounds, making sure the pack leader, Dex, did not take too much more than his fair share. The Vampires sensed the vicious nature of the hunting dogs, so it was the pack that the Vampires turned, while the workers and family were simply drained as food. But the kennel master&rsquo;s de&not;votion to his pack gave him the strength to cling to this world, although the corruption in his dying body meant he was no longer truly capable of that emotion.&#10;Caring for the pack of Guardians was now his new role in the clan and soon the pack ran at the vanguard of the Vampire raiding parties. With so much blood spilt, his power grew, as did the Guardian&rsquo;s alpha, who was seemingly immune to the harm that caused attrition to the pack. What was devotion was now an unholy bond, passing power in both directions.&#10;&#10;Slowly the pack began to spend more time hunting and sleeping alone. Despite their ag&not;gression, Guardians fell in battle, and eventu&not;ally it was just the pair that was left. No-one from the clan was there to chastise the kennel master for his slack work, but then, he was no mere minion anymore and would not take criticism easily.&#10;&#10;No, Gareth and Dex had grown to be the Elders Gugadeth and the Beast, forever bound as a pack of two.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The number of players can be extended from a minimum of 2 seamlessly to an unlimited number of players (Present record is a single circle of 14 players).  Taiko has a unique starting setup since each player begins with an identical army (selected from the available cards), and there is no random shuffling or dealing anytime during the game.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each player begins with a castle to defend, and 7 warrior cards.  Simultaneously, each player put facedown a card from their hand on their left and a card on their right which will attack that neighbor.  Cards are resolved based on their value (higher wins) or by special abilities.  After resolving, all cards are traded.  The game continues until all castles are defeated except for the last castle standing: the round champion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Kicking Class brings an enticingly comical twist to high school. Players take on the role of students going through a whirlwind of hilariously relatable high school faux pas. In the game, you will race against your fellow students to come out on top and claim a full-ride scholarship to the university of your dreams.&#10;&#10;Unlike your typical scholarships, which judge you based on boring things like your GPA or school contributions, the K.A. scholarship has developed its own unique ranking system. To claim this scholarship, you will need to pass classes, spread rumors, throw parties, and do whatever it takes to get the upper hand over your fellow students.&#10;&#10;Whether you strive for popularity or bury your face behind textbooks, the options are endless. Now get ready to kick some class!&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;&#10;The game takes place over the 4 years of high school. Each year there are 3 trimesters, in which you will be taking classes. To pass a class, you will roll skill dice and see if you meet the requirements. If you pass, you keep the card and gain the reward. If you fail, you must draw from the dreaded failure deck!&#10;&#10;You will earn scholarship points (SP) for passing classes, being popular, and taking the ACT. At the end of the game, whoever has the most scholarship points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Revolt is a two-player space combat game set in the inner solar system; the map's outer edge is the orbit of Jupiter. One player represents a solar system government and the other player a rebellion against it.&#10;&#10;Each side has a fleet of ships and a number of bases. Ship counters can represent any number of ships so each player knows where the other has forces but not how strong they are. The ships use vector movement; they can accelerate or decelerate a certain amount each turn and also change heading a certain amount (in 5-degree increments); their movement vectors are drawn on the board.&#10;&#10;Combat is deterministic; the attacker's strength is divided by the distance between the attacker and defender to determine the number of strength points lost.&#10;&#10;The sun's gravitational effects are taken into account for ship movement, but those of the planets are not. The planets and space stations move along their orbits during the game.&#10;&#10;The objective of the government player is to eliminate all rebel ships and bases; the rebel player wins if they can avoid this for 30 turns.&#10;&#10;The basic rules for the game were published in four issues of International Wargamer beginning with the December 1970 issue. The game was also available from the designers; this version included additional tournament rules and presumably also contained the map and counters, as they did not appear in the magazine.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a hand of 4 cards; first player draws a new card and discards directly to the next player, who must take that card and discard to the next, etc. When the final player has drawn, s/he discards to a discard deck, and the beginning player draws a new card from the draw deck. As soon as one player has acquired a full 4-of-a-kind set, they discard and then claim a bone from the table, which triggers a mad dash on the part of the other players to grab the remaining bones. The slowest to claim a bone is eliminated from the game each round, leaving a single winning player.&#10;&#10;This version differs from regular Spoons because that one requires players to simultaneously transfer cards to the left while accepting cards from the right, while this version has one player drawing then discarding at a time, and progressing around the table, one player at a time. Furthermore, the rules about being a &quot;pig&quot; and then a &quot;hog&quot; are nowhere in the Disney version,&#10;&#10;",

Please contact the ministry office for the company you want.&#10;&#10;You are the president of a space development company. Thousands of years after humans began to fly, humans finally made their way into space. Space development has accelerated at a stretch by creating stars in outer space and recovering resources from them, and it is now a major business of the entire industry. Stay on top of this big wave, outsmart your rivals, and win lots of resources!&#10;&#10;Mezame No Sora (&#231;&#155;&#174;&#232;&#166;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;) is a set collection game. Each turn, you play three out of four cards to move or turn your rocket, and pick up a card from the color of the planet you end up on (if the planet is still unexplored). At the start of your turn you discard down to four cards into your personal score pile. If you push someone out of the universe map, you get to steal cards from their score pile.&#10;At the end of the game, each card is worth 1 point, with 1, 2 or 3 bonus points for the majority in the three available colors.&#10;&#10;In this game, you have five cards in your hand, each of which corresponds to a specific movement of the rocket (for example, two squares forward). You are required to select the most suitable action from the limited options and operate your own rocket. At the end of each turn, each player's position becomes a star and acquires resources. The rocket will become more and more difficult to move because it will be an &quot;out zone&quot; where you will be penalized if you enter.&#10;&#10;You can even crash your opponent by pushing them out of the field or to a position with a star! By doing so, you can steal resources from the opponent and get points, so it is often advantageous.&#10;&#10;Rules Summary:&#10;&#10;Use your hand to move the rockets in order. Since the number of cards you can use is small, let's move systematically. On the contrary, it is also possible to advance the game in an advantageous way by predicting the opponent's hand and action.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, explore the planet and win cards. This will be a means of transporting rockets as a hand. The effect obtained for each color of the reclamation area is fixed. Be aware of the cards you want and collect them.&#10;&#10;It is an out zone where you cannot enter the planets and the outside of the cultivated planet. Let alone self-destruction, you need to be careful not to be dropped by the other party. If you drop your opponent, you can steal a lot of cards from your opponent, so let's aim aggressively.&#10;&#10;The person with the most cards in the end wins! Bonus points will be given to the player with the highest number of cards for each color, so it may be the secret of victory not to give up until the end.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arnold Takes Command is a new kind of card-driven wargame for two players, ages 12 to 99. Unlike most of its siblings, in this game movement plays an insignificant role. Additionally, prior experience with traditional wargames isn&rsquo;t required. ATC isn&rsquo;t a dice-rolling slugfest or a &ldquo;take that&rdquo; affair. Here, it&rsquo;s all about the card play: what to play, when to play it, what to discard, what to track, etc.&#10;&#10;The game has two distinct phases, just like the actual battle. Players use action cards of various types to attack, defend, gain initiative, maneuver, emulate morale, take cover, use &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; to their advantage, and so forth. Single &ldquo;duds&rdquo; are discarded, but pairs have a useful purpose.&#10;&#10;A preponderance of &ldquo;split&rdquo; action cards ensures a nice variance from game to game. Components include 70+ cards and two maps.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The goal is always to create the best, most unique, interesting or fun stories. In a competitive version of the game, players have to fill in the middle of a story between a start and end card with cards from their hand. They take it in turns to reveal and tell their stories, and then vote for a winner. Voting is done by simultaneous pointing at the person whose comic strip you liked the best. In the collaborative versions, the emphasis is on building stories as a group, either by adding panels, or swapping panels out for new ones.&#10;&#10;Comic Turns is also a tool for learning about comics, building stories, inspiring creative writing and sparking the imagination.&#10;&#10;",

This is done by becoming the first Candidate to unlock the door to Evercent Springs with your Silver Key. Each Candidate is provided with 7 Companions to assist and fight for them; players must use them to stop their opponents from reaching the door while at the same time protecting their own Candidate and Silver Keys.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each Candidate has a Silver Key and one Companion from each town carries a Spare Key. If you lose both Keys, your hopes of becoming Mayor are over and you are out of the game.&#10;During the game you will face many challenges, including opponents, pubs, holes, havens, bribes, and the Council.&#10;&#10;The players start in their Hometowns; the door to Evercent Springs is located at the center of the board. On your turn, you move one piece. You can move your Candidate closer to the door; you can move away from an aggressive opponent&rsquo;s piece; you can go to the Pub; or, you can capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece and thereby eliminate it from the game. You can only capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece if it&rsquo;s within reach AND is lower ranked than your piece; the Council has ranked the Companions according to three categories, and the Council&rsquo;s Cards show which category is now being used to rank the Companions. The players can meet with the Councillors during the game and try to have them change the category; you get to turn over a new Council&rsquo;s Card and hope for the category you want. Or, you can bribe The Council, and get to choose category!&#10;&#10;Bribing The Council is one of the Ways &amp; Means in the game; if you have Gold Coins, you can purchase advantages. You can also purchase an Extra Step; a Hole Tile that will make a square on the board unusable; a Haven Tile to protect your Candidate; or even buy back eliminated Companions to the game. If you want to buy Ways &amp; Means, that must be done prior to moving your piece. &#10;With Gold Coins, you can also make Deals with your opponents&hellip;&#10;To get your hands on more Gold Coins, you can get lucky with the Pub cards, or eliminate opponents&rsquo; pieces. Or make good deals!&#10;Should your Candidate be captured, and you still have the Spare Key, you&rsquo;re still in the game. The Companion carrying the Spare Key is sacrificed and removed from the board, and your Candidate is being put back on your Hometown&rsquo;s Street, but you can still reach the door to Evercent Springs and win the game.&#10;&#10;If you lose your second key as well, then it&rsquo;s game over for you. &#10;Only Candidates can unlock the door to Evercent Springs, and thereby win the game.&#10;&#10;Strategy, tactics, luck and bribes are some of the tools to win this game; keeping your Candidate with their Silver key safe and at the same time be bold enough to first reach the door to be appointed Mayor of Evercent Springs.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
