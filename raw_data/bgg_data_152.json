    "Description": "In Home Sweet Home, players have five diving bells and want to get as many sea creatures into them as possible &ndash; but crabs don't like octopi and vice versa, so keep those two species separate if you don't want trouble.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, each player lays out diving bell cards in front of them, numbered 1-5, and receives four cards from the shuffled animal deck; crab and octopus cards are also numbered 1-5. At the start of a round, a player lays an animal card from her hand in the center of the table and states the sum of all cards played. The next player does the same, making sure that all animal cards are visible. This continues until the sum of the animals played totals twelve or more. The player who laid the last card takes the stack, then places the animals in her diving bells based on the number on the cards. If you would lay a crab in a diving bell that already holds one or more octopi cards (and vice versa), you must discard one card of each type.&#10;&#10;Once the deck rounds out, players finish the round, if possible, then sum the animals in their diving bells. The player with the highest total wins!&#10;&#10;",

You have fled to the town of Havenfall with the few items and treasures you salvaged from your home.&#10;&#10;In this deck-building game each player starts with the same ten cards. Players use their cards to perform one of the following actions during their turn: buy cards, fight monsters, or trash cards. Each player builds their own unique deck with their purchases. When a player buys a card, it is placed in their discard pile. When a player no longer has a deck, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the deck in which players&rsquo; draw their hands. Purchased cards are more powerful than the ten starter cards and help players fight monsters. Players may choose to thin down their deck by trashing cards in order for more powerful cards to be drawn more frequently.&#10;&#10;Players have the option of gaining spells during their turn. Spells can be used at any point during the game to either aid a player during their turn or disrupt an opponent&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;When a player fights and defeats a monster, the player gains a pixel related to the color of the monster. These pixels are a reusable resource that enhances players&rsquo; cards. When a player defeats a boss, they also gain points based on the monster&rsquo;s rank. These points move the player along on the scoreboard. The first player to reach ten points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Game of Staging Ridiculous Interventions about Nonsensical Problems.&#10;&#10;Caring friends and family have all gathered &ldquo;because they LOVE you&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s how it always starts. That&rsquo;s when you suddenly realize there&rsquo;s a problem - and it&rsquo;s YOU. You&rsquo;re shocked and clueless, which is why your loved ones have taken it upon themselves to carefully broach the subject. Naturally, no one wants to just come right out and say it. So they keep hinting at it, hoping you&rsquo;ll catch on eventually. But will you? Or will this Intervention fail?&#10;&#10;In this game, players take turns being the focus of an intervention by drawing a Problem card with a nonsensical problem like, &quot;Uncontrollable Interpretive Dancing&quot; or &quot;Neurotic Inability to Turn Right&quot;. They can't see the card, but all the Concerned Friends and Family can. Friends will give obscure clues that hint at the problem, without giving it away. The sooner the Intervened can guess the problem, the more points they'll score. The longer the Concerned Friends keep them guessing, the more points the Friends can earn. Each of the three rounds have a unique format for giving clues, Broaching the Subject, The Emotional Appeal and Offering a Solution. But if the Intervened cannot guess their problem by the end of the third round, no one will score any points, having failed to help their friend.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Designers:&#10;You are twisted.  I can&rsquo;t believe you actually want to put these adorable kittens in a blender! I guess that&rsquo;s none of my business. Maybe you&rsquo;re more of a dog person. Sure, kittens are curious by nature, but when they get in a kitchen full of dangerous appliances, it is up to you to save them.&#10;&#10;This fast-paced card game has players working to save all of their own kittens before the unthinkable happens. But sometimes the only way to save your precious litter of kittens is to let those curious little cats learn the lesson of why you should never play in a Blender!&#10;&#10;According to the box: A portion of the proceeds will be donated to a no kill cat shelter.&#10;&#10;Objective:&#10;Save your kittens and send your opponents' kittens to The Blender.&#10;&#10;Setup &amp; Play:&#10;Put the game box top on the table, open-side up and place the oversized Blender card inside, face-up: that's The Blender. Place the oversized Box card face up in the base of the box: that's The Box. Leave a little space between The Blender and The Box: that's The Counter.  Assign each player a Kitten color (red, green, blue or yellow), shuffle the deck, deal each player 6 cards and it's time to start saving adventurous kittens.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players play two cards and then draw back up to 6. Kitten cards may be played into The Blender, The Counter or The Box.  All other cards are played face up in front of the player so that all players can see which cards have been played.&#10;&#10;Players can play Kitties on the Move to move kittens to or from The Blender, The Counter or The Box; the number on the card specifies the number of kittens that can each be moved 1 space. Playing a Blend card will destroy the kittens currently in The Blender, save the kittens in The Box, and move the kittens on The Counter into The Blender unless countered by another player's Blend &quot;Pulse&quot; card.&#10;&#10;Players can move kittens around with other cards as well. Kittens in the Blender moves all of the kittens on The Counter or in The Box to The Blender. With These Cats in the Blender a player can move all cats of a chosen color from The Counter and The Box to The Blender. Kittens in the Box moves all kittens in The Blender or on The Counter to The Box, while Cats on the Counter moves all the kittens in The Blender or The Box to The Counter.&#10;&#10;Total chaos reigns when the Dog's in the Kitchen as each player gives her hand to the player in the direction indicated on the card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all 16 of the Blend cards have been played. Saved kittens are worth 2 points each, blended kitties cost 1 point each. Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 oversized Blender card, 1 oversized Box card, 110 playing cards (64 Kittens: 16 in each of 4 colors - red, green, blue and yellow; 18 Kitties on the Move: 6 of each number; 16 Blends: 8 Regular Blend &amp; 8 Blend Black; 4 Dogs in the Kitchen: 2 left &amp; 2 right; 2 Kittens in the Blender; 2 Your Cats in the Blender; 2 Cats on the Counter; 2 Kittens in the Box), rules.&#10;&#10;",

What if there was a game that supported your modeling hobby instead of burning it out? A game that let you build and paint and combine the models you like, and not just the ones you had to buy?

Some of the counters are fakes and &quot;substitutes&quot; (these are used to combine several counters into a single group.  All counters are placed in an off board box and the matching substitute counter is placed on the map.)&#10;-  Random initiative draw.  Similar to Firepower, chits for each side are placed in a cup and each turn one is randomly drawn to determine which player may move.&#10;&#10;Platoon had a AH complexity rating of 3.&#10;&#10;",

As a player, you must command your German or Allied forces so as to capture key objectives on the board while keeping your casualties down (and your opponent&rsquo;s casualties up).&#10;&#10;Nijmegen Bridge is the third and final game in the Market-Garden series, covering the events happening at this vital river crossing from September 17th-19th, 1944. The central Nijmegen sector of the attack crossed an arm of the Rhine that could not be bridged easily. If the US 82nd Airborne failed to capture the Nijmegen cross, the advance of XXX Corps would be checked and Operation Market-Garden would fail.&#10;&#10;With plenty of decision making and Optional Rules to extend gameplay and realism, the Allied advance into Germany hangs in the balance at Nijmegen Bridge!&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 8 on a 9 scale&#10;Unit scale: Each unit is 1 company to regiment, each hex is 0.6 kilometers, each (day) turn is about 4.5 hours, and each (night) turn is about 10 hours.&#10;&#10;",

Since chronological data were not taken into account, these characters may not have been simultaneously in the palace.&#10;Sebasti&atilde;o Jos&eacute; de Carvalho e Melo (Marquis of Pombal) was in his Palace in Oeiras, more precisely in the Fishing House, enjoying his precious leisure time when he finds out that his butler had shuffled his agenda.

The game consists of wooden letter tiles, each with four letters (the Discovery Edition contains 28 tiles and the Wooden Box edition has 32 tiles).  The board starts with 16 tiles and more are added during the game. On a turn, players find words (at least three letters long) on the board. Words can be situated vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. When a player finds a word, they use transparent tokens to highlight the letters in the word.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, the board expands beyond the inital 4 x 4 layout, as players earn new letter tiles and add them to the wordsearch field. The first player to use up all of their tokens wins.&#10;&#10;",

Back in the late 17th century, this would have allowed goods from the Pacific to be quickly traded across the Atlantic (and vice versa), and it seemed a fortune was there for the taking. Regrettably the adventure was beset by disease, shortage of supplies, the unremitting hardships of the jungle, and the Spanish! After all, they were trying to build a trading hub right in the middle of Spain's Empire.&#10;&#10;Darien Apocalypse is Ragnar Brothers' second Quantum game, and it features four similar but different worlds together with the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. One world may prosper, whilst another suffers deprivation. Scots are enlisted, ships sail, lands are explored. The original Caledonians managed to build a small encampment a fort and a watch tower. So buildings feature and drive the game, providing goods to raise more capital and special abilities to help build the colony and counter the Horsemen threat.&#10;&#10;This game can be played co-operatively or competitively. It feels like a struggle &mdash; it was a struggle!&#10;&#10;",

The player uses that die and nine wooden tiles to make a single word. The player can stop there and score, or bank the used tiles to score later, take an additional die, roll both dice, and make a new word with the remaining tiles. This new word will now be scored with a multiplier of 2 (with 2 dice). Players can continue with this adding dice and making words as long as they have tiles left. If a player fails to make a word, they score only their banked tiles with no multipliers.&#10;&#10;",

Some houses are worth more than others, and, crucially, some features are worth bonus points for specific vampire hunters.&#10;&#10;The tricky part? You know only your own identity. You don't know which of the other players is which vampire hunter and, even more distressingly, you're not sure which one of them is the villainous vampire. Your only clues are which houses they're eager to win &mdash; and if that's not difficult enough, you might even have to contend with a Frankenstein or a Woof Man!&#10;&#10;Watch Out!

    "Description": "Match magic symbols to summon elder gods, demons, and mythological monsters, then use them to attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;You start with two decks of cards: SPELLS and SUMMONS. Spell cards each have 4-6 different magic symbols on them. Each player starts with 2 Spell cards and then draws 1 new card every turn. You can never have more than 6 Spell cards in your hand at once though. The goal is to pair up matching symbols across your Spell cards to create hands, sort of like a weird, alternate universe version of poker. Once you've matched up a complete Spell hand, you trade it in to draw Summon cards. How many Summon cards you can draw in a turn depends on the complexity of the hand you trade in for it.Summon cards depict a deity, demon, or monster from a variety of mythological, religious, literary, or just plain made-up sources. Each Summon card has an ability that you can play against your competitors to make them lose turns, discard spell cards, or other nefarious setbacks. Each and every Summon card you play puts you one step closer to victory, until...&#10;&#10;For a 30-45 minute game, the first person to play 7 Summon cards wins! Want a longer game? Really challenge yourself and play to 13 Summon cards. That's the basics. Pretty simple, huh? Oh, one little twist I forgot to mention...&#10;&#10;Included in the Summon deck are the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They're extremely powerful cards by themselves, but if by some unholy fluke you manage to draw and play all four of them in a game, you win instantly, no matter how many other Summon cards you've played.&#10;&#10;And... shuffled into the Spell card deck are also Curse cards, which can totally throw off even the best player's strategy. They can make YOU lose turns, give other players cards, or other setbacks, so watch out! The tables can turn at any time and nobody is ever safe for long.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, roll the six dice, then re-roll any you wish, then (if you lower your CubeMelt token by 1) re-roll a second time. The dice have heart eyes (which raise love by 1), star eyes (which raise adventure by 1), a sad face (which lowers CubeMelt by 1), and a droopy face (which also lowers CubeMelt by 1). If one die face appears more often than each of the others, your left and right neighbors receive the effects of these dice, while you receive the effects of all other dice; if not, then you receive the effects of all the dice you rolled.&#10;&#10;If a player reaches 20 love or adventure, they win immediately! If a player melts away, reaching 0 with CubeMelt, the game ends, and everyone else's score is equal to the lower of their love and adventure tokens. In this case, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the advanced game that features different costumed versions of CubeMelt, each of which has a unique game-changing power.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Parlay is a card game that challenges players to make the best poker hand and the best word that they can from their cards.&#10;&#10;Parlay uses an artistically enhanced 52 card deck of familiar playing cards, with the addition of a letter and point value on each card. Players decide which cards to hold and which to exchange in an attempt to improve their word, their poker hand, and hopefully both.&#10;&#10;Like traditional poker, players can enjoy a variety of games like the favorites 'Texas Hold'em' and 'Five Card Draw', or original games like 'Unlucky 7's' and 'Wild I's'.&#10;&#10;Unlike traditional poker, Parlay involves no betting or wagering. However, players are faced with an element of poker-style risk, where every hand they must decide whether to 'FOLD' for guaranteed points, or risk their points and 'STAY' in an attempt to win out over opponents for big point bonuses.&#10;&#10;Parlay also introduces 'Wordbluffing', where players are invited to play oddly spelled words to trick their opponents into calling their bluff to knock them out of the hand. Players can also try to get away with fake or misspelled words, hoping their bluff won't be called. Wordbluffing usually results in lots of laughs.&#10;&#10;Parlay comes with a deck of 52 casino quality playing cards, 2 jokers, 1 info card, 6 stay/fold game chips, 80 sheet score pad, and an instruction booklet. Players 2-6, Ages 9 and up.&#10;&#10;",

Other key advantages of the game &ndash; all the players are in the game all the time and you get both competitive (each player plays for himself) and cooperative modes in one box.&#10;&#10;How to play the game: &#10;&#10;     Take your cards in hand as your personal deck, and move the first card slightly down. The numbers of the second card indicate the words of the first card - they are your challenge!&#10;     Describe (or rather bridge) your challenge words with a one-word clue. The players have an option to choose how many challenge words (2 or 3) they will bridge.&#10;     Speak out your clue and show your card - other players should rack their brains to be the first who guess all the words you described. &#10;&#10;&#10;The players have only one try to show how shrewd they are. The first player to solve the clue discards one of his cards. The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards.&#10;&#10;Why the game is so cute: &#10;&#10;     easy game rules, that can be explained in 1 minute - it&rsquo;s a perfect family game;&#10;     you don&rsquo;t need a table to play the game, so you can take it wherever you want;&#10;     it is very dynamic, all the players are in the game every turn; &#10;     the game has both competitive (3+) and cooperative (2+) modes;&#10;     two difficulty levels; &#10;     the game is bilingual: the words on the cards are in the English and in the Russian languages (for the Russian edition). You can play in one of the  languages or in both;&#10;     very replayable with the total of 1008 words on the cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Paragraphs are read in sequence as determined by the rules and tables, describing new situations, locations and characters, providing clues and throwing red herrings in your path in your pursuit of the truth. Each game will provide a new playing experience, since no two games will play out the same way.&#10;&#10;SHDSG is comprised of three booklets: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (comprised of Rules and Adventures), The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. You will need all three booklets and a few 6-sided dice (d6) to play the game. Future expansions will be available to supplement the rules, develop existing cases and solve new crimes.&#10;&#10;You will read various numbered sections one after another but the sequence of paragraphs is determined by rules and tables. Each describes a new situation, or provides rules about the choices and actions you can make. There are plenty of events and situations, so each game will be a new, fresh experience. Ultimately it is also about your skill as a role player to piece the elements together.&#10;&#10;SHDSG is an adventure game played in turns. A standard turn starts with you selecting an Action, such as Exploring, Planning or Investigating before. Generally in an Adventure, you will try to defeat a Villain. This is done by gaining Clue events to find out what has been happening and then reveal the Villain. Once you know the identity of the Villain you must try to discover their Motive and gain enough insight to Arrest them for their crimes!&#10;&#10;This game is free to download as a series of PDFs in the file section.&#10;&#10;",

The rules might be the highest card in a certain suit, or most cards that have a certain skill, or the sum of all cards the player has.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who slays the final dragon receives bonus points, then everyone sums their loot and points, with the player who has the highest total winning.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Medieval Battles is a strategy game with a certain dose of luck and emotion. The rules are very accessible and the possibilities are multiple.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in Britain, around the 9th century. Each player represents one people fighting for occupying space and developing their civilization.&#10;&#10;To gain victory points you must build temples and cities. For that, it is necessary to generate resources that come from the conquest of new territories and from the founding of new cities. And to conquer new territories you must also build troops and buy cards.&#10;&#10;The troops move through the territories and also by ship, which gives them more mobility. The battles are fought with dice, affected by cards played with the face down and revealed at the same time. The presence of a leader also affects the result.&#10;&#10;The end of each round is marked by a Viking attack, the Vikings being the most feared warriors of that time and of the game. After that, there comes the scoring and each player receives victory points markers that he hides from the other players.&#10;&#10;At the end of 8 rounds, the player with more points wins the game.&#10;&#10;The challenge is to balance economic and military development, aiming at gaining the most victory points.&#10;&#10;From the instructions:&#10;For 2 to 5 players ages 9 and up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Playing as a local stable boy who works in the Caravanserai, you have the privilege of being allowed into the restricted inner courtyard. This opens up a unique opportunity for you to make some money by doing your own business with the travellers, and acquiring the merchandise much sought after by local traders outside, who have no access to the area. Your starting resources are modest and you should use them wisely. Sometimes you will need to borrow money to carry out your actions, but supplying the local traders with the goods they want, you should earn enough to invest more, in addition to paying off your debt. The first player to accumulate 32 dirhams triggers the final round of the game, but the player with the most savings wins.&#10;&#10;You have two optional actions per turn, and each must be preceded by a mandatory move along the courtyard path. A move can cover 1-3 spaces, and once in a turn you can chose to roll in the hope of making a longer move &ndash; but never longer than what you have rolled. Each space offers an action: you can borrow money from the money changers; buy, sell or exchange goods at the pavilions and merchants&rsquo; stalls; or trade goods directly with the travellers. However, there is a unique fountain in the centre of the courtyard, which rotates each time when certain transactions are made, and this can affect your income!&#10;&#10;The local traders will give you minor or major orders for the goods they need; completing these orders will not only earn you money, but also help you pay off your debts, increase your savings and obtain ability cards that will give you additional benefits during or at the end of the game. It is worth completing as many major orders as you can, as the order cards are collectible and the sets are worth additional points.&#10;&#10;Caravanserai is an easy-to-learn trading and resource management game that is fun for the whole family. It involves sufficient luck factor to help beginners catch up, but it is also a fairly strong strategic and tactical challenge.&#10;&#10;Hungarian description:&#10;&#10;A karav&aacute;nszer&aacute;j z&aacute;rt ter&uuml;let, oda nem juthatnak be k&iacute;v&uuml;lr&#197;&#145;l a helyi keresked&#197;&#145;k, pedig sz&iacute;vesen v&aacute;s&aacute;roln&aacute;nak a karav&aacute;nok &aacute;ltal sz&aacute;ll&iacute;tott mes&eacute;s port&eacute;k&aacute;b&oacute;l!

A party of four heroes face monsters and terrain that might slow them down, but each deploys unique abilities to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The game takes place in Earthshine, a world that has been literally torn open by a giant meteor. The chasm that has formed has become a new world for exploration, adventure and danger. Our characters have joined up to take on quests below the surface.&#10;&#10;Chain Mail consists of a base set of rules, tokens, and cards, which are then complemented by map, monster, quest, and treasure cards -- one each -- and four hero character cards. The modular design of the game allows for thousands of scenario combinations and a rich depth of party creation and combination.&#10;&#10;Regardless of the setup, each consists of the party working in unison. First they decide to stay or move. Then they roll for trouble, and either battle or adventure. Afterwards, they wrap everything up -- distribute treasure, tend to their wounds -- to end the turn. But the characters REALLY come to life during battle and adventure phases, showing off their special skills and mechanics to create radically different play experiences.&#10;&#10;Every adventure and every party is different; it's up to YOU to guide your intrepid heroes to glory! ...or failure.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Starter Kit was released in January 2019 for Board Game of the Month Club subscribers.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Legend tells of a tavern called BARPIG, where you can hear squeals and oinks of delight; The sounds of adventurous pigs challenging one another for victory or fall on the floor trying. However, not everyone is allowed in the illustrious BARPIG tavern, and some aren't too pleased about it! So when the good pigs are away, the bad pigs break in to play...&#10;&#10;BARPIG: After Hours is the stand-alone sequel AND a deck-buildable expansion to the highly popular BARPIG - The Adventure Party Game.&#10;&#10;Featuring 10 brand new characters and a swath of new items, BARPIG: After Hours features more strategic gameplay, adding a thematically darker side to the BARPIG universe. Expect alliances and treachery alongside your typical bouts of laughter and ridiculous fun our fans have come to expect from BARPIG.&#10;&#10;Planned to launch on Kickstarter in 2019, BARPIG: After Hours will be available to play-test at Dutch Comic Con 2018 at the American Book Centre booth.&#10;&#10;&#10;What is BARPIG - The Adventure Party Game?&#10;&#10;Imagine if you could embody a hero character with the power to challenge or otherwise embarrass your friends. But be careful, for those same friends wield powerful item cards that threaten to change the game at any moment!&#10;&#10;Now combine this with a leveling system to keep it competitive and a damage system to make it vindictive and this is BaRPiG - The unholy result of a one night stand between card-based role-playing games and a mostly ridiculous party. This seriously fun and highly portable game is perfect for anyone, anywhere and everywhere.&#10;&#10;Oh, and there will be pigs...&#10;&#10;What started as a bunch of silly puns written on a bar napkin has since become our out of control hobby.&#10;&#10;",

Players descend into a dungeon randomly laid-out from a stack of tiles, fighting through the orc and goblin hordes to rescue the kidnapped maiden and collect treasure and glory.&#10;&#10;Each player takes turns to move through the dungeon one tile at a time, laying new tiles as unexplored areas are entered; every time a player enters a room, special monster dice are rolled to determine the enemies faced and the potential loot to be found. When a monster attacks, a die is rolled to determine the style of their attack; the player then chooses a card from his hand to counter with, each card being strong against some kinds of attack and weak against others.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal of the game is for the players to fight their way to the bottom of the dungeon to rescue the captured maiden - and then fight their way out with her. The dungeon will become harder to fight through as the player delves deeper, and then harder still on the way out with a helpless rescuee in tow.&#10;&#10;This Print-and-Play game was an entry in the 'One Full-sheet Label' design contest here on BGG, and as such the printed components fit entirely on a single label sheet. A small number of other tokens and blank dice will also be required. Additionally, as the name hints, once constructed on cardstock it is possible to fit the game inside an Altoids tin or similar.&#10;&#10;",

If totally forgotten, they will cease to exist. No more sunrises, no more seasons, no more rains, no more harvests. Earth is doomed.&#10;&#10;In the year 2319, Zeus calls together The Council, made up of 12 powerful gods, to discuss the dire situation. Aphrodite, Ares, Artemis, Athena, Apollo, Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hermes, Hephaestus,  Poseidon, and Zeus. However, their interpersonal conflicts make finding agreement impossible.&#10;&#10;Finally, one decision is made. A competition of epic proportion, the first of its kind, will be held to identify which of them will lead them to a brighter future. They will call their champions Invictus&ndash;meaning invincible&ndash;a title reserved for Kings. With advancements in technology, the playing field is even. All will unite under this new order no matter who wins. With Invictus in place and the Gods united, they can begin to restore mankind&rsquo;s faith and ensure earth&rsquo;s future.&#10;&#10;As a team, defeat the opposition and get them to recognize you as Invictus. Invictus is a deck-building game. During the game, players will customize their decks by purchasing more artifacts, boosts, and reinforcements. As a person&rsquo;s deck runs out, the used cards are reshuffled and placed face down. Thus, your purchased cards will be used many times throughout the game.&#10;&#10;How you customize your card depends on your strategy and your character. Each player will assume the role of a Greek god and each one has special abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. You&rsquo;ll need to use your cards strategically to defeat your opponents before they defeat you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

However, after experiencing the beauty of the crystal power, the creatures also became fierce and warlike. To continue mining and using this mysterious force, different species formed tribes, divided, and occupied the land. Among dozens of tribes, the two most representative but also most incompatible ones - Wazu and Balan - once again triggered a war for a newly discovered land.&#10;&#10;Now, lead your tribe, arrange and assign warriors to fight, and win this war!&#10;&#10;&larr; Overview &rarr;&#10;Maatatahay is a two-player-only strategy game, playing up to 12 rounds on a 5x5 suedette&nbsp;game map. You and your opponent play as the leaders of Balan and Wazu, sending your fearless warriors to the field to fight for the glory. Surrounding your opponent's warriors to defeat them while allocating your valuable unit in a safe spot is the key to victory. You can also collect crystal powers to enhance your warrior's strength or visit the Shrines to seize more strategy opportunities. When the endgame condition is met, the player with the most victory points from their surviving warriors, Spirit Crystals, and relics bonus wins!&#10;&#10;&larr;What's special&rarr;&#10;&#10;        Pick one from three + the weak one&rsquo;s choice: Every turn, the active player chooses a pair of warriors from the tile stream. However, the player with lower strength(fangs around the neck) in that pair decides whether to join the battlefield first or later.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        Arrow support + the sequence: Place your warriors in formation, and gain energy from the environment or your allies with a corresponding arrow to increase their survivability. But remember, only the warrior who enters the battlefield earlier can grant energy to the latter one, for they&rsquo;ve immersed in the land and let the power of crystal go through their body.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        Get &ldquo;Surrounded&rdquo; + collective attack, sole defense: A warrior is &ldquo;surrounded&rdquo; when there are no vacancies around orthogonally. In this situation, the surrounded warrior has to face the collective strength of the opponents on its own.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;And more(various shrine setup and scoring, randomness from the deck, Hot stamping + Suedette game map, &hellip;etc.)&#10;In sum, this is a highly strategic and in-depth thoughts game.

    "Description": "Atlantic Sentinels is a solitaire, tactical level game placing you as the Senior Officer of the Escort, shepherding a convoy in the North Atlantic from the attacks of U-boats, both singly and in wolfpacks. &#10;You are in command of a convoy escort group, composed typically of 4-10 escort vessels guarding a convoy on its way across the Atlantic.   &#10;Your mission is to protect as much Allied shipping as possible while simultaneously destroying as many U-boats as possible during the height of the U-boat threat &ndash; 1942 to early 1943.&#10;&#10;Atlantic Sentinels provides players with a host of decisions as he is assigned to protect merchant convoys, typically ranging from 40 to 60 ships. The placement of escorts to offer front, rear, and flank protection to the convoy is complicated by the size of the convoy and available assets. Additional decisions must be made on where to place the escorts, which are equipped with Type 271 radars, the key to your defense.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, a player&rsquo;s Escort Group may receive upgrades in the form of additional radars, HF/DF (High-Frequency Direction Finding) equipment, and possibly additional ships. Air support can be key, but until the CVE &ldquo;jeep carriers&rdquo; arrive, the &ldquo;Black Pit&rdquo; in the center of the Atlantic remains a high threat area.&#10;&#10;Players will find it highly challenging to minimize convoy losses and keep them to an acceptable level.&#10;&#10;Players may choose any of 9 historical Escort Groups (five British, four Canadian) armed with historical destroyers and corvettes.&#10;&#10;These ships include:&#10;&#10;     B/C/D/E Classes DE&#10;     F Class DE&#10;     H Class DE&#10;     V&amp;W Class DE&#10;     Town Class DE (American Lend Lease)&#10;     River Class FF&#10;     Flower Class Corvettes&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once your initial Escort Group is set up, play proceeds by rolling for a convoy and escorting it across the Atlantic. Enemy forces range from single U-boats (typically a type VII, but possibly a Type IX) to entire wolfpacks. Wolfpacks increase in size (as they did historically) and will be your primary challenge. Encounters are randomly generated, ensuring no two careers will ever be the same. Weather can impact operations, as well as air support and crew upgrades due to experience. A logical but reasonably simple set of instructions bring the U-boats in to attack you from random directions, making your initial defensive array very important.&#10;&#10;Of particular note is the game is designed to integrate with The Hunters if players wish to combine the games.&#10;&#10;Atlantic Sentinels: North Atlantic Convoy Escorts, 1942-43 is meant to be a highly playable and interesting solitaire game covering the actions an Escort Group would have to deal with in fighting the U-boat peril during convoy escort.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10 (solitaire game design)&#10;Time Scale: Semi-abstract (Convoy escort missions, 2 per month)&#10;Map Scale: Abstract&#10;Unit Scale: Individual escorts, U-boats, merchant ships (when targeted)&#10;Players: One (with option for two)&#10;Playing Time: 15 to 20 minutes (single mission), 6-8 hours (full career)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "People love traveling. We want to meet new cultures, see famed landmarks with our own eyes and taste the world cuisine. One of the most pleasant ways to explore a new city is... just going for a walk. But how to chart a tour route that satisfies everyone? There&rsquo;s an answer!&#10;&#10;En Route is a flip-and-write game in which you create tour routes to the most interesting landmarks of the real-world cities (London, New York City, Hong Kong, Paris, Cairo, and Rio de Janeiro) and the made-up First City packed full of geek references. Every city features basic and specific mechanisms, so all of them play and feel differently.&#10;&#10;Cards are not flipped randomly &mdash; instead, an active player plays one card face up, and two players next to them secretly choose one card each. Then, an active player selects one of the two and discards the other. After that, all players use coordinates and other information from the two cards left on the table to draw their tourists and routes.&#10;&#10;During the game, route segments are drawn, connecting different types of tourists to various landmarks and attractions. A game of En Route lasts exactly 10 rounds. At the end of the game, each place of interest on the final route will earn players Prestige Points according to its rules. Whoever creates the most satisfying tour route, wins!&#10;&#10;The game features constant and quite intense player interaction, and players have a fair degree of control and can strategize. It plays fast, dynamic, and makes you constantly think about what your opponents want to do (and sometimes even negotiate so that they play cards that are beneficial to you!).&#10;&#10;",

Everything you will need to play the game comes inside a box of Emergents: Genesis.&#10;&#10;In Emergents: Genesis, players take on the role of powerful superheroes who discovered their powers during adolescence&mdash;known in this world as Emergents&mdash;and battle against the other players to be the last one standing.&#10;&#10;Players customize their decks based on four classes of superpowers in a fast-paced game that can be played by two to four players. Designed by Urban Island Games and Top8Magic, Emergents: Genesis introduces innovative, interactive mechanics to the deckbuilding game that will appeal to all fans of both the superhero genre and interactive card games.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Description&#10;&#10;Players are dealt two Emergents face down and choose one of the heroes to start the game with. The object of the game is reduce all of the other players' heroes to zero health by attacking them while also building your deck and customizing your Emergent's superpowers.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with a deck containing nine Skill cards and three Attack cards. Cards that generate Skill are used to purchase additional cards while cards that generate Attack are used to defeat your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player shuffles their deck and draws six cards. They can purchase basic cards that advance their Emergent's class strategy or purchase more expensive cards that are available dealt face-up from the deck. Cards that are purchased get put in the player's discard pile and whenever a player can't draw a card they shuffle their deck. At the end of each turn, a player discards their hand and draws six cards from their deck.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, players will ideally create a deck that showcases their heroes' unique abilities and allows them to be the last player standing. While many deckbuilding games are points races, where someone crosses a finish line and wins, Emergents: Genesis requires you to defeat your opponents, which means you can defend yourself if you have purchased the right cards along the way.&#10;&#10;",

There are several different Pounce editions which have substantially different components, but similar gameplay.  The 2004 edition, for example, has a plastic cat shaped capture device that doesn't resemble a toilet plunger.&#10;&#10;A player rolls the dice and depending on their roll either tries to plunge the mice or not.  Players holding the mice must pull their mice away before they are captured.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    3 Blind Mice&#10;&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Gameplay of the German version Spitz pa&szlig; auf!:&#10;&#10;Spitz pa&szlig; auf! is a children's game for 2-6 players. One player is drawn by lot to be the die roller for this game. Each player gets a number of tokens, which act as victory points (see further below). &#10;The rest of the players now place their figures, which are attached to little ropes, onto the playing mat in the middle of the play area. The die roller now rolls the die, and, depending on which number shows up (either a 1 or a 6), he must try to put the dice cup over the figures, while the other players must try to pull their figures from the play area before the cup is put over them.&#10;&#10;If they don't succeed fast enough, they have to give each other player 1 token. In case they pull their figure from the play area even if no 1 or 6 was rolled, they have to do the same. Also, if the die roller doesn't act fast enough to cover all figures who needed to be trapped in the cup on the roll of 1 or 6, he has to pay 1 token to each other player and pass the die cup to the next player, who the acts as the die roller until he misses to cover a figure, and so on.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined when one player has reached a set amount of tokens, or one player has lost all tokens.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, especially for young children, there are also colour-coded dice included, and instead of 1 or 6, two colours are determined when the game begins.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, make note of the empty points orthogonally adjacent to one of your groups and move a stone in that group to one of those points. All stones that were part of the same group before the move must be part of the same group after the move.&#10;&#10;Your move must reduce the distance between the affected group and its closest friendly group. The distance between two groups is the shortest free path between them along the lines of the board, i.e. the number of consecutive moves you would need to merge those groups. The path does not need to be a straight line.&#10;&#10;If you cannot make a move on your turn, you win. This occurs when you have only one group or there is no free path between any of your groups. If a board position is repeated with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw. This is possible in theory, but probably requires colluding players.&#10;&#10;The pie rule can be used in order to make the game fair. This rule gives White the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesTry to build long walls between enemy groups to force your opponent to spend more moves connecting them. Playing from the outside in is usually more efficient, as it helps you not to leave any groups behind. The distance rule has some interesting tactical effects: sometimes, in order to move a group (A) in the desired direction, you will first have to move away its closest counterpart (B) so that A is not &quot;engaged&quot; to B anymore.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ayu&quot; is short for &quot;Attach Your Units&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Alakazoo is a family board game for 2-4 players. It tells a story of a competition in Magic Tournament. You impersonate Wizards whose task will be to summon one of Fantastic Creatures as soon as possible. Each player receives a special Portal board that consists of 9 fields. Each field contains 2 runes that must be powered with Magic Power in order that a proper element of a Fantastic Creature could appear there. These elements are represented by special cards managed by players.&#10;&#10;The course of the game is divided into turns. During each turn players, in rotation, perform one of the actions: acquire Magic Power to activate runes (with spell dice), manage Fantastic Creature element cards, or use the assistance of the Magic Helper (provided they are in possession of one). At the end of their turn, if both runes are active (powered with Magic Power) on any of their Portal's fields, players can summon there their due Fantastic Creature element.&#10;Players must be careful though, as gaining too much Magic Power and/or too many Fantastic Creature elements may result in obtaining the Dark Power token. If they collect too many of such tokens, they will have to purge themselves of Dark Power while losing their turn.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game players will be awarded with points from the audience. At the end of the tournament Magic Jury lead by Archmage will evaluate their proficiency in the art of magic by giving them additional points. The Wizard who will obtain the highest total score will win and receive the title of the Arcanimus.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The first phase ended when the tanks of Panzergruppe Kleist emerged unscathed from the western end of the Ardennes Forest on 14 May, thus unhinging the entire Allied strategic plan. The third phase began on June 5, when the final drives into the heart of France were begun. For two weeks at the end of May, the Allies had a final chance to rebalance the situation. Had they succeeded in stabilizing a supplied bridgehead on the Flanders coast, or managed to smash the thinly-spread German mechanized formations while breaking out southward, all of subsequent World War II history would have been changed. Alternately, had the Germans succeeded in bagging the whole of the B.E.F., there would have been little or nothing to stop an Operation Sealion and no troops to send to North Africa.&#10;&#10;Game has a 12 turn Campaign scenario, and a 7/5 turn &quot;No Halt Order&quot; scenario to examine the ramifications of Hitler's mistake. The ratio of playing area to unit quantity creates high-density combat and fluid gameplay situations. The simulation is at the intermediate level of complexity, and suitable for solitaire play&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Jasper and Zot is a one player game about two old, feuding wizards. The White Mage Jasper is quite the famous gardener and his pumpkins always win the blue ribbon at the local faire. His long-time adversary and neighbor, Zot the Necromancer, who is not good at growing living things, has summoned an army of the undead to smash all of Jasper's prize-winning pumpkins. Help Jasper defend his pumpkins by turning Zot's shambling minions into delicate white flowers and then burning them to ash!&#10;&#10;Game play borrows heavily from classic arcade games such as Space Invaders and Puyo Pop.  The player moves Jasper horizontally along the garden path while casting spells to either transform the approaching zombies into flowers or ignite those flowers and any nearby zombies with magical fire.  The more you destroy with a single spell, the more points you earn.  If you can survive both waves of Zot's undead army, you win the game and earn a score based on how well you did.&#10;&#10;Jasper and Zot won first place in the one full-sheet label game design contest here on BGG. Contained in Casual Game Insider Magazine CGI#43(2023)&#10;&#10;",
