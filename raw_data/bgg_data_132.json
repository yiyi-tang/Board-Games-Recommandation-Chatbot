    "Description": "(David A. Vandenbroucke review - http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt):&#10;&#10;France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.&#10;&#10;Complexity is rated as &quot;low,&quot; and solitaire suitability is &quot;medium.&quot;  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.&#10;&#10;For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.&#10;&#10;The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).&#10;Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.&#10;&#10;",

Take on the role of a fearless leader, then race for dominance, guiding your convoy through the treacherous wasteland to claim the richest territories.&#10;&#10;Each round starts by revealing a location card, which gives players a target number they try to reach with their convoy as close as possible. Players can press their luck playing cards from their deck, and whoever gets closest to the target receives the best reward. Topping the target makes you bust, leaving you (almost) empty-handed. At the end of each round, a player chooses a new card with a unique ability to add to their deck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each country affected by the war is represented on an &quot;ideological&quot; chart which tracks the movement of the powers into the different spheres of influence: Fascist, Communist and Democrat.  Where each country lies on this chart is vital to which country controls their decisions and forces.  Political decisions are chosen from a large array of IPOs (International Policy Options) and a number of Political Options available only to the country that you're playing.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the original Days of Decision (I) but is almost a new game. The old one had 4 million possible outcomes, this one has over one hundred trillion (according to the game designer).&#10;&#10;",

While the universe expands, you can also cause orbits, eclipses, hyperspace, or even the mysterious and almost unknown dark energy. Your goal? Align celestial bodies while a cosmic clock is ticking the passing of time&hellip;in millions of years!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game is composed by hexagonal pieces: 48 celestial bodies of four types (planets, stars, asteroids and comets), with four colors (yellow, orange, red and blue) and three backgrounds (empty space, stars and galaxy). There are astronomical phenomena pieces (supernova, black hole and wormholes) and special actions (orbit, eclipse, hyperspace and dark energy). Finally, a cosmic clock will tick the passing of time and players' turn.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, each player takes two hidden objective cards: a celestial body type and a color. During the game, the player scores victory points by aligning three or more celestial bodies consecutively of their own type or color.&#10;&#10;The game starts at moment zero of the universe 13.7 billion years ago, with someone placing the first piece: the Big Bang! On a turn, the player has to place one of the four available pieces below the cosmic clock. Two rules are mandatory to place a piece in the universe:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The piece must be adjacent to at least two pieces and at least one of them has to be a celestial body.&#10;    The celestial body has to have a common characteristic with all the adjacent celestial bodies: same type, same color, or same background.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once the game runs out of available pieces and all of them are placed in the universe, the game ends. The players reveal their objective cards and count their victory points based on the alignments according to their two objective cards. Whoever has the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player who is the most behind on the cosmic clock &mdash; that is, the one who has invested fewer millions of years &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each level is comprised of a dungeon that the heroes will explore in an attempt to find the dungeon's boss. The heroes must then defeat the boss in order to gain more Triforce Shards.&#10;&#10;The game employs a form of deck-building to allow the players to level up their heroes.  Each deck starts with just some basic skill cards representing a hero's Power, Courage and Wisdom.  The heroes can add items and treasures to these decks to power up their abilities throughout the game.  The players will then play these cards to perform actions during the different phases of the game.&#10;&#10;At the end of Level 4, the heroes will face the all-powerful Ganon in a final showdown to determine whether they save Hyrule and win the game, or whether Hyrule will be plunged into an era of darkness under the rule of a new dark lord...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Requires: &#10;1) the printed cards with the game. (63 cards)&#10;2) a game that is multiplayer that you really want to play solitaire.&#10;&#10;Time to play the game: Really depends on what you want to play. Expect to double the normal time for gameplay when using the system for the first time. This will shorten substantially after playing it a few times.&#10;&#10;Concept:&#10;&#10;The Solo System is not a game per se, rather it is a Artificial Intelligence system that provides an unpredictable opponent for your multiplayer games. With a few adjustments, this can make a wide selection of games capable of being played solitaire.&#10;&#10;Short Description of the Mechanics:&#10;&#10;The Solo System is heavily influenced by role-playing systems such as Mythic and The Covetous Poet's Adventure Creator, but is much streamlined to be played with board games rather than role-playing games. It only uses a deck of 63 cards to accomplish its task.&#10;&#10;It works like this: You set up your game and play it the same way that you would a normal game. When it is your opponents turn, you use The Solo System to figure out how your opponent will play.  You will first flip a card and determine what personality/strategy the AI is interested this round. There is a good chance that the system will keep the same strategy as the last round. Then you will look at the board and figure out if there is a move that would match this strategy or flip more cards to give a little more direction as to what he is interested in.&#10;&#10;At this point you will probably find several moves that the AI could take. Choose one and ask the game if it does take that move. Before you flip a card, determine what the probability of the AI is of taking that move: probably, probably not, or unsure. Then flip the card and determine the results.&#10;&#10;Cards have multiple pieces of information on them and are divided into four different decks. One deck has 14 cards, and the other two decks have 20 cards. There are mechanisms for movement on maps, targets and objectives for its armies, selection of resources such as coal or gold, and auctions.&#10;&#10;The system is not unlike playing a game two handed, but you are playing against an opponent. Plus using the card system gives you direction for how to play one of the players. This will assist when trying to play several opponents and keep track of their play style. The opponent may need handicaps to increase its challenge against you depending on how you want to play, and these rules will give you ideas as to how to implement these handicaps.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Post independence from colonial rule, India had been left in shambles. It was the combined efforts of bureaucrats, politicians, and industrialists who worked together (and sometimes not so much together) to start a new industrial revolution following the five-year plans. It is the dawn of a new era, for liberalization and globalization has removed much of the licensing and red-taping that had hindered development of the industries.&#10;&#10;In the game of Tycoon: India 1981, players represent big industrial houses of India that are trying to dominate the six key industrial sectors &mdash; minerals, fuel, agro, power, transport, and finance &mdash; by obtaining the rights from the government and building factories on a map of India. Although the goal is to be rich, they must try to influence national policies to their favor, as well as gain political votes to break ties, all while balancing wealth and fame in a series of rounds that will ultimately decide one winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Box description:&#10;War of Resistance is a detailed, operational level game which chronicles the second Sino-Japanese Conflict starting on July 7, 1937. Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.&#10;The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.&#10;Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.&#10;War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    One rules booklet.&#10;    Two Orders of Battle booklets. One for the Japanese and one for the Chinese orders of battle.&#10;    A Battle Scenarios Booklet&#10;    Four &quot;full-sized&quot; maps (Maps G1 thru G4) and 2 &quot;half&quot; maps (Maps G5 and G6).&#10;    Two map overlays&#10;    8 counter sheets (CS G1 - CS G7)&#10;    A set of charts &#10;    Two six-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Seeing their inevitable doom, the factions reached an alliance. Hundreds of years have passed in peace since The Great War. One day, The Aether Stone fell from the heavens. The Stone carried with it crystals filled with intense magical power. The crash spread these crystals throughout the land, but the majority of the crystals were concentrated at the crash site. Once the factions began collecting the crystals, they realized how powerful they were and what they could do with them. Peace had prevailed, but many sought after the power of the crystals, and power leads to corruption. Eventually, armies began to march on the crash site to hoard it's power. The struggle for conquest had begun. But not all were consumed by the crystals' powers. Some remained content working the land and building glorious cities, filled with monuments and workshops.&#10;&#10;Which path will you choose to follow?&#10;&#10;Rolling Empires is a fantasy empire dice building game for 2 - 6 players. Engine building and area control are some of the key features of this game. It features 6 factions, all with several unique creatures in the form of dice that can be recruited to build your engine. Players score points through building and through conquest. There is no one path to victory.&#10;&#10;",

Now it's a place where weeds grow.&#10;People have been seeing fire spirits on the ziggurat's levels. The elders are asking for volunteers to investigate. Finally, it's your chance to be a hero! You hope to find a dragon.&#10;&#10;Ziggurat is a co-operative legacy game, with the story of the ziggurat unfolding over six chapters and with you making decisions during play that affect all of your games to come. As the story progresses, you will make permanent changes to the game, adding new rules, materials, and pieces to the board. Work together to complete the challenges that each chapter brings. The result is a co-operative adventure that you can play again and again!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To achieve that, they need to do what a dwarf does best: brag about their exploits and try to impress the dwarf council, who will elect the new king.&#10;&#10;They compete against each other to gain glory, runes, and dwarf votes. During the game, the player places their workers in several locations, acquires resources, and impresses the council members. (Each council member will request some resources points.) In every location is a bet, with cards with values from 1 to 6, to know who is the best. At the end of the mourning days, the leader of the clan with more votes will become the new king of the hill.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For What Remains is a skirmish-level series of three wargames set in a post-apocalyptic near future: &#10;&#10;    Streets of Ruin&#10;    Blood on the Rails&#10;    Out of the Basement&#10;&#10;&#10;Blood on the Rails features the Echo and Soldiers of Light factions, set in the Blood on the Rails campaign. The Echo is a faction led by a secretive cabal of humans with psychic powers, and the Soldiers of Light are humans who believe the fall of mankind was brought about due to a dependence on technology.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-player competitive play or solitaire play, and each set can be played by itself standalone, or combined with other sets to form a larger narrative. Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six Factions.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play For What Remains: skirmishes and campaigns. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Campaigns are a series of skirmishes linked together to form a larger narrative. For What Remains is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually secondary. Players win skirmishes by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.&#10;&#10;The game board is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. The default game board is a destroyed urban setting. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement.&#10;&#10;Each character is represented by a counter and has a corresponding character card and tokens. During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite level. A chit pull system is used for unit activation, and a step-loss system is used for tracking injuries during skirmishes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Patton&rsquo;s Vanguard: The Battle of Arracourt, 1944, is a two-play area movement game that simulates the German counterattacks in the Lorraine region of France. As the summer of 1944 drew to a close and Combat Command A of the American 4th Armored Division passed through the French town of Arracourt the war seemed all but over. It seemed as if nothing could stop the Americans from forcing their way across the German border and reaching the Rhine River. The weather, however, was rapidly deteriorating and Allied air reconnaissance failed to detect a counteroffensive by the German 5th Panzer Army. The stage was set for the largest clash of armor on the western front until the Battle of the Bulge.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two quick-playing four turn scenarios depicting the German attempt to drive the Americans from the German border. The first scenario (September 19 - 22, 1944)  pits two inexperienced German panzer brigades against a confident and veteran Combat Command A. The German side has more armor, including the superior Panther tank, and the poor weather generally favors them, but the American side has more artillery as well as better tactics and leadership. The second scenario (September 25-28, 1944) pits the experienced German 11th Panzer Division against Combat Command A and the newly arrived Combat Command B, now hampered by restricted fuel supplies. In each scenario both players will be challenged to determine whether it is better to simply attack, or spend valuable time attempting to maneuver in continually changing weather conditions before attacking. Fast, furious, and chess-like, this is a game for players who love concentrated action!&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day &#10;Area: 1&quot; = .75 mile / 1.21 kilometers&#10;Units: Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;1 - 22 x 17&quot; full color map&#10;176 - full color 5/8&quot; die-cut counters&#10;16 Page Rule Booklet&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;Ziploc Bag&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3 hours&#10;&#10;",

She continues until either she sets aside all five dice or takes a fifth baby bug. (More on that below.) If the player has set aside all the dice and has completed one (or more) of the tasks on the card, she covers one task with a marker. If no tasks remain uncovered, she claims the task card, which is worth positive points, then the next player reveals the next task card and takes his turn.&#10;&#10;If at least one task remains uncovered, the player can either take another turn immediately or pass the dice to the next player. If the player has set aside all the dice without completing a task, she takes two baby bug tokens, and the next player takes a turn.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has five or more baby bugs, that player claims the top penalty card and all players return all baby bugs to the supply. The game ends as soon as the last task card or the last penalty card has been claimed. Players sum their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The land is corrupted. The silent Grayking, brooding upon his throne in the Tower of Ash, is a far-reaching shadow upon Lassadar. We feel his presence in each of our days. His servants grow bold, stealing into our cities, inhabiting the alleys and dark places of our streets. They jeer at us from our mirrors, shaming our reflections.&#10;&#10;The books of the Council of Wardens, handed down to us across the years, say that the era of broken barriers is upon us. Omens tell us, by winter, the Grayking will break through the few defenses we have remaining, cross to Lassadar, and our lands will fall to despair.&#10;&#10;We few who are left, who remember the Grayking&rsquo;s original imprisonment across the Barrier Planes, struggle to keep his power from growing further, but we have little time and far too few disciples. You are young but have proven to hold the strength of our teaching inside you. We have trained you in the arcane arts of ice, oak and flint magic and have taught you those powers are capricious and can damage your spirit if relied upon too much. We wish we had more time to train you further. We do not.&#10;&#10;Go now into the wider world, with our blessings, and seek a means to defeat the Grayking. Find the three Warding Keys stolen by his servants and re-lock the gates to force him back behind the Barrier Planes forever. Our agents, spread thinly across places still untouched in Lassadar, will aid you in your quest as best they can.&#10;&#10;Go now, and save us all&hellip;&hellip;&#10;&#10;Shadows Upon Lassadar is a solitaire fantasy quest game. You play a young magic adept who has been charged with finding three lost keys to lock the gates between the Barrier Plains and prevent the Grayking from reaching the world of Lassadar. You will journey to different cities using a deck of cards; other cards list spells you learn during the game. Magic in Lassadar is, however, a two edged sword and if you use powerful spells you may end up corrupting your own spirit in the process and lose the game. Three specific cards lead to expanded battle maps where you fight the Grayking&rsquo;s servants for possession of the keys. The game uses a variety of AI mechanics to simulate an enemy that learns and adapts as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;Needed to play:&#10;the 48 game cards + the 4 last battle cards&#10;9 six sided dice&#10;25 black eurocubes&#10;and 3 eurocubes: one each in red, blue and yellow.&#10;&#10;This Print and Play game can be assembled as a deck of cards or as cards and a series of mini game boards.&#10;&#10;There are several types of quests in the game that will need to be completed. These quests are encountered by turning over cards from the draw deck:&#10;&#10;City Quest cards showing the name of the city you&rsquo;ve journeyed to, win and loss table reference icons and event instructions for the battle in that city. As you win battles in these cities you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles.&#10;&#10;Council of Wardens Quest cards always have a white top. Their event instructions will help you gain spells and refresh your Mana and Spirit. These cards will always be placed on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game.&#10;&#10;Three Warding City Quest cards, each with a colored band and a numbered Warding Key icon across the bottom will signal when you use the Expanded Battle Maps (wargame hexmap style). On the Expanded Battle Maps you will encounter AI driven servants of the Grayking. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles. As you win the battles in these cities, and gain the Warding Keys, you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile, to be shuffled back into the game.&#10;&#10;Winning or losing the game:&#10;&#10;Draw cards one by one working your way through the quest. If you gain each of the 3 Warding keys you may cast the Oaken Spell: Barrier Lock and lock the gates of the Barrier Plains. The Grayking is instantly drawn back to the Tower of Ash and you have saved Lassadar and won the game.&#10;&#10;If at any time your Spirit falls below [1] on the Character Stats card, or if the Grayking reaches Lassadar on the Progress Track, you have lost the game.&#10;&#10;2nd place in the August 2011 Solitaire Print and Play contest &#10;and was also awarded Best Art, Best AI and Best Horror Game&#10;&#10;Tied for 1st place in The 2011 Print 'n Play Awards for Best Solitaire Game&#10;&#10;2012 Golden Geek Awards Nominee - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/864240/2012-golden-geek-awards-nominees-announced-vot&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nightshift is a thematic board game that immerses players into the role of a strip club Dancer. The Customer stories and gameplay are inspired by the creator&rsquo;s personal experience working as a stripper, providing an authentic and empowering take on this often misunderstood profession.&#10;&#10;Players must select from five different Dancers who each have a distinct approach to charming Customers. The goal is to earn the most money over the night. Be careful about interfering with another Dancer&rsquo;s Customer or your night may not run so smoothly...&#10;&#10;Players use Action Points to Navigate the club and discover new Customers. Each Customer is unique and has variable wealth and loyalty, as well as a diverse range of potential outcomes. Some of them will have a preference for one particular Dancer. Choose your Customers wisely! Engaging with a Customer involves rolling the dice, which combined with the Player's abilities, Power Cards, and potentially a few Drinks, will determine the outcome.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Successfully getting a Customer to the Private Room, or even better, the VIP Room, initiates a theme-based &ldquo;push-your-luck&rdquo; challenge. The aim is to maximise earnings from the Customer without breaking the illusion... This is achieved by performing a combination of dance moves (via card draws) in the Private Room, or deepening your connection (via dice rolls) in the VIP Room, with the ultimate goal of making the Customer fall in love.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase Drinks from the Bar. Champagne is a valuable tool for persuading Customers to extend their time with you in the Private Room or VIP Room, whilst Shots can help you get them in there.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Watch out for the Full Moon, this can trigger strange Events&hellip; Players must also keep track of when they are rostered on Stage, which provides benefits such as acquiring extra Tips and Power Cards. Don&rsquo;t miss your Stage or the club will fine you! These unique Power Cards add another layer of strategy and interaction - will you help out your fellow dancers, or will you play dirty?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Corunea is a Role Playing Card Game, it uses cards and dice to describe and simulate various adventures played by 2 to 4 players in the lands of Corunea.&#10;&#10;Corunea is meant to be played on a table, using its own cards, a few dice and not a single other element. No calculating system or tokens are required to play, nor are paper and pens necessary.&#10;&#10;Choosing the 50 cards of your deck is the equivalent of rolling a character in a classical Role Playing Game.&#10;&#10;Choosing the Adventure you are going to play is the same as choosing a storyline. It will set the length, places, events, encounters and goals of the game session.&#10;&#10;When played in short 1 versus 1 arena duels, Corunea feels a bit like a trading card game with dice, still providing a very different pace, actions panel, and tactical focus.&#10;&#10;When played in long 2 versus 2 adventures, Corunea feels more like a role playing game without a game master.&#10;&#10;Here again, the experience is quite different from a tabletop role playing game because of the competitive nature of the adventures.&#10;&#10;&#10;Being focused on your character, Corunea is intuitive and visual, as the actions you undertake are accurately simulated.&#10;&#10;You can nearly see your poisoned blade moving through the defense of your adversary, biting his armor and delivering his venom. You can nearly feel the faharn flowing through you as your call of fire is forming and see... your adversary plunging out of its flames... for this time.&#10;&#10;The arrows fly and you can almost hear their heads exploding on your target's shield, an axe follows, surprising the shield bearer and this time.cutting through his shoulder pad...&#10;&#10;After a Corunea fight, you could draw its story board very accurately, just by illustrating what happened.&#10;&#10;Playing Corunea you don't deal with abstract armies or summons, you are on the front line, your blade cutting through the foes, your mind bending the elements.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fortunes change at a stroke in this exciting game of betting and bluffing! Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &quot;false scent&quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.&#10;&#10;Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).&#10;&#10;For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.&#10;&#10;During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player &quot;loses his shirt&quot; i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.&#10;&#10;It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place &amp; Show and Undercover (a.k.a. Heimlich &amp; Co.).&#10;&#10;",

The map uses point to point movement on key areas of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;The battle begins with no troops around Gettysburg. Lee and Meade are not entirely sure about the arrival order of their troops; some may arrive a little early, while others may be significantly delayed.&#10;&#10;For the Confederates, victory will be achieved, depending on the current half-day, by occupying strategic points on the battlefield. However, the longer the battle lasts, the more challenging victory becomes. The Union must prevent the occupation of these points at all costs, but be cautious not to lead to the collapse of the Army of the Potomac by losing 3 Army Corps in this struggle.&#10;&#10;The outcome of this fratricidal war will largely depend on the fate of this battle...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The vampire is invisible, so there's no vampire pawn, but he IS somewhere on the map. The only clues are from radars. When a human uses a radar, the humans get to know how far the vampire is from the radar. With the clue from the radar and guessing his moves, humans shoot their guns blindly, trying to damage the vampire.&#10;&#10;Before all bullets are spent or all humans are killed, if the vampire's life is reduced to zero, the humans win. The vampire wins when he kills all the humans or when the humans are out of bullets.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Vampire Radar has nine 2x2 tiles instead of 36 1x1 tiles, making for faster set-up, and it includes variant rules for the human players. Instead of each human player taking two actions, then the vampire acting twice, each human player takes one action, then they pass the starting marker clockwise, then each human takes another action, then the vampire acts. This change rotates the turn order among the humans.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;8&#239;&#189;&#158;9&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#148;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#183;&#157;&#233;&#155;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#230;&#184;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#153;&#154;&#231;&#169;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#138;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#188;&#190;&#228;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#230;&#187;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;0&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;(This game was first published with an English title &quot;Vampire Rader&quot;.

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The set &quot;Showbizz&quot; contains historical events which are related to show business. This relationship is not necessary obvious. Like all Anno Domini the Shwobizz edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

The numbers next to the locations on the Ship are multipliers that indicate how many times you may perform the action. Tools correspond to certain parts of the island: beach, jungle or volcano.&#10;&#10;Next, flip an accessible Treasure token of your choice face up.&#10;You&rsquo;re allowed to keep searching in the hole you started at, or to choose a different space.&#10;After you&rsquo;ve flipped 1, 2 or 3 Treasure tokens face up, flip any tokens that weren&rsquo;t collected face down again on their respective spaces. The Tool is discarded. Now, the player to your left takes their turn.&#10;&#10;If you flip a Treasure token that corresponds to the Treasure card, you collect it! Well done!

To do so, players will attempt to play as many travel cards of the same type as they can. The more cards they play, the better are the chances they will find the Tzerzurians. On their journey they might find other beings they aren't looking for but who, by chance, were entrapped in the middle of that mystical mess!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Game marker placement is shown on the game board. Command orders and cards are used to shorten the rules. Developed for solitaire play, this game requires you to make great decisions based on good strategy, keeping your wits about you when orders do not turn out well, and pressing on to victory.&#10;&#10;Game play is centered around using Field Commands to issue orders by the Athenian and Syracusan commanders to defeat each other. Either side can be defeated by their morale falling too low. The game allows you to play either side against a solitaire opponent that has 3 levels of difficulty.&#10;&#10;Pick the side you want to be, Athenian or Syracusan, and then shuffle the solitaire card deck for your opponent. The card mix used by the solitaire opponent differs from game to game so no two games play alike.&#10;&#10;Each commander (solitaire or player) can issue one order per game turn from their Commands available.  Your order is carried out based on your strategy and current situation faced.  Your choice can cause multiple actions and reactions with results that cause troop eliminations, morale reductions, and events to occur.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN THE GAME&#10;&#10;Any time one side's morale reaches zero during a turn, the other side wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each game includes:&#10;    Box&#10;    Hard Mounted Game Board&#10;    2 sets of troop markers (one set per army)&#10;    2 sets of solitaire cards (one set per army)*Only 1 set of solitaire cards in 414BC Syracuse&#10;    Command Decision Cards&#10;    2 Field Order Books (one per army)&#10;    Rule Book&#10;    Custom plastic storage tray&#10;    Dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: 3 of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 10 of 10&#10;Playing Time: 30 to 60 minutes&#10;Players: 1-2&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

In this fast-playing card game, you've got one year to help build the most famous town in all the West! Each season, the train brings in city slickers and kinfolk from the east to help you run your new businesses on Main Street. Hire your workers carefully, keeping in mind that members of the same family help each other reach success faster!  Dollars are useful, but victory points (VPs) are like pure gold! At the end of the year, the player with the most VPs wins the game and becomes the new Mayor of Capital City! Bring home a little piece of the wild west today!&#10;&#10;In more detail, players have four rounds represented by the seasons of the year to expand their Wild West town! First, they bid for player priority order for the current season. Next, they choose character cards from the train to put to work, then purchase building cards to form Main Street. Then, players attach character cards to the building cards to earn dollars or VPs!  Attached characters are workers that provide bonuses to the current player and other players with characters from the same family! At the end of four seasons, the player with the most VPs wins! Yee-haw!&#10;&#10;",

Additionally, will filling an empty area, colors must match adjacent colors.&#10;Next, each square that is overlapped has a token placed on it.  These represent points, but they don't belong to anyone yet.&#10;After tokens have been placed, players jump tokens to capture them for themself. Jumps can be in any direction, including diagonals.&#10;Finally, a player ends their turn by drawing a card.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when a predetermined score has been reached, or the draw pile is empty.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dig Down Dwarf is a fast-paced press-your-luck dice game that was the winner of the Micro Game Challenge! 128 designs were entered into the contest and Dig Down Dwarf was unanimously picked #1 overall by the judges! The Micro Game Challenge was judged by board game critic Cyrus Kirby, who is better known as Father Geek, and by the podcast team at All Us Geeks.&#10;&#10;Dig Down Dwarf is a fast and casual game that is fun for all ages and all skill levels. Newcomers will be attracted to the easy-to-learn rules and press-your-luck mechanics, while skilled gamers will love the ability to alter dice rolls by spending gems and to activate special dwarven powers. There is a bit of something for everyone, and the quick playtime and portability make it a great travel game and an outstanding filler game as well.&#10;&#10;What is New in the Second Edition&#10;&#10;Objective Cards - This new edition will come with 18 Objective Cards. Players will randomly draw 3 at the beginning of the game and these will become a way to score bonus points at the games end. Players decide, as a group, if the objectives are be kept secret or placed up for all to see.&#10;&#10;New Artwork - Second Edition comes with clean new graphic design work and artwork throughout. You will still recognize some of the icons and fonts, but the new design is meant to convey a sense of nostalgia.&#10;&#10;More Gems - Second Edition comes with 20% more of the shiny gems that made the First Edition such a smash hit!&#10;&#10;Six Player Support - With the addition of extra gems and other components, Dig Down Dwarf Second Edition can host up to six players.&#10;&#10;New Dwarf Power Cards - These new cards utilize acrylic cubes to track the dwarven skills you have unlocked during the course of the game, instead of rotating the card like you had to do in the older version.&#10;&#10;New Dice Colors - Like the new Dwarf Power Cards, we have listened to the feedback over the course of hundreds of plays since the first Kickstarter over two years ago. One thing I noticed was players not noticing that they triggered a dwarf power, because each dice was a different color and it was too much to keep track of for many. A very simple solution has been implemented. You now roll three black dice and one red die on your turn. The red die activates everyone's dwarven powers.&#10;&#10;New Gem Colors - Another complaint we got was that some of the gems looked alike in color. We made sure to make that a non-issue this time around. Star gems are now really yellow and we are now able to manufacture the gems in black for the cursite (fossilized dragon dung) which further helps distinguish each gem type.&#10;&#10;",

Players will start many scenarios without units and just a handful of money.  By building units and capturing cites, players can raise new capital in order to build bigger armies.&#10;&#10;If the design is successful, the possibility of incorporating armies from newer Advance Wars games will be considered.

    "Description": "Twilight City offers an immersive experience for expert players. As a group of partisans, you share the common goal of undermining the dictatorial regime of the Governor in the smog-ridden metropolis, but you also compete with each other for prestige points.&#10;&#10;Twilight City is a complex game with a rich variety of mechanics, including tableau building and resource management. It also provides a solo mode, which introduces unique and challenging solutions to the base rules. The game lasts for an unspecified number of rounds. You have 12 movement points available before your in-game day ends. However, closing the day is not synchronous between players. If you fail to finish your activities in time or have not saved enough money for your expenses (e.g., the daily mandatory oxygen intake), you will have less time available the next day.&#10; Everything starts with a single Main Action, which is either playing a card or selecting a card from the display &ndash; and there are multiple ways to do these.  Playing a single card comes with a multitude of consequences and further options, including movement in the city and a variety of actions accessible through clever selection mechanisms. Each player builds a row of cards in front of them. When certain visual elements of two adjacent cards connect, you collect resources accordingly, and your income also derives from the card row.  Resources are used to craft the items needed for various sabotage actions, and you also have several options to spend your money, including infiltrating the corrupt government apparatus.&#10;&#10;Moving in the city is tricky because you must avoid the formidable Police Airship that hovers above the streets, constantly changing its position. This is crucial because every time someone is spotted by the Airship, things become harder for all players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Season 2 box will include all of the new stuff from Gamefound campaign: Private Eye Case, Divorce Case, Casino Heist, and Solo Mode as they will not be printed separately like the expansions were for Season 1.&#10;&#10;It will also include extra prosecution/defense decks along with additional tokens to make this version standalone/playable without the Season 1 box. If you own both boxes, you will also have enough base decks to play the 2v2 variant as well.&#10;&#10;Casino Heist:&#10;A team of thieves and swindlers have taken the Majestic Casino for all its worth. The suspects were rounded up easy enough, but proving their guilt conclusively will be difficult. The defendants seem overly confident within the court room. Is it just a fa&ccedil;ade as their scheme crumbles down around them? Or do they have one last trick up their sleeves?&#10;&#10;In the Heist case, the prosecution is attempting to convict a majority of the gang responsible for the heist while the defense is doing their best to get as many swindlers exonerated as possible. These defendants are running the long con! Throughout the case they will be dealt double-sided Con cards. Players will be competing to assign these Cons to defendants and flip them to the side that benefits them the most. A defendant's trial is resolved and scored when they complete their long con and are dealt 3 Con cards. It is essential to deal the final Con to the defendant's you're winning to score them. The player who convicts or exonerates the most defendants wins.&#10;&#10;The Divorce:&#10;The Divorce case expansion focuses on a high profile celebrity divorce case between a billionaire tech CEO and 90s Television Star. This is a more symmetrical case with each player taking on the role of one of the celebrities of the marriage. You can play as a Sam, the super rich tech CEO or as Adrian, the TV celebrity. Both Sam and Adrian's cards are dual-sided male/female so you can create any kind of marriage/relationship that you prefer.&#10;&#10;One of the new mechanics in this case are secret Attitude cards. Each of these cards represents the emotional state of each partner and matches one of the bias symbols in the game. It's possible for your attitude to change throughout the course of the divorce proceedings but each one gives you extra victory points for marital assets with the matching bias symbol on them.&#10;&#10;The other big change for the Divorce case is that you'll be fighting over (and swaying) marital asset cards rather than the jury. Each Asset card is double-sided and has an asymmetrical track where you can spend influence to sway bias. The victory point values on each asset are scored by the player who wins the asset (if in their color) but assets can also be shared between players. This allows the Divorce case to be played competitively or cooperatively based on the strategies chosen by each side leading to amicable splits, financial victories, or spiteful losses. Will you compromise for the sake of the children or drag each other through the mud to get the most assets?&#10;&#10;The Private Eye:&#10;The Private Eye Case expansion sees the defense take on the role of private investigator in a 1950s Hollywood noir setting where they have been framed for the murder of a popular film star. The private eye will need to divide their time between investigating clues to solve the real murder and defending themselves in court. The prosecution works with conspirators and ring leaders to gain red herrings to hinder this investigation.&#10;&#10;This case features a lot of new mechanics that shake up the core game. As the defense, you will be working to reveal cards from clue decks to discover WHO murdered the starlet with WHAT weapon WHERE in the city. Like the game Clue, each clue card eliminates one of the possibilities. The dilemma is that in order to investigate and reveal clues, you will need to play evidence cards for their Investigation effect instead of using them in the courtroom to influence the jury. If the Private Eye is able to correctly guess the murderer, weapon and crime scene they will win the game, but they need to make sure that they don't ignore the trial where the chips are stacked against them.&#10;&#10;The prosecution represents a vast conspiracy of witnesses trying to frame the private investigator. Their goal is clearly focused on winning the trial and they will do their best to draft and utilize planted evidence in the courtroom. The prosecution will earn Red Herring tokens as they sway and manipulate the jury which they can place on the clue decks to hinder the PI's investigation.&#10;&#10;Solo Expansion:&#10;The Solo Expansion expands on the solo mode in the base game by adding a new solo base deck, a bias die, Automa personality cards, and case-specific card effects that work with every case released thus far. If you're a player looking to get into the nitty gritty of the rules, read on!&#10;&#10;The new Solo Base Deck is shuffled together with the drafted case cards for the Automa. All the effects on these cards have been written with solo play in mind. The Automa's procedures act like traps that players will have to work around.&#10;&#10;The Automa is further expanded with additional cards that let players build an Automa player. By selecting a Personality card, a Discovery card, and the Questioning card corresponding to the Automa&rsquo;s role in the selected case, there are tons of unique Automa effects and combinations to explore.&#10;&#10;The new Automa rules reduce die rolling and create unique puzzles to work around each witness as players will want to avoid triggering procedures and sidebar abilities that can set them back.&#10;&#10;",

Then, each player rolls the dice one more time and places their blue and yellow dice on their player sheet on the appropriate numbers.&#10;&#10;Then, the start player rolls another set of dice. They may either choose one building which has not been built already and cross it out (and indicate it on the scoring sheet), or they may take one coin for each intersection which has already been crossed out (up to four coins).&#10;&#10;The two dice that are not used are passed to the next player (the numbers are kept the same), and the two used dice are re-rolled and put back on the player sheet with the new numbers.&#10;&#10;Coins can be used to re-roll dice (1 coin) or to mark out both buildings (3 coins). At the end of the game, 1st through 3rd place for each building type is awarded points, as well as bonus points for completed rows and columns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Whenever the great clock in the city hall marks the passing of another hour, a picture shows up in one of the viewing windows. Whatever is shown on the picture is what the children must now find behind the closed doors of the castle. They accomplish this with the help of a mysterious magnetic set of keys that, as if through the hand of a ghost, opens the doors of the old castle. For each correctly-opened door one receives a gleaming cannonball. How many of these balls will be required for victory is decided only by the final dexterity game in the knight's hall.&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "AS FOOD TRUCK TITANS&hellip;&#10;Send your food truck team to score sales at various venues throughout town.  You can only visit each venue once and will need to carefully plan your route and take sales opportunities when they are arise.  Drive efficiently and score bonuses, or race to the finish and hit the big-time payouts on the way.  Plan your route but expect the unexpected in your path to food truck infamy!&#10;&#10;Truck Off: The Food Truck Frenzy Roll and Write is a stand alone game and follow-up to the original Truck Off: The Food Truck Frenzy.  It throws navigation, risk mitigation, and press your luck into the same meal pack for you to digest.&#10;&#10;In Truck Off Roll and Write, all players are driving their food trucks around a grid system town map, and marking off venue locations in a secondary location called a route tracker for each venue they visit.  All players will visit a new venue each turn and then mark the value of their corresponding venue dice directly scoring them points.  If you mark three venues in one row or one column of the route tracker, you gain a bonus.  Bonuses help you navigate around town, allow you to reroll your dice more, drive farther, drive faster, and promote venues to make them more valuable.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the active player rolls the set of polyhedral dice.  The active player may reroll up to one die to help the sales on their route or hurt the sales on their opponents route.  Then all players select one open venue to drive to if possible up to 4 spaces away following a grid movement system. Each player then marks the value of the die on the corresponding location of their route tracker always progressing their route tracker.&#10;&#10;Route Tracker:  The route tracker is made up of six columns, one for each of D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20 venues.  However, the route must always progress forward from D4 to D20 and snake back to D4.  If you skip a venue in your route, then you may not return to that venue on the route tracker.  The route tracker will play a big role in your pathing around the town and also allows you push the game toward end quicker than your opponents expect.&#10;&#10;To win the game and score the most sales, you'll need to plan your efficient route, take high sales opportunities when they present themselves, and figure out how to reroute your food truck if you deviate from your plan.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Two cosmic adventurers are in a tricky scenario and must work together. By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.&#10;&#10;The Twin Stars solo system was created by Jason Tagmire and Mike Mullins. A single session uses just 3 cards and players provide their own dice and coins/tokens. Scenarios and characters can be interchanged with others for a very different gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Twin Stars: Adventure Series I, released in 2017, was a collection of previously-released scenarios. Twin Stars: Adventure Series II contains completely new and original material, but once again consists of 6 Twin Stars scenarios and 12 characters. While by itself, this would make for 396 unique combinations, the game integrates seamlessly with the characters and scenarios from the first collection, yielding a total of 3,312 unique games -- or to put it another way, tremendous solo replayability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     07: Master the Trials&#10;     08: Beat the Odds&#10;     09: Control the Skies&#10;     10: Sell the Junk&#10;     11: Destroy the Order&#10;     12: Serve the Rabble&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dungeon Brawler takes the dungeon crawl game genre and mashes it with side-scrolling beat 'em up brawler arcade games from the 80's and 90's.  Players each control a hero, arrange them in a formation, and prepare for the oncoming waves of monsters, traps, treasure, etc.  If they can survive this automatically-advancing onslaught, then they win as a team.  This is not your father's &quot;move-and-attack&quot; dungeon crawler: by combining deck-building elements with a blazingly fast &quot;conveyor belt&quot; mechanic, this game has deep tactics, but plays incredibly quickly.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one hero.  Each hero represents a different theme: chaos, order, harmony, or discipline.  Their hero choice decides their starting deck of cards.  Each different theme has a different playstyle, but also informs what future cards they can add to their deck.  But, the players are not locked into these themes - they can combine others into their decks to create new twists and combinations on classic fantasy characters.  These heroes line up in a row, with the &ldquo;marching order&rdquo; formation extremely tactically important.  Don&rsquo;t worry, they can (and will) rearrange throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Across from the party line-up is the deadly dungeon itself.  Whenever a card is removed from the dungeon, be it by killing a monster, overcoming a challenge, or taking some treasure, the dungeon automatically shifts towards the players and refills the missing card.  This way, the game is incredibly fast-paced: no moving, exploring, or down-time.  This dungeon is coming at you full-speed!&#10;&#10;Fighting is resolved by playing unique combinations of cards, but be careful!  Your hand of cards is also your lifebar!  Overextend and you&rsquo;ll leave yourself vulnerable.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These points will be achieved mainly by closing dimensions, but also the characters and objects that we find in our interdimensional travel will give us points of victory.&#10;&#10;On each turn, one dimension will be the active dimension, which will indicate the turn order. Players will place their characters in the dimensions in a hidden way. Then, the figures are placed on the board, and the first player will begin to perform his actions, one per turn. When all the players pass, the adventure phase ends and the harvesting phase begins, with players obtaining the resources of the dimensions in which their characters are located. But beware, the rival characters made this task difficult. Finally the discard phase, you can have a maximum of seven cards in the hand.&#10;&#10;There are cards of various types: Character cards, which can have a continuous effect or come into play; objects, which we can use whenever we want; actions and places, some very potent that are discarded once used; and reactions, to nullify the actions of other players or just annoy them.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player after closing a dimension cannot place a new dimension tile. The round ends and the points are counted, the one with the most points between dimensions, objects and characters wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Secret bars all over town are making back-alley deals with Capone&rsquo;s thugs to get the booze they need to satisfy their thirsty patrons and keep themselves in business.&#10;&#10;Capone combines card drafting, auctions, anything-goes trading, and set collection. Each player is the proprietor of an underground speakeasy. Players bid on trucks of booze coming in over the course of the evening to get the hooch they need to satisfy their eager patrons. There are no turns and play is centered around anything-goes negotiation. Does someone have a bottle you need? Make them an offer. Can&rsquo;t fill the order of one of your patrons? Maybe another bar can; work a deal with that bar owner that&rsquo;s beneficial to both of you. Capone will be keeping tabs on the operation too, so make sure to keep him happy. The bar that has the most money at the end of the night wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
