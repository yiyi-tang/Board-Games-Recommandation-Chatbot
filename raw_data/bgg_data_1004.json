    "Description": "Swingbridge is a card game for three players, based on Contract Bridge.&#10;&#10;It is a standard deck, trick taking game, with variable partnerships. An auction phase is followed by card playing. Four hands are dealt: one per player plus an additional one which is placed face-up on the table (the &quot;dummy&quot;); initially, one player is allowed to exchange his hand with the dummy. During the auction phase the players attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding; like in Bridge, bids specify how many tricks must be taken and what is the preferred trump suit (or lack thereof); in addition, bids also have a &quot;color&quot; that indicates what is the preferred partnership for that deal. After the auction, the team that has won the bid (the &quot;declarers&quot;) tries to win as many tricks as possible; the other player (the &quot;defender&quot;) plays both his own hand and the dummy's, and tries to take enough tricks to have the declarers fail their contract. The scoring system is almost identical to Bridge, but players have individual scores.&#10;&#10;Swingbridge is presented as a book, written for an audience of Bridge players, which contains the basic rules of the game, some optional variants, and an in-depth analysis of the mechanics and peculiarities of the game.&#10;&#10;",

A third firm, Skoda, was not invited to participate but submitted a design anyway.&#10;&#10;After initially selecting the Daimler-Benz tank and bestowing the name &ldquo;Panther&rdquo; on it, German leader Adolf Hitler later backtracked and ordered the MAN tank into production instead. The Daimler-Benz prototype, known as the VK3002, was shunted aside as was Skoda&rsquo;s T25. The MAN Panther eventually became a formidable weapon, but initial production models suffered mechanical problems thanks to its rushed development. Either of the other two tanks would likely have been available sooner.&#10;&#10;Variant Panthers lets you try out these rejected tanks on the battlefields of Kursk, in South Flank and Burning Tigers. The Groundhog Day 2016 Golden Journal includes 24 new laser-cut, mounted pieces depicting these two tanks in both German Army and Waffen SS livery. It&rsquo;s a good-looking set. Plus you get scenarios for their use.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to their public Role card, each player is given a secret Identity card: Sane or Cannibal. If you&rsquo;re Sane, it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out who the Cannibals are so you can force them to walk the plank. And if you&rsquo;re a Cannibal? Convince the Sane that you&rsquo;re one of them so you can turn them into your next dinner&hellip;&#10;&#10;Osprey Adrift's gameplay centers around a dual pronged flow of eliminations: The Cannibals eliminate one of the Sane each round, and the entire crew votes to eliminate one more player each round (with the Sane hoping they're getting rid of a Cannibal).&#10;&#10;Players draw cards off the Scavenge deck to stock their hands with Food (needed to stay in the game), Coins (used to bid on the right to be Captain each round, and as victory points should the player survive to the end of the game), Actions (used to perform special feats to help or hinder players), and Resources (needed to power many of the Actions). Or, if a player knows they need specific cards, they can dare to ask their fellow crewmates if they'd like to make a trade - in a separate room from the rest of the players, where a pirate's parley can be formed.&#10;&#10;",

Philip V of Macedon built a fleet of 200 lemboi ships, and was ready to sail to Italy, following in the footsteps of Pyrrhus. This didn&rsquo;t happen, as Rome reacted quickly with a sea blockade and inciting war in Greece, binding Philip&rsquo;s hands. But this provided an opportunity for serious reinforcements for Hannibal in Italy. We had to have this as a variant! Sun of Macedon brings you a new general for the Carthaginian player and two new strategy cards, which focus on stealth movement.&#10;&#10;Desert March: Move an army of up to 5CU between Zuccabar or Icosium and Gades. Roll for Attrition prior to arrival. Hannibal&rsquo;s father Hamilcar has reached Gades overland from Carthage. Such a successful journey across hostile territory might have actually been an inspiration for Hannibal for his march over the Alps. The card allows a small army to follow Hamilcar&rsquo;s footsteps.&#10;&#10;Hidden Cove: Move an army of up to 5CU to or from Genua as if it was a port. This move is successful unless countered by a card. As we know, not every existing harbour is shown as a port in the game. And there is a good reason for that: some of them were not capable of receiving large armies. Some of them were not shown as a game design decision. Genua, however, was used twice in very specific circumstances. Mago arrived there with reinforcements and then, after few years of fighting, most probably evacuated through the same port when things become too hot to handle.&#10;&#10;",

When the sacred chickens refused to eat, Claudius threw them into the sea, saying &quot;Since they do not wish to eat, let them drink!&quot; He didn&rsquo;t listen to the Gods, and was punished by them seriously. Yes, in ancient times, war was a religious act - one of the most important events in a man&rsquo;s life. The religious ceremonials were bloody and drastic. That is why we wanted to have a variant showing the importance of these sacred rituals. So, we have added to the HAMILCAR game a new Roman leader and two new strategy cards based on Pulcher's disaster.&#10;&#10;Bad Omen: Play prior to Battle. Rome&rsquo;s General Battle Rating is decreased by 1. This can be cancelled by an immediate Attrition Roll. This event has been inspired by two similar events. Caius Flaminius did not properly carry out the rituals after becoming a Consul and pressed for a battle, known later as Battle of Trasimene Lake. Claudius Pulcher had disregarded a bad omen prior to the battle and lost at Drepana.&#10;&#10;Price of Failure: Play after a victorious Battle. The opposing player must either immediately remove his commanding General from the map or a number of PCs equal to his Battle Rating. Carthaginian leaders Hannibal Gisgo and Hamilcar (the other Hamilcar, not Hamilcar Barca) were removed from command after losing engagements. Well, not only removed from command but also crucified. Carthage didn&rsquo;t have much sympathy for losers. Also Pulcher faced charges and was never again offered an office.&#10;&#10;",

Players initially receive a random pack of cards that contains a character card and a set of four specific cards. One of them will be the Detective (saboteur) and the others will be Smugglers. In at most 6 rounds, players must then exchange their cards, in order to complete a set of five cards their character needs. They also can buy new ones from the central pile. The goal of the Smugglers is that some of them collects their 5 needed cards. The number of players that need to reach this goal varies by the number of participants. The objective of the Detective is to prevent this number of opponents from fulfilling their goals, for example by holding cards they need or by pushing foward unnecessary cards. In addition, the Detective may terminate the game earlier by stopping the match at any time when calling out and arresting  the player he believes to be the character Al Kane.&#10;&#10;",

The respite could soon be over, though, as some rats got infected and turned into giant monstrosities.&#10;&#10;The Abomniarats lurk around tunnels, floors and ceiling, laying ambushes to catch the unwary off-guard.

An expert on every form of infectious disease existant, the sheer virulence of the zombie plague staggers him with its sordid beauty. he's convinced that while magic is at the core of the initial outbreak, the subsequent spreading infection has wholly natural elements. He cites the Creeping Death and the Bloody Flux as his sources (which have slain untold hundreds of thousands when left unchecked), in addition to the complete lack of magical emanations seen in most mobile zombies. If he can prove his theorems (and develop a cure), perhaps the necromancers can be deprived of their seemingly limitless hordes.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Your students will have a blast learning about New Zealand bird life through addictive gameplay and trading. This game is designed to be fun and engaging while teaching students about our many manu (birds) and how to identify them.&#10;&#10;Each bird's card has three ability ratings that range from 0 to 9, 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest. The uppermost ability rating is flight (F) followed by camouflage (C) and special (S). The numbers reflect the bird&rsquo;s abilities for each category. &lsquo;Special&rsquo; indicates how unique or special that bird is to New Zealand.&#10;&#10;1. Each player starts with an odd number of cards in their hand.&#10;2. Before the game starts each player may place down one environment card.&#10;3. The youngest player starts by calling flight (F) camouflage (C) special (S) or night time (which is all three numbers added together.)&#10;4. Each player places a card face down on the table.&#10;5. Name your card and flip it face up.&#10;6. The player with the highest rating for that ability wins and leaves their card face up on the table and the loser places theirs face down. If the rating is even, then the player who didn&rsquo;t call the round wins.&#10;7. It is now the other player&rsquo;s turn to call and start a new round.&#10;8. Once there are no more cards left, count the number of win cards you have in your pile.&#10;&#10;If you want to play the advanced version, read the abilities on the cards and use them when you turn your card face up. If a card talks about the pile, these are the cards you have down on the table.&#10;&#10;",

Each General, whether human, humanoid, or some sort of deadly creature, has its own unique play-style.&#10;&#10;Once you choose your faction and character, you take turns attacking each other's cities until you have achieved enough glory points to win. Attacks are carried out by moving up to 5 of your 20 troops from your cities into your combat zone on the battleground, placing the enemy's city board, with its defending troops, into a combat zone in the middle of the board, and then both the Attacker and the Defender playing face-down combat cards. &#10;The side with the highest total of troops plus additional points from monsters, artifacts and character powers, wins the battle and the enemy's city is conquered. &#10;Allies may add their troops, monsters, and artifacts into combat zones on the battlefield as well, to help influence the outcome and share in glory or defeat.&#10;In games with an odd number of players, powerful vassal cards come into play at different times to help balance the combat.&#10;&#10;There are a variety of action cards that people may play during different phases that affect allying, troop count, let you look at opponent's cards, cast miscellaneous spells, etc.&#10;The cards come from Battle, Diplomacy, Espionage, Recruiting, Tactics, Scroll and Sorcery decks.&#10;&#10;With 24 characters, 96 action cards (in 6 differently themed decks), 13 Monsters, 13 Artifacts, 12 Vassals included in the base game, replayability is high.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter exclusive Deluxe Edition of this game comes with plastic miniatures for the Monsters, Artifacts and Strongholds.&#10;&#10;The Retail edition of this game comes with cardboard standees of the Monsters, Artifacts and Strongholds.&#10;&#10;",

And, unlike any other game in the series, this came in two editions that are distinctly different - a World Wildlife Fund promotional edition, and an edition celebrating Finland's 75th anniversary of independence in 1992. The box front of the latter is in portrait orientation, which is also unique in the series.&#10;&#10;Kaupunkipelit is a series of games, each of which is basically a light version of Monopoly localized to a city/region of Finland. The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.&#10;&#10;The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:&#10;&#10;-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.&#10;-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.&#10;-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.&#10;-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.&#10;&#10;",

The players draw cards from a common deck. The cards can help or hurt both teams depending on the correct timing of the actions. Revealing and executing the actions alternately comes next. Good planning, clever use of both the actions and the Heroes&rsquo; abilities will determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Suspense is the main feeling of the game since every step towards victory depends on the players abilities to plan, predict and deceit.&#10;&#10;",

To navigate through the Death Path, Subjects will reveal cards at the same time. Much of the Death Path are clear paths but occasionally you will run into a choice with multiple options. This will cause your deck to split in hopes of finding a quicker path to the end. You may also encounter Pathfinders, crude government-control cyber-dudes trying to slow your progress.

D8's for one-handed weapons and D12's for two-handed weapons. They are custom and not numbered traditionally. The number on each side indicates the damage inflicted if you hit. Some weapons, like the volatile Fusion Staff, have low and high damage results representing more risk/reward while others like the trusty Power Nux are more consistent with the damage they inflict.&#10;&#10;The first Subject to finish revealing all the cards in their Maze Deck is the winner. If any Subject loses all their Health tokens, they are dead and out of the game. In a two player game, this means their opponent wins. In multi-player, the others keep navigating through the Death Path until there is a winner!&#10;&#10;A 2 player game takes approximately 20min to play, while adding additional players can increase that to 30-40min.&#10;&#10;",

The game features assymetric goals and reinforcement rules which create different playstyles for the Russian and the Swedish-Finnish armies: whereas the Russian player needs to advance carefully but with a determined pace, the Swedish player needs to wait for the perfect moment to pounce with maximum strength to claim victory.&#10;&#10;The game is offered as a print-and-play of only two pages: one page for the rules, and one page to mount on cardboard and cut out.

Cover the invisible man with these sections.&#10;&#10;Players start on the inner track from the letter 'A' corresponding to the colour of their counter.&#10;After spinning, each player in turn either moves his counter round the board the number of spaces indicated by the arrow when it stops or he takes a card, he cannot do both.&#10;On whatever letter a move ends, the player removes the section bearing that letter from his invisible man.&#10;Should the move end on 'risk' the player must take a card and follow the instructions on it. In either case this ends his turn  which passes to the player on his left. Should a move end on a letter from which the section has already been removed this also ends his turn.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the first player who manages to remove all sections from his invisible man.&#10;&#10;",

Use voting chips and cobbling chips to earn extra points to help you around the board and be the first to reach The famous Rovers Return.&#10;&#10;Start the game by deciding if you will play as individuals or in teams and then choose a character mover and place them on the Start space. Each player or team is then given a True or False voting chip and three cobble chips.&#10;Taking it in turn to be the Question Reader, they must pick up a card from the deck in the centre of the board and read out the question. Opponents then need to decide whether the trivia question is true or false and lay their voting chip up the correct way to answer the question. Once all voting chips have been paid down, cobbling can begin.&#10;Cobbling gives players the chance to pick up bonus points to help them move further around the board based on an opponent's true or false answer to the question. If the opponent's answer that you 'bet' your cobble chip on is correct then you get to keep your cobble chip and gain an extra point. But if their answer to the question was wrong and you chose to cobble, then you lose that chip.&#10;Once players complete a full lap of the board and move past the Start space on the board, they can collect a 30 points token. If you pass Start twice, then flip the token over to reveal 60 points.&#10;After the last True or False card is played and all players have moved their character mover the amount of spaces they've earned, the player with the highest score (most 30/60 token points plus the score on the board) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A 2-player tactical skirmish game with a Nightbreed Theme.  Humans (Naturals) are attacking Midian (a Necropolis, the home of the Nightbreed) in force.  One player is the Nightbreed.  The other player is the Humans (Naturals).&#10;&#10;An 8 x 8 grid is used to depict the surface and upper layers of Midian.  Underground is a series of tunnels, chambers, and caverns.  The surface resembles a graveyard but with additional statues, fountains, walls, and tomb like structures that are actually dwellings and gates to the subterranean areas.&#10;&#10;Terrain types are marked on the map according to players&rsquo; preference. Some terrain types will be referenced by cards but terrain types comprise:  Clear (Paths, Roads), Graves, Fountain, Wall (and Gates), Trees, Tomb and Statue.&#10;&#10;Each player has a unique &ldquo;army&rdquo; list comprising 16 units of differing strengths (hit points), with differing characteristics.&#10;Each player has a unique deck of cards of four different types (Attack, Defence, Move, Special)&#10;&#10;To set up the decks are shuffled separately and units are placed in the back three rows of the player&rsquo;s side of the board.&#10;&#10;Naturals go first with players taking turns.  Each turn has 3 Phases: &#10;1. Draw Phase&#10;-  Draw 3 cards and place them in your hand. &#10;2. Action Phase&#10;-  Play cards (no limit). &#10;-  Play a Move card to move a unit the indicated (range) number of spaces. &#10;-  Use an Attack card to attack a unit at the indicated distance (range) from the attacking unit. &#10;-  Your opponent may use a Defence card to negate an Attack card.  &#10;-  An attack card that is not negated causes the target to lose 1 Hit. Use tokens to keep track of Damage (lost hits) sustained by units.  Any Unit reduced to zero Hits is killed. &#10;3. End Phase&#10;Max hand size is 7 cards.  Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The first side to lose 10 or more units will break and flee.&#10;&#10;",

The &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; is the living room floor at Christmas time.  There are two terrain types &ndash; clear or obstacles (boxes, christmas tree, furniture).  Obstacles block all movement and attacks.  Terrain is laid down at the players&rsquo; discretion.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck of cards.  Card are of four types: Attack (A), Defence (D), Movement (M), Special (S)&#10;&#10;Each side gets a unique set of 16 units that can be moved around on the board. Units have different movement allowances and strengths (hit points).  One unit on each side is designated the Leader.  Units cannot stack but friendly units may move through each other.&#10;&#10;To set up each player places his units in any of his 3 last rows.&#10;&#10;Players take turns. &#10;Each turn has 3 Phases. &#10;1.

    "Description": "Players are students (Junior Members) of Aristotle&rsquo;s school in Athens Circa 334 - 322 BC.  Players move about the Lyceum (Gymnasium and surrounding grounds) to acquire knowledge in a variety of categories and subjects.&#10;&#10;The board is composed of 27 tiles, called Lyceum Tiles.  The tiles are organised into a circular track in a random order.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck. When a card is played, immediately gain its reward and then discard the card.  When the deck runs out the first time shuffle the discard and draw from it.&#10;&#10;Players share a set of action tokens.  There are 7 types of tokens: Material Cause, Efficient Cause, Formal Cause, Final Cause, Potentiality, Actuality and Aristotle.  Actions tokens are used during the game for additional movement, gaining points in various categories, affecting die rolls etc.&#10;&#10;There are 6 Categories: Philosophy, Logic, Life Science, Physical Science, Humanities and Arts.  Each Category is further divided into 6 Subjects.  During play points are earned in individual subjects, however for final end of game scoring, it is the total points earned by subjects within a category that count. Every time you gain a point in a Subject, you also get a corresponding Action Token according to the subjects tables.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn consisting of 3 phases:&#10;&#10;1.  Aristotle Phase&#10;&#10;     Aristotle starts the Game in Aristotle&rsquo;s Library and moves in a clockwise direction 2D6 spaces. &#10;     Whenever he lands on a space containing one or more students, they each get 1 point in one random subject (first roll a random category, then a random subject) &#10;     If he lands in a space containing no students, the top card of the deck is placed onto that tile.  The first student to land there gets that card, as well as the tile&rsquo;s regular offering. &#10;     If you land on Aristotle, you gain 1 Cause Token of any type.  &#10;     If on your move you pass over Aristotle you gain 1 Aristotle Token. &#10;&#10;&#10;2.  Move Phase&#10;&#10;     Move your Pawn forward (clockwise around the track) one or two spaces OR you may move forward 1D10 spaces. &#10;     You may spend an Action Token to alter your movement. &#10;     When you land on 1 or more opponents pawns, you may steal 1 Token from any one of them. &#10;&#10;&#10;3.  Learning &#10;&#10;     Follow the instructions on the tile you have just moved to.  This will usually earn you 1 card or some Action Tokens or 1 point in one specific Subject or a choice on a list, or a roll on a table. &#10;&#10;&#10;Scores are tracked using paper and pencil.&#10;&#10;The game ends when players have gone through the deck twice.  &#10;The player with the highest score in the most categories is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2-4 players with an Aquaman Theme.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck of 8 suites:  Aquaman (A), Companion (C), Sea Creature (X), Plot (P), Foe (F), Power (O), Strangeness (S) and Location (L).  Each suite comprises 16 cards ranked from 1 to 16.&#10;&#10;The board is an 8x8 grid. Each square must be big enough to easily hold 1 card.  1 card is randomly dealt face up to each space on the board. Each player places their pawn on a different corner space (each pawn represents a different manifestation of Aquaman).&#10;&#10;Each player draws 3 cards to start.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising five phases:&#10;&#10;1. Power Phase&#10;-  If you have at least 5 cards in your hand, you may discard 1 card from your hand to activate its special ability: &#10;-  Aquaman: Draw 2 cards from the deck &amp; put them in your hand. If the sum of the ranks of the 2 cards is less than the rank of the Aquaman card, draw and keep a third card. &#10;-  Companion: Look at the next 4 cards in the deck. Keep one and &#10;discard the other 3. The one you keep must be of a lower rank than the Companion Card. &#10;-  Sea Creature: Take the top card of discard and put it in your hand. &#10;It must be of a lower rank than the Sea Creature card. &#10;-  Plot: You may move your pawn to any target, non-occupied space this turn in Swim phase (do not bother rolling the dice). The card in the target space must be of a lower Rank than the Plot card. &#10;-  Foe: Target opponent who is adjacent to you must reveal one random card from his hand; if it is lower in rank than the Foe card it is discarded.  &#10;-  Power: Discard X cards and draw X replacement cards. The cards you discard may not be of a higher Rank than the Power card. &#10;-  Strangeness: Put 1 target adjacent card on the board in your hand. It must be of a lower rank than the Strangeness card. Immediately draw a card to replace it with on the Board.   &#10;-  Location: Look at the next X cards in the deck where X = the rank of the Location card.&#10;&#10;2.  Swim Phase&#10;&#10;     Roll two dice. Move your pawn on the board orthogonally first the distance of one of the dice, and then the distance of the other. For example, you roll a 2 and a 5.  You decide to first move him to your left 5 spaces and then forward 2 spaces. &#10;&#10;&#10;3.  Action Phase&#10;&#10;     If you land on a space not occupied by another pawn, take the card there and put it in your hand. Immediately replace the card you took with the top card of the deck. &#10;     If the space is occupied by another player&rsquo;s pawn, there will be a fight: Both players reveal 1 card from their hand. High card wins. If tied, players reveal a second card. Discard all revealed cards. The winner gets to look at the loser&rsquo;s hand and steal 1 card. &#10;&#10;&#10;4.  Mission Phase&#10;&#10;     You may complete a Mission.  To do this play (discard) 8 cards from your hand, one from each of the eight suites.  &#10;&#10;&#10;5.  Rest Phase&#10;&#10;     Max hand size is 10 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The first player to complete 3 Missions is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
