    "Description": "Players try to escape from the prison island Alcatraz in this quite abstract game. Board resembles a chess board, it's a 9x9 grid where players must move their pieces from one end to the other. Each piece can move horizontally or vertically as many spaces as the player wishes, but there are few complications: the guards. Each row has a guard. Whenever a piece moves to a row, the guard on that row moves as many spaces towards the piece as the piece moved (if you move three rows up, the guard on that row moves three spaces towards you). If the guard catches you, the move is illegal. Of course, it's legal to make the guards catch other players' pieces... The first player to have three of their four pieces escape wins.&#10;&#10;Alcatraz is fun, quick game and a nice brain-teaser, especially with more than two players when the board gets quite crowded.&#10;&#10;",

In the historical battle, the US Second Marine Division had 3 days to clear the island of Japanese soldiers.  The bloody battle inflicted nearly 3,000 casualties on the Marines; only 17 of 4,700 Japanese soldiers survived.  The solitaire game places the player in command of the US forces to determine how he performs compared to the historical outcome.&#10;&#10;A map overlaid with a hexagonal grid forms the game's playing field.  In the middle lies the isle of Tarawa, surrounded by water.  The terrain and Japanese defenses are also printed out, as well as the US-designated landing beaches.  Each turn, the player receives an amount of forces to deploy onto the beaches.  He handles attacks between the two armies, rolling dice and checking tables to resolve their effects.  When the Marines has defeated the Japanese in a hex, a cleared marker is placed on it (and removed if the US forces retreat from the hex due to a counterattack).  If the Japanese attack is particularly effective, the Marines suffers casualties, which is reflected by moving a marker on the Casualty Track.  The player also has to concern him with Booby-Traps, Snipers, Air Raids, Morale, and Supply.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the third turn.  The player wins if all hexes of the island are cleared and the Casualty Track reflects less than 5,000 casualties.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls several gnomes intent on battle for neighborhood control. You&rsquo;ll pick out your gnomes, arm them, and fortify your yard to find out if you have what it takes to be the top gnome household.&#10;&#10;The games start with recruitment of your gnomes. Every player chooses 2 gnomes from a selection board. Next players can add items to their gnomes, such as weapons and defense items, and yard items that apply to their whole household.&#10;&#10;For you turn, you can either continue beefing up your gnomes and yard, choose new gnomes to join you, or choose an opponent to battle with your gnomes. In battle, you also have one-time use and action cards from your hand to surprise the enemy. The loser of each battle hands over a gnome. Whoever has the most defeated gnomes set aside at the end of the game wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As seen on Board Game Arena.&#10;&#10;Remember When ... is a family party game for 3-9 players, ages 8 and up.  Younger readers are also able to play, as the game is very educational for teaching sentence structure and increasing vocabulary, while being fun at the same time!&#10;&#10;The players represent retired super heroes and reformed super villains who have gotten together, years later, to reminisce about their earlier adventures.  However, as always happens at occasions like this, each is trying to outdo their peers by bragging about an even more amazing story of what they once did.  But the funny part is that everyone's memories are faulty because they are now going senile, and they're relying on their &quot;friends&quot; to help them fill in the blanks!  So while the hero or villain might really have a great story to tell, what comes out of their mouth ends up being VERY different.  Each player has two goals - 1) To be the best at helping the other players in remembering correctly, and 2) To come up with their own memory/adventure that their peers agree is the best one of all!&#10;&#10;Remember When ... comes with hundreds of unique cards, each with 4 words/phrases on it's 4 sides.  There are ZERO repeats, meaning there are billions of different combinations!  There are also several blank cards for players to create their own.  On the Active Player's turn they are creating a memory with 7 or 8 (if using the optional Orange cards) different cards representing a different part of the memory.  1) WHEN they did this, 2) WHERE they did this, 3) HOW they did this (i.e. Adverb), 4) The ACTION that they took (i.e. Verb), 5) The DESCRIPTION of the object of their memory (i.e. Adjective), 6) The OBJECT of their memory (i.e. Noun), and 7) WHY they took this action.  For example, &quot;Remember When ..., while looking for my other sock, in the crowded grocery store, I repeatedly kissed the furry caveman because the Great Conjunction was at hand!?&quot;&#10;&#10;But the Active Player does not create this Sentence/Memory from their own cards.  The other players are rapidly trying to assist the Active Player by submitting one card each.  The Object and the Action Taken are determined first and read out loud, so the players have some context for their card submissions.  Once one card of a type/color (i.e. &quot;Blue&quot;) has been submitted then another available color must be submitted.  As the players submit their cards to the Active Player, face down, they are trying to guess which of those 4 words/phrases the Active Player will actually choose.  If they are correct in their guesses then both they and the Active Player will get points for matching.&#10;&#10;Once the Active Player has assembled their sentence, scored it for &quot;helping points&quot;, then they read the completed sentence aloud (we suggest as dramatically as possible).  This is because the other players will be voting on which memory of the evening is the most exciting of all!&#10;&#10;Also try the game out FOR FREE online at Board Game Arena!&#10;&#10;",

Actions consist of Drawing a card from the deck or playing a card from your hand and following the actions.&#10;&#10;Playing cards may result in forcing other players to draw cards, peeking at other player's cards, swapping hands with a player, attacking an individual player or forcing every player to take extra actions.&#10;&#10;When drawing you may draw a card that will instantly kill one of your Beans.&#10;&#10;If a player is attacked or if you draw a Kill card, you may defend against that attack or death by playing an accident card with a corresponding icon.

One sequencing card for each animal is laid in a row.&#10;&#10;A deck with 15-18 cards is placed in the center of the table, and players take turns drawing a card and trying to communicate to the other players which animal and how many of this animal are on the card. To do this, they clap their hands one time for each animal, and they slap the table a number of times equal to the animal's place in the sequencing row &mdash; but they don't want to do this too clearly because for each incorrect guess by an opponent, that opponent must give the clue-giver a card from his scoring pile. Whoever guesses correctly claims the card, and whoever has the most cards in scoring pile once the deck runs out wins.&#10;&#10;",

This set can be played by itself, or mixed in with other editions.&#10;&#10;Management Material is a card game with a corporate theme where the players try to win by avoiding being promoted to management.  This is done by playing Excuse cards to avoid the Project cards and passing the Project to the next player.  Other players may also play Recognition cards on you, which make it more difficult to get out of the project with an Excuse.  Ultimately, some player will end up completing the Project, and that player adds the card to their completed projects, pushing them closer to the 30 points necessary to be identified as Management Material and losing the game.  The last player that avoids being promoted to management wins the game.  Event cards provide an additional randomizing element.&#10;&#10;",

Intervention cards can be used as instants and will allow you to turn the game in your favour (as long as you play them at the correct time.

It pitted the forces of Brian Boru, high king of Ireland, against a Norse-Irish alliance comprising the forces of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, king of Dublin, M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and a Viking contingent led by Sigurd of Orkney and Brodir of Mann. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed. Although Brian's forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son Murchad and his grandson Toirdelbach. Leinster king M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain.&#10;&#10;Game from Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #162 (along with Saipan) depicting a long forgotten but interesting subject. Game of the clash between the invading viking and the Irish forces under Brian Boro.&#10;&#10;Little is known on this battle and the designer has admittedly researched as best he could. However, the game is of original design and is quite bloody in its combat table, well in keeping with the era.  Nicely produced map and counters,depicting the area of the battle, with counters in the traditional green for you know who and blue for the vikings and their allies. The game is based on kill or be killed, with little room for maneuver... and would suit most medieval wargamers to a tee.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 30 minutes&#10;Map: 130 yards per hex&#10;Unit: Individual Leaders and 300-500 men per combat counter&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; (Clontarf uses only half of the map as the other half is for Saipan)&#10;One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters, 100 for Saipan and 100 for Clontarf)&#10;One 10 page rulebook&#10;&#10;",

If the first 9 holes (&quot;Front 9&quot;) at Pebble Beach are laid out in this order--4-4-3-4-5-3-4-4-5=36, then when the player begins by rolling all 9 dice, he/she must play the course &quot;in order&quot; by choosing two par 4's before he/she may then chose a par 3. Having to go in the order of holes on a golf course creates a different strategy and usually produces higher scores than the Traditional format.&#10;&#10;In all formats, tournament play is the most exciting--where players are playing against each other, and their scores are affecting other players' choices and strategies.&#10;&#10;A game primarily for non-gamers and sports nuts, which nevertheless is a very strategic, &quot;push-your-luck&quot; dice game. It is not just a matter of rolling dice and counting up your score; the requirement of keeping one or more dice each time you roll presents many interesting choices, depending on what your opponent has done, and what you already have kept for scoring.&#10;&#10;The game is sold online and in major golf shops and golf stores. Game includes a cup, nine dice, score pad, pencil, and rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

Collecting points is done by buying items according to each person's interests. The points can be lost as well, for example if the player gets a drug card.&#10;&#10;The game was designed and published by the founders of CCP to finance the beginning of their EVE Online project.&#10;&#10;According to the manual of the 2013 re-release, Danger Game was developed in collaboration with Iceland's Alcoholics Anonymous group to teach children the inherent dangers of drinking and drug use.&#10;&#10;The game's original box art features a man, actor J&oacute;n Gnarr Kristinsson, dressed as a woman. Years later, J&oacute;n Gnarr (as he has legally changed his name to now) would become mayor of Iceland's capitol city Reykjav&iacute;k. When developer CCP considered re-releasing Danger Game as part of an anniversary box set for EVE Online, it approached the former model and mayor to reprise his role as the damsel on the cover. Gnarr agreed and appears on the reissued game's art.&#10;&#10;",

His accounts from the land was so overwhelmingly fantastic and adventurous, that one could hardly believe him. Yet, the precious cargo he brought with him, convinced even the most discriminating and suspicious among the Venezians.&#10;&#10;Everyone wanted to have some of the valuable goods from China. Through the Silk Road &mdash; the legendary trading route which connected China with Europe &mdash;  traders brought exquisite treasures home, most importantly, precious silk,  which no one outside of China knew how to make.&#10;&#10;But the road which led to Venezia through the Gobi desert and passing the great commercial centers of Xi'an, Samarkand, Buchara, Bagdad and Byzanz, was dangerous. This made the traders dependent on each other during the journey. Nevertheless this did not stop them from, using the right tactics and a trace of cunning, trying to gain advantages over each other. Especially in the Bazaars and at the large Trading Posts which lined the route. The first to arrive would make the most profitable deals and receive the most ounces of Silver when they arrived at the end of their trip.&#10;&#10;",

Paired players then argue topics such as &quot;Who would win in a fight, Mary Poppins or Judge Judy?&quot; or &quot;What is more nerve-wracking: a first date or a job interview?&quot;  The non-arguing players then vote on who they felt argued best, each vote equaling a point for the arguing players.  After every player has argued twice, whoever has the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's fun is that the Player Assignment Cards also determine which side of the argument you must take, even if you do not agree with that side,&quot; says White.  &quot;So, for instance, if you can't stand rap music, you may be put in the position to argue why you think rap music is great for society.  This can be quite entertaining.&quot;&#10;&#10;Included with Argue is 1,000 topics, a precision timer and 100 optional Distraction Cards.  These can be used to make arguing more of a challenge by causing players to perform outrageous stunts, such as arguing &quot;while smelling your left shoe&quot; or arguing &quot;while jumping up and down for 15 seconds.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cooperative game for 2-4 players ages 8 and up.  The Watchtower space station is under attack by villains (5 per hero plus randomly-appearing extra-powerful &quot;ultra villains&quot;) and the players win by capturing them all before the Watchtower is destroyed.&#10;&#10;The board consists of concentric rings in eight triangular sectors, with the station in the middle.  On each player's turn, they roll two dice: a standard 8-sider and custom 6-sider.  If the 6 shows a JLA logo the hero can move the 8-sider in spaces then attack.  Otherwise, the 6 will show icons for villain advancement towards the station, or new villains appearing on the outer ring, and then the player rolls again.  Thus, the villains will make totally random progress towards the station before each player's turn (and possibly even none at all).  The Watchtower can take four villain attacks before it's destroyed.&#10;&#10;Hero attacks are straightforward; each villain has a numeric defense value, and each hero rolls two 8-siders against their villains (e.g., Superman vs. Bizarro) and one against others (e.g., Flash vs. Luthor).  Defense values range from 7 to 15, so it's unlikely for a hero to win without help.&#10;&#10;Help comes in the form of allies and power cards.  Other heroes stacked with an attacking hero can roll their dice and add to the attack, greatly increasing the chance of success.  And power cards activate hero powers like moving other heroes (Superman, Flash), adding dice (Green Lantern) or allowing other heroes to play cards during your attack (Batman).  However, power cards are limited; each player starts with two and only draws a new one when defeating a villain.&#10;&#10;Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Defend the Justice League satellite from a super-villain onslaught!&#10;&#10;The most dangerous villains in the universe have combined forces to attack the Justice League satellite. In Justice League: Axis of Villains, you can play as Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, or The Flash, and team up to defeat them in a powered-up strategy game!&#10;&#10;",

You have been hired to conserve these hamsters and keep them safe from their natural predator: the badger.&#10;&#10;Tricky Badger is a set-collection, trick-taking card game. The game lasts five rounds, and each player starts the round with a hand of nine cards, with pink always being trump. Ten collection cards are placed face up from the deck.&#10;&#10;At the start of each trick, the active player (a position that rotates) chooses a collection card that the winner of the trick will add to their collection; each collection card has an arrow to indicate whether the highest or lowest card in the trick will win. The active player leads a card, and players must follow this color, if possible. Some cards trample others, and a trampled card is removed from consideration in the trick. If a trump is played in the trick, then the highest or lowest non-trampled trump wins the trick; otherwise the highest or lowest non-trampled card of the suit led wins the trick.&#10;&#10;After nine tricks, the round ends. Discard the remaining collection card, deal out nine cards to each player, and lay out ten new collection cards.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, players score points for their collection cards, which can be independent or connected to other cards. Every female hamster and every male hamster is worth 1 point, for example, but a female and male hamster that are connected are worth 3 points. Get a second male hamster, however, and they fight, eliminating all of your hamsters. Similarly, a 3-point badger in your collection will eat all hamsters present unless you connect it with a bone to slake its hunger. You can feed wheat and weevils to hamsters to earn bonus points, but weevils on their own will eat your wheat. Magpies can steal cards from opponents, but cages and buckets can protect your animals from theft.&#10;&#10;Whoever ends up with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players want to make their pawns reach the ground floor of the tower because at the end of the round pawns have different values depending on the floor where they are located; the farther down they go, the more they're worth. Players have only one instrument to move pawns, though: their pointing fingers!

Each player is dealt 8 cards face up.  The remaining cards are stacked face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned face up and placed next to the draw pile to form the match pile.  Each player will then try to get rid of as many cards as possible by matching the numbers on the cards with the numbers on the dice they roll.  There&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that, but you&rsquo;ll have to see the rules to get the whole picture.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to capture three squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row which don&rsquo;t contain animals. However, if you make three in a row and at least one animal is in those cells, you lose! (Think of the members of an animal activist group getting angry at you for capturing the animals.) To win, you must strategically free the animals while going for three in a row.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Are your friends infected by an alien entity? Can you contact mission control before its too late? Grab some friends and join the paranoia.&#10;&#10;Alien Entity is meant to be played multiple times. Players are passed cards face down to determine who is playing as a human or an alien. The humans win if the satellite array is built or the alien gets shot. The alien wins if it passes out infection cards to all of the humans. After each game ends, points are calculated and another game starts with a new random person as the Alien.&#10;&#10;Each player draws cards from a central pile and takes turns playing and passing cards. Choose wisely because you will only be able to play one card per turn and equipment such as body armor only lasts until your next turn.You may pass cards face down to other players to either help them or hurt their progress. If you are a human you may want to pass parts of the satellite array to another human. If you are an alien you can pass infection cards to other players to get them on your side.&#10;&#10;Games usually last between five and ten minutes. After each game points are given depending on the outcome of the game. The cards are then re-shuffled and a new alien player is secretly chosen. You can play until a player amasses 7 points or you can just play for fun indefinitely.&#10;&#10;",

While Eternas is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you thinking. Eternas is a four in a row style game in which the first player to place four bead of their color in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, wins the game. Conceived around the shape of the circle (the symbol for eternity) Eternas was designed for borderless play. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Eternas is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.&#10;&#10;",
