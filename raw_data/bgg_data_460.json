    "Description": "At first glance, this game appears to be a multi-player variant on earlier games in the vein of L'Attaque. Players set up pieces of hidden value, advance them, and capture opponents pieces by moving into occupied spaces and having the piece of greater rank.&#10;&#10;However, there are other differences beyond the multi-player capability. Players do not seek a hidden flag; rather, they strive to reach visible target spaces in their opponents' territories that may only be occupied by a Spy piece. Challenging is optional; i.e., multiple players may have pieces co-exist on the same space as long as a player moving in declines to ask, &quot;Who's there?&quot; Finally, each player has a piece that cannot be captured called the Secret Police, which may only capture an opponent's Spy.&#10;&#10;The first player to move his Spy onto an opponent's Palace space or Coat of Arms space is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

A United States citizen twenty-one years old could file a claim on 160 acres of public land which he wished to own as a home for himself and his family.  If he lived there for five years, had built a house and was raising crop, he was given title to the land.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The country was wild, the problems faced by the &quot;sod-busters&quot; were great.  Many homesteaders gave up before five years had passed.  Everyone who succeeded did so through sheer determination and by using every skill or handicraft he could master.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing cards and playing them onto their Land Tracts.  The cards come in 5 colors, one for each year.  At the end of the game, players who have a house, crop, and 4 of the 6 other types of cards, without having the claim jumper card, win.&#10;&#10;",

At 8.5 x 11 inches, they are significantly larger than the standard cards in order to better reflect the capabilities of these massive ships. A starbase card (also 8.5 x 11&quot;) is also included.&#10;&#10;Border Box #6 has 7 battleship miniatures and a starbase.&#10;&#10;Federation Commander: Line of Battle has extras of each of the ship cards (except the Starbase) that are in Battleships Attack.&#10;&#10;Boosters #16, #17, and #18 are loosely associated with this module, as they contain dreadnoughts and dreadnought variants (in other words, some big ships, too). Across the three boosters, most of the ships are previously unreleased.&#10;&#10;In a break from the established pattern, Squadron Boxes #16, #17, and #18 contain minis that match the boosters. (Typically, Squadron Box minis match the ship cards found in the main product.)&#10;&#10;Either the Federation Commander: Klingon Border or Federation Commander: Romulan Border base set is required to use Battleships Attack.&#10;&#10;Publisher's Federation Commander site: http://www.federationcommander.com/&#10;&#10;",

(and incidentally maybe at your friends toes or random appendages). Relive the summer fun with this quick mini reproduction of the game.&#10;&#10;Please note... this is not the real thing... if you were to be playing this game... well there is not a foot and half long metal dart flying through the air.  We use smaller magnetic tipped darts and our field of green is a felt field with rings backed by a magnetic strip.  The essence of the game is still the same... get it in the rings.  But if you want a bit of danger well we've included two felt feet as well... impale one with a dart and you lose points.  Finish the round without sticking a dart into the tender tootsies... and you'll find your score climbs up a bit more.&#10;&#10;If you have any questions... well I'm (mbourgeois) the guy to ask.  We don't forsee production on this game anytime soon.  There simply isn't the current market for it.  However if you'd like to make your own... just ask for info and we'll send off the material requirements and measurements to make your own.&#10;&#10;See: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2279107#2279107&#10;&#10;",

It was an harsh battle, where the Austrians got the numerical advantage but didn&rsquo;t have the confidence to use it as it was due for a victory.&#10;The simple, but not simplistic rules integrate movement and combat, several readiness status for the various leaders and troops present on the field of battle, fire and melee rules, morale, territorial gains and so on.

    "Description": "I Obey &ndash; the Campaign of Bezzecca 1866&#10;This one is an operational game on Garibaldi campaign over the Alps during the initial and central phases of the Third Italian War of Independence. It was a strange, fascinating campaign by one of the most famous generals of his time, not only in Italy. Garibaldi&rsquo;s red shirts fought and won against a superior, but very dispersed Austrian army, that tried to force Garibaldi to a slow and depressing struggle over mountain passes and cliffs, but was surprised in the decisive battle of Bezzecca that opened the road to victory for the Italian general that was stopped by a direct order of his king (to which he responded simply &ldquo;I obey&rdquo;, giving up a sure victory on the field for a political one for his country).&#10;&#10;With a very peculiar chit drawing activation method and a combat system that stresses fatigue over real casualties, I obey is a fascinating study of this neglected campaign, with a see-saw motion of the counters over the splendid map and the chance for both sides to gain an unexpected victory.&#10;&#10;Medium complexity, 2/3 hours playing time, both for competitive and solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Released as Print-n-Play in June 2007&#10;&#10;",

Benefits range from upgrading all archers to long bows, increasing unit size based on your Warrior's Level, and additional movements, to name a few.&#10;&#10;Starting with BattleLore: Horrific Horde, additional Deployment cards are included in some supplements.&#10;&#10;Set-up now includes the following actions:&#10;&#10;     Ready your deployment deck and draw deployment cards&#10;     Set-up your units based on the cards drawn&#10;     Determine initiative&#10;     Deploy your Reserve units&#10;     Establish your War Council&#10;     Select and play 2 Specialist cards&#10;&#10;&#10;The expansion also includes new terrain hexes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Test your memory with Spider-Man &amp; Friends! Just turn over the cups to see if you can make a match of Spider-Man or his superhero pals!&#10;&#10;A version of 'Memory' notably different in that it contains no cards and players are not matching 'identical' pieces; instead, players match the top half of a painted miniature to the bottom half, all hidden under plastic cups. The game comes with a fold-out showing what the complete miniatures look like (mostly unnecessary once you discover, for instance, that Spider-man has bulbous 'manly' feet, and Spider-girl has petite 'girly' feet).&#10;&#10;The 'carrying case', when opened, serves as the game board, impressed with spaces to place the half-miniatures and cups.&#10;&#10;The rules also list a 'more challenging game' variation: after a 'full' miniature is found it is still removed, but the now empty cups remain on the board to throw off players: this variation is dependent on the plastic cups and therefore unplayable with other Memory-type games that use only cards.&#10;&#10;",
