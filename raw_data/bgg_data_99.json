    "Description": "The year is 1692. In an atmosphere of pessimism and charged paranoia, the citizens of Salem are at the mercy of demons &ndash; not demons of the soul, but demons of the mind. What began as a devout Puritan community devolved in a matter of months into a people torn apart by fear, lies, and fanatical orthodoxy. The residents of Salem quickly discovered that they could find Hell all around them.&#10;&#10;Salem incites the atmosphere of paranoia that held the village of Salem captive. Players act with the assumption that there are witches among them (and, in this case, there will be). Each player controls six residents of Salem, three of whom are witches. Game play is simple: try to rid the village of witches and keep the identities of your own residents secret.&#10;&#10;The game plays over the course of four rounds representing the four months (June&ndash;September 1692) in which the hysteria was at its height. Each round has two parts: a Witch Hunt and a Witch Trial, followed by hangings (the dates of which correspond to the four actual hangings that took place in Salem that year). During the Witch Hunt, players send residents to jail and provide alibis for their own jailed citizens. At the end of each round all jailed citizens stand trial. Players then collectively decide who is hanged and who is spared. The player who is most successful at discerning witches from villagers wins!&#10;&#10;While the story surrounding the Salem witch trials has become something of a legend, every character in this game is based on a real person whose life was directly touched and in some cases torn apart or taken away by the events surrounding the Salem witch trials. Extensive research has been done to craft the real-life stories of all 42 residents in the game.&#10;&#10;While this game focuses on the people and events specific to Salem, Massachusetts, similar witch hunts were taking place as far north as Maine and as far West as Connecticut. Surely, the devil had come to New England.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Winner of the 2018 Best Combinatorial Game award, Blooms is a 2-player game where players capture each other&rsquo;s pieces by surrounding them.&#10;&#10;It was inspired by the classical game Go and a painting in an Oregon coffee shop.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bloom: a bloom is an entire group of connected stones on the board of the same color. A single stone (unconnected to others of the same color) is also a bloom.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Fenced: a bloom is fenced when there are no empty spaces adjacent to any of the bloom&rsquo;s stones.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each player owns 2 colors of stones. To start, Player 1 places 1 stone of either of her colors on any empty space.&#10;     From then on, starting with Player 2, the players take turns. On your turn, you must place 1 or 2 stones onto any empty spaces. If you place 2, they must be different colors. Then capture all fenced enemy blooms.&#10;     The first player to have captured X stones wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;The key is you can and usually should sacrifice your own stones to gain positional advantage. It's common for players to get 10 or more points down in games played to 20, and still win. This is important because new players often don't see the value of sacrifice and lose without having any idea what happened, which isn't fun.&#10;&#10;&#10;     See diagrams and gifs here&#10;     Play online at Board Game Arena&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game play in Disney Villains: The Card Game is simple, but the villains rarely stay loyal to you, possibly giving points away to other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player takes their own villain deck, which consists of cards numbered 1-6 three times in various colors. Shuffle your deck, then lay one card face up and take four cards in hand. On a turn, you must play one card from your hand that matches the number or color of the card on top of your pile &mdash; but if the card you would play matches the top card of your left- or right-hand neighbor's discard pile, then you must play it there instead!&#10;&#10;Maybe you can choose a card in hand that matches only your top card? If you have no valid play or don't want to give points away to someone else, you can play the card face down on your stack, showing the hero on the card back. On your next turn, you can play any card you like on your pile &mdash; except if it matches a neighbor's top card, of course, in which case you must give it away. (You can't play on a neighbor's hero card.) Whatever you do, refill your hand to four cards at turn's end.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been played, everyone scores for the cards in their pile &mdash; but first they must count the number of hero cards in their pile. However many heroes they have, they must remove all matching number cards prior to scoring. If you have four heroes, for example, you must discard all 4s &mdash; and this is bad since all cards score points equal to their value. If you have nine heroes, then you first discard all 6s, then all 3s. Whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Disney Villains: The Card Game includes two special cards that each player can shuffle into their deck prior to play. (Reshuffle if you flip up a special card initially.) When you play a special card, discard it to the center of the table instead of playing it on your pile. Here's what these cards do:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Maleficent &mdash; Curse: All players with the highest number on their pile discard those cards to the center of the table.&#10;    Cruella de Ville &mdash; Exchange: Exchange your top card (whether hero or number) with the top card of another player's pile.&#10;    Ursula &mdash; Whirlpool: Decide whether all players pass their topmost card to the player on their left or right.&#10;    Captain Hook &mdash; Interfere: All players must flip their top card from number to hero or vice versa.&#10;    Jafar &mdash; Hypnosies: Take the top card of another player's pile and add it to your hand.&#10;    Scar &mdash; Intrigue: Draw a card at random from each player's hand and place it in front of them. They must play this card on their turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Feelinks contains 50 cards offering 150 situations from everyday life. For example: &quot;You wake up in the body of a person of a different ethnicity&quot; or &quot;The Minister of Justice is caught smoking cannabis&quot;. The players are obligated to express their feelings in a given situation and to guess the feeling of another player in the same situation.

BattleCON builds upon other fighting-type games by placing a focus on tactical positioning, extreme character specialization, and a wide range of viable plays at any given moment. These elements combine to make every match memorable and action packed.&#10;&#10;In BattleCON, both players take their actions simultaneously in a turn sequence called a beat. At the start of each beat, players choose their attacks secretly, then reveal them and execute them together.&#10;&#10;An attack consists of two cards--a style and a base. The style is specific to your character, while the base is (typically) shared among all characters.&#10;&#10;Bases (the right side of the attack pair) typically grant you movement, resistance to stun, and a set priority and range, and power. They are the tactics of combat--heavy punch, light punch, projectile, throw, and the like.&#10;&#10;Styles (the left side of the attack pair) are modifiers that add your character's personal touch to the attack. They integrate your special abilities by enhancing attacks with things like time control, life drain, increased speed, the ability to absorb damage, and more&#10;&#10;The first complete BattleCON set is titled &quot;War of Indines&quot;, and follows the adventures of the heroes and villains of a fantasy world. Indines (pronounced &quot;In-deanz&quot;) is a fantastic world of ancient magic, high technology, and political intrigue, where daring heroes and epic villains are daily fare, and where there's always an adventure of some type to be had.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;The Seven Years' War Worldwide&#10;&#10;Between 1756 and 1763, Europe erupted into what became the first true world-wide conflict, known as the Seven Years&rsquo; War. On the one hand, Britain and France vied for supremacy in world-wide trade, becoming deadly enemies in the process. On the other, Austria and Prussia struggled for dominance in Germany. On the fringes, Russia began to feel her growing power, while Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey all knew their time was almost up.&#10;&#10;Soldier Kings re-creates the free-for-all that was the Seven Years&rsquo; War. Two to eight players take the roles of the nations listed above, trying to capture or hold onto the rich lands of Europe, India, South-East Asia and America. The world is changing; the power that grabs the most now will dominate the modern age that is just dawning. If you&rsquo;re the Soldier King, that power will be you.&#10;&#10;In Soldier Kings, each player has armies and fleets. There are also a handful of generals and admirals to assist these in battle and in movement. The best is Frederick of Prussia, called &ldquo;The Great&rdquo; for a reason. The worst is the hapless Prince of Orange, with whom the Dutch player is saddled.&#10;&#10;Players have allies; some are set at the beginning of the game, others alliances are forged during the course of play. Everyone else is an enemy. No one is &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;; those are just enemies you haven&rsquo;t attacked yet.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into land areas and sea zones. Armies move on land, fleets at sea. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for your forces, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Money is, well, money. You expend manpower to rebuild your forces, and money to finance their actions. Thus you need to hang on to areas that generate these resources for you, and take them from the other guy.&#10;&#10;You do that by defeating enemy armies, and besieging enemy areas. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor. These hits must be sustained by enemy armies by reducing them in strength, or eliminating them. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there). The procedure here is very similar.&#10;&#10;Throwing a twist into all of this is card play. The universe is loaded with random elements; life does not unfold as an orderly series of &ldquo;phases.&rdquo; After a short countdown to start the game, players can play cards at any time, in any order.&#10;&#10;The cards are the centerpiece of the game, giving it its free-wheeling nature. Generals can vacillate. Mercenaries can be hired. Local militia can appear to help. Soldiers might run off to loot. Bridges get burned, snow falls early, the harvests are bad, the harvests are good. Royal marriages, minor country alliances, the rise of new leaders &mdash; all sorts of events take place during card play.&#10;&#10;The game contains seven scenarios: a campaign game covering the entire war, and then six shorter ones, one for each year of the war. Play ends on a pre-determined turn or when a player has achieved his or her conditions for automatic victory, whichever comes first.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(second edition, TG552)&#10;&#10;Inspired by the Book of Kells and its mesmerizing patterns woven amongst the vellum pages, Project Kells evolved.  Standing atop the Hill of Tara and contemplating the conjoined ringforts of Forradh and Teach Chormac, the games of Sacred Hill and High Kings of Tara were born.  Steeped in the ancient legends of Ireland&rsquo;s Celtic heritage and royal past, these unique games of pure strategy are appreciated by young and old alike.&#10;&#10;Tailten Games won the Games Magazine award for BEST ABSTRACT GAME 2006; the  Spiele f&uuml;r Zwei - Spiele Akademie 2005 (Austria); Index 100 - Showcase 2005 in Ireland; and the award for 'Best Irish-Style Traditional Gift' 2005 in Ireland for Project Kells.&#10;&#10;According to the designer, Murray Heasman,&quot;The game takes five minutes to learn, yet a lifetime to master.&quot; The sheer beauty of this game alone makes it a gift to treasure--but the three separate games  each pose a daunting task for any strategic or abstract gamer.&#10;&#10;In all there are eight variants to stimulate the mind, so take it to your own level.  From a more simple Sacred Hill, a go-like game with its' elemental challenges, to an all-out-brain-burner in the form of Poisoned Chalice... Project Kells combines the best of beauty, gameplay, theme, and replay value.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll be amazed at the possibilities.  Once you&rsquo;ve learned the basics, be prepared to delve deeper, because you&rsquo;re likely to be already hooked on this game.  Scoring with knots (instead of kingdoms) will get you addicted.&#10;&#10;&#10;     This first game: Sacred Hill introduces the basic elements of play.  The aim of both games is the same -- to have the least number of kingdoms by the time the game is ended, a kingdom being a group of linked ring forts.  There are two phases to the game.  In manoeuvres (first phase) you are building a network of unconnected ring forts scattered around the board.  In Battle (second phase) you are adding ring forts next to your own, linking them together with bridge tiles, to form larger (and fewer) kingdoms.  This starts to magically create the Celtic knotwork.  Isolated ring forts that are besieged must be captured.  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.===&#10;     The second game:  High Kings of Tara introduces the kings.  Each player has three which do the work of building your ring forts. They move like the knight in chess and add many more twists and turns to the game, taking it to another dimension.  Kings can capture enemy ring forts and kings; they can also be immobilized.  Your own kings cannot work in tandem and they must always move to a vacant hill whenever possible.  Ties are possible, but the duality of scoring pursuits (ringforts versus captured kings) usually prevents this possibility.  This is especially true in tournament scoring...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Those who feel that they have mastered those variants are encouraged to try the real brain burner of the bunch.  Poisoned Chalice  Played at right angles to each other, each player tries to exert total control over each other from a position of inferiority. The end scoring is the same as in the Sacred Hill variant, but in this endeavor the limitations of placement create challenging strategic obstacles for both opponents.  It is possible to exert control over an opponent in such a way that at times they are limited to one possibility for tile placement.  However, there are twists that occur if a piece is captured (surrounded) on the board (like in 'go').  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.&#10;&#10;&#10;This is very probably the same game [system] as The High Kings of Tara.&#10;&#10;",

Aces of Valor is a solitaire game where you command a fighter squadron on the Western Front during World War I through a campaign of multiple missions to score as many victory points as possible to assist the war effort. You can play as the Germans, or one the Entente powers (British, French, or Americans). Each aircraft counter represents the pilot and the aircraft combined, and your squadron will have up to eight at any given time.&#10;&#10;The player chooses the campaign&rsquo;s duration (8, 12 or 16 missions), and draws a card to determine the objective of each mission, which includes patrols, trench strafing, photo recon, artillery spotting, balloon busting, and bomber escort. The player&rsquo;s flight moves across a gridded map that is a semi-historical representation of the Western front. Anti-aircraft fire is heaviest near the trenches but can happen anywhere over enemy territory. When combat occurs, aircraft are moved to an &ldquo;Initiative Track&rdquo; for up to three rounds of combat, where pilot skill, aircraft performance, and luck all come into play to determine the outcome.&#10;&#10;The player earns mission points by destroying enemy aircraft and ground targets, and also by escorting bomber and 2-seater aircraft on successful bombing, photo reconnaissance and artillery support missions. When the flight lands, mission points are converted to victory points or used to repair and replace aircraft as well as upgrade aircraft to newer, better models. The goal is to earn enough victory points to achieve a minor, major or strategic victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Aircraft drawings by Vincent Bourguignon&#10;Counter and Map Design by Mark Mahaffey&#10;Cover Painting and Layout by Ivan Berryman and Randy Lein&#10;&#10;",

While there are plenty of other ETO games out there, The Supreme Commander effectively models all of the primary aspects of the war in a simple, straight-forward manner.&#10;&#10;Murmansk convoy, Lend-Lease, diplomacy, the strategic U-Boat campaign, technological advancement, strategic bombing campaigns, naval invasions, the economy and military production, partisans &ndash; All of these elements and more are included in a surprisingly easy-to-learn game.&#10;&#10;That is not to say that The Supreme Commander is some sort of compromise, surrendering historical accuracy for simplicity. The game delivers a detailed order of battle and meticulously researched economic and diplomatic system which allows players to play out the historical military campaigns of the war as well as the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; that may have happened. It is entirely up to the players &ndash; the system is open-ended and does not restrict players to the exact decisions of the past.&#10;&#10;Play time will vary, but the campaign game generally will be a weekend long game that will rarely play the same way twice.&#10;&#10;A campaign game and two shorter scenarios are included.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;Rulebook&#10;Two 22&quot;x34&quot; maps&#10;Diplomatic Track (cardstock)&#10;2 Player aid cards&#10;Two countersheets&#10;6 x Force Pool cards for France, UK, US, USSR, Italy, Germany&#10;Two 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     1.5 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     60 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Corps and Armies&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS   2 to 5&#10;&#10;DEVELOPER: Paul Marjoram&#10;MAP and COUNTER ART: Charlies Kibler&#10;ART DIRECTOR &amp; PACKAGE DESIGN: Rodger B.

Ingenuity, logic, and a healthy dose of insanity will lead you to success.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Everyone gets 10 random cards of objects.&#10;One player reads a chapter out of the &ldquo;book of adventures&rdquo; until he reaches a challenge. Now the person next to him must choose exactly 2 cards that he/she thinks are best suited to solving the challenge. The same player also chooses 3 other cards that he/she thinks are the most unsuitable for solving the challenge.&#10;Shuffle those 5 cards face down and reveal them in the middle of the table. (Additionally, the 2 chosen items can be written as a proof on a secret tablet)&#10;Now, all other players need to discuss and find the 2 chosen items.&#10;The game ends after the group successfully solved 5 challenges or failed 3 times during one adventure.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "All is lost save Honour is a game about the campaigns fought during the Italian Wars (1494-1530), mainly between the Hapsburgs (the Empire) and the Valois (the French kingdom). The first volume is devoted to campaigns between Agnadello (1509) and Pavia (1525)&#10;&#10;All began after reading Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Art of War in Italy 1494-1529&rdquo;, London, 1920. Soon that period looked extremely interesting to us and nearly neglected by the wargame community.&#10;Our intent was to generate any interest, among &ldquo;aficionados&rdquo; and historians, about that ancient era, when the first applications of modern strategy in the art of war took place.&#10;&#10;This is the time of charges of cavalrymen with the finest gliding armors; of the first use of fire arms and artillery (with some effect); sieges, mercenary troops, treachery, pillaging and all that &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; that may enlighten a wargame.&#10;&#10;Those campaigns were led to bring to &ldquo;the battle&rdquo;, which was often decisive, we decided to bring in a detailed sequence of the main battle (said &ldquo;Major Battle&rdquo;). So in the game, there are three kinds of battle: Major Battle, Skirmish and Siege with the Major Battle involving different tactics played by each side.&#10;&#10;The map represents Lombardy in the XVIth century and the neighbors states. The sources for the maps were new books and old manuscripts and maps, among which a manuscript dated 1520 (!), regarding the state of the roads in the area between Lodi and Piacenza.&#10;Many books have been written about this subject and I think we have read the most important ones.&#10;&#10;We had to make a selection of all those campaigns fought in Italy during the Italian Wars. The five campaigns we have included are:&#10;- Agnadello 1509, Venice defends its Republic against the foes. &#10;- Novara 1513, the Swiss against the French army. The last triumph of the Swiss.&#10;- Marignano 1515, Fran&ccedil;ois I grabs the Duchy of Milan from the Swiss&#10;- Bicocca 1522, the French lose the Duchy of Milan&#10;- Pavia 1525, Fran&ccedil;ois I loses the largest battle and Milan to the Empire&#10;&#10;Game Highlights:&#10;&#10;     new game system, operational-level, devoted to warfare in the XVIth century campaigns&#10;     highly interactive sequence of play, focused on maneuver and careful planning&#10;     various forms of combat: Major Battles, Skirmishes, Sieges&#10;     set of Exclusive Rules and specific rules and events for each campaign&#10;     a 22&quot; x 34&quot; fine-art map , reproducing a part of XVIth northern Italy, based on an accurate study of ancient maps and sources&#10;     gorgeous iconic counters representing all the main Capitani who fought there and the different combat units&#10;     detailed (as it is possible) order of battle, with combat units differentiated by strength, maximum movement, quality and reliability&#10;     very low counter density and limited play time&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Europa Simulazioni website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Knee Deep in Hexes is like deck building meets all your favorite 90's RTS games combined - but this time it's a board game.&#10;&#10;Knee Deep in Hexes is a 2-player strategy skirmisher. After the exodus from Earth, you fight on a distant desert planet for scarce resources, build extractors, factories and units - from fast construction vehicles to frightening Paloozas.&#10;&#10;Get knee-deep into intergalactic warfare: Choose your companions with their set of game-breaking skills, build your deck out of unique strategy cards and outsmart your enemy: Win by either destroying their headquarter or by sending their most valuable units to the scrapyard as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a faction first. Every faction consists of four companions - the General, who oversees the battlefield from the planetary orbit, the Commander, who draws on many years of experience in combat and adjusts tactics rapidly, the Tech, who supports the troops by steady innovations and the Trickster who is outsmarting the enemy. Each companion comes with a unique deck of action and war cards. Players can either use these predefined decks or, if they are advanced, engage in deckbuilding in search of ever unique combos.&#10;&#10;The same high variability applies to the map: Here you can either use a predefined casual variant for a quick match or build a world before the game starts by drafting planetary cards. We are already designing and playtesting new factions, companions and decks as well as worlds.&#10;&#10;In this action-packed game, you'll have very little time to secure your basic supplies - that is, build the first construction vehicles and build the first extractors to harvest materials and energy - before clashing with your opponent on the tight map.&#10;&#10;Play action cards during your turn to gain unique strategic advantages and take the initiative on the battlefield. Gather your tanks, carefully plan the use of your war cards, which will give you powerful bonuses in battle - and declare the war zone you want to attack. But beware, here comes the big twist: the battle in the war zone you declare will not take place directly at the end of your turn, but at the end of the turn of your opponent. Your enemies have a whole turn to react, to redeploy troops or to suddenly stab you in the back somewhere else. So be one hundred percent sure before you act!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Adaptoid is a board game for two players designed by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s in 2007. Each game lasts around 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;An adaptoid is a creature that constantly evolves to adapt itself to its surroundings. To survive it needs to be fed. In adaptoid, two armies of adaptoids must confront one another with the aim of eliminating all opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 37-space hexagonal board. Each player receives a supply of adaptoid bodies in either white or black which are plastic discs with laser-cut sockets ready to receive one of the small pile of claws and legs in the colour of each player. The capabilities of each of the adaptoids varies through the game depending on how many and what type of appendage are added.&#10;&#10;Each player turn has 3 phases: Movement, Growth and Feeding. In the movement phase, the player may move one of their adaptoids as many spaces as it has limbs. Adaptoids cannot move through occupied spaces, but they can move on top of an opposing adaptoid to initiate a capture.&#10;&#10;In the growth phase the player must either spawn a new, empty, adaptoid next to one of their existing pieces or add a leg or a claw to any adaptoid already on the board.&#10;&#10;In the feeding phase, every enemy piece is checked for starvation. An adaptoid requires space to graze equal to its number of limbs. Any enemy piece which has fewer empty spaces around it than limbs starves to death and is removed. Starving your opponent to death (or indeed having them incautiously starve themselves) is worth a point.&#10;&#10;The resolution of capture move is simple. The adaptoid with the most claws wins and the other adaptoid is removed from the board. If both pieces have the same number of claws, both are removed with a point going to each player. Starved or captured pieces are returned to the supply ready for further use.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has either obtained 5 points by capturing and starving enemy adaptoids or has been completely eliminated from the board.&#10;&#10;",

Well chosen tile placement is the key to success in this evolving puzzle of a game that will grow on you.&#10;&#10;In Trellis, each player has a supply of flower meeples in their unique color that they are working to place in the garden. Each player also has a hand of hex tiles depicting a tangled weave of differently colored vines.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the active player must plant a tile on the table, growing the size of the garden. Once a tile is placed, automatic blooms happen first. All newly connected vines will bloom flower meeples, if the newly connected vine matches color with the neighbor tile and only if the vine on the neighbor tile has already been claimed with a flower.&#10;&#10;The active player then places a flower claiming a vine on the tile they placed that has not yet bloomed. Immediately, each unclaimed vine of the same color on neighboring tiles connected to the vine just claimed will automatically bloom for that player.&#10;&#10;Finally, if any opponents had flowers bloom due to the tile placement, then the active player gets to place a bonus flower - one for each flower bloom they helped their opponent place! If there are no unclaimed vines available on the tile the active player placed, they get to place a bloom on any unclaimed vine anywhere in the garden!&#10;&#10;The first player to play all fifteen of their flowers immediately wins. Which vines to claim and when to help opponents grow flowers in order to gain bonus blooms for yourself is very furtile soil to ponder during a quick play of Trellis.&#10;&#10;",

Intended for 1 to 7 players, the game offers a team of adventurers the chance to face the merciless dungeon master and his corrupt hordes of monsters. You must do your best to overcome the torments of the crypt. Mutual aid, reflection and decision-making will be key for your journey.&#10;&#10;You can either play against the game or against another player. If you face a player, he'll become the dungeon master by creating the dungeon, controlling the monsters and launching events at the other players. If you face the game, all the above are automated.&#10;&#10;All the other player will take control of one of the 13 characters. You'll be fighting monsters, avoiding traps and curses, opening chest and doors, spending money to the smith or the alchemist. Everything you gather in this adventure is for the entire team. You'll think together to optimize your progression to have a chance to defeat one of the 4 bosses.&#10;&#10;Combats are turn-based. Heroes take action first. They can either use their weapons, use their skills or use a consummable object. Once they all did an action, it's the monsters' turn. Monsters tends to attack the hero holding the defender token. Some of them can choose their target.&#10;&#10;The dungeon is a layout of 6 to 15 cards (at the end of the games). Heroes enter the crypt by turning a card face up (Monsters, chests ...). They resolve the card before deciding to go back to the camp or going deeper in the crypt and therefore turning the next card face up. Once they are at the far end of the dungeon, they can decide to face the boss or the go back to the camp. At the beginning of the game, being a coward is the only option. At some point, you'll have to face your ultimate nemesis. Beat him and you'll win but fail to do so and you'll lose the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The northerly route was chosen for the invasion, passing through Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida. The French offensive began at the end of June. On 24 July, Marshal Ney with the advance guard defeated General Craufurd under the walls of Almeida and threw him back across the Co&acirc; River, as a prelude to laying siege to the place. The French then penetrated into Portugal. Their advance was slow and difficult. As for Wellington, he drew up his army in the formidable position of Bussaco. On 27 September, Mass&eacute;na ordered a frontal attack upon the English line of defense. After a bitter struggle he gave up the attempt and broke off the attack. It would take until the next day to find a way to turn the position at Sierra de Bussaco. With these two battles the terrible duel between Mass&eacute;na and Wellington had begun!&#10;&#10;Almeida and Bussaco 1810 are the 30th and 31st battles of the Jours de Gloire series. The game includes a map (size A2), 216 die-cut counters, and a booklet containing rules, scenarios and historical notes.&#10;&#10;Almeida and Bussaco 1810 will be the supporting game for the 14th Bicentennial Trophy in January 2011.&#10;&#10;Game System:&#10;Jours de Gloire Series (JDG)&#10;- scale = 297m/hex; &#10;- time = 75 min/GT; &#10;- strength = 200 men/SP&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In terms of its gameplay, Qwirkle Cards plays somewhat like Rummikub, with players laying down cards/tiles from their hand onto the table and possibly moving things around to create new sets.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players start with a hand of nine cards from the 108-card deck; each card shows a colored symbol, with each of the six symbols appearing three times in each of the six colors. Whoever has the most cards in hand of one symbol or one color (but without duplicates) starts the game by laying these cards face up on the table as a set. Players then take turns in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must add at least one card to the table; if she can't, she draws nine new cards, shuffles her old hand into the deck, then plays. When she plays, she can play as many cards as she likes as long as they share a color or symbol. She can create a new set if she plays at least three cards or she can add her cards to existing sets (as long as she doesn't duplicate a color or symbol) or she can do both. On her turn, she can move cards from one set to another, possibly using these cards with cards that she plays in order to create a new set.&#10;&#10;The point of this gameplay is to create qwirkles, that is, a set of six cards that contains either each symbol in a single color or each color in a single symbol. When a player creates a qwirkle, she claims this set from the table. After a player's turn, she refills her hand to nine cards.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the deck runs out of cards. Each player then takes one final turn, including the one who took the final card, then whoever has claimed the most qwirkles wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the state of R&rsquo;yan, five factions of the population rise against Emperor Flaut III: Students, Beggars, the City Guard, Alchemists, and the Apparats, medieval robots with a living soul, implemented by said Alchemists. These factions must work together to overcome the Emperor, but only one will eventually rule the future country. Otherwise, Flaut III suppresses the revolution and retains control...&#10;&#10;In Dark Empire: Revolution, each faction consists of a total of 13 cards: three cards with a value of 4-6 and two cards with values 7-8. There are ten additional cards which can be added to the strength of any faction card already in play. The table represents Vindoban, the capital of R`yan, where the emperor deploys his army on one side and the insurgent people gather on the other.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of turns (&quot;weeks&quot;). After four weeks, a month is completed with an intermediate scoring, and after three months a final scoring ends the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of seven cards, one random &ldquo;secret goal&rdquo; faction that the player attempts to guide to victory, and a set of &quot;temporary support&quot; cards. With these cards you secretly &ldquo;bid&rdquo; on the faction you believe will win the next month&rsquo;s scoring by having accumulated the most points.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: players simultaneously place one card each in the centre of the table, either towards the revolutionary forces, or as a traitor on the emperor's side adding this value to an &ldquo;Emperor card&rdquo; already placed in that location. This happens three times, but you are only allowed to place one of your three cards as a traitor. The week is then resolved and the player who provided the most support for the strongest faction puts aside one of his cards for this faction to be scored; in addition, this player is immediately awarded 2 extra points. The player who played the highest single card for this faction (not necessarily the same player!) is awarded 1 point. But beware - when the emperor (his card plus all traitors) gained more points than each single faction, the Emperor card is placed to the scoring! The table is cleared and the next week begins. After four weeks, a month is over and an intermediate scoring takes place. If you are correct with your prediction of this month&rsquo;s winner you gain another 6 points.&#10;&#10;After three months the final scoring occurs, determining the winner: the &ldquo;secret goals&rdquo; are revealed and the collected points of each player are added to the cards scored for their faction during the course of the game. The faction with the highest score wins the revolution - and the game. But: if the emperor can put down the rebellion - then the faction with the lowest score wins the game. Or, if the winning faction is too far ahead, it is immediately overthrown by all the others and the faction with the second highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player rules over a civilization in the ancient world, attempting exploits that will be remembered long after the civilization has withered. Each turn, players will select two action cards, which represent edicts delivered by the player to his populace, announcing what aspects of the empire he/she wishes to address:  building structures, implementing advances, migrating population, initiating combat, annexing new territories, instituting reforms to manage the empire&rsquo;s unrest, building trade routes, demanding tribute, and -- crucially &ndash;- recording Chronicles about his/her reign.&#10;&#10;The central element of the game's scoring system, Chronicle cards represent claims of great accomplishments.  To score a chronicle, the player must have a &quot;heritage&quot; level commensurate with the claim he/she is making:  claims of great works will only be believed and perpetuated if the player's civilization has established a reputation in the relevant civilization category (cultural, civil, or political).&#10;&#10;Actions generally require the payment of resources (crops or gold), and action costs correlate either to the player's empire size or the player's Unrest level.  Unrest increases when a player's territories become too crowded, or when a player re-uses an action card, or when a player voluntarily presses on his populace to squeeze additional productivity out of them.  Managing Unrest is a central concern for the player throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Players must strike the right balance between competition and peaceful interaction with their neighbors, to propel their civilizations from insignificant, forgettable kingdoms into empires worthy of the attention of historians!&#10;&#10;",

Otherwise, a player can choose to knock to end the round, after which each other player can take one final turn. No matter how the round ends, players then sum the value of cards in their hand.

If you don't have cards of this color or all the cards of this color are equal to or less than the number played, then you add these new cards to the stacks in front of you, with each color going into its own stack; if the number played is lower than the top card in a color stack, then you place all previously played cards of this color in front of you face down as penalty points, then start a new stack of this color with the cards just played.&#10;&#10;You then choose as many cards from the row of six as the value of the card(s) just played. The quantity of cards played doesn't matter &mdash; only the digit on those cards! Whether you play a single 1 or five 1s, you draw only one card. If you now have more than eight cards in hand, you must discard down to eight cards, keeping all discarded cards as penalty points.&#10;&#10;On a turn, after playing cards, you can choose to discard cards of a color to collect a mountain card in the same color that has a same or lower value. Thus, to collect a 4 blue mountain, you must discard four or more blue goat cards that you've collected in front of you.&#10;&#10;Once you've gone through the deck twice (with 3-5 players) or once (with two players), the game ends. You tally all mountain points you've collected, then lose 1 point for each penalty card in front of you. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

Only one player can point to each card. Once a player has chosen the right card, the turn stops. The player who finds the right card keeps it. Each card counts as a victory point. Players who were wrong give their cards to the active player. But if neither player gets the right card, the active player must return a previously won card.&#10;&#10;",

Players may bring additional certificates out from their initial deal, buy shares from the pool, or take a certificate from the draw pile, buying the share certificate they draw or placing it on the discard pile. If you have enough money, you can buy your way down through the discard pile to get what you really want.&#10;&#10;Each player tends to operate one or more companies from the start of the game, but it is easier to lose control if someone else gets the right certificates from the draw or discard piles. With no phases as such, tiles may be promoted from yellow to green to russet and grey at any time, as long as the usual sequence is observed.&#10;&#10;With less control over the shares you gain, the challenge is more to do with making the best of what you have been dealt rather than trying to follow your grand design.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description:&#10;In the year 42BCE, a mysterious magical force was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. The miasmic shockwave of pure otherworldly magic spread outward from a point somewhere in the middle east, and in a few short hours plunged the entire globe into chaos. In those terrible moments, human civilization changed forever. &#10;&#10;Magic infused their very bones, manifested in their children, came unbidden to the fingertips of their women, and plagued their countryside in uncontrolled bursts of power. Ordinary beasts of the wilderness were turned by these bursts into fanciful creatures of legend. Entire tribes of humans from all corners of the world were altered by the flood of uncontrolled magic, changing before the very eyes of their friends and neighbors into elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, centaurs, and even minotaurs. Creatures that normally existed between our reality and others were shunted into this one, leaving ghosts, faeries, and other magical creatures stranded in our world in ways they were never intended to be. Even remnants of the Old World, gods of the ancients and their ken, were awakened from their immortal slumber through this great cataclysm to trouble mankind once more.&#10;&#10;The world had changed forever.&#10;&#10;The year is now 37BCE and the middle-east sits at the center of a vast struggle to control humanity&rsquo;s fate. Three powerful nations have harnessed the power unleashed by the day of chaos, and they struggle to claim dominance over the known world. Their arcane legions are now yours to control.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;If you ever wondered what happened to the guys from WizKids just take a look at this game and you will know what they have been doing with the downtime after WizKids closed their doors.&#10;&#10;Players each field &quot;bases&quot; of variable sizes (Sortie/small and Formation/large) with individual figures inserted into starting positions on the base. The goal is to control victory point areas and inflict losses on the opponent. Movement and battle resolution are conducted through a unique formation management mechanic that allows players to move figures around on the unit bases to increase either movement/melee/ranged combat at the cost of losing capabilities in the other areas.&#10;&#10;Currently wrapping up play-testing as of May 2009. Arcane Legions will be available in September of 2009. Initially, look for 3 different factions (Egyptians, Romans, and Han Dynasty).&#10;&#10;Figures are highly detailed true 25mm made from PVC 105. Common figures are unpainted with colored tempo prints on banners and shields, while all the uncommon, rare and Commander figures (Booster Pack contents) are fully pre-painted. The game is designed to use both types. There are 9 different unpainted common figures for each faction and at least 20 different fully painted premium figures for each faction. If you buy a legion bundle of a faction you receive around 70 prepainted figures, whereas buying one of each army pack gets you about 54 unpainted figures.&#10;&#10;With more than 110 figures, the Starter Pack includes small armies for all three factions and enough formation bases, sortie bases and base cards for a complete two player game.  The Army Packs contain 40 common soldiers.  The Cavalry Packs contain 15 mounted figures.  The Booster Packs contain 5-10 (depending on the size) Leader / special figures and their associated base cards, plus five additional formation base cards for use with figures from the Army and Cavalry Packs.&#10;&#10;All Arcane Legions products (with the exception of the Starter) can be purchased faction specific.&#10;&#10;",

Five courageous tribes have set out to conquer new lands: the Huns, the Langobardens, the Goths, the Anglo Saxons, and the Vandals. As you seek new settlement areas for your tribe, you'll strengthen it by enlarging clans, establishing or conquering new countries, and building a powerful sea presence. Whoever scores the most points will stand far ahead of others on the tribe leader path and win the game.&#10;&#10;Origo is a family game for 2-5 players from ages 10 and up, in which luck and tactics are mixed well. Depending on the number of players, the game duration is 30-90 minutes.&#10;&#10;The flow of the game is driven by cards on the one hand (expanding, attacking) and by the movement of figures on the boards on the other (hiking, sailing). The player whose turn it is carries out the following actions in any sequence: expanding, attacking, hiking, sailing. Whoever occupies the final field in a country founds that country and receives points. There are further points in three large tribe evaluations during the game for the largest tribes, control of the seas, and control of the countries.&#10;&#10;The game is, in many aspects, very similar to Captain Future&#10;&#10;",

Flying from cloud to cloud and from surprise to surprise searching precious stars, an unexpected journey awaits.&#10;&#10;The Little Prince: Rising to the Stars brings you in a journey from the Grandfather's house to the Little Prince's planet. It is a point-to-point movement game, in which your goal is to collect stars.&#10;&#10;You move your plane by playing one of the fox cards in your hand, and every player starts with the same set of cards (eight cards numbered 1-5, with duplicates of 2, 3 and 4). Whoever is farthest back on the path to the Little Prince's planet is the active player, and this player plays one card from hand, moving at least one cloud and up to the number of clouds shown on the card. If you land on a star cloud, you take a star from the reserve; if you land on a telescope cloud, you flip one of the tokens at Grandfather's house to see what happens; if you land on a bird cloud, you take one card from Grandfather's deck, which provide different types of movement. If you arrive on a cloud where an opponent's plane sits, you take a card at random from that opponent's hand and give him in return a card of your choice.&#10;&#10;When you cross one of the three connecting boards, you take one of the story tiles next to it, with these tiles holding 1-5 stars. Collect both the fox and Little Prince, and you earn eight stars for this pair instead of only two.&#10;&#10;If you manage to make it all the way to the Little Prince's planet &mdash; and you'll need to pick up extra movement cards in order to do so &mdash; you receive a star-filled paper plane, with the quickest players receiving the most stars. In the end, whoever collects the most stars wins.&#10;&#10;",

Once players have placed all their dice or have chosen to pass for the round, each biome is resolved.&#10;&#10;The player who first placed dice in a particular biome gains priority and reaps the rewards of doing so: selecting a resource first, and discarding a resource to thwart their opponents' plans. However, if another player places more of their biome dice in that same biome, that player gains priority. Once priority order has been established for the biome, players each claim resources to feed their nestlings and gain the matching segment to add to their resource ring on their player board.&#10;&#10;Once all biomes have been resolved &ndash; including the wild grasslands biome in the center of the board &ndash; players score points based on how many nestlings they fed and how many segments are in their resource ring, regardless of which round they were assigned.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, the tension rises as players must make key decisions along the way, decisions that could secure victory or usher in defeat. Will they feed their nestlings for more immediate points, or take a different resource to complete a section of their resource ring, thus earning a bonus and triggering a powerful chain reaction? Will they use in-game currency to activate another end-of-game nest goal or save it for victory points? Will they place a second die to secure priority or risk it and head to another biome to take other much-needed scraps?&#10;&#10;At the conclusion of round four, the game ends and players reveal their endgame nest goals and tally their points.&#10;&#10;",

The twist here is that the counters are placed in a series of 5 boards of differing size that are formed to make a pyramid, hence the name &lsquo;Quinamid&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple, with any one of  3 options available to the player : &#10;a)    Place a counter in a vacant space&#10;b)    Rotate a board (including those boards &lsquo;above&rsquo; it) through 90 degrees&#10;c)    Move a board (including those boards &lsquo;above&rsquo; it) one &lsquo;position&rsquo; in any orthogonal direction.&#10;&#10;An important rule is that the subsequent player may neither move NOR rotate a board which was moved or rotated by the preceding player.&#10;&#10;Players take it in turns to make their move until one of them reveals a line of 5 counters, this being in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction.&#10;&#10;As players use option c) above they will &lsquo;cover&rsquo; boards below, thereby hiding the contents. It follows therefore that there is a bit of memory required to recall what was under the various boards if you are to use it to your advantage.&#10;&#10;A game is often completed in 2 or 3 minutes so replay value is high. It is often better to play a &lsquo;best of 5&rsquo; series to employ different strategies, so that would take around 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;The game should appeal to players aged 8-80. It could be played whilst waiting for a meal to be prepared or as a post-prandial diversion with other players spectating and giving out &lsquo;advice&rsquo; ! Easy until they themselves have a go !!&#10;&#10;Components are sturdy, with the counters and boards being made of good quality wood, and the package comes in a nice wooden presentation box of dimensions 7&rdquo; x 7&rdquo;, making it portable and suitable to be played on the train, the beach or at picnics.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net (real time or turn based, AI option)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Space Mission, players explore eight planets (randomly selected from twelve in the game) by flying from planet to neighboring planet or passing through a &quot;jump gate&quot; that allows them to travel anywhere. Each planet has a different combination of values for jumping to it, scanning it and landing on it.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of five cards, with each card having three color-coded values on it: blue for jumping, green for scanning, and orange for landing. On a turn, you take two actions from six possibilities, with the same action being possible:&#10;&#10;&mdash;Top up: Discard any number of cards (including zero), then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Jump: Move your spaceship from the jump gate (where players start the game) or a planet to any other planet by discarding a card that shows the landing value of the target planet. Place one of your tokens on the jump gate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Fly: Move your spaceship to either neighboring planet; this move is free.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Scan: Discard a card with the scanning value of the planet where your spaceship is currently located; look through the face-down planet tiles, place one aside face-down with your marker on it, then return the tiles to that planet. This action is possible only on undeveloped planets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Develop: Develop the planet where your spaceship is located by discarding two cards that match the two landing values shown on that planet. Mark this planet with your space station token, hand out all scanned and claimed planet tiles to the appropriate players, claim one remaining planet tile for yourself, then place the remaining tiles face-down again. A planet can be developed only once.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Discover: Take a planet tile of your choice from the developed planet where your spaceship is currently located.&#10;&#10;If at any point, all of the planet tiles on a planet show only empty space, the player holding the tiles lays them face-up next to that planet. When 6-12 space tiles have been revealed, an amount based on the number of players, the game ends and players tally their points.&#10;&#10;Each type of planet tile scores in a different way. With Minerals, for example, you multiply the number of mineral tiles you hold with the largest number of mineral tiles in a single color. Medals are worth three points each. A green-blue pair of Matter tiles is worth seven points, while a single Matter tile is worth only two. Each space station you've built is worth three points, and the players score 9, 6, 3 and 1 for having the most, secondmost, etc. tokens on the jump gate. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Jump Gate&#10;&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;",
