    "Description": "&quot;Bugs&quot; is a tactical-level wargame with six asymmetrical factions that models episodes in the lives of various insect species. In addition, this game system is designed to include new expansions, where factions of other phyla can be introduced, for example: reptiles.&#10;The rules weight can vary, being suitable to a broad range of ages and war game knowledge, so it can be played by both children who are learning to count (4+) and more experienced wargamers.&#10;In educational terms, this game aims to alert the community to the difficulties that animals face every day, and will increasingly face thanks to global warming. The game has a mechanic that simulates, by increasing the difficulty, possible future scenarios in which food is scarce, and weather conditions will be less favorable.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dominion: Seaside is an expansion to both Dominion and Dominion: Intrigue. As such, it does not contain material for a complete game.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box: &quot;All you ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by. And someone who knows how to steer ships using stars. You finally got some of those rivers you'd wanted, and they led to the sea. These are dangerous, pirate-infested waters, and you cautiously send rat-infested ships across them, to establish lucrative trade at far-off merchant-infested ports. First, you will take over some islands, as a foothold. The natives seem friendly enough, crying their peace cries, and giving you spears and poison darts before you are even close enough to accept them properly. When you finally reach those ports you will conquer them, and from there you will look for more rivers.&#10;&#10;One day, all the rivers will be yours.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dominion: Seaside (Second Edition) contains nine new types of Kingdom cards, which will be released on their own as an update pack for those who own the first edition of this expansion. A few cards will receive minor errata, but these will not appear in the update pack.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A 'hybrid board/app' tactical air combat game for two players that runs on a 'simultaneous turn by turn' basis over a board of hexagons. (Print n' Play)&#10;&#10;This unique system allows you to apprehend the flow of an air engagement (dogfight) in a dynamic and realistic way. Hands on throttle-and-stick, you manoeuver to get into your opponent's six, or to get out of the pursuit! It's a duel of minds in which the most experienced pilot will certainly win.&#10;&#10;A bomber is not able to turn its nose as fast as a fighter and the latter does not have the same turn rate at different airspeeds. In this game, each aircraft has a specific flight model (energy management chart) which you can study to integrate its strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the resolution of offensive actions takes into account the actual position/attitude of the planes and evasive manoeuvres to determine success.&#10;&#10;The app contains the game manual, the scenarios, a link to the pdf document to print and shape and the user interface to easily select and present your choices.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents 8 seconds of flight time, which allows complex manoeuvres such as Immelmann, Split S, High yo-yo or Barrel rolls to be performed in sequence.&#10;&#10;The game features 20 skirmish scenarios (involving up to 8 airplanes) that include air-to-air and/or air-to-ground objectives, 5 aircraft types (fighter, interceptor, ground attack, bomber, transport) and 11 weapon/action types (cannon, missiles, bombs, countermeasures,...). Each scenario offers a number of points to be won by each team, the one that has won the most points wins the battle.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Inside this container are twenty wooden discs, two each of ten colors, and you can see these discs inside the thicket through 29 cut-out slots. However, the thicket is designed so that five of the discs will fall into grooves at the bottom of the vertical container, and the discs in these grooves will be hidden by a piece of cardboard underbrush so that they are not visible until you remove the underbrush during play. Ten animals in the colors of the discs are set up in the center of the playing area within reach of all players. Each player also has a stack of nine tiles that when placed together form a picture.&#10;&#10;Each round, one player shakes the thicket face down so that no one can see which discs are going where, then they stand the thicket upright on the table. Everyone then grabs for the animals that they think are hiding in the underbrush, that is, the animals that can be seen only once through the cut-out slots &mdash; or possibly not seen at all.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has grabbed all the animals that they wish to, remove the underbrush to see which animals are actually there. If you grabbed an animal that is in the underbrush, reveal one of your picture tiles, and if that animal is in the underbrush twice, reveal two picture tiles instead. If by mistake you grabbed an animal that is not in the underbrush, you must return a picture tile to the bottom of your stack. Keep playing rounds until one or more players have revealed all of their tiles, completed their picture, and won.&#10;&#10;",

To have any chance at the win, players must balance strong dice-rolling with strategic action card playing.&#10;&#10;2-5 players are given 3 rolls per round to achieve familiar dice combinations like Large Straight, 4-of-a-kind, and Full House. The player with the best roll at the end of a round wins a point AND and action card. With 10 different action card types, players can use cards to steal dice from their opponents, skip their opponents' turn, and even make their opponent &quot;respect the ones&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After being cut off and isolated in mid-February 1945, the German garrison at Breslau, some 50,000 men, defied all odds holding onto the city for almost a week AFTER Berlin fell! Hitler had ordered the city be held at all costs, believing Soviet forces tied up there were thus not taking part in any assault on Berlin. The defending garrison finally surrendered just days before the war officially ended (with the Gauleiter in charge fleeing the city by air to escape capture).&#10;&#10;Taking the city fell to the Soviet Sixth Army, comprised of some eight divisions with 80,000 men between them, plus four tank regiments and two artillery divisions. An entire Air Army, the Second, was also assigned to provide ample destructive power from the sky. The task facing the Soviets was daunting; urban warfare plus a very determined defender. Terrain too was critical - the Oder River flowing through the city sliced it up into many parts. Taking a major sector of the city could mean nothing more than occupying an &quot;island&quot; in the end.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

That would be scaled back to just the hybrid conversions of Ise and Hyuga, but not in the Golden Journal.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the Americans drafted plans of their own (which still exist) to convert the hulls of Iowa-class battleships, Alaska-class large cruisers and Baltimore-class heavy cruisers into aircraft carriers. When it became clear that plenty of Essex-class carriers would join the fleet before those conversions could be made, the project was dropped (except for the conversion of nine Cleveland-class light cruisers).&#10;&#10;Battleship-Carriers includes 20 new &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces, 10 of them Japanese, 10 of them American, all of them our standard, beautiful die-cut and silky-smooth tiny works of art.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Several weeks after the German invasion of Poland, she began to attack Allied merchant shipping. British and French warships scoured the South Atlantic in search of the German cruiser.&#10;&#10;After sinking nine merchant vessels totaling just over 50,000 tons&rsquo; displacement, Admiral Graf Spee steamed to the waters off Argentina&rsquo;s River Plate estuary. Instead of more undefended shipping, she found three British cruisers. Despite the heavier guns of the German ship, Admiral Graf Spee lost the encounter and fled for the neutral port of Montevideo, where her crew scuttled the ship.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

His vehicle included caterpillar tracks and a revolving turret with a 37mm gun, and looked very modern for its time. The War Ministry declined to accept it, but we&rsquo;re not limited by such thinking.&#10;&#10;Imperial &amp; Royal Panzers is a variant for Infantry Attacks: Fall of Empires, with the Burstyn Motorgesch&uuml;tz and some other early attempts at armored vehicles like the Austro-Daimler armored car. But most of all, it gives you Austro-Hungarian tanks. In 1914.&#10;&#10;It comes with 24 new die-cut, silky-smooth playing pieces. You also get a set of scenarios to turn these proto-panzers loose against the Russians (who do have those 76.2mm field guns, so this it&rsquo;s no walkover).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player may place a maximum of: 1 Linebacker, 1 Defender, and 1 Attacker. If, during the game, all 3 tiles a player draws are Instant Action tiles, he may use the Player Substitution rule.

During the course of the game, a player may make as many Player Substitutions as he has Football Player tiles. If a Football Player tile is removed from the board, it goes to the discard pile of the player who placed it on the board. If more than one player uses Futbolists during a game, each player marks the Futbolist he plays with a spare HQ damage token.&#10;You can still use the Unlucky Draw rule when playing with Futbolists.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Note: You cannot use Futbolists while playing Factions: Dancer, Mephisto, Death Breath.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Przed rozpocz&#196;&#153;ciem rozgrywki, ka&#197;&#188;dy gracz mo&#197;&#188;e umie&#197;&#155;ci&#196;&#135; odkryte &#197;&#188;etony Futbolist&oacute;w obok stosu &#197;&#188;eton&oacute;w swojej Frakcji*.

    "Description": "San Francisco, 1970: A quiet commune, a rock band and a tough motorcycle club are united by their love of music and mind-expanding drugs. Together they want to revive the legendary Woodstock Festival. But when the commune's guru is murdered, it's all over with Love, Peace and Happiness.&#10;&#10;The host invites his guests to a communal dinner, where everyone assumes the role of a murder suspect. One of the guests has committed the murder, but they all have secrets they'd rather keep to themselves. Over three rounds, they try to get behind the secrets of the other players without making themselves suspects. The common goal is to solve the murder case - or get away with the bloody deed.&#10;&#10;A game of Deadly Dinner consists of three rounds, in which each player gets new secret information about the crime. Players must discuss their information and clues as a group in order to identify the perpetrator in the end. To prepare, each player should receive their character's starting information a few days before playing the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Austrian mountain brigades had the advantages of numbers and firepower, but fierce Montenegrin resistance kept the kingdom unconquered until January 1916.&#10;&#10;Infantry Attacks: Black Mountain includes 88 die-cut and silky-smooth playing pieces, including Austro-Hungarian and Montenegrin troops, leaders and weapons plus the markers needed for play.

    "Description": "Even weeks before Trafalgar, by August 1805 the newly crowned Emperor Napoleon Ier, had come to understand his plans required action on land. More specifically, he had to defeat his continental enemies in order to secure his continued power. Britain, Russia and Austria were allied against him and, since he couldn&rsquo;t get at the British on their island fortress, and Russia was too far away to allow for the required quick victory, he was left with invading Austria.&#10;&#10;Rapidly surrounding and capturing the main Austrian Army at Ulm, December found Napoleon at Austerlitz (modern day Skavkov u Brna) in southern Moravia at the end of a very stretched supply line. He also appeared to be slightly outnumbered by an Coalition army made up of the remnants of Austrian forces, plus a sizable Russian contingent. Feigning weakness, Napoleon lured the Coalition force into attacking his right flank (where he wanted them to), then counterpunched through the Coalition center to encircle most of them. The Coalition were crushed, and through the victory, Napoleon cemented his hold on the throne. It was a crowning glory.&#10;&#10;This two-player grand-tactical simulation by Ty Bomba presents the battle generally considered to have been Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory. Both players have the opportunity to attack and defend, but the main burden of the offensive resides with the French player. His opponent, the Allied player, commands the Austrian and Russian units. Each hexagon on the map represents 600 yards (549 meters) from side to opposite side. The units are brigades and divisions. Each full turn represents one hour of &lsquo;real time.&rsquo;&#10;&#10;Published in Against The Odds #57&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player holds a hand of eight white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes more) to the round boss, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The round boss determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent a point, and then the player to the left of the Round Boss becomes the new Boss for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, or until they are thrown out of the pub, at which point the player with the most Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Kampf gegen das Spie&szlig;ertum: Travel Edition contains 400 brand-new Cards. 100 yellow and 300 white cards are enough to play with friends.

Both of Robert&rsquo;s brothers, Stannis and Renly, have each decided it is their turn to rule. This has torn House Baratheon in two as half has thrown in with Stannis while the other half backs Renly. With House Baratheon&rsquo;s great resources, each still has a chance to be the next to rule from King&rsquo;s Landing.&#10;&#10;The Baratheon Attachments #1 box set for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Baratheon players a host of new options when they&rsquo;re building their armies, whether it&rsquo;s for Stannis or Renly. Some of the Unit Attachments will work for both brothers, while others can only be added to particular forces. Either way, these new options will bolster House Baratheon&rsquo;s already well-equipped troops, making their armor tougher, their speed faster, or letting them last even longer on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

That is, however, very much not the case. While their Frozen Shore Chariots aren&rsquo;t the most sturdy of constructs, they work well enough to usher those bold enough to ride them into battle. More than capable of bashing their way through enemy ranks due to sheer mass and speed alone, these engines of war are a formidable foe to face.&#10;&#10;The Frozen Shore Chariot Box Set gives Free Folk Players in the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game a new warmachine for their army. Like cavalry models, this unit can make a free Maneuver Action at the start of its activation, letting it get into position for one of its deadly charges. They hit like an avalanche, getting extra power and taking out concentrated enemy units with ease.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
