These updated scenarios have not previously seen print in ASL form, although two have been available for download from the MMP website. They range from the beginning of World War II in Poland through the Russian offensive in the Ukraine across the Dnieper River, following the Battle of Kursk in 1943.&#10;&#10;Turning the Tide&rsquo;s scenarios feature the forces of Poland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, France, Britain, Greece, Russia (and Russian partisans), and the United States all battling Germany. Scenarios take place in both night and day, winter and summer, and involve cavalry, motorcycles, air support, parachutes, and gliders as well as armor clashes and infantry battles. Most take place in the countryside, but there are actions in cities and towns as well as forests and mountains, and some involve seizing bridges over rivers and canals.&#10;&#10;The majority of the scenarios can be played with just boards 1-5, and only two require a board that was not part of the original SL-GI system. None of these scenarios use overlays.&#10;&#10;Whether you cut your teeth on Cross of Iron or picked up Beyond Valor for the first time yesterday; whether you prefer Matildas vs. PzKpfw IIs or T 34s vs. PzKpfw IVs; Turning the Tide&rsquo;s array of interesting scenarios has something for you.&#10;&#10;Twenty-five years in the making, and a true labor of love from the original ASL grognard Jim Stahler, Turning the Tide is the penultimate step in converting SL-GI scenarios to ASL. We are already working with Jim on a follow-on scenario bundle to cover September 1943 through May 1945 to complete the ASL updating process.&#10;&#10;A fairly complete list of all original Squad Leader scenarios and their ASL scenario numbers and publication data can be found at:&#10;http://tacticalwargamer.com/boardgames/squadleader/squadleaderscenarios.htm&#10;&#10;The scenarios in Turning the Tide are:&#10;&#10;U14 Sacrifice of Polish Armor &#10;U15 Battle for the Warta Line &#10;U16 Under Cover of Darkness &#10;U17 Resistance at Chabrehez &#10;U18 Assault on a Queen &#10;U19 Hasty Pudding &#10;U20 Fighting at World's Edge &#10;U21 The French Perimeter &#10;U22 Road to Kozani Pass &#10;U23 Rehearsal for Crete &#10;U24 Traverse Right..Fire! &#10;U25 Breakout from Borisov &#10;U26 Bald Hill &#10;U27 A Winter Melee &#10;U28 Sowchos 79 &#10;U29 Night Battle at Noromaryevka &#10;U30 Swatting at Tigers &#10;U31 The Front in Flames &#10;U32 Disaster on the Dnieper Loop &#10;U33 The Bukrin Bridgehead&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Fanatic Enterprises web site:&#10;&#10;FANATIC PACK #1 features 12 scenarios on card stock. Each scenario has been thoroughly playtested and balanced for your enjoyment. Here are summaries of the actions depicted:&#10;&#10;FE1 A Victory for Early Polish Armor: It is 1920 and the Russian army is invading the fledgling country. But the tough Polish Army is going to fight for its independence with every tool it possesses. You want tin can action? Here it is! Uses boards 46 and 11 and requires use of Axis Minor and Italian counters.&#10;&#10;FE2 Dans La Bataille, Pour La Patrie: May 1940, the French have their one opportunity to crush the German assault. The successful attack through the Ardennes is moving to the sea, cutting the French in half. However, this gives the French a singular opportunity for counterattack. Can DeGaulle marshal his forces for an effective attack? Requires board 12 and 4 and the French and German counters.&#10;&#10;FE3 The Border Forts: November 1940 was a very bad month for Mussolini. His attack in Greece was failing, his battle fleet was heavily damaged at Taranto and his airforce was taking a beating in England. Only in the far deserts of East Africa was he enjoying any victory. Uses boards 27 and 31 and requires Italian and British Counters.&#10;&#10;FE4 Whirling Dervishes: February 1941 finds the newly formed Free French Army looking for a way to contribute to the Allied cause. Bold action is taken from the colony of Camaroon. Using odds and ends of vehicles they traverse the desert and surround an isolated Italian fort. The defenders hang on until the cavalry arrive in the form of an Auto Saharan Company. Uses boards 26 and 28 and requires Italian and French counters.&#10;&#10;FE 5 Beyond the Call of Duty: its April 1941 and the Germans are preparing to invade Yugoslavia. Just before the invasion assault troops cross the border and attack the fortifications along the frontier. Requires board 11 and 18 and uses Allied Minor and German Counters.&#10;&#10;FE6: Cavalry Charge at Mussino: During the crucial battle in front of Moscow in November 1941, the Soviets are boosted by the arrival of Mongolian Cavalry units from the far east. However the cavalry would pay dearly in this action as they assault the dug-in German guns in a bloody cavalry charge. Uses boards 19 and 42 and Russian and German counters.&#10;&#10;FE 7 Quick and Dirty: It is the Spring of 1942 and the Japanese have released their own form of Blitzkrieg covering much of the globe with their power. March finds them invading Java and in this opening skirmish a Japanese reconnaissance patrol races a Dutch force to capture a bridge. Uses Board 47 and Japanese and Allied Minor counters.&#10;&#10;FE 8 Soebang Serenade: The only major armor clash of the Dutch East Indies Campaign occurred at Soebang on March 2, 1942. The counterattacking Dutch run into Japanese forces consolidating their control near the Soebang airfield and a melee ensues. Uses boards 24, 37 and 38 and uses Japanese and Allied Minor counters.&#10;&#10;FE 9: Blackforce Counterattack: British and Japanese tangle in this PTO action. British armor and infantry slug it out as the Japanese try to protect their bridgehead. Uses boards 38 and 40 and British and Japanese counters.&#10;&#10;FE 10: An Abandoned Army: The surrender of Allied forces on Java did not end the fighting in the Dutch East Indies. A desperate force of Dutch and native troops struggles to hang together on the island of Sumatra. The Japanese are poised to crush them along with the help of the locals. An Urban Guerrilla for the PTO with partisan units popping out of nowhere to attack the Dutch. Uses board 32 and Japanese and Allied Minor units along with partisan counters.&#10;&#10;FE11: Italian Winter: The German SS Police force was a fearsome and tough group. This action covers a battle between the SS Police force using captured T-34's against a dug in Italian partisan force with some tricks of their own. Uses board 50 along with Italian, German and Russian counters.&#10;&#10;FE 12: Once More into the Breach: Late in the war the Germans were desperate. Attacked from all sides they threw what they could at the tidal wave of Russians attacking from everywhere. This action covers a rescue operation as the SS try to reach a surround group of SS before they can be annihilated&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Advanced Squad Leader&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A new &quot;Mix and Match Explore&quot; power allows a player to combine the explore cards with their hand before discarding.  Three new start worlds increase the number of start worlds to 12 and allow players a choice of a military or non-military start world.  New goals are also included.

    "Description": "In June 1919, 11 battleships, five battle cruisers, eight light cruisers and 50 destroyers of the German High Seas Fleet attempted to scuttle themselves in the British anchorage at Scapa Flow. Most of the crews succeeded, and the enraged Allied Powers soon stripped Germany of her remaining modern warships as well.&#10;&#10;The mass sinking at Scapa Flow did clear up one diplomatic flashpoint: Some American naval staff officers feared they would be incorporated into the Royal Navy and used in an Anglo-American conflict. As punishment for the German act of defiance, the Allies seized all remaining German dreadnought battleships and modern cruisers, plus 400,000 tons of floating cranes and drydocks and other equipment and all submarines. Germany's new Wiemar Republic would have to build its new Reichsmarine around a core of aging ships already docked as obsolete by the old Imperial Navy.&#10;&#10;Reichsmarine is a Great War at Sea supplement exploring the alternate history possibilities had the High Seas Fleet not been scuttled. Just like Second World War at Sea: Imperial &amp; Royal Navy, it comes as a .pdf download: You get everything right away, but you will have to assemble the playing pieces yourself. It has everything you expect in a naval game supplement: scenarios, ship data sheets, and playing pieces.&#10;&#10;The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by the Royal Navy or Weimar Germany. The ships lost at Scapa Flow are all present in British colors; those surrendered afterwards are in the colors of Weimar Germany. Plus, one-inch &quot;long&quot; pieces are provided for Royal Navy destroyer leaders. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Jutland, Mediterranean, U.S. Navy Plan Gold and Sea of Troubles to enjoy all of the scenarios.&#10;&#10;Reichsmarine is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut-and-mounted, nor are the scenario book or the ship data printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Babel each player gets ten cards and trades cards with the other players in an attempt to form poker combinations. When a player has a good enough hand - two five-card combinations which are high enough, or a ten-card straight or flush - they go out. When a player reaches a certain target score the game ends.&#10;&#10;With three to five players a single deck is used and players all sit at the same table. Trading is free-form and players may trade unequal numbers of cards. If trading bogs down and all players agree, they all draw one card from the deck but do not discard any (obviously not possible with five players). A player must have two combinations of flushes or better (or a ten-card set) to go out; when a player goes out the hand ends and all players score. Combinations lower than flush still score for the players not going out. If players drew extra cards only ten can be scored.&#10;&#10;With more than five players multiple decks are used and the game is played as a party game with players circulating around the room. All trades must be equal since no extra cards can be drawn. When a player has two combinations of straight or better (or a ten-card set) they can take their hand to be scored and get a fresh hand. Pairs and triplets are not scored. This version is called Super-Babel in some editions.&#10;&#10;",

This is a simple race game based on the strip, for up to four players.&#10;&#10;The strip centered around Jiggs, an Irishman who comes into wealth in the United States. Even so, he still wants to keep his old pals and eat corned beef and cabbage at Dinty Moore's tavern, much to the consternation of his bourgeois wife, Maggie. The constant warfare between them is the source of much of the humor.&#10;&#10;The game features the strip's characters as playing pieces and their surroundings as the playing board.&#10;&#10;",

To roll a d9, roll a d10 normally, but treat the 10 as a zero.&#10;- Printouts of the ship combat record for each ship participating in the battle&#10;- A battle mat marked in hexes large enough to accommodate your ship models/counters.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to be simple to learn and fast paced, yet still provide an engaging tactical experience that will provide countless hours of fun.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to destroy your enemy&rsquo;s fleet. The cylons accomplish that by hanging back with their carriers and sending wave after wave of missiles and fighters at the colonial fleet, possibly accompanied by Cylon battleships, trying to overwhelm the Colonial defenses.&#10;&#10;Conversely, the colonials want to get in as close as possible to the cylon base carriers so that they can pound them into so much scrap with their powerful rail guns.&#10;You may also wish to create scenarios with other objectives as well, perhaps based on sequences from the show, such as the battle at Ragnar Station, or simply scenarios you dream up yourself.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Card Bowl reproduces the game of football using standard playing cards.&#10;&#10;The game balances strategy and chance, and almost anything that happens in a real football game can happen in Card Bowl, including runs, passes, sacks, fumbles, interceptions, punts, field goals, etc.&#10;&#10;Special teams plays&#10;&#10;Cards representing different values are simply drawn in a certain order, and modifiers applied to determine results (e.g. spot where kickoff is received and yardage returned).&#10;&#10;Scrimmage plays - Version 1 (Complex)&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt eleven cards representing players, and spreads them out on the table in formation, face down. The cards are then moved and turned over in a generally specified manner and order, in alternating turns, which represents the development of the play. In addition, at certain points of action, cards are turned over from the remaining deck, which represent the element of chance and the unanticipated dynamics of the game.&#10;&#10;The scrimmage play evolves around match-ups between offensive and defensive cards, with the values and modifiers determining the outcome. Multiple cards on each side plus drawn cards may be involved in one match-up.&#10;&#10;At some point during one of its turns, the offensive player executes a play (e.g. hands off the ball, throws a pass). Cards from each hand that are directly involved in the play are then added along with drawn cards, and the offensive and defensive values are compared to determine the outcome.&#10;&#10;The scrimmage plays can actually replicate the flow and dynamics of a real play.&#10;&#10;The game does require a lot of addition, so being able to add quickly is also helpful.&#10;&#10;Scrimmage plays - Version 2 (Simplified)&#10;&#10;Each team has its own deck of cards (of course team playing cards would be ideal). A third deck is used as the neutral Draw Deck. For each play from scrimmage, each player selects four cards from his own deck. After each play, these four cards are placed in that player's used card pile, and can't be used again until the deck is exhausted. Thus the entire deck is used in 13 plays, then each player starts over with the whole deck.&#10;&#10;For each play, each player places four cards from his deck face down representing players. The cards are all turned face up, and the offense chooses which card/player the play goes to based on the type of play he wants to run and the most advantageous matchup. Additional cards are then drawn from the Draw Deck and added to each player's side of the matchup. Cards involved in the play are then added along with drawn cards, and the offensive and defensive values are compared to determine the outcome. Fumbles, sacks, incomplete passes and interceptions can occur.&#10;&#10;For complete instructions, play diagrams and change history, see Web Links.&#10;&#10;",

I&rsquo;d never seen a Panther before, and hearing it clanking up put the fear into me, right to my toes. They hit us hard and fast, knocked us dead. Fierce, them SS Krauts. Even though they were people just like us, scared all to Hell, they fought like no one else. That was The Bulge to me; freezing cold, Kraut tanks, and horror. Horror all around me. Even when we started winning.&rdquo; &#10;-Conversation with Lee Johnson, 391st Engineers, Ardennes veteran.&#10;&#10;On December 16th, 1944, three German Panzer Armies hurled themselves at surprised Allied lines in the Ardennes area. This desperate bid to drive to the English Channel for a second time, attempting to recapture the port of Antwerp and forcing the Allies to sue for peace, would be called The Battle of the Bulge. In the end, this massive offensive would fail, costing the Germans the war. But it could have gone differently. PEIPER AT THE GATES is a mini-campaign of branching linked scenarios set during the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper and the 1st SS Panzer Division towards the Meuse River.&#10;&#10;Smash through all opposition as the Germans, capturing the bridges at Trios Ponts and driving into the American far-rear. Hold the Panzer advance at Stavelot, stopping them cold with a small rag-tag band of American fighting men. Fight the climatic battle of a lone King Tiger against massed Sherman tanks as Task Force McGeorge attacks the La Gleize Cauldron from the north. Play solo or with friends. Play the Germans. Play the Americans. But just play. The fate of the Western Front is in your hands.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike &quot;Snakes &amp; Ladders,&quot; players have (limited) movement choices during the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players spin a top to generate a random number, then consult a chart which gives them 2-4 movement options. If a player stops in a space which gives them points, they record these points on their chart.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the first to accumulate 100 points.&#10;&#10;This is the long predecessor to The Game of Life which is produced by the company that bears his name.&#10;&#10;",

These extra-large sized dice can be useful for stimulating many word and spelling games.&#10;&#10;This guide is not intended to be a comprehensive set of notes for the dice, but rather an offering of a variety of games and activities which are sure to generate many more ideas by both you and your students.&#10;&#10;The set consists of 12 dice.  Two dice have only vowels printed on the six sides.  The other ten dice have a combination of consonants, vowels and blends printed on the six sides.  The letters are arranged on the die with the more commonly used letters appearing most often.  Following is a chart indicating how often each letter or blend appears in the set.&quot;&#10;&#10;a-4 &#10;b-2 &#10;c-2 &#10;ch-2&#10;ck-2&#10;d-2 &#10;e-6&#10;f-2&#10;g-2&#10;h-2&#10;i-2&#10;j-2&#10;k-2&#10;l-2&#10;m-2&#10;n-3&#10;o-4&#10;p-2&#10;qu-2&#10;r-4&#10;s-2&#10;sh-2&#10;t-2&#10;th-2&#10;u-3&#10;v-2&#10;w-2&#10;x-2&#10;y-2&#10;z-2&#10;&#10;Games suggested in the instructions:&#10;Make A Word (3 to 5 players)&#10;Write A Word (4 to 5 players)&#10;Nonsense Words or Not? (2 players)&#10;What's the Word? (4 to 5 players)&#10;along with other suggested games&#10;&#10;Interesting is the fact that the same letter has different values on different dice.  For example, the letter &quot;a&quot; has a value of 1, on the dice with all vowels (a,e,e,i,o,u) but the same letter &quot;a&quot; has a value of 3, on a mixed die with vowels and consonants (a,l,n,o,p,r).  Also, there are five blends:  ch (worth 5), ck (worth 6), qu (worth 6), sh (worth 5), and th (worth 5).&#10;&#10;",

It is interesting that this work pre-dates Games Workshop's Warmaster Ancients.&#10;&#10;From the introduction of this title:&#10;&#10;&#10;These rules are meant to supplement the Warmaster fantasy miniatures rules produced by Games Workshop, and incorporate the ancient rules supplement for that system developed by Stephen Hess. Our thanks to Mr. Hess for taking the time to assemble the basic troop types for the vast majority of troops available in the ancient period, as well as providing many prepared armies lists, and for graciously allowing me to directly incorporate his work into this piece. This supplement for Renaissance gaming is heavily dependent on the work done for the ancient period. Especially useful were the basic infantry, cavalry and elephant troop types. Rules incorporated here are elite, skirmishers, phalanx, warband, and camels. Stephen Hess&rsquo;s Ancientmaster rules supplement can be found on the web http://www.brumbaer.de/Wm/Ancients/index.html.&#10;&#10;&#10;Also included are guidelines for creating army lists from other sets which focus on this period, WRG 7th ed. &amp; DBR.  &#10;  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

This game is sure to be a hit with your family on vacations, camp outs, or an evening at home. English and Spanish instructions are included.&#10;&#10;Similar to the play in Rummy, players receive seven cards to begin and draw from the deck or discard pile to begin each turn. Player discards one card to signal the end of the turn. The object of the game is to collect groups of three houses of the same color or three houses at consecutive addresses on the same street. Players lay down collections to gain the 10 points on each of the cards. A player can match a fixer-upper house with a cash card for 25 points. There is an old fire station card and an old church card that can be played alone and worth 25 points each.&#10;&#10;Like Mille Bornes, this game has a few roadblocks. A player can play a Haunted House card or a Termite card on an opponent. The opponent cannot lay down any point cards until the proper remedy card is played, which is a Medium or Exterminator. If the player has the Home Inspection Team card displayed, the player is exempt from Termite or Ghost troubles.&#10;&#10;Hands end when a player runs out of cards. Don't get caught with a lot of points in your hand, as they are subtracted from the points you have collected on the table. Play continues until a player reaches 500 points.&#10;&#10;Learn more at www.tricasagame.com.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a different character and special power taken from a range of different neighbouring cultures. Players buy trade goods in far off markets to sell in the bazaars of Byzantium, while doing their utmost to undermine and obstruct their rivals and avoid the various historical hazards of the time. Players use Trader markers to purchase and move goods appearing across the board, avoiding dangerous local events and rival player skulduggery. Later in the game players can attempt to secure influential government roles worth bonus victory points but require each role to be voted upon by all players so bribery and deal making is a must! The player with the largest and most influential merchant empire at game end is given the title of Merchant Prince of Byzantium.&#10;&#10;",
