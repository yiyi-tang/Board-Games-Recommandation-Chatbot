This is a complete redesign of N30 I and N30 II at a more detailed scale.&#10;&#10;&quot;N30 portrays the morning blockades of November 30th. Two players represent the opposing sides; one represents protesters; the other represents the police, with their incident commanders, Assistant Chief Ed Joiner and Captain Jim Pugel. The protesters aim to show that non-violent direct action can work, show that networked organizations can defeat hierarchical ones, and bring media attention to the issues. The police try to break the blockades and allow the conference to open as planned.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Each turn represents 10 minutes. Each protester cluster represents 20-30 protesters, of whom 10-15 may be arrestables; each police hard or soft squad represents 10-15 police; each police mounted squad represents 6 police and each police chemical team represents 4 police (usually with 1 armored car). The police forces include most of the units of the Demonstration Management Team. They also include squads scrambled from the Convention Center venue (and/or other police units in the area).&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The 'brain' is made of three miniature TTL logic chips containing over 300 transistors, diodes, and many other components giving a vast computing capacity with a wide range of probabilities for conflict purposes.&quot;&#10;&#10;In essence, this is a straightforward  hex-map based battle game for up to four players playing individually or as teams. It contains plastic miniatures and a rectangular game board with pre-marked battlefield features. There are no battle cards or other modifiers apart from the handset. The game depends entirely upon the handset to determine the amount of movement and the result of any attack. The handset therefore replaces dice, but serves much the same function. However, players have the freedom to select position, and direction of movement, and the miniatures are marked with values that determine their firing power, and this has a bearing on the result of combat actions (see below).&#10;&#10;Each team deploys a regiment of 8 of tanks (slow moving, high fire power) and 4 armoured cars (fast moving, low fire power) in a pre-mapped fictive country on the game board (Kazaldis, Armania, Sarapan and Calderon) separated by marked national borders (which are red) and terrain features such as a river (with bridges), forests, mountains, and buildings. Each country also has a major city marked by a blue border. Inside the blue border several buildings are marked, into which tanks cannot move, meaning they must navigate the city to get to the enemy HQ or get out of their service/repair area and back into combat.&#10;&#10;The objective is simple: to win by occupying the opponent or opponents' headquarters by moving a tank (or armoured car) into the HQ space (pre-marked on the board), or by destroying all enemy tanks.&#10;&#10;Though the mechanic is therefore a fairly standard hex and counter skirmish, the computer in the handset ultimately drives the game.&#10;&#10;The handset consists of six small red bulbs, two buttons and three switches. The lights appear over six icons indicating conditions of movement (the computer determines 'movement points' which may be spent according to terrain features - for example moving through a city costs one movement point per movement but armoured cars moving in open country may move two spaces per movement point), result of firing, repair status and range of attack.&#10;&#10;The bulbs have three states - on, off, and flashing, each of which has a different meaning (see below). Of the three switches, one is a power switch. The other two switches determine the conditions of the 'roll' on any given player's turn. One indicates whether the player has opted to attack or retreat (the selection becomes a variable in the computer's calculation of the result), the other on whether the tank is moving or being repaired (tanks under repair cannot move or fire, but if the handset indicates that the service has been successful, the tank can move and fire in that turn).&#10;&#10;The handset also has two buttons: one red, one black. The black button is pressed for between 2 and 5 seconds to command the computer to run a computation cycle that will determine movement and repair status (depending on the switches). It will also secretly determine a firing result that will be shown if and when the player presses the 'fire' button (firing is optional).&#10;&#10;The red button is for firing. When a player wishes to fire, they press this button and the computer indicates the result of the firing action. If the bulb is fully lit, the result is a hit and the tank with the lower fire power is destroyed. In the case of equal firepower, the attacking tank is considered to have the advantage and destroys the defender. If the bulb flashes, the tank with the lower fire power is damaged and must be placed on a service space for repair. If the bulb stays dark, the attack has failed. According to the instructions &quot;When the computer is programmed for Assault the 'firing result' probability is expressed as a 50% chance of a Hit, 25% chance of Damage and 25% chance of a Miss, while the chance of a 'Service Ready' is 25%. When the computer is programmed for Retreat the 'firing result' probability is expressed as a 25% chance of a Hit, 25% chance of Damage and 50% chance of a Miss, while the chance of 'service ready' is 25%.&quot;&#10;&#10;Firing is further complicated by the game board and player actions though. A tank in open country can only fire at an enemy tank in a directly adjacent hex in front of or behind it, and it must turn to face in the direction it wishes to fire. Within city boundaries a tank may fire at an enemy in any hex in contact with the one it occupies, though it must again turn to face the target. Ranged firing (two spaces) is possible in open country, but is again a random result from the handset. A tank which is allowed a ranged attack by the handset may fire across lakes and rivers, but not mountains.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Assault Of The Ogroids is a computer moderated solo board game published in the May 1987 issue of Sinclair User magazine, a computer magazine for the 8-bit SInclair ZX Spectrum.&#10;&#10;The player takes the part of Deerfoot, a scout sent to gain aid for his city which is being besieged by the evil Ogroids.  The board is a rectangle 12 spaces by 15 spaces, and the player wins the game by traveling across the board within 30 hours.&#10;&#10;Every square entered takes a toll of the available time and the player's stamina.  There are five different types of terrain, and the random encounters include finding useful items, meeting unfriendly monsters, becoming lost or finding a quicker route to your eventual goal.  You lose once 30 game hours have passed, or if you are killed by a monster or other kind of encounter.&#10;&#10;The computer program is approximately 90 lines of BASIC. It randomises numbers for combat and for encounters met along the way, and also keeps a track of the gold and items held by the player.&#10;&#10;Gary Chalk designed the game and also illustrated it in a style familiar from the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; game books.&#10;&#10;",

You've got 8 pawns each, all in 1. (or 8.) row. You must capture maximum possible number of opponents pawns in your turn. To win, you must capture all of opponents pawns or to move all your pawns which still are on the board to the last row. Ties are rare, but possible. You must pay attention, because it's possible to lose more than 5 pawns in one move, even if it doesn't look like. Easy to learn, hard (or maybe impossible) to perfect.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The basic unit is the battalion, usually comprised of three stands of infantry or three vehicles. The basic command formation would be (depending on nation/year) a Brigade or Division. Each Brigade/Division has an attached commander, and each side has a CinC stand. Commanders have Leadership ratings which influence initiative and the pace of the game. The overall rating of a formation determines which Decision Die (Activation) it uses, which determines how many units may act, how many auto-rallies you get, etc.&#10;Units are rated by morale, which is the key element of the game. A unit's morale determines which attack die you use, which morale die you use, and how many times it can recover from panicking.&#10;&#10;Fire Combat: The attacker must make an opposed die roll to hit and damage its target. The attacker rolls a die based upon its morale grade, so a Militia unit roles a d6 while an Elite unit roles a d12 to hit. The defender rolls a Cover Die based upon covering terrain; open (d4), light cover (d6), type of tank (light, Med. Heavy) etc. The difference determines how many disorder markers the target takes, and can force a Panic Check.&#10;&#10;Attached companies provide fire support, and special units are important in the game. A unit can have up to four attached companies that provide Fire Die bonuses, help recover Disorder markers, etc. Example, a Battalion with an attached HMG company (+2), Mortar Company (+1), AA Company and Medical Company would get a +3 on its Fire Die, force attacking aircraft to make a Morale Check to press a ground attack, and automatically remove one Disorder Marker per turn.&#10;&#10;The rules are fairly comprehensive and cover all the basics of the period -- air superiority over the battlefield, ground attack, artillery, smoke, amphibious landings, fortifications, mines, engineers, supply, paratroopers, gliders, etc.&#10;&#10;Also included is a set of rules on generating battles and battlefield terrain, basic army lists, equipment lists, and some sample battles and campaigns.&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's web site)&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Panzer Korps: Campaigns &#226;&#128;&#147; Rules & Scenarios&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If the pyramid is still facing away from them at the end of the game, they earn points for it, depending on size. When a piece is dropped, it can &quot;turn&quot; one or more other pieces - that is, change the direction of other pieces along the path in which it is pointing, so that those pieces are also pointing away from the player who dropped the piece. The number of pieces a piece can turn is dependent upon its size; a large pyramid can turn three other pieces, a medium two, and a small piece only one.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you choose a piece to drop, and then you turn the correct number of pieces in front of the piece you just dropped, so that they are all pointing away from you.&#10;&#10;However: only pieces that are lying down are turned. Pieces that are standing upright are left standing upright. This means that in some cases, particularly early in the game, you won't get to turn any pieces even if you drop a large piece.&#10;&#10;Rules can be found on Wunderland.com&#10;&#10;Game System&#10;&#10;    Icehouse Pieces&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But this is not easy, since the next player can move the characters in the opposite direction.  &#10;You can also gain victory points when someone fulfills their objective on your turn, in which case both players share their points.  &#10;There are also action cards that can change everything in a second.&#10;&#10;The first player reaching 20 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game was developed for the second season of the TV Show of the same name, and the situations are a reflect of the ones happening in each chapter.&#10;&#10;",

Only a player who reacts quickly and keeps his nerves can win the game.&#10;&#10;The game includes a board (two-sided) with an obstacle course and a shortcut, three team members per player, a die, and a timer. The timer gets started, and the active player tries to race his pieces along the track. He rolls the die, moves one of his characters the full amount, rolls the die again, moves the same or a different character, and so on until the time runs out. Then the next player gets to act.&#10;&#10;The track depicts barrels which act as obstacles; no player can land on such a space. The characters of other players are either treated as obstacles, or moved back to the next free spot if somebody lands on their space. The finish space needs to be reached with an exact die roll. The player who first finishes the race first with all his characters wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

While he can join the fray (perhaps to bolster the flagging morale of one of his units), his ability to control the rest of his army will suffer, maybe evening failing to follow his orders.&#10;&#10;Written with 15mm figures in mind, Taiko! converts easily to 6mm and 25mm as well.  The rules play to two levels of combat, 1:1 scale, and 50:1 scale. The former is used for small skirmish battles, and has a fast and chaotic feel to it as units of warriors engage, pursue their beaten foe, and then perhaps find themselves being beaten and pursued.  The 50:1 scale is ideal for recreating the larger battles of feudal and/or renaissance Japan, with large formations of infantry and cavalry maneuvering around the battlefield under the control of their lord or one of his generals.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of 36 game cards plus one card with the rules: 20 of the cards deal with Gulliver's journey to Lilliput, and the other 16 to Brobdingnag.&#10;&#10;The cards are illustrated on one side, with the relevant passage from the novel on the back.  The cards are marked with numbers from 1-9 and letters from a-d: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, etc.  Every four cards with the same number are a set.  The story is told sequentially from card to card, obviously heavily abbreviated.&#10;&#10;The game is a simple &quot;Go Fish&quot; variant, but oddly enough they recommend gambling when playing the game!  (&quot;A pool of counters formed at the start pays an agreed bonus to the player with the most fours.  A stipulated fine may be paid to the player who is misinformed about a card.&quot;)  The game does not include any &quot;counters&quot; ...&#10;&#10;The cards are completely in English, despite being made in Austria.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to be the first player to pay for his or her truck, that is, to reach $40,000.00.&#10;&#10;Players select from a hand of load sheets, which indicate i) where a player picks up a load, ii) where that load is to be delivered, iii) the fee for delivering the load, and iv) the bonus fee if the load is delivered within a certain number of days. A day is a player's turn. The roll of a die determines how far a player may travel on his turn. A player's truck may carry up to two loads at one time.&#10;&#10;The key to the game is in the efficient use of the load sheets. For example, do you take just one load across country and go for that big bonus, or do you double up on the loads, which will slow you down and probably cost you a bonus, but will give you an extra payday? You also try to minimize the travel time in which the truck is empty by arranging for the next pick up to be near the just-reached destination.&#10;&#10;",

The flag is usually between spaces 8 and 20, depending on the length and par of the hole.&#10;&#10;To begin a hole, you must pick up the number of dice corresponding to your first choice for a club (3 for driver, 2 for iron, 1 for putter, 1 for sand wedge).  Ball movement is determined by the sum of the dice rolled.  Continue on making a new club selection, taking a swing, and marking off the ball movement until it lands in the hole.&#10;&#10;The six-sided dice in game are all identical: 1, 1, 2, 2*, 3, 3.  The asterisk gives you the ability to double the sum of the dice roll.&#10;&#10;2'S WILD is a Yahtzee clone specifically designed to take advantage of the dice for TWO'S GOLF.
