    "Description": "&quot;You and the other players are competing to contract cargo ships which will bring valuable goods to port. Staying out at sea too long is risky, as weather can endanger your entire fleet. Will you gamble on long voyages for big money, or will you play it safe and stay close to home?&quot;&#10;&#10;Shipping lanes are made up of 7 cards 1-6 and another for scoring. You roll dice not at sea and can choose pairs to go to sea or not. One die chooses where to start and the other is the value of the cargo.&#10;&#10;Then you roll two dice to see if a storm shows up and whether you lose any of your ships. Ships lost are removed and can be rerolled again next turn.&#10;&#10;Finally move your ships forward (towards the lower number), if any move to zero and onto the scoring card earning points through a multiplication; doubles can net you a couple of bonus points.&#10;&#10;If anyone reaches the 100 point goal or more the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;-description from the book, Random Fun Generator&#10;&#10;",

The more honestly and clearly we answer, the faster we advance around the board. The winner of the game is the person who has best demonstrated that bedrock of true friendship: the capacity for sincere, kindly self-disclosure.

If they choose to answer the question, the other players will judge if the player has shared fully; if they feel this is the case, the player scores points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has reached the end of the track; the player who has scored the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Contains Game Board, 4 Sets of 24 Cards, 6 Wooden Counters, 1 Wooden Dice | 197 x 197 x 35mm | Instructions included | 3 - 6 Players | Suitable for 15 years +&#10;&#10;",

Outwit your opponent and finish with the top score!&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a 2 player game...&#10;&#10;A set of dice are rolled and put in plain view. Then each player rolls a dice and sets an additional one to match a value of one of the center dice keeping it secret as well.&#10;&#10;Repeat play until someone gets 50 or more.&#10;&#10;They reveal their dice and then figure out what to remove. This then creates a set of left overs.&#10;&#10;The set die + the rolled dice for each player are summed and scored based on whether they odd or even they will score differently. Whoever got a lower score so far gets the left over center die.&#10;&#10;-description from the book, Random Fun Generator&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Thirteen Colonies have gone from a restless bunch to a group of independent entities.  Throughout the process, a number of documents and other writings have played an integral role in motivating the citizenry and justifying the need for Independence.  As a publisher, your goal is collect and publish more parts of these documents than your competitors.  Publish a significant portion of a document or series of writings and you will attract Advocates that will boost your score. But beware, there is a heavy price for beginning a collection and under-delivering.  Or, will you take the ultimate risk and publish only Loyalist writings?&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by playing cards to different collections of writings. A card played to a collection represents one part of a published writing. But, there is a catch - once you begin publishing to a collection your score in that collection starts negative. You must continue publishing to that collection to achieve a positive score in it. Once to have played three cards to a collection you may also play Advocates to the collection which can double, triple, or quadruple your score.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, a card is played either to a collection or to an appropriate discard pile. Then a card is drawn to replace the played card, either from the deck or from the top of one of the discard piles. Cards played to one of the player's collections must be in ascending order, but not necessarily consecutive. Play continues until the draw pile is exhausted at which point the players scores are tallied.&#10;&#10;If a player decides to publish the Loyalist writings, they may only play to the Loyalist collection and no other collections, their initial score is doubly negative, and all cards in the Loyalist suit are double valued. It is a high risk, high reward option.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Out of sheer desperation, the Knights resort to re-implementing the game in their own style as an honor and tribute to the original.&#10;&#10;Knights of the Round Table is inspired by King&rsquo;s Court, the out-of-print cult classic card game issued in 1983 by Janjohn Games, Inc.&#10;&#10;This game is a wild re-imagining of UNO with more complex draw cards, wild cards, and other special cards. Some draw cards chain together; others allow you to skip or change the direction to affect different players. Defensive cards allow you to protect yourself or even deflect an action back on the instigator. The goal of each round is to play all of your cards first while the goal of the overall game is to have the lowest score when any one player exceeds 500 points.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are sent to an adventurous journey to the heart of Celebes, an anomalous island of Indonesia. Wonders are everywhere. Birds, butterflies, mammals, and insects are dazzling with beauty. And you have the best mission in the world: to collect and study them all! This will definitely be your lifetime expedition.&#10;&#10;Celebes offers games that can be enjoyed by families, which can be played by 2-4 players. The main mechanics of the game are Point to Point Movement and Set Collection. Each player will be provided with a set of logistics cards, botanical tokens and cash. The player's task is to move from one point to another to get data on flora &amp; fauna endemic there. Each turn the players will play one logistic card, later the value printed on the card will be additional travel capital for this turn. If they want to retrieve data, they have to pay a certain amount of money to be able to put the botanist on the game board following the existing path. Players will get a flora / fauna card if they succeed in placing their botanists in a new area.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the round there will be one event card that is opened, this card can change the playing conditions and change the player's tactics. The game ends when the last event card has been executed. Players will get points for having a certain set of cards. However, a new set is counted when the total is more than three cards of the same suit. If there are only one or two cards in a set, the value does not count or is considered forfeited. The player with the most Victory Points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The idea of the game is to get into the Blue Book or Social Register of &quot;High Society&quot; in the middle of the board. Naturally, more than just money is required for admission. Players must also possess their own estate, a piece of property, four status symbols, 200 liquid asset points (money), and a formal invitation. This game is about acquiring all those items and being the first to make it into the Blue Book.&#10;&#10;High Society is designed primarily for four players, although rules for five to eight players are also included. Players move their pawns around the track by means of dice rolls or to specific spaces specified by &quot;strategy cards&quot;. Players acquire an estate or property by being the first to land on it. After acquiring an estate or property, they may be able to charge a trespassing fee to players who land on it. Players also acquire Status Symbols and points (money) by landing on any of the eight Status Symbols spaces.&#10;&#10;Players gain or lose points and Strategy Cards or Status Cards as they land on spaces around the track. Any player who cannot pay their debts is eliminated. Once a player has all the requirements for admission to the Blue Book, they proceed to one of four Country Club Lane paths to the center of the board. Once a player is in one of the Country Club Lane paths, they roll the dice to advance. At the last space before the Blue Book, the player rolls one die and specific rolls determine whether they lose a turn, return to their estate, or win the game. A player in Country Club Lane may also be &quot;Blackballed&quot; by another player in which case they return to their estate space on the board.&#10;&#10;",

Set on a 9x9 grid, players use domino-like tiles to carve out and claim empty spaces called glades. The game unfolds in two distinct phases: a tile-laying phase where players strategically place their tiles to create and influence glades, followed by a scoring phase where ownership of these valuable empty spaces is determined.&#10;&#10;During the tile-laying phase, players must navigate a series of placement rules, creating a delicate balance between expanding their own territory and blocking their opponent. The unique matching mechanism, where tiles must connect to opponents' tiles with matching suit values, adds an extra layer of strategy and interaction.&#10;&#10;As the board fills up and options dwindle, the game transitions into the scoring phase. Here, the true test of strategic foresight begins. Glades are claimed based on the highest surrounding suit values, with a clever cancellation mechanic.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Mathe-Meister is a free roll and write, print and play game, supporting one or more players. Players will dynamically create simple mathematical equations and attempt to solve their sums towards maximum victory points. However, players must be careful how they create each equation based on its location. Producing an odd or even sum in the wrong location, turns said sum into negative points! Over eight rounds, players roll dice, write operands and operators, utilize gameplay bonuses, and ultimately collect their victory points into a final score. The player with the highest final score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As with its predecessor Skogen, you start with a blank canvas &ndash; an empty lake &ndash; and then your job is to fill it, slowly but surely, with life. You do this by selecting the &quot;elements&quot; required for living things and placing them on the lake bed: once a few are in place, you can start populating.&#10;&#10;Before long, the full dynamic beauty of the ecosystem will bloom into life, and the interdependence of the species on each other, as well as their environment, comes into play. Your lake will be teeming with leeches and perch, dotted with lilypads and frogs, crewed with ducks and menaced by hawks. Nurture your lake as best you can, gain points for the most exciting and rarest species that you manage to introduce, and be careful of &ndash; and grateful for &ndash; the capricious forces of nature that wreak beautiful chaos on your environment.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on the hit BBC Radio 4 panel game, the Unbelievable Truth Game is a game in which the truth is stranger than fiction. If you can tell fibs without batting an eyelid or you can embroider the truth like a pro, then this is the game for you.&#10;&#10;Players take turns trying to smuggle unbelievable truths past their opponents in a series of quick fire and lecture rounds. If you can spot when a &quot;truth&quot; is fact or fiction, ring the bell to win a point.&#10;&#10;",

The Junkyard or the Farmstead,to find Items. Each Item has a Value. At the end of each round, players reveal their Treasure Cards and see which Location yielded the highest  Items value. All players who chose that Location get a Victory Point.&#10;&#10;Objective:The first player to score 5 Victory Points wins if no other player has 5 or more Victory Points. 6 Victory Points wins if no other player has 6 or more Victory Points.7 Victory Points everyone with 7 shares the win.&#10;&#10;Setup:Pick a starting player. At the beginning of each round, the starting player shuffles the cards and deals 2 cards face-down to each player. Then they deal 2 of the remaining cards face up in the center of the play area. Each round has 3 phases.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Choose Treasure Cards. &#10;Opening with the Start Player and moving clockwise, each player will choose a card in their hand as a Treasure Card. They will place this card face up in front of them. Using the other card, hide either the top or bottom half of the shown Treasure Card so that only the Item or Location is visible. *This is very important!&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Trigger Active Abilities                                                                      &#10;Beginning with the Start Player and continuing clockwise, each player displaying an Item with an Active (A) ability may use it.&#10;For example, if a player is showing the Compass, they would choose another player with a revealed Item. The targeted player would have to discard their revealed Item card if they correctly guessed the targeted players location. &#10;Note: A player can only be targeted by the Compass, Abacus, Whistle and Dog Mask once per round.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Award Victory Points                                                                               &#10;All players now reveal their chosen Treasure Cards unless their Treasure Card was discarded in Phase 2. Each player with a Treasure Card showing a Passive (P) ability may now use that ability.&#10;Add up the value for each Item at each Location. The Location with the highest value of Items wins the round.&#10;Each player with a revealed Treasure Card with the winning Location receives 1 Victory Point. If there is no winning Location, then all players with a revealed Treasure Card earn 1 Victory Point. If a player had to discard their Treasure Card, then they cannot receive Victory Points.&#10;After Phase 3 is complete, check to see if any player has achieved the winning objective. If not, then pass the Start Player token clockwise and start a new round.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Roll the die, press the porcupine's nose that number of times, and hope his darts don't fly out. No one knows when that will happen, and the only player not to make the porcupine pop wins. Kids can switch up the gameplay and try a round where whoever makes him pop first wins. Or try a game where each dart color is assigned points and when the porcupine pops, players race to grab as many darts as they can, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
