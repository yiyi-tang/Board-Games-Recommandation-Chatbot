The vehicles belonging to the Koala Brothers and their friends are completely mixed up and little by little, as night falls, the way home is hard to find.  Where is the scooter? Who knows where Frank and Buster&rsquo;s house is?  Your mission is to help the friends to get themselves and their vehicles back to the right house.&#10;&#10;The game is comprised of five small boards representing the homes of the Koala Brothers and their friends. Each house has three spaces on it.  The (two) Koala brothers and four of their friends appear on six red counters and their preferred means of transport are represented on five blue counters (the koala brothers fly a twin seater plane).&#10;&#10;At the start of the game the counters are mixed up, one of the red ones removed, and the remaining ten distributed at random between the houses.&#10;&#10;Players take it in turns to roll a special die and take actions accordingly:&#10;&#10;&bull;    If it shows a number then the player moves a piece of his choice the number of free spaces indicated on the die.  Movement can be in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction.&#10;&bull;    If it shows an eye the player can secretly look at a counter of his/her choice.&#10;&bull;    If it shows an arrow the player selects a playing piece of his/her choice and turns it up so that everyone can see.&#10;&#10;Players may also gamble tokens by secretly peeking at counters.  If the counter is at the right house then it wins tokens, if not it loses tokens.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds until all the friends and their vehicles are face up in the right location.  The player with the greatest number of tokens is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

A card is placed in the headpiece by another player such that it can be seen by all the players except the one actually wearing the headpiece.&#10;&#10;The game card shows three subjects in three different categories - Food and Drink, Entertainment and Miscellaneous.  The subject is something that should be familiar to all the players and could be anything from a famous film star to a wild animal.&#10;&#10;The 'Head Case' selects whether he wishes clues on the category on the top, middle or bottom row of his card, and is then informed of which particular category the subject belongs to.&#10;&#10;The other players then take it in turns to offer clues as to what the subject is.  Clues should be relevant to the subject but somewhat distant and slightly cryptic.  Clues should not be derived from part of the subject title.  The 'Head Case' has 10 seconds to try and guess the text on the card at which point the next player gives another clue.&#10;&#10;Tokens are added into a central pile to indicate how many clues have been given - these tokens having been evenly distributed amongst the players at the start of the game. If the 'Head Case' guesses the subject then the player that gave the last clue must collect all the tokens.  A player also gains them if he is unable to provide a suitable clue.  In the event of the 'Head Case' not guessing the answer within 12 clues he fails and collects all the tokens from the pile,&#10;&#10;Another player is then selected as the 'Head Case' and the while process is repeated.  Play continues until one of the players runs out of tokens or when all players agree to stop.&#10;&#10;",

Now available with either Dicecar Jr. rules and Extreme Dicecar rules packages.&#10;Here&rsquo;s the skinny of what Dicecar is. Dicecar is a Table Top Racing game that is played using dice and cards. The drivers must have their own 1/64th scale race cars. These are available at most department stores in the toy section or at your local racing collectible stores. Some spaces on the race track allow you lane changes or prompt you to draw cards which could be good or bad. Pit road is outlined in yellow, so you know where the speed limit begins. Strategies include pit stops in which you choose gas only, one side or both sides tire changes. Avoiding trouble and making moves which can put you in front of the competition are important strategies as well. To win you must be the first driver to cross the start/finish line after completing all of the laps and pit stops. Table Top Racing is no fantasy as you race face to face with your family and friends. Everyone can race at Dicecar. You don&rsquo;t need to be a race fan to enjoy the game. Racing knowledge can help but it is not necessary. Experience counts, so race a few times as you develop your strategy. Dicecar includes qualifying, drafting, unscheduled pit stops for tire or engine trouble. Crashes can happen and the yellow flag will bring out the pace car for a caution. Have fun racing and building your 1/64th scale racing world. Different tracks are available as well as accessories like the high banks and soft walls. Other items such as the pace car, jet dryer trucks, tow trucks and ambulances are also available and make your world of Dicecar a lot of fun.&#10;&#10;",

The designer found that children that are not used to adult conversation will often reply to questions with one-word answers or an answer not related to what the question that they were asked.  The game is also helpful for adults that have had strokes, brain injuries, or are attempting to relearn or expand their language skills.&#10;&#10;As a player lands on certain colored game board squares in a train track format, a player chooses one of 240 question cards, divided into the four corresponding color categories of &quot;Wh- Questions, &quot;If I...&quot;, &quot;Tell about...&quot;, and &quot;How do you...&quot;.  The game cards have three levels: kids, adults, and both.&#10;&#10;The companion workbook called ConverStation Graphic Expression teaches people when to express themselves in writing versus conversation.&#10;&#10;The board game hit the market in June 2005, winning the 2005 Preferred Choice Award from Creative Child magazine as a Toy of the Year Finalist.&#10;&#10;The game is published by Say It Right, a small press educational publisher based in Tybee Island, Georgia.

The basic game comes with the first book in the series and the rest of the books will have small expansions to the game.&#10;&#10;The basic game plays a little like the old Titan boardgame, with each player having secret armies on the map. Each player got one treasure hidden in one of his armies, and the goal is to get both of them to Rai (the capital in the middle of the board) and keep them there for 3 turns.&#10;&#10;The two players will try to get his armies into the most favorable terrain which is different for each unit. Each army got one leader and two units (hidden at the start of the game) and the combat is simple dice rolling. The board is made in the same way as in Settlers of Catan, and  uses hexes with various terrain.&#10;&#10;&quot;Kampen om Rai&quot; was published as a &quot;base&quot; set in book 1. Followed by 10 sequels with 10 expansions total.&#10;Some expansions inlcude more players, more cards and the &quot;veteran unit&quot; extra cards.&#10;&#10;Book 8 opens for sea battles and sea monsters&#10;Book 9 and 10 contributes with a boardgame map (poster-like)&#10;&#10;",

If the Goat is dealt to the table, he must be put back in the pack shuffled, and a new card dealt to the table in its place.&#10;&#10;The first player must make a pair by matching a card on the table with one in his hand if he can, at the same time reading aloud the title of the card, for instance, &quot;I am Buster's Father&quot;. He then takes the trick to himself. If he cannot make a pair in that way, then he must play a card on the table, any one he likes, except for the Goat.&#10;&#10;After his play, he must then take the top card from the pack, so that he will always hold 3 cards, until the pack runs out, when there are no more cards to draw from. Then, if a player cannot make a pair by matching one on the table, he may make one from his hand. If he can do neither, he must draw a card from his left-hand neighbor and try to make a pair from the table or from his hand, and so on, until the last card remains unplayed which must be the Goat. The player with that card must hold it up and say &quot;I am the Goat.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Most of the items look faintly sinister: here is something called Schimmel, or Ball and Hammer and here an inscrutable British concoction, Squails, and, behind the sofa, his earliest acquisition&mdash;the ghastly New and Fashionable Game of the Jew, a dice game devised in 1811 that, according to Sondheim, &quot;taught kids to be anti-Semitic. But all the games you see here are very nice to look at and real boring,&quot; he adds. &quot;This thing about games&mdash;I'm not really fascinated with games.&quot;&#10;&#10;--&#10;Looks to be a variation of Gluckshaus.  Roll both dice and pay the amount rolled onto the space of the same value.  If there is something already on the space, collect it instead.  Rolling a 7 always pays to the Jew space.  Rolling a 12 collects all the counters on the board.&#10;From: http://www.gamesetal.net/Stock_Pages/GLB/glb3930.htm&#10;&#10;",

Goal for each player is to collect the most card sets in one colour, consisting of one card of each number.&#10;&#10;Decks of each number are separated. &quot;0&quot; and &quot;15&quot; are each shuffled, and put as two face up stack on the table. &quot;8&quot; cards are shared evenly among players, and put as face down stacks in front of them. Determined by numbers of players, a given number of &quot;8&quot; cards are revealed from each players deck, and everybody tries to match the two face up cards from the common decks with their tableau. If they find the &quot;0&quot; matching to one of their &quot;8&quot;, they put it below their card. A matching &quot;15&quot; they put on top of their &quot;8&quot;. Once a set is complete, it is removed into a victory point pile and another &quot;8&quot; from the players deck takes it place. Game ends, as soon the decks are depleted.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the race and after a pit stop, cars start off at 60.  In the two turns, the maximum speed is 120.  The turns drive the primary choices available, as some lanes provide a shorter path than others.  The choice lanes have a cost in fuel usage or tire wear.

    "Description": "Various versions of this game have existed for many years. I am not sure if this game has been renamed?&#10;&#10;Sure Shot Baseball is a two person game played much the same way as outdoor baseball.  The game consists of nine innings of 3 outs each.  The &quot;pitcher&quot; rolls a plastic marble down a slide and it heads toward a batter controlled by their opponent.  The &quot;batter&quot; tries to hit the ball out of the stadium by turning a batting knob.  If it goes out of the unique up-curved field the &quot;fielder&quot; then tries to catch it.  Singles, doubles, triples, foul balls, and home runs are determined where the ball goes over the wall.  The &quot;runners&quot; stay in their team dugouts until it is time to position them on the field.&#10;&#10;Each &quot;batter&quot; gets only one pitch. A missed pitch counts as one out.  Each team gets three outs and then players change positions.  Players play nine innings and whomever has the most runs wins.&#10;&#10;There are a few other simple rules.  The game is quite tricky to learn and play competitively.  But it is definitely a fun experience if you enjoy baseball!!&#10;&#10;",

The players take turn moves a tent vertically, horizontally, or diagonally into a free space (without jumping or capturing). After moving, the player moves the movement marker one space clockwise, which chenges the rate of movement for the opposing player. The player who moves his pieces such that none of his tents are adjacent to each other is the winner. A nice little game from Abacus (weisse Serie).&#10;&#10;",

In some situations, both the players asking the questions and the players responding will be able to advance. In other situations, an incorrect answer will send a player backwards along the track.&#10;&#10;Questions for younger players are included in the question book, allowing players to create an easier game for children.&#10;&#10;",

BSO, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or heavy weapons). No CRTs, no siree!&#10;&#10;The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don&rsquo;t 'drive' the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.)  The cards are turned into a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards or rally units. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&#10;&#10;The cards, themselves, give the players 'Opportunities', from using their Tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Reaction movement, to appearances by Patton and Monty.&#10;&#10;Playing time for BITTER VICTORY has averaged 3 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 8 pages, including a section on Solitaire play!&#10;&#10;Available in English or French&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)&#10;    1 A1 map of Sicily &#10;    20 colored Opportunity Cards &#10;    224 counters (NATO Symbols) &#10;    1 Aid Cards&#10;&#10;&#10;The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva.&#10;&#10;",
