Evil locations also contain evil encounters (monsters) that adventurers must fight when they enter their card or the 4 cards next to it (but it's weaker there).

Each quadrant is further subdivided into a route map of delivery addresses (1-18) which may be traveled on throw of a dice by each players transport vehicles. Each vehicle has a different capacity for mail (vans can diver up to two of the players cards, trucks carry three). Since each card dealt to a player indicates an address printed on it (e.g. B13, A6 etc. etc.), on his/her turn, dice must be thrown and vehicles moved towards those destinations in order to deliver the mail. When this is done, the player earns a cash bonus. A delaying element is added to the game via aircraft, which can be rented to deliver unwanted cards (to a maximum of four)from a players hand to another players depot when that player may seem likely to run out of deliveries &amp; win the game.&#10;&#10;",

This will be achieved by drinking, stripping, winning chips, and indulging in general hanky panky.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game consists of a board, die, candle with holder, chips, pawns, a &quot;Boss's Cards&quot; deck, and a &quot;Sexetary's Cards&quot; deck.  The candle goes in the center of the board for ambiance.&#10;&#10;The board has many tracks, similar to a Careers board.  Players roll and perform various actions depending on the space landed on.  The currency in the game is chips and articles of clothing.  Chips can be bought for articles of clothing.  &quot;When a player has run out of both chips and clothing, he is declared a PARTY POOPER, and is at the mercy of the other players.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;NOTE: OFFICE PARTY does not condone gambling nor alcohol.  Neither does it specify the measure of each drink taken.  What the chips represent, and what is used for drinks, is left entirely to the discretion of the players.  All we can say is, 'HAVE A BALL!'&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Inside the Crease (ITC) hockey is a tabletop simulation of the fast-paced game of pro hockey.  In keeping with the pace of the sport of hockey this game uses double-sided Fast Action Cards (FAC) to move the game right along.&#10;&#10;From the first face off players will perform on the ice like no other simulation out there.  Skater&rsquo;s cards are broken down with four separate offensive columns based on whether your team is at even strength, in the power play, shorthanded or the column for rebounds and great feed passes.  These cards don&rsquo;t just tell you whether a player takes a shot but the quality of the shot as well.  Some guys will be shooting at the twine with quality shots most of the time while others will just be putting the puck towards the net.  The slick-passing skaters are not left out here as a good play maker on the ice can set up much higher shooting opportunities.   Players are also rated on the frequency of giving away the puck.  In ITC a bone-headed pass that loses the puck isn&rsquo;t just a turnover it can be a chance for a breakaway for the opposition.&#10;&#10;Defense is covered equally in depth with four separate defensive ratings to set players apart.  The ability to takeaway the puck, block shots, check players off the puck and a general defensive ability all can force the action of the offense.  You will be able to &ldquo;see&rdquo; a great defensive play stop a would be shot.  Blocking a shot or forcing a shot wide with a defensive stop can be a goal saver.  Controlling loose pucks can be a real game turner in ITC with this ability captured in the ratings as well.&#10;&#10;No hockey game would be complete without the ability to capture the penalty aspect.  In ITC the players are not just rated for penalty frequency but the type as well.  Whether it be a minor, major or misconduct you will know when it happens.  If a fight breaks out you will watch the two combatants head to the box.  When a minor is called you will get an actual penalty name (elbowing, holding, etc) for added flavor.&#10;&#10;The goalies are created with the ability to stop shots in the six different shooting categories.  You will be crushed to watch a weak slapshot trickle through for a goal but be ecstatic watching your goalie thwart an excellent scoring opportunity.  In ITC the  ability of the goalie to control the action after a shot is also taken into consideration.  You will see your goalie simply give up a rebound shot, hold the puck or be able to pass it off to a teammate.&#10;&#10;If strategy is your game ITC delivers with a simple and unobtrusive way to handle your coaching choices.  If you push more forecheckers up the ice for better scoring chances you are leaving yourself open on the back end.  It is your choice how to play it.&#10;&#10;",

The cards are numbered, so you can stack the deck and play out four scripted turns that show the basic mechanics. And it only takes a couple of minutes. Instructions, dialogue, and stupid jokes are included. Or use your own stupid jokes - we won't mind.&#10;&#10;The other 39 cards are promos, to give away to friends, customers, or total strangers. These are completely new cards, each guaranteed to be more munchkinly, more insane, more cursed than the last. And we've included multiple copies. Every munchkin will want at least one of each. Will you be generous? Or will you demand tribute? Of course, you are a munchkin, so you will keep at least one of each for yourself, right?&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;CautionIf you have no experience with playing Munchkin-games this will NOT help you learn the game!

Aim of the game is to lay out your cards according to districts clinging together.&#10;This way you have an educational effect in order to learn the French districts and where they are situated.&#10;&#10;Third game is a variant to get rid of your cards as fast as possible.&#10;&#10;Very stylish game components: Top quality cardboard box insert for all the gaming stuff, and every player gets a coloured felt mat to lay out his thick, linen finish cards, and even the two card stacks get their own felt mat.&#10;&#10;A fun game for the whole family, even by modern standards.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, players compete to spend all of their money and return to Washington with no money in hand. The challenge, however, is to avoid collecting new funds from the Treasury on the Road to Inflation, which means that a player's best chance to win is both when his own funds and the Treasury's are exhausted.&#10;&#10;As with many political games, more attention is paid to the political statements being made than to producing a playable game design. The only choices a player has in the game are whether to keep a roll of doubles or to re-roll the dice, and when to take the Road to Inflation to try to win the game. All else is driven by the dice and the spaces on the game board.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is an auction-based roll-and-move election game that adds party and platform-based strategy.&#10;&#10;To start the game, prevailing public opinion is rolled (6- Democrat, 7 Independent, 8+ Republican on 2D6). In addition, each player chooses one of five alignments (moderate or conservative Republican, Independent, moderate or liberal Democrat), and secretly chooses up to 6 of the 15 available issues. The 30 issue tiles are shuffled and 3 placed randomly on each side of the board (region): North, East, South and West. The track around the board has a variety of plus or minus spaces, but six out of 10 spaces on each side are blank and trigger auctions.&#10;&#10;The player landing on the space can put any unclaimed state in his current region up for auction. Bids are secret and paid in Political Capital (PC), the game&rsquo;s currency, and players pay their bids whether they win or lose the auction! After their bids are revealed, they are modified by regional issue matches (1/3 = 5 PC; 2/3 = 10 PC; 3/3 = 20 PC) and any card bonuses. Finally, all players roll dice that depend on their affiliations and the state&rsquo;s preference. (A pink state gives 3 extra D6 to a moderate democrat, 2D6 to a liberal democrat, 1D6 to an Independent, and nothing to Republicans.) The highest total then wins the auction.&#10;&#10;While issues help in some states, taking fewer stands allows a player to collect more PC for each circuit of the board. As soon as a Republican and Democratic candidate reach 5 states with 50+ electoral votes, they win the party nomination, and other players in the party either drop out or become independents. Three scenarios are available: full campaign to electoral vote majority; most electoral votes after one time through the Momentum card deck; or a short game won by the first player to win at least one state in every region with at least 50 electoral votes.&#10;&#10;",
