    "Description": "Game PYTAKI is a nice, simple integration game for the whole family. Thanks to intuitive mechanics, you can start playing PYTAKI right away. This is important because many people do not like playing games because of their complicated rules. It's enough that only one person reads the instruction beforehand and is able to bring the whole family into play in a minute.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;On your turn you draw a task tile requiring you to answer personal question or perform specific task. Tasks may involve additional components like Mood dice (for example you roll them and then tell what makes you feel the mood rolled). Play continues until the stack of tiles is exhausted.

    "Description": "Tales of adventurers, treasures and dragons are now a distant memory for the citizens of Paradise City. Those who were enemies are now friends and the world has moved on, even though pockets of magic remain. And there is a new form of entertainment &ndash; Rock and Roll!&#10;&#10;King Richard, son of Nicholas the Good, has never really liked people. His paranoia has grown worse over the years and he is building an army of robots to subjugate the good citizens of Paradise City. Only the people can stop the mad king, but they need inspiration to do so. You must lead your band, with your revolutionary rock songs and unite the various folks of the city. Only together can you take down the &lsquo;Man&rsquo;. But beware, the king&rsquo;s secret police are everywhere and take a dim view of long hair and loud music. Make yourself too obvious and you will end up in a dank dungeon.&#10;&#10;Monster Rock is a rollicking game of fun and adventure set in a modern fantasy world. You need to improve your band by playing gigs and writing songs. There are different audiences with varying tastes. The Halflings are simple folk and a popular ditty is all they need to entertain them, while the Elves are far more sophisticated and respect a well-crafted melody. Or you can play to the Undead and crank your amps up to eleven! Your fans become your followers, whom you can then lead in the revolution against King Richard and his robot army.&#10;&#10;Monster Rock can be played by up to five music fans, competitively or cooperatively. There is also a solo mode.&#10;&#10;",

One player states a question from one of their cards, and the other players should call out the correct answer providing they hold a corresponding card. The rules contradict themselves on the subject of drawing cards and hand sizes, but basically you keep matching pairs and drawing. The rules are also inconsistent between languages when to end the game: either when all cards have been drawn, or until no more matches can be made between hands. At this point matching pairs in hand are added to pairs taken during play and the player with the most pairs wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

In each game, you will experience a unique zombie apocalypse story line with your friends full of choices, voting, alliances, combat, and betrayals. The game plays out like a group choose-your-own-adventure, only when players die they aren't out of the game - they become zombies with their own &quot;zombie cravings&quot; that they need to satisfy to win! Dead 'til Dawn is a unique, action packed and exciting game!&#10;&#10;Dead 'til Dawn Mixes Role Play with a Competitive Twist. Each player starts with a Character card, with unique abilities and/or agendas, though it's still up to the player to decide how to play! The game starts by revealing 8 yellow-bannered character cards. These are the &ldquo;core characters&rdquo; who will allow new players to ease into the game. Some characters are helpful, some selfish, and some are downright evil. If a Character dies and joins the moaning dead, the bottom half of their Character card will show how they can still win by satisfying a &ldquo;zombie craving.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dead 'til Dawn plays out like a Zombie Movie. As the night falls, the survivors are hopeful - they have weapons, equipment, they're unhurt and ready to face the night. However, about half way through the game, as ammo runs low and weapons and tools have been broken or lost, and people's agendas begin to show...&#10;&#10;Every game is a unique zombie story line. With 104 Event cards (or 120 with the deluxe set), 12 Setting cards (from the Dead Arm of the Law expansion), AND up to 25 possible Characters, this game never plays the same way twice.&#10;&#10;Finally, players are NEVER out of the game. If a player dies, they simply switch sides and continue to play as a zombie! They draw zombie cards to achieve their &quot;zombie craving,&quot; which usually features taking down those left alive. This feature not only keeps everyone involved, but as the game progresses and more players become zombies, it greatly increases the difficulty and drama of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Eyegamer &mdash; The Ultimate Board Game To Have Fun And Train Your Memory.&#10;&#10;In Eyegamer, the goal of the game is simple. The player&rsquo;s task is to collect as many pairs of cards as possible in the shortest period of time.  Eyegamer is a re-implementation of the classic memory game, with a minimalist, black &amp; white card design.  The minimalist design of the cards is designed to make it harder for you to match cards.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, shuffle and place the entire 40 card deck in a 10x4 (4 rows of 10 cards each) layout.  The cards should be placed so that the patterned side of the cards are face down, and the &quot;Eyegamer&quot; card backs facing up.&#10;&#10;On your turn, simply pick any two cards and turn them over, showing the patterned sides.  If they match, remove them from play.  Each matched set should stay with the player/team that matched them.  If the chosen cards do not match, flip them back so that the &quot;Eyegamer&quot; card backs are facing up.  They remain in play.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each matched set is worth 1 point.  The player/team with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are three modes of play included in the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Solo - a 1 player challenge&#10;     Challenge - a 2 player challenge&#10;     Team Deathmatch - Up to 8 players (team sizes of 2 and 4 per team) with team members alternating turns choosing cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;You can also purchase multiple Eyegamer decks to create larger grids for the game, thus making the game more challenging.&#10;&#10;",

To others, it was no more than a rumor or a fable told to little children. No one really believed the prophecy, until that night&hellip;when the cursed hour arrived; enemies appeared from every crevice of the city. Out of the darkness, bright colors flashed and the ground trembled&hellip; and suddenly Wizard appeared, and whispered under his breath: &#10;&quot;Dance, you fools, dance all the way from here to hell&hellip; dance, but do not forget to whisper to the dragon along your way that the wizard is back &ndash; your time is over.&quot;&#10;&#10;Expansion 2: The Wizard&#10;1. In this expansion we added one more hero (in addition to the hero in expansion 1) + one more hero board and so we actually expanded the game to 6 participants!!&#10;This intensifies the game experience and allows to the participants switch characters and refresh the game.&#10;2. The arsenal of clothing and weapons has been expanded into accessories that are suitable for wizards.&#10;3. The hero can throw battle dice which belong to specific magic and thus increasing the amount of dice which the hero can throw from 2 to 3-5.&#10;&#10;        The main advantage of this expansion is the additional fighting options for the game. It adds colorfulness and interest to the game and increased the possibilities that the hero has. It includes extra new cards or magic such as: ILLUSION MIRROR which allows the hero to do more actions in his turn.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;We also added 4 magic dice to improve the hero's power.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Giant was a peaceful farmer who was content with his life, he bothered no one, and no one bothered him. That all changed after that one cursed winter&hellip; when the goblin raid started from the Caves of Doom &ndash; it was that same night when the goblin's fury torched 1,000 straw huts, and the air was filled with fear. It was from that same fire and pain that a hero and a legend was formed, the Giant who stood against evil and returned the favor twice over.&#10;&#10;Expansion 1: The Giant&#10;1.

Losing points isn't always a bad thing in Jewelers Row, however, as just before you score you will send the points in your lowest scoring gem color to your neighbor. Players then score for their top two gems, and only those two.&#10;&#10;As you try to maximize your highest two gem types, you will want to watch your neighbor on your left to try to knock them down a notch, and watch the neighbor on your right to see the damage they're sending your way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The discovery of these crystals led the galaxy to a new era of technological breakthroughs, as it was already going through exciting and turbulent times since the start of the first major intergalactic conflicts.&#10;&#10;When using Small Star Empires: Dawn of Discoveries, at the start of the game you randomly draw crystals of three colors from the bag and place one at each 1 planet system on the board. Additionally, you shuffle the technology deck and reveal several technology cards that will be available for the players to research (purchase).&#10;&#10;Once you colonize a system containing a crystal, you collect that crystal. During the game you may spend collected crystals in order to research the available technologies. Additionally, you may also build research stations on the board. When an opponent colonizes a system adjacent to your research station, you both get &quot;research bonus&quot; and gain one extra crystal for use.&#10;&#10;The technologies that you will research range from new engine drives that enable special movement across the board, utility modules that can be used to colonize asteroids and weapons, and shields that can be used to defend or damage ships. Eventually the technologies could score points at the end of the game, so you need to think about which technologies fit your strategy best!&#10;&#10;How will you use the possibilities that the powerful crystals have to offer?

    "Description": "M&ecirc;l&eacute;e is a maneuver and fight, dice-less card game of medieval hand-to-hand combat.  The game is for two or more players.  It recreates combat with playing cards that represent individual warriors and warhorses.  In game play, M&ecirc;l&eacute;e is like a traditional miniatures game, except that it uses cards rather than miniatures -- i.e., a miniatures game without the miniatures -- making it very affordable.  Multiple sets of decks are being manufactured, allowing it to serve as a collectible.&#10;&#10;Battles are fought on a table top, upon an imagined grid of card-sized columns and ranks.  Alternatively, players may either create their own or purchase a large scale roll up play mat so that spacing is more visually apparent, though this is not required by any means.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for simplicity and ease of play.  It is challenging and enables fast-paced play in 30 minutes or less, even when there are 50 warriors or more on each side.  The biggest limitation is the size of the gaming table available, rather than the cost or availability of armies of warrior cards.&#10;&#10;The game designer's goal was to make a medieval combat game that cuts out the many complexities that often bog down miniatures combat games.  Instead, the focus was on rendering a more historically realistic experience on the battlefield with colorful and unique coats of arms carried by each warrior, as depicted in large size on the cards.  Launched through Kickstarter, the first sets of the game had cards that were sponsored by individual backers whose names and coats of arms appeared on each warrior card.&#10;&#10;While most miniatures and fighting/combat games use various forms of hit points, unit points, and strengths, and these are slowly degraded in various engagements with dice rolling, routing, critical hits, and so forth, M&ecirc;l&eacute;e is different.  There is no extensive paperwork and unit tracking round by round.  There are no chits or markers to indicate wounded warriors or degraded units -- warriors are either alive and fighting, or are killed.&#10;&#10;The game depicts small, medium, or large-sized battles, but focuses combat right down to the individual level. Its combat methodology is drawn from the actual experience of the designer (and play testers) in medieval reenactment battles, where an individual fighter is generally doing fine, fighting away, moving, charging to engage, and so forth, but then at some critical moment in the battle, quite suddenly, he or she gets out too much in front or ends up on the flank with opposing forces circling around....  Things happen quickly from there -- and WHAM, WHAM, WHACK, they're down. M&ecirc;l&eacute;e captures that experience perfectly.&#10;&#10;In M&ecirc;l&eacute;e, to be defeated, an individual warrior almost universally is first overwhelmed and is simultaneously hit by multiple attacks at once.  For instance, the warrior is attacked by a pole axe, two spears, a great sword, and someone with big mace hitting from the side, and, in that case, no amount of fancy footwork can save the day.  Thus, the key to victory is to maneuver your forces and focus your attacks selectively, maintaining a mobile reserve and carefully planning when, where, and how to engage.&#10;&#10;The game's combat methodology is easy to learn, quick to grasp, and fast to play.  The rules are one sheet -- front and back -- and can be explained in a few minutes to almost anyone.  Combat is resolved simply by comparing &quot;Combat Values&quot; on cards.  Generally, if the Combat Values of the combined attacking cards add up to a value of TWICE the defending card's Combat Value, the defender is killed and removed from play.  While simple in practice, skilled players find that there are multiple dimensions of complexity that result.  A unique set of modifiers also are applied based on the four medieval elements -- Fire, Air, Earth, and Water -- as each of these represent combat styles that are chosen and employed in by each player during each combat round.&#10;&#10;To win, either the majority of the opposing forces are defeated -- and the other side gives up, seeing no possible victory -- or the opposing side's banner is seized, which brings and early and glorious end to the battle.&#10;&#10;Players may also make up their own victory conditions, such as escaping off the field with more than half of the remaining forces when the game is started with vastly unequal sides, or killing the opposing side's Commander, and so forth.&#10;&#10;Scenario Packs and Add-On Expansion Card sets are also available, although the basic game provides extensive replayability as it is.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A terrible prophecy said that terrible monsters would bring darkness to the world at the align of the planets. Despite all the efforts to prevent it, the monsters manage to scaped to our realm and transformed the pacate village of Ashwood into the lands of Witchland. Rumors of the Witchland reached the ears of the Hallowhood Guild, an ancient guild of monster hunters who had for generations fought dark forces in various corners of the world. Over the centuries, fighting monsters became no longer just a chore, but also Hallowhood's greatest pastime and its members eagerly awaited an opportunity like this to prove themselves!&#10;&#10;Witchland is a semi-cooperative game. Players must work together to find the terrible monsters that are ravaging Ashwood village and defeat them before the planets line up, but at the same time compete with each other to see who will be the great hunter of this adventure.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, if players succeed in their mission, the player with the most victory points will be the winner. When the planets align, the players failed to protect the world from shadow monsters and now no bet matters anymore. Perishing in darkness is all that remains for humanity.&#10;&#10;Teamwork is critical to group victory, overly selfish actions or incorrect decisions can lead to everyone's defeat! But remember: there can be only one winner!&#10;&#10;During the game, play as one of the Hallowhood members and look for clues to identify the whereabouts of terrible monsters&#10;while dealing with a horde of angry peasants. To do this, collect ingredients, make potions and acquire powerful artifacts that will help you through this nightmare. Make the right choices when dealing with countless crossroads along your journey and remember: the enemy is always on the prowl.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bleaktrick is a trick-taking game for 3 or 4 players that can be played with a standard deck of playing cards. 40 cards are used: Aces to 10's in each of the four suits. At the start of each round, 36 of the 40 cards are dealt equally to the players and each player exchange one card face-down with both of its neighbors. In a 3-player game, each player also discards a card from his hand.&#10;&#10;The dealer leads the first trick and play proceed clockwise until all cards are played. Normal rules for trick-taking games apply: players must follow suit, otherwise they can play any card and the highest card of the leading suit wins the trick (there is no trump suit). When a player wins a trick,&#10;he takes only the card that won the trick (the rest of the trick is discarded), puts it in his winning pile and leads the next trick.&#10;&#10;The twist in Bleacktrick game is this: Every time a player takes a trick with a card of equal or lower value than a certain threshold, then this card becomes the &quot;bleak&quot; card. The starting value of the threshold is 7 but it changes each time to match the value of the last &quot;bleak&quot; card. There's an exception though: if you are already the &quot;bleak&quot; card owner, you can win tricks with cards of smaller value without lowering the threshold. The goal of the game is to score the most points without ending up with the &quot;bleak&quot; card in your possession.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player scores points according to the cards in his winning pile, except from the &quot;bleak&quot; card owner who scores negative points. The lower the numerical value of a card, the more points it scores (for both the positive and the negative case). So, it's preferable to win tricks with low value cards but also more risky as you may end up with the &quot;bleak&quot; card. The player who won the last trick is the dealer for the next round, while the owner of the &quot;bleak&quot; card can have a peek at 2 of the 4 unused cards of the next round. The game ends after a prearranged number of rounds or when a player reaches a prearranged number of points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Santa&rsquo;s Game is a card game with Christmas theme and a variety of Christmas characters. It is based on Czech version of public domain card game Crazy Eights (&ldquo;Pr&scaron;&iacute;&rdquo;). Santa&rsquo;s Game introduces new rules and additional cards. Although the theme is Christmas oriented, the game is wonderful to be played at any time during the whole year.&#10;&#10;It is quick and easy to learn, yet can be more fun and strategic than appears on a first sight. Being in a category of games based on random draw, clever strategy can sometimes eliminate randomness a lot.&#10;&#10;Game contains 110 cards and rules.&#10;&#10;Cards are divided into 5 suits, 22 cards per suit. There are four suits of colored cards (red, green, blue, yellow) and one suit of special cards (grey). Colored cards are: Reindeer/Number 1 to 9 (72 cards), Gift (8 cards), Christmas Tree (8 cards). Special cards are: Santa Claus (8 cards), Santa&rsquo;s Sleigh (8 cards), Snowman (4 cards), Elf (2 cards).&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the round, each player receives 7 cards. The goal is to get rid of all the cards in player&rsquo;s hand by matching last played card on a discard pile.&#10;&#10;Player&rsquo;s turns are taken in a clockwise direction. A player can make only one action during each turn. An action is considered to discard a card, to take a card from the deck, to pass the penalty and to take penalty cards. Each turn player discards only one card to a discard pile (with the exception of Santa's Sleigh, where is player allowed to discard multiple cards). Each card has a function, which is executed after player discards it.&#10;&#10;Based on a card on a discard pile, player can only discard the same color (red, blue, green and yellow) or the same value of the cards (same number, Gift, Tree). Special cards (grey) may be discarded over any card, except if player is receiving penalty. If player does not want or cannot discard any card, they must take one card from the deck.&#10;&#10;Cards:&#10;&#10;Reindeer &ndash; represents numbers 1 to 9&#10;Gift &ndash; any chosen player at the table gets 2 penalty cards&#10;Christmas Tree &ndash; the next player&rsquo;s turn is skipped&#10;Santa Claus &ndash; changes color&#10;Santa&rsquo;s Sleigh &ndash; discards more Reindeer at the same time&#10;Snowman &ndash; passes the penalty to next player in the sequence&#10;Elf &ndash; returns player to the game&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But, to steal them all, and not end up doing a nickel in the big house, you know you must be... gone in 61 seconds.&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;Shuffle and arrange the &quot;Car&quot; and &quot;Security Guard&quot; cards in a 4x8 grid, face up on the playing surface. This is the &quot;Parking Lot.&quot; Security Guards face the most expensive car between those in front of and behind it. Place the rest of the deck face down. The player to the left of the dealer has first turn.&#10;&#10;For each turn a player draws 1 card and replaces a card in the Parking Lot with it, keeping the card removed. &quot;Forward&quot; cards replace any unblocked card to steal it by driving it away in forward gear. &quot;Reverse&quot; cards allow the opposite action. &quot;Plus&quot; cards steal a car in either direction and give the player an extra turn. Blank cards cover Security Guards to remove them. If a card can't be played, place it at the bottom of the deck and skip the turn. A turn ends when the drawn card is played.&#10;&#10;A car cannot be stolen if another car or Security Guard is blocking the path out of the lot, or if the guard's flashlight is pointed directly at it. The game ends when all cards have been stolen.&#10;&#10;The player who has stolen the greatest value of cars after all have been boosted, wins!&#10;&#10;",
