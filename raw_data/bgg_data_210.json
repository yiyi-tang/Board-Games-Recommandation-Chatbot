    "Description": "Coming in a very awkward-sized box (42 x 42 x 3 cm), this is a distant relative of Scrabble. The 19x19 board is colored in two distinct areas, the central lozenge (just reaching the edges) being called the arena. The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.&#10;&#10;Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.&#10;&#10;Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.&#10;&#10;The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:&#10;&#10;The Eye (covers 1 square);&#10;    The Rod (covers 2 squares);&#10;    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);&#10;    The Snake (covers 4 squares);&#10;    The Door (covers 5 squares);&#10;    The Gun (covers 6 squares).&#10;&#10;",

Otherwise, it differs from traditional chess in that it has 9 pawns and three bishops--one for each colour. The set-up naturally varies from that of a square board, but beyond that, much of the play is fairly similar.&#10;&#10;",

Those Skips come in really handy at the end of the deck, when the dealer starts handing out the Ground cards. Catch a Ground card, and you're dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;Falling is a real-time game, it takes as long to play as it takes to deal a deck of cards at a leisurely pace.

Sometimes you&rsquo;re lucky and get a large hand of cards you can choose from, and sometimes you have to micromanage and get the best out of a small hand. It&rsquo;s a game where your luck can change suddenly when the Sandman lashes out, testing your intuition and skills. Will you hide and wait for the attack to blow over, or will you actively attack and escape by the skin of your teeth?&#10;&#10;In Sleep Tight you need to constantly be alert and think few steps ahead, as you will need to guess the other players&rsquo; next move or even worse, the Sandman&rsquo;s!&#10;&#10;The players uses action cards and Soul Fragments as a &quot;fuel&quot; for their action.

(The nightmare ends, and everyone wakes up.)&#10;     Escape the nightmare. If a player has 10 Soul Fragments and plays the card, that player wins and the other players lose. (The dream collapses, leaving the other players to be consumed by the Sandman.)&#10;&#10;&#10;There are two ways to lose:&#10;&#10;     Everyone dies. If every player dies by reaching 0 Soul Fragments, the players lose. (They die and are completely consumed by the Sandman.)&#10;     The nightmare traps you. If the Dreamscape deck is empty, the players lose. (The kids are trapped in their dreams and can&rsquo;t wake up anymore)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Your Career card lists how much time and money you can spend on each turn. On your turn, you may play cards from your hand, but only if you have enough time or money to pay for them (some cards, like &quot;Lucky Lottery&quot; allow you to add your two scores together). The cards you play feature life goals that are worth points. You may also get married and have children which costs you time but earns you bonus points. When the Early Life cards are used up, play proceeds with the Later Life cards. This deck also has the Letter cards &quot;L&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;F&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, and when all four of these cards are drawn the game ends. The players add up their scores and the one with the highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players must exercise the highest level of caution because a rotten plank of wood in the bridge might break at any time, causing the player &ndash; or worse, some of the precious treasure &ndash; to plunge into the gorge. What's more, the other treasure hunters will be only too glad to pilfer your finds should you give them the chance.&#10;&#10;The goal in The Bridge to Treasure Cave is to cross the bridge (a 3D structure inside the box), grab the treasure and cross the bridge again to return the treasure to your camp. On your turn, you roll a number of dice to determine how far you move. Each die face shows how far you must move and possibly some event:&#10;&#10;     Danger, which adds another die roll which may cause the bridge to (partly) collapse at your location, or may cause you to lose a treasure;&#10;     Repair, which allows you to repair a damaged part of the bridge;&#10;     Pilfer, which allows you to steal a treasure from another player, if you land on his location.&#10;&#10;&#10;There are three dice: a green die, which in general permits only slow, but safe movement, a yellow die, which gives a good chance to pilfer treasure, and a red die, which allows for fast, but risky movement. The number of treasures you are carrying determines how many dice you may roll: the more treasures you carry, the fewer dice you roll. After rolling, you select one die to execute.&#10;&#10;If you reach the treasure cave, you can immediately claim up to three treasures. If you reach your camp, you may unload your treasures and prepare for the next crossing. If you end your move at a gap in the bridge, or if the bridge collapses under you, any treasures you are carrying are lost in the river, and you return to your base camp.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the cave holds 25 treasures. The first player to carry a certain number of treasures (depending on the number of players) back to his camp wins. Alternatively, if no player has acquired that number of treasures before all treasures have been claimed or lost in the river, the player who has collected the most treasures wins.&#10;&#10;",

You control a MegaCorp &mdash; one of the six enormous conglomerates that dominate economic and political life in the mid-21st Century. You control industries, manipulate governments like puppets, and even wage war to open new markets. You win by making more money than the other MegaCorps.&#10;&#10;A player chooses industries in countries, hoping for big payouts by having less competition in the industry. But if you own an industry and want to build the same industry in another country you will need to get permission. Of course, you can try to take over the country first then build in there, using the force of countries you own and mercenaries you have or with those you can persuade allies to contribute.&#10;&#10;The type of government a country is can also have an effect on what you buy (or what you keep!). Kleptocracies can steal ownership of your industry. Dictatorships can nationalize an industry to shut you out. Democracies can buy you out.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The purpose of these objectives is to be able to assign victory points (technical score) in the event that no player is able to complete the assigned goal. The final score for each player is given by the total sum of the state borders in the target. For example for the following 3 target states - China (7 points), Northern Europe (5 points) and India (3 points) - the player receives 15 points.&#10;&#10;In the event of a tie at the end of the set time, the win is awarded to the player with the most points out of target.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from Wikipedia&#10;&#10;",

They can steal items from the store, slack off, or keep performing their work duties. Each activity has risks and rewards. The player scores points after successfully slacking off and after taking their stolen goods to their locker. When a player gets caught (by the boss) doing something wrong they gain heat. Heat also naturally rises during the game. When a player reaches 30 they are fired. The game ends when all of the players but one are fired or the event deck is exhausted.&#10;&#10;Five Fingered Severance is a take that game. To gain points the players will have to open themselves up to the other player's attacks. I want the game to be more tactical though, so the plot cards in the deck are limited to just a few types of cards. This allows players to know about what they are getting when they take a turn to refresh their hand.&#10;&#10;",

In the game of Kamozza, you are exporters and your goal is to load as much of your freight as possible into ships.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has the same set of freight cards of various loads.&#10;&#10;There are two docks on the table. Each round, two ships come into these docks. The one of these two ships has larger load capacity, and the other has smaller. Then each player secretly chooses a freight card from their hand and destination ship to load the freight. When they are revealed, count up the load for each ship. If the load exceeds the ship's capacity, the ship is sunk. Otherwise freight is successfully loaded and victory points are scored to the successful players.&#10;&#10;After the fifth round, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is simple but exciting, and its artwork is cute. You can play another game using the same cards. You should load your freight from heavier to lighter, but if you and other player play the same card, both cards cancel each other and you miss a chance to load. This game is also exciting.&#10;&#10;The game was originally produced in 2012 in Japanese.

    "Description": "A mancala game.&#10;&#10;From Mancala World:&#10;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mangala_II&#10;&#10;&quot;Mangala is a Turkish mancala game which was very popular in the 17th and 18th century. According to Metin And, a Turkish ethnologue, the game could be related to the &quot;mancala&quot; of The Arabian Nights (fifteenth night), one of the first literary accounts of mancala games. The game was depicted in Turkish paintings as early as in the 16th century. In Europe, it was first mentioned in 1694 by the English traveller Thomas Hyde. Mangala was also found by Edward Daniel Clarke in Balaklava, Crimea (now a suburb of Sevastopol) in 1801 and by Peter Emund Laurent on Chios Island (now Greece) in 1818. It might have influenced Mandoli (Hydra Island, Greece) and Ban-Ban (Bosnia). Mangala has almost the same rules as the Baltic German Bohnenspiel, which originated in Persia where it was known as Manqala or Manqalat.&#10;Two Ottoman Women playing Mangala (18th century)&#10;&#10;The classic Mangala is still known in Turkey. However, the Mangala played in Gaziantep in Southeast Anatolia is not related to it at all, but is a close variant of La'b madjnuni (&quot;The Crazy Game&quot;), which was played in Damascus (Syria) in the late 19th century. More games called &quot;Mangala&quot; (again with quite different rules) are popular among the Bedouins in Egypt.&#10;&#10;Mangala might be the first commercialized mancala game in a western country. A game called &quot;mangola&quot; (a common synonym for the Turkish Mangala at this time) was published by Jaques in England in 1863, after Walter Whitmore Jones claimed to have invented it. Jaques pattern book covering shows a thick wood board with two rows of six cells in which something like white beans are placed. The records of copyrights kept by the Stationers company, the Public Records Office at Kew, includes a volume covering 1862-64, which has an entry showing that the rules of Mangola were protected by copyright at that time. Richard Ballam, a board games collector, found an advertisement in the Illustrated London News (December 23, 1865) saying: &quot;Mangola, a new game. By the author of Squails, Frogs &amp; Toads etc. Wholesale Jaques &amp; Son&quot;. Claiming foreign or nearly forgotten boardgames as own designs happens frequently in the game industry. (...)&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Mangala is played on a board, which consists of 12 holes dug into the earth. Initially there are six glass beads (&quot;boncu&#196;&#159;u&quot;) or cowrie shells in each hole.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of a hole, one by one, in a counter-clockwise direction into the succeeding holes.&#10;&#10;If the last bead falls in a hole on either side of the board, making a total of two, four or six beads including the last bead, its contents are captured.&#10;&#10;If this hole is preceded by other holes which contain two, four or six beads, their contents are also taken.&#10;&#10;A player must move if he can, but passes when his holes are empty.&#10;&#10;The game is finished when all holes are empty.&#10;&#10;The player who captured more beads wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

But they still haunt the house.  You must try to find out who was murdered, by what means and why.&#10;&#10;The cards include Motive cards, No Clue cards and a single &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card.  In addition, there are cards that can be assembled side by side to form larger pictures: the six guests (Cleopatra, Napoleon, etc. --they were costumed, you see; in four pieces), four weapons (also in four pieces) and Alfred Hitchcock (in six pieces).  Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest into the house's rooms.  You enter a room by exact count, except that a 7, 11 or doubles allows you to go directly to the spot of your choice.  When you reach a room, you pick up the top card there and discard either it or another card from your hand to the &quot;Lawn&quot; --off the board.  These cards are laid face down without overlapping each other but are shown to the other players as they're laid down.  Later, you may try to recover a Lawn card by showing a card from your hand of the appropriate type (a piece of a guest, for example) and then pointing to a Lawn card and picking it up.  If you remembered right, you may repeat the procedure.  You can also claim cards from other players by meeting them in the house and &quot;accusing them&quot; of withholding a particular card (this is what the No Clue cards are defence for).  Once the rooms are empty, everyone gathers in the hall and play is speeded up.&#10;&#10;First player to assemble a Ghost, Weapon and Motive OR Alfred and &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;",

A player must conquer new fortresses and upgrade existing ones so to increase income, and gain access to stronger and bigger units. Each unit has different innate skills (power, range, &amp; speed), and some special abilities which add many strategic maneuvers, fun, and replay-ability.&#10;&#10;The game is straight forward and easy to learn; it does not limit the player but rather gives freedom of action. In each turn, a player can receive money, build units, upgrade fortresses, move and attack as much as his resources and units allow him. There is no specific action sequence. a player can do what suits him best.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, the school is also a training ground for dark beings from the 5th dimension. These beings, while capable of unfathomable universe destroying power, have a long way to go in order to reach their full potential. The MSfB will help them reach that potential!&#10;&#10;In a twist on the Miskatonic genre of games, instead of players taking on the roles of humans trying withstand the dark forces around you, players instead play the dark forces of the Lovecraft universe (or at least &ldquo;dark forces in training&rdquo;). The game takes place during the final 3-day test in the &ldquo;Human Possession&rdquo; course. Each 5th dimensional horror starts the test in control of one of the human students of the school. The goal for the beast is to figure out which student they are in possession of before the other members of the class figure out which student they are controlling.&#10;&#10;Designed by Garrett Herdter, MSfB takes the standard deduction game concept of &ldquo;I try to guess the other players hidden roles&rdquo; and flips it. In MSfB, each player has no idea who they are, but they DO know who all the other people are. This dynamic and the fact that 1 or 2 of the players can lie during the game make MSfB hysterical fun while still being easily accessible and quick to learn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the introduction:)&#10;&#10;The Moscow Option: Guderian's Gambit is a simulation of the fighting that could have taken place between Smolensk and Moscow during the first half of August 1941 if Hitler had decided to concentrate his eastern armies' supply in order to allow the mechanized forces of Army Group Center to make the 150 miles to the Soviet capital city. Historically, of course, the German dictator chose instead to halt the AGC, temporarily de-emphasizing Moscow as a target while diverting his forces' strength on the front's northern and southern sectors. Here we assume he chose instead to reorganize the mobile divisions of Panzer Groups 2 and 3 and ad hoc Panzer Army Guderian, putting that general in charge of a daring effort to take Moscow, thereby winning the war by plunging the entire Soviet Union into strategic paralysis.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player, operational-level, alternative history wargame of low complexity. In it, the German player controls all Panzer Army Guderian units and is opposed by the Soviet player who controls all the Red Army units.&#10;&#10;The situation is inescapably such that the German player controls the strategic initiative and sets the overall tempo of play. We therefore recommend opponents who share a particularly competitive relationship should play a series of matches, switching sides each time, before deciding who between them owns bragging rights to the game.&#10;&#10;1 hex : 9 miles&#10;GT : 1 day&#10;Units : divisions and brigades (3000-12000 men and/or about 50 to 180 armored vehicles)&#10;&#10;",

The game is mainly concerned on the air aspect of such a conflict. Land battles, naval operations and special forces are included, but serve mainly as a background of the air war.&#10;&#10;The Polish player manages his squadrons and sends them against enemy troop concentrations with bombers and ground-attack aircraft, engages the enemy aicraft with his fighters, and decides about the use of his air-defence assets... hoping for the timely arrival of NATO squadrons coming to his aid.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Agresor&quot; commands ground forces, supports them with his aircraft squadrons and tries to destroy the Polish airforce, or at least take out its airbases.&#10;&#10;The idea behind Eagles and Missiles is based on scenarios being considered by the Polish staff and tested on big field war games such as: Anakonda and Dragon. Like in the real-world simulations the invasion is performed from three directions: the Baltic (naval invasion), Kaliningrad District and Belorussia.

These battles are fought on a generic map that represents the types of terrain found on the Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;The game has that essay quality of many Dunnigan designs.  It intentionally does not try to be all encompassing but consciously focuses on specific strands of the story as simply and straight forwardly as possible.  Good advice for storytellers and game designers.  While a bit primitive by today's standards Lost Battles is nevertheless complete and playable presenting many interesting problems to be solved.  Though only four scenarios are provided with game, the highly variable victory conditions actually make the game extremely replayable.  The game also provides brief tools to design many scenarios of your own.  In fact you could say that it is this that the game does most best.  It is likely that many early designers played a game or two of this before going their own way taking with them the bits and pieces of the simulacrum that suited them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from MMP website:)&#10;&#10;In July, 1763, Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) was under siege as part of Pontiac&rsquo;s Rebellion. A relief column was sent out from Carlisle in order to try and break the siege. The column was under the command of Colonel Henry Bouquet and consisted of approximately 500 British soldiers of the 42nd Highlanders, 77th Highlanders, and 60th Royal Americans.&#10;&#10;On August 5th, several hundred Indian warriors of the Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron tribes attacked the column east of Bushy Run Station. The British held out, and that night a redoubt was constructed from the supplies, and the wounded were treated inside this perimeter. The next day, the Indians attacked again, and a British counterattack broke the Indians. The British column was able to advance, and relieve Fort Pitt on August 10th.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Bushy Run game uses a simplified version of Iwo Jima: Rage Against the Marines (in Operations Special Magazine Issue #1). The American Indian units use a concealed map and have dummy units to help hide their movement. The British force is a mix of soldiers, grenadiers, and scouts (who can reveal hidden Indian units). To increase replayability there are random events each turn (8 turns, 10 event chits, so 2 are not played each game...their identify is not revealed). Both sides have multiple ways in which they can secure victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to Banana Republic, a political unstable country where the economy is controlled by political and business elites. You are one of the elite of this nation, and your objective is to stash enough money in an offshore trust fund that you can retire comfortably. Invest your income in stocks, properties and bonds, then exert influence on the government to manipulate the economy for your personal gain. Orchestrate the downfall of other elites by destroying their personal life through car accidents, expensive divorces, and shotgun babies. Do you have what it takes to survive in this cutthroat world of money mania?&#10;&#10;Wongamania: Banana Economy is an economic and modern finance board game that reflects the complexity of modern investment portfolio management by incorporating multiple asset classes that behave differently under different economic situations. Deviating from the traditional auction mechanisms used by most stock-trading board games, Wongamania: Banana Economy uses a combination of resource management, environment manipulation, and take-that mechanisms to reflect the brutal competition and uncertainty of the modern global financial markets. Players have to manage a portfolio of stocks, properties and bonds, and assess the risk-reward of holding them in different allocations. Players are also able to influence the economic environment by manipulating it to either benefit their personal investment allocation or to wreck havoc against other players who are using a different asset allocation strategy. Players are also able to make use of their money for other purposes, such as sabotaging the personal lives of other players, hiring professionals to disrupt the strategy of other players and buying insurance to protect against sabotages. Whoever stashes enough money in a off-shore trust fund wins the game.&#10;&#10;Wongamania: Banana Economy is a reimplementation of the 2014 game Wongamania (only available in SEA), and multiple changes have been made to cater better to the international audience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You are in the enchanted forest, and you must leave before night. The magic tree stands in the middle of the forest. It is a multi-colored tree that you may grow or shrink, and you must overcome its challenge to escape. Specifically, you have to insert all your wooden pieces in the tree trunk and capture a precise number of your opponents' trunk pieces. Be smart and skilled, and you will succeed. Otherwise, you will turn into a mushroom and spend one thousand years near the tree with all the ones who missed before you!&#10;&#10;All players start Arbra Kadabra with ten wooden trunk pieces in your color, with the die (showing 1/1/2/2/3/3) and the base of the tree in the center of the table. On a turn, you roll the die, then either add a number of pieces to the tree or remove a number of pieces to the tree equal to the number that you rolled. (If the tree is too short to take pieces, then you must add them.)&#10;&#10;When you add pieces to the tree, you must add pieces of your own color first. Once you have no more pieces of your color, you can instead place pieces of other players' colors. Why would you have pieces of their color? Two reasons: (1) When you remove pieces from the tree, you must take them from the top down; you can't remove pieces from the center of the tree. (2) If the tree collapses on your turn, then you must take all of the pieces that fell and add them to your collection.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with all this building and unbuilding? To win the game, you must have none of your own pieces in front of you. In addition, you must have exactly four of the opponent's pieces in a two-player game, exactly three of each opponent's pieces in a three-player game, or exactly two of each opponent's pieces in a four-player game. Do this first, and you win!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Destruction of Army Group Center: The Soviet Summer Offensive, 1944, is a simulation on a corps/division level of the Russian Summer Offensive of 1944 on the Eastern Front (Operation Bagration). Historically this offensive destroyed one entire Nazi Army Group, and prevented large transfers of men and equipment to the newly formed Western Front where the Anglo-American forces were expanding their beachhead in preparation for the August Breakout. The game covers the first twenty days of the offensive, during which all the decisive action took place. There are several scenarios, depicting a variety of likely possibilities, from the historical one through various degrees of German preparedness and 'sanity'.&quot;&#10;&#10;Units represent Russian corps and Axis divisions. Stacking limit is 3 units/hex. Players alternate moves. Order of phases in each movement turn is: movement phase, combat phase, second mechanized movement phase. Semi-active zones of control extend into adjacent hexes, with some exceptions. Units pay two extra movement points to enter or leave an enemy zone of control, and may move directly from one controlled hex to another if they have enough movement points. Attacking is voluntary. Combat results involve unit eliminations, exchanges, and retreats, but the Axis mechanized units have a modified step-reduction mechanism (an eliminated Axis mechanized unit is replaced by a weak battlegroup which has no zone of control, and is worth extra victory points to the Russian player if it's eliminated in a later combat).&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by victory points, gained by eliminating enemy units and, for the German player, for failure by the Russian player to have a continuous line from the north to the south board edge at the end of his turn.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are provided, ranging from the historical one where Hitler's propensity for issuing &quot;Stand Fast&quot; orders finally caught up with the Axis, to the maximum withdrawal scenario, in which the Axis essentially eliminates the portion of the front historically covered by Army Group North and uses the forces of that Army Group to strengthen the resulting greatly-shortened line in the Army Group Center area.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 km&#10;Units: Kampfgruppe to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 28&quot; map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One foldout rules folder (folds out to 10 pages)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the prime of ancient Greece, the mightiest city states (Polis) of the peninsula compete bitterly for supremacy. This epoch is now evoked again in a playful manner. Each player represents one of the famous cities: Athens, Corinth, Thebes, or Sparta.  &#10;  &#10;In order to demonstrate power and strength, warriors and mighty heroes must be displayed in splendid parades. However, it is also valid to use the favor and gifts of the fickle Gods of Mount Olympus as skillfully and impressively as possible.  &#10;  &#10;Each City State card set has the same number and type of Warrior/Hero cards and God cards. Warrior/Hero cards have values between 2 and 10. Gods have certain abilities that can change the displayed values dramatically. In the game, each player must try to use his 25 cards as skillfully as possible in order to collect the most Fame points.  &#10;  &#10;The game extends over three Parades, each of which has three Marches. Fame scoring occurs after each March. The city with the lowest display loses Fame points. The two cities with the highest displays earn Fame points. Twice only during the entire game, each city may send emissaries to the mighty oracle at Delphi, in order to beg for her aid and, possibly, turn Fate in their favor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(description from publisher's website)&#10;&#10;THE GAME CONCEPT&#10;It is 21st century America--a place where money talks and politicians listen. In this game, players are wealthy CEOs who bribe politicians to gain political power and influence. Players must be careful, however, because political scandal might bring down one's political friends and all of one's invested money. Players who use their money wisely to bribe the right politicians will be victorious.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by having the highest total bribe on any of the five Politicians. On your turn, you will receive and play Money Cards and/or Power Cards. You bribe a Politician by placing a Money Card next to, and on your side of, a Politician Card (which are in the center of the table). The bribes grow as more Money Cards are played on the same Politicians. Power Cards are used to perform a variety of actions and are discarded after use (such as stealing other people's bribes). At game's end, all the bribes are revealed and tallied up. Players score Victory Points for each Politician that they have 'won' by having the biggest bribe. The player with the most Victory Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
