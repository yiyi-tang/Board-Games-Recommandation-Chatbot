There are, however, several differences -some of them rather substantial- between the two games. Just to describe a few of them (comprehensive list here):&#10;&#10;     The game's objectives (wining conditions) are different: Total conquest in Castle Risk vs a prefixed amount of conquests (Fully occupy 3 Empires in addition to your own) in RisiKo! Pi&ugrave;.&#10;     &quot;Spoils&quot;/Reinforcements are to be reclaimed, in RisiKo!

If accurate, these pay offs can make up for the points lost during the trick play.&#10;&#10;After one hand, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The front of each card has a top and a bottom showing different suits and ranks.&#10;&#10;",

Superclass cards are postponed until the final stage.&#10;Class cards remain implicated in the challenge deck and drop out to players randomly during the game itself. Also in the game there are goal cards that are in the challenge deck (they come to players during the game). After receiving the goal, you put it in front of you next to the class card.&#10;Each turn, one challenge card should be played with a dice roll. If the number that falls out is greater than the number indicated on the challenge card, then the card is played and can be put away in a discard or folded into a set of goal cards.&#10;On each card, there are symbols in the upper left (bonus cards) or right (challenge cards) corner. On the bonus card - a positive or negative bonus. On the challenge card - the number of bonus cards that must be used to draw the card. If there are still not enough points, then life points are taken away from you according to the number of uncovered points (the total number of bonuses and challenges on the table is 8, 5 fell on the cube, 3 life points would be taken away from you).&#10;Players need to collect the complete set indicated on the goal card. After reaching the specified condition, the player receives a random superclass card, loses health points and continues the game. The game ends when all players have fulfilled the conditions indicated on the goal cards (or by agreement).&#10;&#10;",

In the first half of the game, players are building a pyramid on their side, starting with the base. Whenever a player adds a card to the 2nd level or higher, they can activate that card's trading ability, and then trace that back to the base of the pyramid, activating any cards along the way that they desire.  Ultimately the path will trace back to some ship boards in the middle which hold both the cards the players will refill their hands with, as well as a cost to buy the ship board.&#10;&#10;Once the players' are finished building their pyramid, the looting begins.  Players will form 3-card poker type hands on each of the ship boards.  They can choose from the cards remaining in their hands or the cards in their pyramid; however, to choose cards from the pyramid, they must &quot;unbuild&quot; the pyramid from the top and can only access uncovered cards.  Once the players have both added 3 cards to each board, the boards are evaluated and points are awarded.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points from the boards acquired during trading and the boards acquired during looting wins.&#10;&#10;",

These Strongholds of ever-present lies must fall!&#10;&#10;This game includes 9 different Word Wielder heroes to choose from, each with their own unique set of Gifts (abilities) from 4 different Classes: Champions (Melee/Tank), Seekers (Range/Bow &amp; Arrows), Edifiers (Prayer Type Weapons/Words of Holy Fire and Healing Light), or Discerners (Dynamic &amp; Well-rounded/weapon specializations are player&rsquo;s choice).&#10;&#10;Play through The Story (main campaign) that is broken out into 7 Chapters meant to be experienced over multiple sessions. Each Chapter can take between 60-90 minutes to complete. There are Checkpoints provided to help you pick up where you left off even if you put the game away.&#10;&#10;Gameplay alternates between Two Phases:&#10;One - The Chosen Phase where player&rsquo;s spend their chosen Word Wielder&rsquo;s Guidance Prayer and Action tokens to prepare for and battle The Darkness by rolling dice and comparing results against the enemy stats, and advance the Chapter objectives and&#10;Two - The Darkness Phase where the Darkness on the board then takes their Actions trying to Burden and Overwhelm the Word Wielders in order to stop them.&#10;&#10;So equip yourselves for battle by praying for Discernment, allowing you to draw from over 90 cards packed with anointed Weapons of Light, Armor, and Single-Use items. Each new card collected has its own abilities offering your Word Wielders limitless combinations and tactical possibilities. Slay the Darkness and collect their cards to build up a Light Pool - once enough enemies have been slain, return them to the Darkness Deck and draw a Heaven&rsquo;s Armies Card with one of three different Angels that can be played to help your Wielders gain the advantage in battle.

The first card from the drawing pile gets turned over and the players continue the series. The first player who has laid out all of their cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;In their turn, a player can lay out as many cards as they want as long as the element or the shape from the top card is continued. Once made, the decision between element or shape cannot be changed while laying out cards (For example: A water circle is the top card. The player lays out a water circle and then a fire circle. With the fire circle they chose &quot;shape&quot; and are able to lay out earth or air circles but no other shapes).&#10;&#10;If a player is unable to lay out any card, they draw three cards and the direction of the game changes.

But there is something the king has failed to tell you...&#10;&#10;In Maze of the Minotaur, you must navigate the ever-shifting labyrinth in search of the wandering Minotaur and defeat him in combat. The labyrinth is not only shifting, however - but also collapsing all around you. Additionally, the Minotaur has crafted the labyrinth to close in around you as you move, preventing you from retracing your steps! Once you have defeated the Minotaur, enter the tower at the center of the maze to free the labyrinth's architect Daedalus and his son Icarus and fly them to freedom!&#10;&#10;Maze of the Minotaur is the third Fantasy Adventure Module in the Roll-With-It system, a modular, solitaire roll-and-write adventure game system with endless possibilities for adventure through an accomplish-the-task-and-escape-the-maze-style gameplay.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is centered around a maze or map, through which the player must navigate, accomplish some objective(s), and escape the map under pressure from the enemy's attacks via the Doom die. The simple, puzzley, maze-style gameplay is approached differently in each adventure, building on the basic rules with new rules, concepts, and components that make each adventure feel fresh and unique.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Within Stock Monarchy you will play as the ruler of a small Kingdom listed on the stock market. The competition will be relentless. To win, players must bring their Kingdom to dominate the stock market with a savvy combination of warfare, technology and trade.&#10;&#10;THE STOCK STATES&#10;The Stock States are a rich empire with a bizarre form of government: a stock monarchy. The Supreme Sovereign wields absolute power, but his election and term in office are determined by the satisfaction of the stockholders, the true masters of the Land.&#10;&#10;CORONATION CHALLENGE&#10;The time has come to nominate a new Supreme Sovereign. As usual, the Coronation Challenge is issued so as to find the most talented contestant amongst the richest Houses of the Realm. The winner of the Challenge will be crowned Ruler of the Stock States.&#10;The Challenge will take place on one of the peripheral and uncivilized islands of the empire. The Island is inhabited by Mattoks, somewhat obtuse and na&iuml;ve creatures with a very basic lifestyle. Mattoks can&rsquo;t quite discern between good and evil and are therefore easy to manipulate or to corrupt. They are not to be entrusted with complex tasks, but they are excellent at following simple instructions and will comply with whatever command in exchange for a few shiny coins.&#10;At the beginning of the Challenge every participant will be assigned a starting region of equal dimension and three months&rsquo; time to showcase their strategic skills and &ndash; most important of all &ndash; to enrich the stockholders.&#10;The management of the Realms on the Island mirrors the stock monarchy of the Stock States: each scion will be free to act as an authentic absolute monarch, but his choices will be evaluated by the stock market. Dominating the market, however, will not be easy: all shareholders ultimately desire to grow richer and see the value of their shares rise, but some of them also have specific preferences on how this should be done. The two most prominent examples are definitely the conqueror and pioneer currents. The conquerors want a Ruler in power who pursues profit through military expansion, while the pioneers prefer one who will enrich them by investing in technological growth. Therefore, whoever wants to sit on the Throne of the Stock States will not only have to effectively administer his own Realm, but will also have to distribute copious dividends and support, at least in part, the interests of conquerors and pioneers. Ultimately, the winner of the Coronation Challenge will be the Ruler who is able to impose himself on the market and make the value of the shares of his Realm soar.&#10;&#10;GAME-FLOW&#10;The Game-Flow has 3 stages: Setup, Round and End Game.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&bull; Creating the island: the Island is created, depending on the number of Players (in a 2-Player game it is possible to create more&#10;than 2 billion different Map layouts, in a 4 Player game more than a trillion, and that's without counting Resources and Know-How Tokens).&#10;&bull; Auctioning the Starting Territories: Players bid to seize the best possible starting Territory for their Realms.&#10;&bull; Setting up the Realms: every Ruler autonomously chooses the initial Setup of their Realm.&#10;&#10;ROUND&#10;&bull; 3 Game Rounds: The 3 Game Rounds is where the real action takes place. The Kings have to plan and implement their strategies by issuing orders to the Spies and Mattoks of their own Realm. This is done through the 14 Command Cards, which let Players move their Spies and carry out Actions with the Mattoks.&#10;&#10;END GAME&#10;&bull; Distributing dividends to the shareholders: the Money, Ingots and revenue from the sale of White Whiskey are used to pay&#10;dividends, which drives up the value of the shares of the Realm.&#10;&bull; Announcing the winner: the Player whose shares have reached the highest value is crowned as new Supreme Sovereign of the Stock States.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "West of Souls is innovative solo or cooperative fantasy adventure for 1-6 players. Enter the world of Eloria, plagued by darkness and monsters of a vitriolic nature. You and your party will explore and make decisions that directly affect the world&rsquo;s infrastructure and future. The vastly branching storylines and numerous NPCs found in West of Souls ensure unique game play and future replay ability.&#10;&#10;Enemy encounters and agonizing choices abound in this game and even the simplest of decisions may alter the world as you know it. Players will take up the mantle of an unlikely hero who, through motives of their own, have decided to stop Eloria&rsquo;s impending doom. Be it gold, valor, or a deep empathy for the world around them, the players must work together to gain victory over scenarios and continue on their journey.&#10;&#10;As players progress through the ever-changing world, they will develop their abilities, gain increasingly effective gear, and unlock additional skills specific to their character. Following each completed scenario, player choices will determine the future direction of the party&rsquo;s quest, guaranteeing player involvement in the development of their own story. &#10; The game is split into scenarios that are comprised of an exploration and journey phase, and each turn is split into a time of day (morning, mid-day, dusk, night). In the journey phase of the game, characters with travel throughout the game map discovering locations, triggering events, battling monsters, interacting with the world, and talking with NPCs to gain information about their quest and Eloria&rsquo;s tainted past. Action point-based turns are used within West of Souls. Each player will have a defined number of actions that may be completed on their turn (unless you have unlocked a skill or found some gear that says otherwise). Once enough information has been gathered and players are in the correct location, the exploration phase begins.&#10;&#10;One unique aspect of West of Souls is that the exploration phase is a hybrid of non-linear narrative, card-based battle encounters, and dungeon crawling. In addition, all characters in play do not have to enter the same exploration together, allowing for multiple explorations to occur simultaneously. Within the exploration phase, players will be forced to make harrowing choices, complete skill checks, and defeat beast to move forward. Vital story elements, lore, and history will be revealed to the players as they progress through the game.  &#10;While death is an option in West of Souls, a player is never permanently removed from the game. The main resources in this epic journey are time and stress. If your team does not accomplish their goal within the allotted time frame, Eloria is cast into ruin. Likewise, if the encounters prove too much for your party and your stress level reaches a breaking point, you will lose the game. Victory is achieved at the end of each scenario as players defeat enemies of increasing difficultly and complete the necessary tasks. &#10; This flagship game from Sky Monster Games is an ambitious story telling odyssey that maximizes the use of battle mechanics in combination with non-linear storytelling and character customization.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each party leader is revered and respected by supporters and opponents alike, but are plagued with an insatiable desire for more power. Power is gained by gathering support from the party and by winning the influenceable party members of opponents&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;One party leader is the chairman for the round and takes on certain roles and responsibilities. He or she starts the round by saying, &ldquo;for the people&rdquo; at which point everyone picks up the hand they have been dealt and begins to play in an orderly fashion, always abiding by the rules and laws. Proper respect and decorum must be maintained during play including only speaking at appropriate times and only when required by rules and laws. Players keep each other in check by giving a penalty card from the top of the deck for observed deviation from the rules and laws. One player wins the round by playing his or her last card and proclaiming &ldquo;Power for the People!&rdquo;. The winning player collects power, creates a secret law, and becomes the chairman for the next round.&#10;&#10;Play continues with the next round. All of the existing rules and laws are in force, but now a secret law is in play. Opponents of the new chairman must deduce the action or lack of action that the secret law requires. Doing so will avoid penalties and enable a potential future win allowing him or her to gain power and write a secret law of their own, for which he or she can penalize other players.&#10;&#10;By the final round there may be up to 10 secret laws in effect. At this point it becomes challenging to remember all the laws and rules in order to avoid getting additional cards through penalties. At the end of the final round, the player with the most power becomes the Supreme Leader!&#10;&#10;To review, in Power For The People, players establish the party platform, gain power, create and follow secret laws, penalize offenders, and become Supreme Leader!&#10;&#10;",

It comes with two expansions, the Emigration and Arsenic Expansion, that are not found in the retail edition. They can be obtained in Tinners' Trail: Expansions Box.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Tinners' Trail, set in 19th century Cornwall, you represent a mining conglomerate at the height of the tin and copper mining industry. You must buy plots of land across Cornwall in auctions and survey them for tin and copper, always managing your &quot;work points&quot; and money effectively.&#10;&#10;Once you have a mine in place, it's time to extract the ore and (ideally) make a profit, but the deeper your mine goes, the more expensive the process gets. To reduce the cost of mining, you can place developments, such as ports, train stations, and adits (drainage tunnels), but there's only so many improvements to go around. Once you have made your money &mdash; trying to time the market to sell when prices are high &mdash; you can invest it in industries outside of Cornwall, which gains you victory points. The earlier you invest, the better the return. Can you outplay the competition and make the most money, or will you be left without two shillings to rub together?&#10;&#10;What's changed since 2008?&#10;Increased player count - a game that was once only 3-4 players can now be enjoyed by 1-5 players!&#10;&#10;2 new expansions - the Arsenic expansion, which introduces a new resource, and the Emigration expansion, which sees miners travel overseas.&#10;&#10;Reduced randomness - but still keeping the variability. The board is now set up with tiles instead of the roll of a the dice.&#10;&#10;Improved Auctions - dual-use cards are now an important part of the game, giving you information before an auction or an extra boost after an auction.&#10;&#10;Improved artwork and graphic design&#10;&#10;Improved component quality - with custom meeples and colour blind friendly colours.&#10;&#10;Lord Wallace solo mode - a brand new solo mode.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Take control of one of six unique Corporations and vie for dominance in the Alpha System by utilizing a mix of different actions and resources. Focus on building up your infrastructure and set yourself up for a strong finish or go for fast and immediate rewards. Use your Influence in the council chamber to make sure things progress according to your wishes, or resort to outright aggression to dominate the competition.&#10;&#10;A New Frontier is a highly engaging conflict game where your ability to gauge your opponents is key to victory. Since players can interact with all other players, regardless of position, conflicts are plentiful, but also quite undramatic. There is no player elimination, and you also cannot &ldquo;gang-up&rdquo; on someone, at least not from a conflict perspective. Conflicts are multi-phased, with ample opportunity to outsmart your opponents.&#10;&#10;A New Frontier has nearly no hidden info (the obvious exception being player fleets) and few random elements, and with only 5 turns every decision counts. The goal of the game is to become the most dominant Corporate Republic in the Alpha System, which is achieved by having the most Victory Points by game&rsquo;s end. All types of actions can potentially lead to Victory Points allowing for multi-pronged strategies. In addition to Actions and Credits, players must balance Prestige, which represents their organization&rsquo;s goodwill and reputation, and that is essential for certain aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is centered around four ore-rich planets, with each player being present at every planet. This is where players harvest ore for income, build ships and upgrade mines, as well as carry out attacks against each other. In addition, there are four support areas/phases (Exploration, Politics, Marketing and R &amp; D), where players can choose to diversify in order to gain advantages and Victory Points. Each Turn starts with a Planning Phase where players hiddenly set their strategic plan for the whole turn by using the resources at their disposal. Players then make tactical decisions during each Action Phase within the framework of their strategic plan.&#10;&#10;Depending on chosen strategy, a player will normally amass between 30-60% of their Victory Points during the game, and the rest during end game scoring.&#10;&#10;",

As dusk descends, you can choose to risk danger and stay to gather more resources, or return home to feed and protect your family with blessings and hexes.&#10;&#10;As night falls, Grando stalks Kringa. If Grando stops at a location or home, unprotected workers will fall sick or even placed in the village's crypt. If the crypt fills up, the players lose.&#10;&#10;Players have a limited time to discover how to destroy Grando by fulfilling the secret holder's objectives. Once a secret is discovered, you will learn one of Grando's weaknesses. Ready the weapons and set up a trap to lure Grando in. If you manage to successfully spring the trap and defeat the evil Strigoi, you win! If you fail, you doom Kringa to a fate worse than death!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
