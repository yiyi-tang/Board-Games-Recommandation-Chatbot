Explore new strategies and card combinations to seek new ways of building your dynasty's Legacy.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    New Emperor Rules - During the Third Century, Emperors didn't only sit on the throne in Rome - they ruled from the provinces and commanded armies in the field, where they were at risk of being killed in battle or assassinated.  These optional rules place Emperors directly on the board in place of a Governor or General token.  Bold use of your Emperor will grant you bonuses, but if the Emperor token should be removed from the board, your reign is at an end.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    AI Players - New optional rules for non-player factions driven by easy-to-use &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; instructions will allow 2 or 3 players and even solo players to enjoy a full 4-faction game.

The nine cards bear the words: BRIM, FORM, HEAR, HOT, SHIP, TANK, TIED, WASP, and WOES.  Only the letters A, E, H, I, O, R, S, and T can win - each having exactly three appearances in the combined nine cards; every other letter appears less than three times, if at all.&#10;&#10;HOT was written by Leo Moser and published in Chimaera (Issue 5 - Sep 1975).&#10;&#10;-User summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User summary:&#10;&#10;War of the Rings is a Diplomacy variant written by Jeff Key and published in Chimaera (Issue 13 - Mar 1976).  The basic game follows the 1971 rules, but with numerous exceptions.  The rules were accompanied by a custom color map.&#10;&#10;The game supports six players and the named nations are Mordor, Rohan, Gondor, The Men of the North, The Elves, and The Dwarves.  Although fleets and sea travel are de-emphasized, the map presents five sea areas.  The initial setup does not contain fleets and fleets cannot be built.  However the buildable unit &quot;bunchaboats&quot; is functionally somewhat similar.  The land area is divided into an exceptional number of provinces, many of which have an indicated &quot;terrain&quot; that limits which types of unit may enter (for example, only Goblins, Ents, and Dwarves may enter mountain terrain).  There are thirteen neutral supply centers at the start of play, including The Shire.  The initial land setup heavily favors Mordor which starts with eight provinces; The Dwarves starts with two provinces; all other groups start with three provinces.  This forces most, or all, of the players to align against Mordor.  The initial units include special &quot;double strength&quot; and &quot;triple strength&quot; armies.  During play, only normal strength armies can be created.&#10;&#10;There is an additional special piece, The Ring, that begins in The Shire region.  No player owns The Ring but any player can move The Ring with any army unit that moves from the area that holds it.  Alternately, some units may &quot;put on&quot; The Ring which then becomes inseparable, conferring some significant benefits (including invisibility - the unit receives orders as usual, but they are not made public unless the unit engages in combat).  If the unit &quot;wearing&quot; The Ring is destroyed The Ring remains in the province.&#10;&#10;There are three separate victory conditions: (1) a player may move The Ring to Barad-Dur, destroying it; (2) the Mordor &quot;triple strength&quot; army (AKA Sauron) is eliminated; (3) the Mordor &quot;triple strength&quot; army and The Ring end a turn in the same province.  In the case of (1) or (2), Mordor loses and the relative strengths of the remaining players are compared to determine a winner.  In the case of (3), Mordor wins.&#10;&#10;The rules also present several modifications to the standard rules, primarily regarding the &quot;double strength&quot; and &quot;triple strength&quot; armies.  Too, four turns per year are played.  Intended for postal play, the game supports traditional table play without alteration.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most influence at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each god's deck of cards contains unique strengths and weaknesses and leads to many diverse playing strategies and increased replay-ability.&#10;&#10;Also includes a single player variant with a player-controlled AI called The Fate.

    "Description": "In the early 20th-century, rival steamship lines fiercely competed for speed, luxury, and profit. The legendary Blue Riband award was the greatest prize of all, won by the passenger ship with the fastest westbound transatlantic crossing. In this game, you&rsquo;ll design and operate your own classic transatlantic liner, with one player as Lusitania and the other as Titanic.&#10;&#10;You have two paths to victory: speed or luxury. Focus on one strategy, or try for both at the same time. In the first part of the game, you'll act as a ship designer, competing with your opponent to build the fastest and/or most luxurious ship. You build your ship by placing design cards that can increase your ship's speed, luxury rating, safety level, and profitability.&#10;&#10;In the second part of the game, you'll captain your ship as you and your opponent race across the Atlantic from Southampton, England to New York. Set your speed by deciding how much coal to burn each day, and contend with hazards including icebergs and a U-Boat. Try not to sink or become stranded along the way! The first ship to reach New York wins the Blue Riband award, but you can also win the game by having the most luxurious ship. You earn bonus points through financial profit.&#10;&#10;The game materials are based on historic, public domain photographs and drawings from the early 20th century. The steamship images feature Titanic, Lusitania or their sister ships.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Demolition Derby was written by Bob Chapman and published in Chimaera (Issue 14 - Mar 1976).  The game was designed for postal play (play-by-mail) and supports eight players and one game master.  Subsequent issues of the periodical included play reports.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a single car designated by color (White, Yellow, Orange, Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Black).  The demolition derby is part demolition and part traditional race.  The play board depicts an oval track divided into five racing lanes (A-E) and twenty-six racing zones (1-26), allowing for 130 distinct track locations.  One zone is traversed each turn for each 10 M.P.H. of speed.  Each turn (top and bottom) runs six racing zones with variable, denoted bank (which limits safe speed); each straightaway (left and right) runs for seven racing zones.  Cars may be in the same zone as long as they are not in adjacent lanes.&#10;&#10;Each car has a determined number of &quot;wear&quot; points (damage) and a speed in 10 M.P.H. increments.  Each turn consists of players issuing written orders for their car (intended acceleration, positive or negative; intended lane change; and attempts to baulk, shunt, or spin an opponent).  The game referee then executes the turns' orders using an &quot;order of precedence&quot; for the cars which rotates each turn, following a pre-randomized pattern.&#10;&#10;As a further randomization, a deck of forty &quot;tactics&quot; cards was dealt at the start of each race, each player holding five cards.  These could be played on any turn.  Cards bearing +1, +2, +3, and +4 allowed additional acceleration (in 10 M.P.H. increments) on the turn they are played; the &quot;Superb Driving&quot; card allowed a turn to be safely navigated at any speed.&#10;&#10;The game was intended to be played with one postal turn per week.  A typical, complete race took approximately two years (abt. 100 turns) - though deliberately combative driving could significantly shorten this by player elimination.  Cars that did not receive orders were assumed to follow their lane at a constant speed (with appropriate results).&#10;&#10;-User summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Investorboss! was written by Ian McLaren and published in Chimaera (Issue 15 - Apr 1976).  This simple game was designed for postal play (play-by-mail) and cannot be converted to face-to-face play because turns require one week of real time.  At least two players are needed, though the game may facilitate any number of players (8 players is considered optimum).  At the start of the game, one player is selected as the &quot;investment manager&quot; and this player will execute all of the turns and make a report of results (including their own).  The game runs for a number of weeks (turns) determined at the start of play.&#10;&#10;The game is run by selecting any newspaper published at least once a week that carries at least some financial news and stock listings (the author suggests the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as appropriate).  All players begin with a &pound;100,000 loan taken at interest.  Players submit one turn per week in writing, containing a buy/sell order or orders.  Players may buy or sell any number of shares they can afford in any stock, bond, or security that is routinely reported in the selected newspaper.  Players may also repay a loan, in whole or in part, if desired.&#10;&#10;The &quot;investment manager&quot; player calculates a trade expense using a standard (given) formula depending on the type of security, and then adjusts the player's portfolio as appropriate.  On the weekly mark, the newspaper issue of that day is used to determine the net value of all player holdings (including appreciation, depreciation, and dividends).  The loan rate for outstanding loans is deducted, and players that are &quot;in the hole&quot; are forced to take overdrafts at higher loan rates (loan interest rates are fixed by the rules).  The &quot;investment manager&quot; player then makes a report to all players.&#10;&#10;After the determined number of week (turns) has elapsed, all shares in any security are sold, all costs are calculated and deducted, all loans are repaid (if possible), and a final valuation is made for all players.  The player with the highest monetary value is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Your previous exploits have garnered the attention of one of the most prestigious Bounty Hunting Guilds, The Severed Skull. But first, you must prove yourself worthy of initiation, and for that you must compete against others who have also been chosen.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over a series of rounds. On your turn, you will be tracking down a variety of the universe's most notorious fugitives.&#10;&#10;You start with a hand size of 4 cards, each representing the fugitives you are currently tracking. On each turn, all players will secretly select one fugitive to catch. Once all players have chosen a fugitive, the fugitives are revealed and placed in each player's Temporary Holding Cell aboard their ships. Then, in turn order, starting with the 1st player, each player has the opportunity to activate the Special Action that is awarded for the fugitive&rsquo;s capture.&#10;&#10;After all actions have been taken, the fugitives are then moved from the players&rsquo; Temporary Holding Cells to their ships&rsquo; Brigs. If at this time any player has 5 different fugitives wanted for 5 different crimes and are wanted by 5 different Bounty Issuing Organizations, then the game promptly ends. If not, all players track new fugitives by drawing back up to 4 cards in hand.&#10;&#10;At this time the 1st player marker is passed clockwise, and another round begins.&#10;&#10;This cycle continues until someone captures a winning set of fugitives or until there are no more fugitives left to track (i.e., the draw deck runs out). At which time, scores are tallied and a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to City in Peril!&#10;&#10;This is a two to four person, free-for-all tactical navigation game. It plays in about 30-60 minutes regardless of the number of players. Each player controls a hero, and the goal of the game is to rescue the most civilians. There are 100 civilians that spawn throughout the game at an increasing rate. Players repeatedly navigate their hero from their corner of the city to the opposite corner using abilities from a common power pool.&#10;&#10;The board is a top-down view of a city. There is a 6 by 6 grid of street intersections that have one of five obstacles. Civilians appear at these intersections by dice rolls, but the heroes must use power cards to get to them. Each turn, a player chooses one of five pairs of power cards. After their turn is over, the abilities are discarded and replaced by a new pair of cards. Game-play continues until all the civilians are saved.&#10;&#10;Each player has a unique starting corner of the board and must move forward towards the opposite corner. Although there is a common pool of powers available to all players, what is useful to one player might not be useful to another.

    "Description": "Introduction&#10;&#10;The game is a cooperative, 1 to 6 players, settled in the Elements Realities universe, a concept by Giortech GmbH.&#10;&#10;In the game, the players are Temporal Agents, in a Time Agency set in the near future, that jump in time for dangerous missions in the past, in the ancient Greece.&#10;The agents must protect the Timeline and preserve the Reality from the attacks of a mysterious force only known as... Darklings! All the wonderful discoveries of the ancient Greece, the democracy, the philosophy, the arts, the sciences, are at risk. The Agents jump in the middle of the most important key events of the mankind to protect the Reality.&#10;&#10;Produced at LudoFact, this made in Germany game is presented in German Version. English Version is coming shortly.&#10;&#10;The Game mechanics of Elements Realities&#10;&#10;The game is cooperative as all the agents have to fulfill dangerous missions in the past to protect our Reality from the attacks of the treacherous and mysterious Darklings.&#10;Each player chooses an Agent with specific unique skills. Then, each agent chooses a mission card among the currently available in the Agency, and starts the jump procedures: First a briefing card is executed, and then the jump is done on the Time Jump Track with a dice roll, based on the time distance in epoch to jump back. If the jump is missed, then a roll is made on the Jump Failure Track, where the Agent can influence the result by spending his own Reality Chits (the &quot;coins&quot; of the game). When an Agent manages to jump successfully into the past, the Mission story is built. The mechanism of building the mission is so that it is almost impossible to build the same mission twice. Every mission card has objectives on the bottom, and a sequence of Events cards is extracted, each containing one or more objectives symbols, until all the missions goals are paid off. A certain number of Reality Chits are positioned on the Mission card, as final reward. The Agent then each turn faces one Event card that can be passed by successfully rolling against some of the personal skills. Every Event passed shall make gain or lose Reality Chits on the Mission card. If at any moment the number of Chits should go less than zero, the Mission is lost and the Agent is transferred back to the Agency, where can start a new Mission. Every lost Mission reduces by 1 the level of our Reality. Every successful Mission increases the level by 1. Goal of the game is to reach level 10. When all Agents have moved in a round, before the next, there come the Darklings. An Agent per turn possesses the Destiny in his hands, a special white wooden Chit. Whoever owns the Destiny faces the Darklings in that round. A Time Epoch is moved forward, a Reality Chit is given to the Agency from the bank, and a Darklings card is extracted and positioned on the board. If the Darklings card has the same symbol of the current Epoch (circle, triangle or square) then the card comes into effect, and the negative effects are executed. Before that, the owner of the Destiny can decide to roll against the Darklings cards as many dices as many Reality Chits of the Agency is willing to pay. The roll is made against the current Reality Level, so if the Agents are losing the game it will become increasingly more difficult, and if they are winning it will become easier. For every successful roll, a Darklings card of choice can be removed and the positive effect on it is executed. Then a new round starts.&#10;&#10;One of the most interesting aspects of the game is its configurability. The difficulty level is based on the starting level chosen for our Reality and the Darklings Reality. This amounts to almost 100 difficulty levels to choose from, in a 2D space of difficulties. Elements Realities will never become obsolete! Then the Game is unique in that an Agent can join the game in every moment, and can leave in any moment. No more uh-uh moments when a friend knocks at the door and you are already in a one hour game. Just offer a chair and an Agent card. The same if someone has to leave or pause the participation during a game. This *is* freedom!&#10;&#10;The Game of Elements Realities has many facets: family game, strategy choices, roll of dices, collaboration between players, deep immersive story. The presence of Special Missions that build exciting Side Stories that span for multiple Mission cards, give the game an uncommon depth. The Agents, the Stories, the entire World of Elements Realities, are depicted in the Science Fiction Novels that are regularly published. An entire Universe comes to life. Giortech shall also produce a first pilot episode of a series.&#10;&#10; A final note from the Author &#10;&#10;I want to make a special note, at the end of this presentation of Elements Realities, to put under light the fact that the Missions presented in the game, and the surrounding stories, happen in the real Greek history. By playing the game, you will learn important events that forged the world in which we live, and the dates in which these events happened. So the Edutainment aspect is great and unique.&#10;Last, but not least, I leave you with a thought. There is a deep analogy between our lives and the Universe of Elements Realities. As the Agents jump in Time to protect the great discoveries of the ancient Greece, the Philosophy, the Arts, the Democracy, so everyone of us, in our today time, must not take for granted once and for all terms like Culture, Arts, Democracy, but we have to nurture them every day a little.&#10;&#10;Each of us is a Time Agent, in our time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "TMG Deluxified version of Gentes - Kickstarter only&#10;&#10;Gentes is an interesting civilization game with an innovative timing mechanism.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gentes&quot; is the Latin plural word for greater groups of human beings (e.g., tribes, nations, people; singular: &quot;gens&quot;). In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:&#10;&#10;Buy new cards from the common display&#10;Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)&#10;Train/Educate your people&#10;Build/found cities&#10;Take money&#10;To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.&#10;&#10;It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.&#10;&#10;Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III. Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols. Build cities to enlarge your options!&#10;&#10;The differences between the Deluxified and regular edition:&#10;&#10;Includes &quot;New Cities&quot; Expansion&#10;A foil stamped box&#10;6 oversized meeples&#10;24 normal sized meeples&#10;89 metal coins&#10;28 wood action tokens&#10;21 wood lock tokens&#10;60 wood hourglass tokens&#10;4 dual layered player boards&#10;4 custom shaped score tokens&#10;folded space custom insert&#10;1 drawstring bag&#10;1 upgraded round token&#10;&#10;",

Each year, the mega city of Gettown plays host to a gladiatorial arena match like no other... 'The Tournament'. Combatants with powerful abilities and high tech weaponry, fight to the death to win wealth, fame and, the ultimate position of Master of Gettown.&#10;&#10;Masters of Gettown is the world's first 'full contact dice' battling game. To that end, each game sees all players throwing combat dice in to a three dimensional acrylic arena, trying to end with the highest combat score each turn to either deal damage or defend themselves. During the game, players are encouraged to throw their dice at their own or other player's dice in order to physically change their value as well as activate character or combat abilities via the custom 'ability' die.&#10;&#10;With this new 'full contact dice' combat mechanic, interchangeable arena bases (covered in various effect areas to aim for and avoid), a plethora of different characters and futuristic weaponry to equip them with, no two games will ever be the same. Also, with the inclusion of both easy to learn 'beginner' rules as well as 'experienced' rules, players can quickly get to grips with the practice of throwing their dice at other dice and then move on to advanced aspects of the game like bidding hit points and equipment drafting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The hero player was required to raid through woodland and into a small pre-mapped dungeon area with a team of seven miniatures. Meanwhile the evil player had to use his army of eighty orc-like &quot;Sprites&quot; to defend against the heroes incursion.&#10;&#10;From the Rulebook: We have devised these rules for use with the Thane Tostig range of fantasy figures designed and produced by Barry Minot, who also drew the illustrations.&#10;&#10;They are intended to give an easy to play, fast moving, fantasy action game, which though ideal for the younger wargamer, will provide a basis on which older wargamers and fantasy fanatics can build, adding as many further complications as their fertile minds may devise.&#10;&#10;",

After breaking out of the Ardennes the German armored and motorized forces drove for the Channel ports to divide the Allied forces from one another. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in Belgium and the British High Command in London were in a quandary as to how best to proceed; whether to find a way to breakout of the German encirclement or withdraw from the continent back to Great Britain. The Allied forces in Calais, composed of recently landed British regular and reservist (Territorials) infantry, as well as elements of the 1st Armoured Division, received contradictory orders as to whether they were to defend the port, advance and attack, or withdraw. The battle of Calais in many ways came to stand for the tragic outcome  of the campaign for the Allies in 1940. The garrison&rsquo;s determined stand also took a toll on the German&rsquo;s 10th Panzer Division, and that any invasion of Great Britain would not be easy or similar to what transpired in France and Low Countries.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;A complete game of But Not In Vain is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     This rules booklet&#10;     One 11&quot; by 17&quot; map&#10;     One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet&#10;     180 single-sided, un-mounted counters&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hamsters of Panama is new, original, simple but not stupid, funny but not childish, strategic but not too complicated board game. This board game allows players interact with each other, make strategies, harm fast runners or annoying talkers and many more. &#10;To win the game players have to play as many rounds as it takes to move 12 steps ahead to reach paradise Panama island. Those steps are divided in four different difficulty levels from the easiest one to the hardest one.&#10;&#10;In each round players get two special cards with certain features and take as many number cards as they think are enough for their playing strategy. After that players use special cards. Finally, results are calculated and players who meet level conditions move forward to Panama.&#10;&#10;It should be mentioned that there is only one plane to Panama and many hamsters who want to be first, so don't be lazy, run fast, think hard, outsmart opponents and reach Panama island.&#10;&#10;Join us and be prepared to survive the ultimate journey to Panama!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Bollywood Game is a typical Bollywood movie turned into a strategic and competitive card game, for everyone. Take this filmy journey as your friends turn foes, your romance is put to the test and you gotta fight for what is right at every turn.&#10;&#10;Players are able to keep track of each of their attribute points (Strength, Charm and Kindness) To prove your skills you must earn points for each of the three attributes. Points start at 0 and will evolve throughout the game. While players get ready to play, a Hero or Heroine card is laid down on the table &ndash; this card becomes the object of affection for all players. Each of these Hero or Heroine cards have attribute points, and  once these points are met by a player, he or she can play the Happy Ending card and win the game.&#10;&#10;Once players decide which Hero or Heroine will be on the table as the goal of the game, the remaining Hero and Heroine cards are put aside and no longer a part of the game.&#10;Action Cards, Actor Cards, Song Cards and Counter Attack Cards are shuffled and SIX CARDS are then distributed to each player, and cannot be displayed to anyone.  &#10;The remaining cards become the game deck and will be put face down on the table. This is the deck players will draw cards from in order to advance in the game.  &#10;During his turn, a player can play any card he has in hands. His turn will finish when the player discards all the cards he wishes from his hand to the &lsquo;discard deck&rsquo; next to the original &lsquo;playing deck&rsquo;. Cards will be face up on the &lsquo;dicard deck&rsquo;. &#10;The player can also finish his turn by simply choosing to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; without discarding any cards during his turn. But the player cannot end his turn with more than 3 cards in his hand, if a player has more than 3 cards in hand at the end of his turn he must choose a remaining card to be discarded. &#10;All the cards used during a turn (i.e.: Actor Cards, Song Cards, Counter Attack Cards) will be discarded to the &lsquo;discard deck&rsquo; as well. &#10;After all players complete their turns, the first player will draw as many cards as necessary from the playing deck until that player has 6 cards in hand&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "THIRD REICH: THE CARD GAME is a historical game of World War II designed by John Prados that uses cards and can be played between two to four players. Each player controls a side or a Front in this multifaceted game, seeking to defeat the opponent by winning the most Battlefield cards before the end of play. There are no dice, tokens, counters or anything but cards in this game.&#10;&#10;Force and Unit Cards&#10;&#10;These cards represent military forces of various nations in the war. The Basic Game contains a selection of Axis and Allied divisions and corps and armies for the Soviet.  An illustration shows the type of troops, or a typical combat action, a unit insignia, or other distinctive element. The card often has brief comments on the actual unit. It will show a combat value.  Certain unit types have special abilities in the game.  In general, battles will be resolved based on the CVs of the Army Cards on both sides of the action. The player draws cards from a pile called the Mobilization Deck, holds them in her/his hand, and then deploys them to locations on the tabletop.  ,.&#10;&#10;Support Cards&#10;&#10;These cards represent important Leaders in the war, key command Headquarters, and Air Force units. Support cards by themselves have no Combat Value. Instead, they add their printed CV to other Army Cards present with them. This support value is shown by brackets printed around the card&rsquo;s CV. If alone on a Battlefield when the opponent attacks, Support Cards&mdash;excepting Air Force units&mdash;are eliminated. Air Force unit cards immediately fly to another Battlefield on the same Front where friendly cards are present. If unable to meet that condition, Air Force cards are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Special Cards&#10;&#10;Special Cards come in many varieties and have particular functions. The capture of Battlefield Cards is the player&rsquo;s main goal in the game. Battlefield Cards provide locations for combat, create a timeline for the war, and award Victory Points to the player who captures them. They are specific to one of three geographic Fronts in the game.  Event Cards add to the play and can upset the best of plans; they are self-explanatory. Fuel Cards represent economic resources and shape the actions the player can conduct in his turn. Battle Condition Cards set characteristics for a fight in progress.&#10;&#10;The Board&#10;&#10;The Board can be a game mat or any tabletop as a geographic space divided into three main areas called Fronts. The Fronts occupy the center of the space between the players and collectively are termed the Combat Zone. At each player&rsquo;s edge of the table, she/he will require three spaces. One of these is for the player&rsquo;s Mobilization Deck, which consists of all unplayed cards. One is the Discard Pile of cards that have been expended. The third is for the player&rsquo;s Strategic Reserve, which comprises cards the player has put into play but not yet deployed to a specific Battlefield.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Transform a standard deck of playing cards into an immersive game of two-player baseball in Hardball Shuffle.&#10;&#10;Both players draw rosters of ten cards from the deck. Each card represents a ballplayer on the team, with the ballplayer's relative skill determined by the value of the card. Select one card from each roster as the pitcher, and fashion the rest into a batting order.&#10;&#10;As the game begins, batters secure a hit if their card is worth more than that of the pitcher. The bigger the differential, the more bases a batter achieves. Conversely, if the batter's card value is lower than the pitcher, they are out. The standard rules of baseball apply, with three outs to a half inning and the victor is the player with more runs at game end.&#10;&#10;Understanding several wrinkles is key to a winning strategy. From the batting team's perspective, a batter automatically strikes out no matter the batting card's value if they share the pitcher's suit. On the other hand, batters become incrementally more powerful if they share the same suit as any teammates already on base. And base runners sharing the same value as the batter automatically steal a base.&#10;&#10;For their part, the fielding team must adjust for the fact that their pitcher's card is limited to a maximum value of 10, even if it is a face card. Furthermore, pitchers become fatigued over time, with a pitching card's effective value declining by one for every inning pitched. To mitigate this, a new pitcher may be selected out of a player's batting lineup between innings, with that hole in the order replaced from the minor leagues (drawn from the deck).&#10;&#10;Lest the innings start to blur together, a team's lineup is far from static. Each player demotes a batter to the minor leagues at the end of every inning, selecting from among a handful of minor league call-ups to fill the void. It is never too late for a last-minute comeback!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Welcome Battle Commanders! The future of your faction's survival is depending on you! Gain influence and expand your forces to strategically defeat the opposing faction. You win the battle when you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s health to zero. However, a Battle Commander must be cautious if their opponent is off-initiative. Since Battle for Sularia is a round-based card game, if your opponent is off-initiative, they have the chance to strike back and reduce your health total below theirs and thereby defeating you and winning the game!&#10;&#10;FEATURES/GAME PLAY INCLUDES:&#10;&#10;Multiple Play Modes&#10;To start play immediately, you can play with the pre-constructed 60 card play deck included in the box. Players can then play in our &quot;60/90&quot; constructed format by customizing their play decks with the additional cards provided in the box! If draft play is more your style, we suggest adding one box of Reign of Terror to our Battle for Sularia core set box, which also supports 2-4 player draft play.&#10;&#10;Construction Point Values&#10;Unique &quot;60/90&quot; deck construction system. Each card has a construction point value of 1 to 4 points. Each deck must have a minimum of 60 cards and a deck cannot exceed a total construction value of 90 points. This system pushes the envelope on deck construction and maintains value and interests for all cards within the set &ndash; not just a few select overpowered options.&#10;&#10;Two-resource System&#10;Engaging two-resource system which includes influence and sularium. Influence increases once per round, while each player uses their influence to establish sites on their turn to help build their sularium stockpiles. Sularium is used to deploy combatants, which are used to attack your opponent's sites. The two-resource system in turn provides additional strategies for repeatable game play.&#10;&#10;Round-based Game&#10;Simultaneous combat! The game runs on a round-based system, which allows each player to complete their turn before the round is over.&#10;&#10;Lore and Art&#10;In addition to our engaging game play, we've forged our own path in terms of game setting. This allows us to explore new content and visuals without restrictions, which in turn provides new players with a fresh start and removes the barrier of entry associated with older legacy games and stories.&#10;&#10;SETTING:&#10;&#10;Reign of Terror: The Protoan introduces a brand new faction to the world of Sularia. The Protoan were originally designed as a biological weapon alternative to the conventional weapons of their time. They were engineered to aggressively spread a viral infection that would pacify an opposing force or civilian population, while leaving the surrounding infrastructures and environment relatively unharmed. Of course, &ldquo;relatively unharmed&rdquo; is a very subjective point of view. Because, if the Protoan could not pacify an enemy with its virus, then they would simply devour them along with anything else in their way.&#10;&#10;The breeding facilities of the Protoan were believed to be one of numerous lost technologies of the time before the apocalyptic event know as the Fracture&mdash;nearly a millennium ago. Since the Fracture, they have evolved deep underground&mdash;far beyond their original design. Furthermore, the bio-engineering developed to control their population no longer seems to be effective, as they continue to spread at a rate far beyond their original life expectancy perimeters. As if the power struggle between the Jotune and Synthien wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, this new emerging threat puts the very survival of everyone on the planet at risk.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW:&#10;&#10;Reign of Terror: The Protoan is a new stand-alone card game and core faction that is compatible with our other Battle for Sularia card game titles. The Protoan have their own unique game play strategies, as well as familiar options you would expect to find in a competitive card game. See the keywords for a list of new mechanisms.&#10;&#10;NEW KEYWORDS:&#10;&#10;VIRUS/INFECTION&#10;&#10;The VIRUS/INFECTION mechanism is a two-part ability. VIRUS is represented by counters that buff your Protoan combatants in some way. However, when those VIRUS counters are transferred&mdash;through various methods&mdash;to an opponent&rsquo;s combatant, they become known as INFECTION counters. As the name implies, infection is not a good thing for your combatants. If your combatants become seriously infected, they will die.&#10;&#10;CHALLENGE&#10;&#10;If a Protoan combatant has the CHALLENGE keyword, it can single out an opponent&rsquo;s combatant to defend against it. Whether through intimidation, mind control, or some primal subconscious response of the defender&mdash;it also doesn&rsquo;t matter if the defender is reset or activated&mdash;it has to defend. While this may seem like a good idea by the defender for whatever reason, it usually results in it being completely devoured.&#10;&#10;HARDENED&#10;&#10;In Reign of Terror, we introduce HARDENED as a keyword that is linked to sites, however it's possible you will see this keyword on combatants in the near future. The ability is pretty solid, pun intended, as it prevents blast-through damage. So if you are familiar with the basic rules, you'll know how useful an ability like this will be in order to stay alive.&#10;&#10;Reign of Terror was divided into two parts&mdash;Reign of Terror: The Protoan and Reign of Terror: The Exsularian. They are scheduled to launch in March and May 2018, respectively.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Noir is an expansion authored by Stephane Anquetil, a very talented writer with credentials including Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective scenarios as well as Escape Books and Box (404 &eacute;ditions).&#10;&#10;In Noir, the whole group is collectively representing one private detective with unconventional methods.&#10;&#10;Instead of Forensic Contacts, players have 4 action cards they can use at any point and any moment:&#10;&#10;Spy&#10;Break-In&#10;Bribe&#10;Intimidate&#10;&#10;You won't be able to intimidate everyone without repercussions. &#10;Also, your money is in a shortage, so you can't bribe everyone you meet.&#10;Noir really brings another side to crime busting!&#10;&#10;This Expansion requires the base game (London) to be played. It also requires an app to work (it's impossible to play without it), but once downloaded no Internet connection is needed to play. You currently need Android 4.4 or newer, or iOS 8.0 or newer to run the app, which may change in the future.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to teach about the use of intelligence resources in tracking someone down.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around hidden information, with each side playing on their own hidden game board behind a screen. El Chapo&rsquo;s team is constantly moving around inside Mexico trying to evade the law, but the cartel leader has certain tastes and expectations. He&rsquo;s not just willing to sit inside a hole somewhere and is interested in leading an active, social lifestyle. Law enforcement has to use that against him.&#10;&#10;The key to the game is the facilitator. It&rsquo;s their responsibility to keep the game moving by interpreting the rules and feeding them to players on the fly. But in Kingpin, the facilitator also plays the role of referee. They have an important role in moving the action forward and revealing information to both sides.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Collection compares favorably to the popular cooperative game Pandemic. In Clopper's game, a group of players must work together to resolve three major crises across the globe. The object is for players, who each represent different types of CIA officers, to collect enough relevant intel to resolve all three crises. If any one of the three impending disasters boils over (as represented by three increasing &quot;fire&quot; meters), the team loses. Every game must have at least three players to fill the roles of &quot;political analyst,&quot; &quot;military analyst,&quot; and &quot;economic analyst.&quot; Those three are only able to collect intel in their specific fields, while additional players (up to seven on a team) have their own specialties.&#10;&#10;The difficulty comes from the low number of actions each player can do per turn, along with how quickly the fire meter ratchets up. Players can take two actions per turn: move your agent around the globe, foster new relationships in your current location, or attempt to acquire intel. The latter move is a dice roll. Those rolls are bolstered by having more relationships in a certain zone, by having fellow agents in that same zone (if they offer a specific &quot;colocator&quot; bonus), by having bonus cards, and by how good your relationship is with a specific agency.&#10;&#10;",

These areas of influence themselves change as the relics move, and often overlap with those of your opponent.&#10;&#10;The first player to unite a matching set of four relics wins the game, but as you consolidate your power over one house, your control over the realm diminishes. Dance effortlessly from one alliance to another while quietly establishing your dominance over the realm, until your opponent can do nothing but watch helplessly as you seize the throne!&#10;&#10;The crystal staff from the wizard&rsquo;s college, an enchanted lute from the bard&rsquo;s guild, the cutlass of the pirate king, or the black knight&rsquo;s helm; the deck of relics consists of forty cards, each an original painting by legendary artist Sam Ballard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Most of the actions involved small craft armed with automatic weapons and torpedoes attacking other patrolling coastal forces as well as supply convoys and small war ships. Most of the actions took place under the cover of darkness since stealth and surprise were vital to the survival of these small craft.&#10;&#10;This is not a game for large capital ships or huge fleets. The game is designed to allow each player to assume the command of a handful of small boats in order to refight the type of actions that were typical of the coastal action fought throughout the war.&#10;&#10;Ideally these rules are used with 1/600th or 1/1200th scale models. Any Naval game will come with a whole host of data for the ships and vessels involved, and this set is no different.&#10;&#10;To keep this piece to a manageable size the publisher has deposited all such data in the Files section of the TooFatLardies Yahoo Group.&#10;&#10;",

Its story is heating up, and the most climactic event is about to begin: The Tournament Battles!&#10;&#10;In this game, players are readers of the manga &quot;BOOKMAKERS&quot;. The player who has been most excited at the manga wins the game. The game is published in the same format as 'Weekly Shonen Jump', a very popular weekly manga in Japan. The designer is publishing under his own label &#197;&#140;tsuka seisaku (&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#232;&#163;&#189;&#228;&#189;&#156;) outside of his other work with KUA. The doujin publisher Gyunbuku-ya (&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#133;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#177;&#139;) is listed for design work on the game, not strictly as the game publisher.&#10;&#10;There are nine competitors in the tournament. At the beginning of the game, each player is randomly assigned a competitor as their favorite character. Players take turns placing a competitor to form a tournament bracket. Then players secretly choose who will be the champion of the tournament.&#10;&#10;There are eight battles in the tournament. Most of a battle proceeds automatically, and rough probability of victory is calculated easily. But before the battle begins, players have some chances to place a fan letter face-down on a competitor to modify the result toward their favor.&#10;&#10;Here are how you get excited (score victory points).&#10;1) You score points when your favorite character wins a battle, and ultimately, you score big points when your favorite character wins the tournament. &#10;2) Each competitor has a destined rival. You score points when your favorite character fights with their destined rival. Win or lose doesn't matter. &#10;3) For each battle, you score points if you have correctly predicted who will win the battle. &#10;4) You score points if you have correctly predicted the champion of the tournament.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest total wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of black, green, and gray cats (six each), blue and red cats (three each), golden cats (four), and eight music notes.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you reveal a card, then stop and collect that card or reveal another card. If you reveal a type of card that's already been shown, then your turn ends, you collect nothing, and all revealed cards are laid face-down again. If you stop before this, you collect the revealed cards except for a revealed note card, which is turned face down again. If you collect a blue and red cat, thereby reuniting the lovecats, you score 2 points; if you collect a pair of matching cats, you score 1 point. Golden cats are wild and can be paired with any color. You cannot use the same blue cat to score for both lovecats and a pair.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 8 points wins. You can do this solely by collecting cats, but another possibility is to start your turn by saying &quot;Note atsume&quot; (&quot;Collecting notes), then reveal only note cards &mdash; which are worth 1 point each &mdash; until you have a total of 8 points between cats and notes, thereby winning the game; if you flip anything other than a music note (i.e., a cat), your turn ends and you must hide those notes once again, while giving the cat card to the player on your left. Hope you didn't make them win!&#10;&#10;",

You can attempt to complete your deck by trading cards with other Phreakers. They may be kind and donate to your cause willfully. You both may consent to a fair trade. Ideally, you will both desire to battle in The Stream for the card(s) you need. Winner takes the spoils.&#10;&#10;Why does a complete deck matter? Look at the back of the deck. Do you see it? The art...it's incomplete. Complete the art, find the puzzles and capture the flags.&#10;&#10;Inspiration&#10;The game Phreaker was inspired to provide the CypherCon 3.0 attendees a fun set of puzzles, with the option to have something they can continue using and collecting long after CypherCon 3.0 has ended. A byproduct of the game's inspiration is to use all proceeds from the sale of decks at the Midwest Gaming Classic and other conferences to support the Hak4Kidz NFP charity.&#10;&#10;Many hours, people, and scrapped ideas went into creating what we hope dials you up into the exciting world of phreaking and hacking that was the two decades from 1970 to 1990.&#10;&#10;Time to get your phreak on.

    "Description": "Family friendly 2 player baseball game that uses a dueling dice rolling system. Draft your team, set your line up and outwit your opponent in this fast-paced 2 player game.&#10;&#10;Each player will take turns drafting players from a pool of 30 character cards, until they have filled their team. Each team will draft 9 batters and 3 pitchers each in any order they choose. You will need to set your lineup for your batters 1-9 and decide on which pitcher you will use to start the game.&#10;&#10;Each game is only 3 innings long. This is to keep the games shorter, kid friendly and gets you quicker into the next game. (We suggest you pitch a new pitcher each inning however, in advanced games you can play a full 9 inning game. In those cases it's suggested you pitch a new pitcher every 3 innings)&#10;&#10;All players have a special power that can be activated when they roll a Crush/Dominate on their die roll while batting/pitching. This power often gives that character a huge advantage during that at bat to succeeded or in the pitchers case to get the batter out.&#10;&#10;Pitching &amp; Hitting &#10;Once you set your lineup and selected your pitcher, the game starts. Home team will pitch first and the visiting team will bat first. The goal of the pitcher is to get the batter out, either by strike out or through the contact deck in which the batter can hit into an out. The batters goal is to make contact with the pitch and draw from the contact deck to get a hit. Each player will pick one of the 3 colored dice that stand for each of the types of pitches in the game. The dice have numbers ranging from 1-5 and 1 CRIT Side. Both players pick 1 die to roll and then roll at the same time, then check the results. The Pitcher gets a +1 to their die roll if the batter did not match the pitchers colored die. This is for not guessing the right pitch in the at bat. However if the batter does match the pitch color they would receive the +1 to their die roll. If the batter meets or exceeds the pitchers roll they make contact with the ball and draws a single card from the hit deck. If the Pitcher exceeds the batters die roll the batter receives 1 strike. On 3 strikes the batter is out. If either player rolls the CRIT Side, that character activates their own power. It's often a hit for the batter and a strike for the Pitcher automatically but with card manipulation along with it.&#10;&#10;The Hit Deck has 50 cards and it's filled with automatic hits like: Home Runs, Triples, Doubles and Singles. There are also Contact Play Cards where it's hit out into the field and the pitchers team must successfully make a play on the ball or the batter gets a hit. Not to forget the dreaded automatic outs as well as foul balls. Many special powers allow you to draw multiple cards from the contact deck to give you the best chance at getting on base.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;30 Beautifully designed players, 24 Hitters with 6 Pitchers.&#10;50 Card Hit Deck.&#10;6 Colored Dice Pitching &amp; Hitting: Fastball, Curveball &amp; Changeup.&#10;2 Standard D6 for Fielding.&#10;10x10 Playmat.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tucked away in the corner of the tribe&rsquo;s archives, a dusty tome has been discovered. In it, scholars have come across what had only been legend: a new method of harnessing the power of the glyphs. Why had this tome been hidden away? Unfortunately, the scholars learned the answer to their question much too late, and cursed they ever found the tome&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Glyph of Destruction is a new glyph in the land of Tundrus. This glyph, as the name suggests, is not to be trifled with. The new method of harnessing the glyphs has remarkable power: Players are able to generate doubles of any glyph they desire with ease. But such power comes at a cost. In rare instances, the method doesn&rsquo;t generate the desired glyph, but instead forms an entirely new glyph. A glyph that eradicates the power the player once had.&#10;&#10;During a champion&rsquo;s REPLENISH phase, players may elect to temporarily substitute active dice for one or more of five black dice. Each of these dice specialize in one of the five other glyphs. Four of the sides have a double-glyph of the die&rsquo;s specialization. Be warned, however, for the other two sides have the Destruction Glyph. Any time the Destruction Glyph is rolled, the die is immediately locked in (can&rsquo;t be rerolled), and the original die that was substituted for the black die is trashed. Once the black die has performed its function that activation, it is returned to the general stock and players regain the die that was substituted (assuming it wasn&rsquo;t destroyed).&#10;&#10;",
