There are 500 cards included.&#10;&#10;Stereotype Cards present the players with a statement asserting a stereotype. Players must determine if the statement is right (true) or racist (false). While Debate Cards are subjective statements that players will vote on to determine if it's right or racist - and unlike America, majority vote wins!&#10;&#10;But be careful, too many wrong answers and you run the risk of being labelled:&#10;a) a racist bigot who incorrectly believes in too many stereotypes OR&#10;b) a sissy snowflake that cries racism when it doesn't apply.&#10;&#10;",

This expansion pack features phrases that sound a lot like famous movie quotes&hellip;but just &quot;off&quot; enough to challenge players and generate lots of laughs. Players draw from the deck and read the phrase as best as they can, but it's not so easy to do when the mouthpiece is hindering them from forming words correctly. Players try to say phrases such as &quot;We need to walk about your weepy mess reports&quot;. Teammates must correctly guess the phrase in under a minute in order to earn the card. The team with the most cards at the end of the game wins. The expansion pack can be added to the original Speak Out game or 1 player can use the mouthpiece and everyone else can guess what he or she is saying. (Timer not included in expansion pack.)&#10;&#10;Contents: 144 Pieces of Content on 72 Double Sided Content Cards, 1 Washable Mouth Piece, Instructions.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately for you, your free-spirited sprites frequently switch teams and help your opponent accumulate bliss points instead of you! By maintaining a well-staffed team, complete tasks and accumulate bliss to win the game.&#10;&#10;Each round, players place at least 1 gnome card face-down from their hand. Simultaneously reveal gnomes and determine who will resolve their cards first. Use your gnomes to fulfill requirements depicted by the current task cards. Doing so will score bliss and sometimes recruit loyal enchanted animals who will help you in future rounds. Finally, both players pass played gnomes to the opponent for use in the next round, while also keeping their own unplayed gnomes. Win by gaining 77 bliss.&#10;&#10;Distinctive mechanics include (1) gaining your opponent's expended cards, (2) a sliding card system to generate fresh tasks that you can slightly foresee, and (3) an automa to support solo play.&#10;&#10;Distinctive theming includes (1) garden gnomes, (2) silly illustrations, and (3) an unrepuntant love of puns in the flavor text.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

No two journeys are ever the same.&#10;&#10;You begin the journey with a clan of eight people - a mix of adults, youth, elders and toddlers who each contribute dice to the clan's dice pool. Each turn, you decide how far to journey. You can camp in place to rest and remove weariness, or move more quickly through a landscape of forest, meadows, rivers and other types of terrain. Be careful of moving too quickly, however, or members of your clan will become weary.&#10;&#10;Each time you draw a Terrain card, you also draw an Event card. Depending on the cards, your clan might have to deal with anything from a sudden blizzard to an encounter with stragglers from another clan.,On each day of your journey, you choose whether to craft clothing and shelter to keep out the cold, to entertain the clan to keep morale up, or to forage for food and medicinal plants. You can only perform two of these activities, so choose wisely - whichever activity you don't choose will cause members of your clan to become hungry, sad or cold. At the end of the day, you check to see if any of your clan become sick - or if they die from illness.&#10;&#10;When your clan finally reaches the cave, the game is scored based on how many of your clan survived, and whether they are sick, injured, or suffering from a condition.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The scenarios focus on the battles around Hill 253.5 and the plains to the east of the hill.

After the first wave, the aliens will attack again with deadlier force - you win if you are able to repel both waves without running out of resources. Having a good variety and spread of defenders is critical to efficiently counter the invaders.&#10;&#10;The game is heavily reliant on luck. Despite this, there&rsquo;s still an undercurrent of subtle strategy, related to concepts of probability and mathematical parity.&#10;&#10;Area 52 is a solo tower-defense game played with a deck of regular playing cards, inspired by games such as Button Men and Onslaught. The rules were created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Boocoo Fire Mission is the result of 3 years of research and playtesting, drawing from first-hand accounts of the war to create a wargame seasoned with plenty of historical flavor. A simple and effective hidden movement system allows players to really sweat as they try to work out if it's safe to cross that open field in front of them. Plans don't usually survive contact with the enemy, and a number of mishap tables help to create a narrative experience that goes beyond your average &quot;move and shoot&quot; wargame.&#10;&#10;Boocoo Fire Mission is aimed at 6mm or 15mm miniatures, and can be played on a 4' x 4' or 6' x 4' table.&#10;&#10;This game is company scaled, and the smallest maneuver unit is the squad, with players generally controlling 2 - 4 platoons, each with a number of squads and an HQ. Players will direct their forces on the ground, as well as coordinating support such as air strikes, artillery, and taking advantage of special assets such as VC spider holes or booby traps, or the NVA's stubborn resistance and uncanny ability to recover casualties, preventing US a body count...&#10;&#10;Rules are provided for infantry, from the lowest quality ARVN troops, to the most elite ANZAC SAS and US Recon squads, and their various weapon attachments such as RPGs, LMGs, Recoilless rifles, and mortars, as well as helicopters such as the UH-1, AH-1 Cobra, OH-6 Loach and CH-47 Chinook. Vehicles such as the M113, M48 Patton, M551 Sheridan, various marine &quot;amtracs&quot;, the M42 Duster, and M50 Ontos are also covered.&#10;&#10;Boocoo Fire Mission is has a descending level of detail, with infantry as the most detailed unit in the game, followed by helicopters, and finally vehicles. Infantry can hide, dig in, crawl to avoid opportunity fire, and conduct suppression. Helicopters have detailed damage tables to provide for many interesting results from fire, and can drop off and pick up infantry on the table. Vehicles can disembark their crew, leaving sentries behind to man a single weapon, and can also transport infantry.&#10;&#10;Army lists are provided for ANZACs, ARVN, US army, Armored Cavalry, Mechanized companies, and US marines. VC and NVA are of course included, and some factions are split into different time periods depending on if their equipment evolved over the course of the war. Boocoo Fire Mission covers the entire Vietnam War, from early ARVN vs VC skirmishes in the early 1960s, through to 1975. Specific city fight lists are also included for both the Allied and Communist forces, to allow players to play battles such as those in Hue or Saigon.&#10;&#10;The game provides printable markers, and a printer-friendly version of the rules is also provided. Note that the markers are only in the full-color version of the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pundit is football&rsquo;s original trivia game, made for fans like ourselves, who love to revisit memories of legendary players and iconic moments!&#10;&#10;Challenge friends and family to see who best remembers the forgotten greats, cult heroes, one-hit wonders, fringe players and young prospects - to take the Pundit crown!&#10;&#10;1. Choose your best five categories to compete in.&#10;Taking turns, the two teams pick a question category to compete in. Whichever team wins the coin toss picks three categories, the loser picks two.&#10;&#10;2. Answer questions correctly to keep hold of the ball.&#10;When answering a question correctly the attacking team chooses to either pass the ball up the pitch or draw a Tactic card. If answered wrong, possession is turned over to the opponent&rsquo;s captain.&#10;&#10;3. Forwards score the goals.&#10;When the attacking team gets a question right with the ball at their forward&rsquo;s feet, a goal is scored. It&rsquo;s also possible to score from the penalty spot via Tactic cards.&#10;&#10;4. A match lasts 45 minutes.&#10;When time is up, the team in possession can finish their attack for one last attack on goal. No Tactic cards allowed in stoppage time, it&rsquo;s in God&rsquo;s hands from here.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The animals in the Arctic are bored. That's why polar bears, seals, ice gulls and even the odd orca have arranged to play a fun little game: floating on the ice floes.&#10;&#10;So without further ado, the animals jump around happily on the ice floes and try to form the largest possible groups with conspecifics. The orcas help where they can and the other animals pass the time cheerfully in the icy Arctic Ocean.&#10;&#10;In this fun card game by author Martin Schlegel, 2-6 people aged 8 and up must have good eyes.&#10;&#10;In each round, the aim is to find the best possible place for the newly revealed card in order to form the largest possible groups of animals of the same species.&#10;&#10;How is the game played?&#10;At the beginning, 2 cards are placed in the middle, whereby it does not matter whether their islands fit together sensibly or not. The remaining cards form the draw pile.&#10;&#10;Then turn over another card, place it in plain sight for everyone to see, and start a 1-minute countdown.&#10;&#10;Now the &quot;let the heads smoke&quot; phase begins:&#10;&#10;Which of you will find the best place for the new card? You should make sure that as many animals of the same species (polar bears, seals, ice gulls) as possible come together on the newly created floes.&#10;&#10;If an orca can be seen on both maps, the points are doubled.&#10;&#10;Within the 1-minute countdown, everyone now looks for the best place for the new map and you all note down the highest possible score.&#10;&#10;At the end of the minute, you compare the numbers and whoever has the highest number of points has to prove that putting on the card also brings in the corresponding number of points.&#10;&#10;If this is successful, the person receives 3 extra points in addition to the number of points he or she has written down; all others receive the number of points they have written down.&#10;&#10;If this is not successful, the person goes away empty-handed; all the others receive their points and the card is discarded.&#10;&#10;In the game instructions you will find 2 more variants: One where you outscore each other by calling out the scores, another with an hourglass. The scoring remains the same in both cases.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On March 9, 1862, the clash of the ironclad gunboats CSS Virginia and USS Monitor at the Battle of Hampton Roads heralded a new age of naval warfare. The innovations of the early industrial era yielded powerful new warships, armed with strong new guns, and plated with thick metal armor. A new ironclad navy threatened to revolutionize the practice of naval warfare, rendering old wooden fleets obsolete.&#10; This solitaire book game explores the use of ironclads during the American Civil War through a series of scenarios that teach the system gradually. In seeking to capture essential qualities of the battles in a fast and playable system, many aspects of these conflicts have been abstracted. Simplicity and ease of play have taken precedence over intricate rules and historical detail.&#10;&#10;Each scenario consists of a playsheet (left) and mapsheet (right), and features a short historical introduction. The scenarios, which each usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, walk you through the rules. As you progress from scenario to scenario, new rules will be added, basic rules will be upgraded to &lsquo;standard&rsquo; or &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; status, and scenario-specific rules may come into play. By the end of the book, you&rsquo;ll have experienced the game system in full, and perhaps something of ironclad history as well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
