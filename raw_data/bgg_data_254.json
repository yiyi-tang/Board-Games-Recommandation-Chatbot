Although the dispute was originally about a strip of territory between the Nueces and Rio Grande Rivers, the consequence of the war stripped Mexico of what is now much of the American southwest, including California.&#10;&#10;The map consists of a number of important locations, each named for a city, and contains significant terrain features and numerical values for replenishment and morale. Units gain friction points as they move and represent a variety of factors: terrain, sickness, sagging morale, and lesser factors. Unit types are Infantry, Heavy and Field Artillery, Cavalry, Leaders, and Supply, with the combat units rated regular, seasoned, or conscript. A roster sheet allows for easy organization of friction point tallies, and the CRT is based on combat class. Some interesting rules involve a Mexican Invasion of the U.S., the Neutral Strip, the Polk Indecision Table, and the Veracruz Invasion.&#10;&#10;17&quot; x 22&quot; mapsheet, 100 counters, 10 pages of rules and charts&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pirate King is a game where players take on the roles of pirate captains. Players sail around the Caribbean trying to become the Pirate King by smuggling cargo and capturing territories.&#10;&#10;Players set sail by choosing how far they would like to move each turn and roll a d12 to determine how far they will move. Rolling too low or too high will cause a player to overshoot or undershoot his or her target, but a good roll will hit a player right where he or she wants to go.  Wherever a player lands on a territory, he or she has choices to make about what actions to take, whether that be to capture the port, pay the owner a dock fee, or attempt to wrest control of the port from the current owner.  Players draw cards that have good or bad effects on the Pirate's Booty or Captain's Log spaces, and further spaces have effects on players&#10; Players gain points by holding territories, having Great Treasures, or by defeating the Commodore.  The game is over when a player has 16 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Dragon Stripes, players test their luck as a knight approaching a dragon, with the knight trying to pick up as many gems as possible along the way. (In an earlier version of the game, Die Augen der Kali, players moved a figure toward the goddess Kali, collecting gems as they move.)&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 40 gems. Shuffle the deck of 51 cards: 38 footprint cards, 10 stop cards, and 3 danger cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player places the knight before the first stripe on the dragon's tail, then reveals the top card of the deck. If they reveal a footprint card, they advance the knight this many stripes toward the dragon's head, then place gems next to the knight equal to the number on the current stripe (which range from 1 to 17). The player then decides to either reveal another card or hold. In the latter situation, other players can offer to take over the current player's turn by paying them a bounty based on the number of gems currently next to the knight. If someone takes over the turn, they must reveal at least one card as the new active player; if no one does, the current active player collects all of the gems, then the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;If the active player reveals a stop card, they lose 1/4 of their gems (rounding down), then the knight retreats to the dragon's tail and the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;The first time the active player reveals a danger card, this is treated as a stop. The second danger card is also treated as a stop, but the penalty for being stopped now (and by future stop cards) is 1/2 of your gems. The reward, however, is that each time the knight moves forward, the number of gems placed next to it doubles.&#10;&#10;Dragon Stripes ends one of two ways: Either a player reveals the third danger card, which causes them to lose all of their gems, or a player moves the knight past the 17th stripe to the dragon's head, at which point they claim all gems that remain in the dragon's hoard. Either way, whoever has the most gems at this point wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Castle of each player sits in the nearest right corner of the board.&#10;The first player that captures an adversary Castle (or conquers the last piece of one colour) wins , thus ending game.&#10;&#10;Turn action: movement and capture&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player can move one of his square-shaped pieces. All the pieces (but the Castle, which as said before can not be moved) are equal to each other. Each of them can move in 4 diferent ways, according to the side of the piece facing &ldquo;north&rdquo;, north being defined as &ldquo;forward&rdquo; from the POV of the owner of the piece. So for example &ldquo;north&rdquo; for the player sitting on the east side of table will be westward, wile for the player sitting on the north side of the table it will be southward, and so on.&#10;&#10;On his turn the player can move one of his pieces in one of these &#10;2 ways:&#10;    - just rotate the piece in place (thus changing the piece movement&#10;            type for the next time he will decide to move it);&#10;    - move the piece and then (optionally) rotate it;&#10;&#10;A player can capture other players' pieces by moving one of his piece on a square occupied by an opponent's piece. Pieces can never &ldquo;go through&rdquo; or &ldquo;jump over&rdquo; other pieces, both of the same or different colours.&#10;&#10;Each piece can be oriented in four different ways (one per each side of the piece) enabling it to four different kind of movement.&#10;&#10;The active roles is the one facing &ldquo;north&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;These are the four roles a piece can assume:&#10;&#10;- Warrior:&#10;        it moves 1 square and can't go backwards, in other words it can&#10;        move to one of the 5 squares adjacent to it (W, NW, N, NE, E);&#10;- Blade:&#10;        it moves 1 or 2 square &ldquo;forward&rdquo; (N);&#10;- Catapult:&#10;        it can move up to 3 squares diagonally going only forward, as&#10;        usual (NE, NW);&#10;- Shield:&#10;        the only role that can go backwards, it can move up to 2 squares&#10;        going South or just 1 square going diagonally (SW or SE).&#10;&#10;Begining of the game&#10;&#10;The first player to move will be the one opening the table. Then it will be the player on his left the one to move, and so on, going clockwise.&#10;&#10;We advise you not to distract from what the other players do: you can lose the game even if an enemy don't conquer your Castle (one wins, all others lose).&#10;&#10;",

Players start from Home Port as merchants and set out on a trading voyage. By throwing the die, they sail to exotic ports like the Pearl Coast, the Jewel Coast and the Spice Islands. When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought. Cargoes range from codfish and coal to precious spices, pearls and diamonds,!&#10;&#10;Players might also draw a pirate card while trading. They then have to decide whether to rob other players - or continue as honest merchants. Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each player&rsquo;s pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they don&rsquo;t show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).&#10;&#10;Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port! Things are made even more exciting by the &lsquo;Treasure Chest&rsquo; cards which players draw every time they roll a &lsquo;one&rsquo;. They then find out whether they have landed without any wind in the doldrums, - or been blown by a hurricane to a distant port, - or have found buried treasure - or other such twists of fortune!'&#10;&#10;",

The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady &amp; The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.&#10;&#10;When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.&#10;&#10;An odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game. Nice to look at though.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Golf is a card game played with one or more standard 52-card decks plus jokers, depending on the number of players. Generally, the game is played over 9 or 18 rounds, and the goal is to get the lowest score over those rounds.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt cards in a 2x3 or 2x4 rectangle. On a turn, a player will replace one card out of the draw or discard pile to try to lower their score. A matched pair (top to bottom) is worth 0 points, pip cards are worth their number, face cards are worth 10, but kings are worth 0. When one player decides to stop, the other players get one more chance to lower their score before the round ends.&#10;&#10;There are restrictions on which cards can be played depending on which version of Golf you are playing. Many versions of Golf have evolved over the years, as happens with many standard card games.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Creatures: The Card Game, later released as Creature Clash!, is a creative, strategic card game that blends friendly competition with a good laugh!  It is intended for 2 to 6 players, ages 8 and up.  The game is comprised of 96 playing cards consisting of either a &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo;, &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo;, or &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; portion of 32 particular animals.  Each animal is illustrated across the three cards, and includes a fun fact about that animal and a corresponding &lsquo;strength&rsquo; value ranging from 1-10 (e.g. a mosquito is strength-1, and a grizzly bear is strength-10).&#10;&#10;Gameplay occurs as players mix and match &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo;, &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo;, and &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; cards in their hand to create entirely new creatures, and stage attacks against the creatures in other players&rsquo; hands.  For example, the &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo; of Octopus (4), the &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo; of Hippopotamus (7), and the &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; of Armadillo (1) combine to create OC-POTA-DILLO (12)!&#10;&#10;",

The dividend of the funds and stocks is determined through rolls with one or two dice. Players have to pay rent when landing on someone else's company. The rent is a fixed cost depending on if the company has buildings or not. Players can at times during the game be forced to put one of their companies up for auction.&#10;&#10;The players move on the board using markers. The players can optionally buy one of two types of cars that will cause the player to move across the board at different speeds. Using &quot;the wreck&quot; the player always has to roll two dice. The more expensive &quot;sports car&quot; gives the player the option of using one OR two dice when rolling for a move.&#10;&#10;Every time the players are back at the beginning on the circular board they get and/or pay interest depending on how much money the player have in the bank and if there are any outstanding loans. The current interest rate is determined every now and then using dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player with 4 million in cash OR the first player who owns a complete corporation (all companies in a group) and 1.5 million in cash.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "INTRODUCTION:&#10;Table Land is populated by humans, dwarfs, elves, orcs and barbarians. It is a world in permanent war for the control of the territory. Play and become a true Lord of Tierra Mesa by beating your rivals.&#10;&#10;AIM OF THE GAME:&#10;The aim of the game is to achieve, before the other players, a combination of 5 cards with the same value, or to form an army with 5 consecutive cards of the same race or where each value accords a different race (Unbeatable Run).&#10;&#10;You will become Lord of Table Land in several ways:&#10;1.    Gathering together an army of 5 consecutive cards (run) of the same race.&#10;2.    Gathering together 5 cards of the same value (archers, princesses, catapults&hellip;)&#10;3.    And finally, the Unbeatable Run; you can get an army alliance gathering 5 consecutive cards of a different race each.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who gathers one of these combinations.&#10;&#10;BEFORE THE GAME:&#10;-    Shuffle the cards.&#10;-    Hand out 5 cards to each player.&#10;-    Allocate the deck of cards facing down, in the middle of Table Land.&#10;-    The first game starts with the player who owns most hairs in his ears, continuing then, in a clockwise direction. The following games are started by the winner of the previous game.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been distributed to the players the game stars. The player that starts the game draws one card from the central deck, looks at it, and gets rid of the card which is not convenient for him. Each player should always have 5 cards.&#10;&#10;Each player discards should be placed on Table Land, ALWAYS in front of the player, creating a deck where the last discarded card is shown. This way there should be as many discarded decks as players.&#10;&#10;When a player gets rid of a card and puts it on its deck facing up, any interested player can take it. How? The interested player should cover it with its hand. The fastest player covering the deck is the one that gets the card. This player should then discard one of his cards. Then, the game continues in a clockwise direction starting from him.&#10;&#10;This way the game continues until one of the players gathers 5 cards with the same value or 5 consecutive cards of the same race or the Unbeatable Run. The player should let the other players know during his turn by placing the discard card facing down and by showing his 5 wining cards, he gains the victory by beating his rivals.&#10;&#10;WINING COMBINATIONS:&#10;&#10;Option 1 &ndash; Whoever wins 5 games is the winner of the whole game.&#10;&#10;Option 2 &ndash; After each game all card points must be counted, except those from the winner, being 100 points those from the action cards. The player with fewer points after 5 games is the winner.&#10;&#10;Option 3 &ndash; After each game only the winner&rsquo;s points must be counted, in this situation the value (each value corresponds to a different race) of the Unbeatable Run is three times the addition of the values. The game finishes when one of the players reaches 1000 points or a previously agreed quantity.&#10;&#10;These are not the only possibilities, players can agree on other options for victory.&#10;&#10;ACTION CARDS:&#10;&#10;This game has a series of action cards which are used for the interaction between players to threaten their rivals:&#10;&#10;Skull (2 cards): If a player places this card on the other player&rsquo;s deck it means that all his troops have been killed. He must place all his cards, facing down, beneath the central deck and draw 5 new cards.&#10;&#10;card swap (1 card): If a player places this card in another player&rsquo;s deck, both players must swap one card.&#10;&#10;hand swap (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that you swap your hand of cards with that player.&#10;&#10;steal 2 cards for the deck (2 cards): Placing this card on to other player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the attacking card) randomly takes 2 cards from the other player&rsquo;s hand, and then this player must immediately pick up two new cards from the central deck. The 2 cards that have been taken from the player&rsquo;s hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.&#10;&#10;steal 3 cards for the deck (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 3 cards from his rival&rsquo;s hand. Then, the rival should draw 3 new cards from the central deck. The cards taken from his hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.&#10;&#10;steal a card (3 cards): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 1 card from his rival&rsquo;s hand, and keeps it. Now the victim has 4 cards, therefore he must pick up a new card to have 5. The assailant has now 6 cards therefore he must discard one of them to have 5 again to continue the battle.&#10;&#10;Potion (2 cards): the joker substitutes any other card concerning value and race. It can NOT be used as action card. One player can have on its hand up to two jokers.&#10;&#10;FAQs:&#10;&#10;- Which discard cards can I pick up? You can only pick up the last card that has been placed at the top of the discard deck from the player that&rsquo;s on its turn.&#10;&#10;- After an action card who continues? The player next to the player who has discarded the Action Card, always clockwise.&#10;&#10;- Do runs or the Unbeatable Run have to start from number 5? Runs do not have to start from 5, as long as they are always consecutive numbers.&#10;&#10;- What should it be done if the extension of Tierra Mesa cannot be cover and a player does not reach their rivals discard decks? Instead of hunting the card with the hand you should scream Guar!!! The one that screams it first takes the card.&#10;&#10;- Can I draw one card from any discard deck while other player is drawing a card from the central deck? When a player picks up a card from the central deck the possibility of taking a card from a discard deck is blocked.&#10;&#10;- If I take a card from a discard deck, can the card that appears underneath be taken later on? NO. Those cards were previously played, therefore, you should pay attention!!&#10;&#10;- What should it be done when the central deck finishes? All discard decks from all the players must be gathered together to form a new central deck. The cards must be shuffle before placing them on the middle of Tierra Mesa.&#10;&#10;- If two players place their hands on a discard deck, who takes the card? Either the one that has more fingers placed on it, or the most aggressive one.&#10;&#10;",

However, for a truly winning holiday, you must work out the best moment to return home. This is exactly what you will have to do in &ldquo;Camper Tour&rdquo;. The aim of the game is to complete the longest journey, returning home and consuming all the available Camper points. The game is divided into two distinct phases: the outward journey and the return journey. The length of each player&rsquo;s outward journey depends on the decisions and strategies they adopt during the game. 4 campers start their journey building, along the way, the route: everyone has its expectations to satisfy (represented by the 25 tokens to be played during the game) and typical situations to face (positive or negative unforeseen events). Will you be able to put your energy to good use and complete the longest journey, returning home just at the right time?&#10;&#10;",

The problem is, the self destruction sequence has been set by the ship's AI running wild, and that same AI is still trying to stop the players from fleeing. To successfully flee, the players have to activate the escape pod by turning on 13 switches all over the ship. To reach the switches they have to unlock the doors that block the way between them.&#10;&#10;The way all this happens is simple: on your turn you can either roll the dice to unlock doors on your half of the ship OR move your astronaut through doors that have previously been unlocked. You try to reach the switches to be able to turn them on. Sometimes you roll a dice combination that you cannot use. When that happens you have to draw a card that may lock unlocked doors, or deactivate activated switches. To win the game, all astronauts have to reach the escape pod in the center of the board before the time has run out, after all switches have been turned on.&#10;&#10;The game is played using a free timer app downloaded to a smartphone. The timer also plays atmospheric sounds that remind the players of the urgency of the situation.&#10;&#10;",

Dunnigan turned his eye to the Western Front. Combat Command was described as &quot;Platoon-Company Level Combat, France 1944&quot;.&#10;&#10;From the Design Notes:&#10;&#10;&quot;PanzerBlitz (published by Avalon Hill) proved to be a very popular game.  It was complex, but most people were enthusiastic about its apparent realism and authenticity.  In point of fact, PanzerBlitz was not all that realistic or authentic.  The game did have its good points.  That it moved at all was a credit to its play-mechanics.  What was lacking was an awareness, and implementation, of some of the more critical aspects of small unit operations.  Chief among these aspects is the &quot;confusion factor&quot;, which becomes nearly decisive at the platoon level.  Other aspects left untreated in PanzerBlitz were the near simultaneity of action and reaction at that scale, as well as a more realistic handling of combined arms coordination.&#10;&#10;Not all of these problems (nor others unmentioned) have been solved in Combat Command.  By merely changing the cale and some of the combat and movement mechanics, we have introduced more change in the game than these innovations themselves suggest.  One rather obvious result is that the game is simpler, easier to play.  This is essential for any game.  Too much time spent on the mechanics makes the simulation more of an exercise than a game.  The game-system for platoon level simulation as it now stands in Combat Command is not yet perfect.  But we do feel it's superior to the system we first introduced in Tactical Game 3 and PanzerBlitz.  We are working on still better game-systems for this scale of operations.  When we finish them, we'll publish them!&quot;&#10;&#10;The Combat Command game system was quickly discarded as the seventies saw SPI release a string of &quot;new and improved&quot; tactical wargame systems.&#10;&#10;",

Each player secretly writes a four-digit number or four-letter word. The digits or letters must all be different. Players take turns trying to guess their opponent's number/word. The opponent tells them the number of matches.&#10;&#10;Right number, wrong place is a &quot;cow.&quot; Right number, right place is a &quot;bull.&quot;&#10;&#10;If the person who took the first turn is also the first to decode the secret number or word, the other person gets one more turn to see if they can tie.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Competitive dice game where vultures fight over a carcass.&#10;&#10;You're a vulture. She's a vulture. Everyone is a vulture -- and everyone is hungry. You are going to fight beak and claw with those other vultures for the sake of first dibs on dinner. But don't get too greedy, or you might wind up with little more than scraps.&#10;&#10;Vulture Culture pits five or more &quot;friends&quot; against each other in a feeding frenzy free-for-all. The game takes place over five rounds, each of which represents the revelation of a fresh carcass to consume. Yummy. The vulture that escapes the scuffle with the fewest feathers ruffled will enjoy the privilege of prime pickings among the tasty treats available. Conversely, the most beat-up buzzards develop an attitude adjustment, which just might earn them the edge next time around.&#10;&#10;Every round, each player receives the same three actions: one each of Attack, Avoid, and Assist. Each round consists of a series of Attacks which take place without a conventional turn order. Attackers choose the strength of their attack, but increasing the strength makes it increasingly likely that the attack will miss its intended target and strike another bird instead. Additionally, every Attack presents an opportunity for all players to Assist with the devious deed at hand, or Avoid taking damage should events go awry. The catch? Every action can be played only once. You can block any one Attack and take no damage, but that leaves you vulnerable for any other actions that occur that round. Success requires roughly equal parts of clever hand management and deft social manipulation.&#10;&#10;Vulture Culture was created to combine the thrill of thematic games like Munchkin and Cosmic Encounter with the mechanically-minded strategic sensibility of eurogames like Power Grid and 7 Wonders, all in less than an hour.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dwarves in Trouble is an easy and dynamic non- collectible card game. The participants play the role of dwarf treasure seekers who decided to pay a visit at a dragon&rsquo;s den while the dragon was away. They managed to get inside. Unfortunately, while they were plundering the treasure, the dragon return unexpectedly. Certainly, it will not be polite towards anybody caught stealing its possessions. It is a common knowledge that dwarfs tend to be greedy and it would be considered a dishonour to simply throw away the precious stuff. For that reason you need get rid of the treasure in a clever way&hellip;.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to dispose of the gold completely or to have the fewest Gold coins the moment the Dragon arrives. As we know, dragons have the sixth sense that helps them localise gold and valuables. The dragon will focus on the most greedy treasure hunters. The arrival of the beast will cause such a confusion that only one dwarf will be able to escape and others will be burnt to ashes.&#10;&#10;The game overview&#10;&#10;The person who is most generous starts the game. Continue playing your turns clockwise. At the beginning of his or her turn each player draws a number of cards so they have a total of 4 cards in their hands.&#10;&#10;In their turns the players can:&#10;&#10;    play any number of cards and resolve its effects,&#10;    discard any number of cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Important: the amount of gold and number of cards is known to all the players during the whole game.&#10;&#10;",

Players are dealt a hand of cards, which come in five suits numbered 0-9, and each turn they play one card to the table, following suit if possible. If all the cards played are in suit, the player of the highest numbered card wins; if one or more cards are out of suit, however, then the highest one of those cards wins. The trick&rsquo;s winner scores three coins, and the player with the most coins at the end of the game, which lasts several hands, wins.&#10;&#10;&quot;What makes the game tricky are the rule cards, two of which are in play at the start of the game &ndash; make that in play face-down, which means you have to remember what the rules are throughout the hand. Sample rules are 'When you play a card that has an Igor on it, you must say &quot;Yes, Master&quot;' and 'When you laugh, you must follow your laugh with a &quot;Meow.&quot;' At the start of each turn, the dealer can add or remove one rule from play, and the player who wins the most tricks in a hand has the same option, so rules are constantly popping in and out of the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
