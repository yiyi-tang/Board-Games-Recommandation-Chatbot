With this book you can play the entire Dilgar War in scenarios, using over 20 different scenarios including the huge Final Battle at Omelos - a battle so big we had to break it into four parts! Of course, we couldn't do a book like this without ships, so you'll find more than 20 new vessels inside - such as Jha'Dur's personal Mishakur Dreadnought, and ships for the Abbai, Brakiri, Markab, Llort, and other races involved in the Dilgar War! And, as if we hadn't already packed enough cool stuff into one book, we've even added an entirely new race, the Descari Committees! How could you possibly live without this product?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "[from the introduction]&#10;&#10;The late 2230&rsquo;s and early 2240&rsquo;s saw the institutionalization of raiders throughout the know galaxy. Human raider bands created shell corporations to, at one and the same time, conceal and support their activities. Within the League, these methods were sometimes adapted to the local politics. The Vree Guild of Salvage, once a respectable institution, has become a front for several pirate groups. Several Brakiri corporations, seeing the value in having a small military force whose activities they could plausibly deny, are believed to have created whole dummy divisions supporting the activity of raiders in exchange for occasional &ldquo;favors&rdquo; from those raiders. In contrast, raiders operating out of Drazi and Centauri space continue to follow their centuries old traditions of working on the fringes of society where they have long been accepted, if disreputable, institutions.&#10;&#10;",

Vehicles and support weapons represent 3 real-life equivalents.  The aim of the game is to recreate World War 2 battles.  A players wins when one side is forced to retire from the battlefield, caused by morale checks and losses. It uses a set of mechanisms to create a fast-play set that reflects the realistic experience of a WW2 soldier.  All the equipment available to the soldier in WW2 is included, such as support weapons, vehicles, artillery and aircraft. The rules reward players that use the equipment tactically rather than the simple &quot;see the enemy and charge&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game lasts up to 15 turns.  Each turn has a number of phases - move, spot, aircraft, fire, morale and orders. The winner of the initiative for each turn determines which side goes first in each phase. A single 6-sided die is used for almost all mechanisms. Vehicles, if hit, require a further roll to determine damage.  Morale is checked once a unit has received a number of casualties which varies with nationality.  Once a number of base units has received adverse morale checks, the overall morale of the army is checked each turn until one side eventually pulls backs or routs..&#10;&#10;",

The player then moves Albert clockwise on the path as many spaces as the number of spaces moved by the sheep that turn. (For example, if the sheep moved four intersections, then Albert moves four spaces.) If after moving, the triangle where Albert is located has sheep on all three vertices, then Albert collects those sheep, removing them from the board and placing them on the path back to his barn.&#10;&#10;The player who first gets five of his sheep on the path to the barn wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Royal Execution you create your own military and political faction of commoners, nobility, and royalty to claim the Thrones of an imaginary Realm. Align yourself with one or more Royal lines of succession to control the thrones of King, Queen, and Bishop recreating the numerous dynastic civil wars of the Middle Ages.&#10;&#10;The Challenge: Your opponents have troops, assassins, and can stage revolts. Rival royalty and their factions may attempt to imprison you - or worse - gather the right support to condemn your royal to death by execution.&#10;&#10;Just like the power struggles of the Middle Ages you'll soon be facing fierce competition for political and military power, which quickly becomes shamelessly ruthless, viciously vengeful, hilariously melodramatic, and just plain fun!&#10;&#10;If you are fascinated by the pomp, power, and melodrama of Medieval royalty and their struggles for power - this is the game for you!&#10;&#10;The objective is score as many points as possible by claiming sovereignty over territories and controlling the royal thrones. Players maneuver to capture the Thrones of King, Queen, and Bishop of the Realm and control their lucrative territories - scoring points along the way. The first player to reach a predetermined number of points is declared the Supreme Sovereign of the Realm and game winner.&#10;&#10;Every player is entitled to make one common play during their turn. Common plays represent the powers of the lower classes and a treacherous noble&rsquo;s access to the royal court. For example, revolts were ways the populace kept royalty and their policies in check. Assassins often gained access to royalty with the help of treacherous nobility. Both of these cards (Revolt and Assassin) represent real threats to royalty who fail to protect themselves.&#10;&#10;Royalty may make an additional Royal play during their turn. Royal plays represent the unique powers of reigning royalty and are easy to identify by the Royal Play scroll on top of each card. They can be used to protect your royalty (for example, Troops) and to eliminate hostile ones (Royal Execution).&#10;&#10;Play Options: Teams; Role Playing; Historical Based Games; Adding the Medieval England Feudal Deck; Adding the Medieval Combat Deck, Alliances and Pledges.&#10;&#10;",

Each plane is different with its own aircraft&rsquo;s characteristics with a series of specific manoeuvres and special abilities, hence making it distinguishable from the other members of the squadron. CW, allows players to customize both flight style and combat technique, consequently the same model of aircraft can perform a varied range of manoeuvres or be endowed with a series of specific special abilities, depending on the Plane Data Sheet (PDS). The sPDS of the squadrons are based on historical facts and list the characteristics, abilities and hardware of the most renowned squadrons of the FWW which, in combination with the mission allow players to recreate the entire history of the war.&#10;Throughout each game, players are awarded experience points which in turn permit a series of abilities or manoeuvres, the ultimate aim of which is to be awarded the category of ace.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Purple-skinned inhabitants of Gobland settled down wherever their short but nimble legs carried them. However, the heart of the nation beats in the capital of Big Gobba. It's here, on the Hill slopes, where the local chiefs dwelled. Upon discovering on the morrow of the recent festival that city's elite'd got lost somewhere, common goblins gave all other stuff up &mdash; it's high time to climb up the very top of the Hill, to the Cauldron, strike it and seize a better office.&#10;&#10;Who doesn't want to become the Great Chief and rule the biggest Gobba in the world?! I'm asking you &mdash; who?&#10;&#10;According to the classification, Gobba is a kind of &quot;resource gathering and winning on points&quot; game. Goblin players travel around the levels of the Hill and do their best to collect the required quantity of resources in order to win election for one of five offices.&#10;&#10;Under the Hill a large Dump spreads out &mdash; upon getting here, players draw a card from the catch deck. They might get either a gizmo of some value and with some ability or a cataclysm impacting the overall situation in Big Gobba. As goblins are sly by nature, they can even hide a cataclysm that is unfavorable for them. However, when revealed, the deceit will be punished for sure.&#10;&#10;The level above the Dump is occupied by Hovels. It's the place where goblins make hidings of their cards, so that their hand can be unloaded. However, it's a risky business, as there might come some enthusiasts for exploring others' hidings.&#10;&#10;Yet higher the craftsmen level lies. Each cell up there has its own ability. For instance, in Hurler you can pay for flying to any other cell, in Booth you can play a shell game with another goblin, in Bazaar you can buy or sell a gizmo, and so on.&#10;&#10;Above the craftsmen level, the elected elite of Big Gobba dwells. At first the area is empty, still whenever some goblin becomes elected &mdash; other players will have to pay for passage through the occupied dwelling.&#10;&#10;The Cauldron is situated on the very top of the Hill. To announce an election, you have to climb up there and strike it. Whoever makes a higher bid, wins. Unless, to speak the truth, some evil-minded goblin throws a Sour Watermelon and scuttles the election. I bet they can.&#10;&#10;Still, even if you succeeded in getting some office, it's too early to relax. The point is nobody in Big Gobba has ever abolished reelections. They do cost more but cunning competitors can hardly be frightened by a high price.&#10;&#10;The victor is the goblin who gets more offices, and if there is an equal number &mdash; the goblin with senior offices. For instance, Trader stands higher than the Deputy of Hovels as the elections of the first one are paid with expensive gizmos, and for the Deputy whatever resources go.&#10;&#10;During the game goblins can surprise each other in many ways: push down, stab with a knife, befuddle with mushrooms as well as use various sophisticated gizmos like Dusty Sack or Primus Stove.&#10;&#10;Goblin-like elections may lead to a triumph or a scuffle but they will never make you weary! &#10; ",

    "Description": "Million is a tabletop game of futuristic combat between fighters in high-tech combat armor. It was published in 2001 in the French gaming magazine Backstab, issue #35.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a square playing surface of one meter length. The magazine provides counters for the playing pieces and scenery, but players are advised to build their own scenery and use plastic or metal miniatures.&#10;&#10;Each player first builds a combat armor using a set number of points, buying systems in each of three categories (Mobility, Offence and Defense). Each of these systems is represented by a counter. These counters also represent the armor's &quot;hit points&quot;: once a player runs out of counters, the armor is considered to be too badly damaged and the player is off the game.&#10;&#10;Each player then makes three piles of face-down counters (one for each system), put her figure in one corner and play begins.&#10;&#10;Each turn, each player secretly chooses two of three systems to activate (Mobility and Offence for example). Players then reveal their choices, draw enough counters from their activated systems to replenish their hand to five counters, and roll a d10 for initiative (players can expend counters to gain a bonus on the initiative roll). Each player then take an action, alternating between players until there are no possible actions left or each player passes, at which point another turn begins. Each player can take a move action and a shoot action each turn, and also play counters as an action.&#10;&#10;Damage is resolved by rolling on a damage table with a lot of different results (loss of counters, fighter pushed back and/or stunned...). The last fighter standing wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player also has a movable hunter as well as a fish.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, territories combine and result in conflicts among the animals claiming those territories. A player may also use his animals and hunter to attack, potentially emptying a region in order to occupy it on a later turn.&#10;&#10;The fish scores based on the regions it borders. Land animals score based on the size of their territory. The hunter is a tactical piece, but does not score.&#10;&#10;",

A player who ends in a dead zone is not allowed to count any single scoring event more than the holes remaining to the final hole. (A player can score normally from the final hole.)&#10;&#10;The deck also includes Jokers, which may count as any card. Their value can change between pegging and counting out the hands.&#10;&#10;A variant, HyperCribbage-7, includes seven card hands and cribs (and much larger maximum scoring combinations), and is played twice around the board.&#10;&#10;As in Cribbage, players are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards.  Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.  The winner is the first person to peg 121 or more points.&#10;&#10;",

Forty-two connection cards are laid face-up on the table (grouped as desired by the players), along with multipliers of value 2, 3 and 4.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can play cards from his hand to create any of the connections on a card. The player can simultaneously rearrange cards on the table to create new compounds, using the multiplier cards as needed to create molecules like O2 or H2O. If you leave element cards on the table, you must pick them up, but your hand limit is three cards; should you need to pick up more, those extra cards will count against you at the end of the game. A player's score is the sum of compound cards claimed and noble gas cards collected, minus penalties from dead cards collected during play.&#10;&#10;The second game is &quot;Chemuno&quot;, with all of the cards being shuffled together and each player receiving a hand of seven. The first player lays a card on the table; the next player must lay down a compound, element or multiplier that &quot;matches&quot; this first card. (A compound must use an identical element as a compound on the table or use the element or multiplier present, and so on.) If the previous card was a multiplier, the next player must draw 2-4 cards (equal to the mutiplier value) unless she can play the same multiplier herself, thereby doubling the penalty for the next player. The first player to run out of cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to escape the maze, wins!&#10;&#10;You will roll 2 to 5 six-sided dice to perform the following actions: OPEN, MOVE, SEARCH, HIDE, HELP or ATTACK.

HAND cards (Useful, Useless and Charmed items) help you defeat the maze, influence others, intimidate them, or just plain force them to do your will. SKULL cards (Bad Scares, Devious Traps, Wicked Hexes and Dark Entities) await those who roll below 9. Skulls can kill you or drive you insane.&#10;&#10;In this game, you are YOU.

Will you find the inspiration at the right time? You will have to roll the dice to know and choose the ideas (Decktet suits) you keep wisely to take the advantage over your opponent.&#10;&#10;In The Wall, players throw a bunch of dice, and then decide to use those for either taking influence counters or paying the influence value of one of three cards available at that time. The card then goes into one of three categories (People, Places, Events) on the player side, to try to take control of that category.&#10;Players also have identical Action-card decks, giving them a random special action every turn.&#10;In the end, whoever controls more categories wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Activation uses the chit - pull system. Generally one chit represents one army and units can only be actvated once during the turn. Except for German panzer and motorized units, which can also be activated by special chit &quot;Schenlltruppen&quot;. That makes the Polish player feels like he can be really outmaneuvred by the Germans.&#10;&#10;Important factor is use of the air force. It can either support combat or interdict movement of ground units and rail transports. Luftwaffe can really dominate the sky.&#10;&#10;Combat table seems to be pretty &quot;normal&quot; - it has 6 rows, but you are rolling 2 dice instead of one. Unlike many other games, the results are not added but substracted... The range is from 0 to 5. After calculating the probability you may notice, that 1 is the most likely result (16,6 %) and 5 is the less likely result...&#10;&#10;Depending on the scenario, the players take part in:&#10;- the historical First Blitzkrieg &ndash; German strike on Poland in September 1939, &#10;- the alternative Red Blitzkrieg coming from the East, or&#10;- the hypothetic Blitzkrieg of 1938 (the defense of Czechoslovakia).&#10;&#10;In the 1939 historical scenario Wehrmacht is superior to Polish forces. But do not worry, PL gains VP either for holding terrain objectives or inflicting causalties to German units. German player must eliminate PL unit to gain VP for it. Therefore, usually the Polish player has more VP during the game - and the German player must perform a really good Blitzkrieg to gain victory.&#10;&#10;What is more, the players will get a chance to play the Red Blitzkireg scenario, and check how Polish Army can act vs. the Red Army. This scenario shows the actual Soviet deployment of 1939 versus Polish defense plan East, which was only theoretical.&#10;&#10;Another what if scenario is Czechoslovakian defense of 1938, supposing that the Munich dictate was rejected. There are quite heavy fortifications along the border, and the Wehrmacht isn't as strong as it was it 1939. In expanded version, this scenario is going to be for 4 players: Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland and USSR.&#10;&#10;",

The front-line had to get through the highly defended echelon zone starting from Oder and ending with the highly fortified Berlin&quot;.&#10;&#10;So writes the Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov about the assault on Berlin . For four years the Great Patriotic War continued. Millions of soldiers, thousands of tanks and planes &ndash; the entire might of USSR , Great Britain , France and many other countries were sent to battle. In the end fascist Germany was defeated.&#10;&#10;The strategic card game &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; is dedicated to the last period of the war when soviet soldiers assaulted Berlin and completely broke the German forces. Each player takes on the role of a division commander. He has command over different units: infantry, armored vehicles, artillery and aviation.&#10;&#10;Each unit has a historic counterpart &ndash; so for instance each rifle company in the game is a counterpart of real life divisions, platoons of KV tanks and T-34s, batteries of &ldquo;Katusha&rdquo; rocket launchers, squadrons of LA-7s and Tu-2 and so on. All in game characteristics were done keeping in mind the actual abilities of the historic counterparts. By using special &ldquo;tactical cards&rdquo; you can use different assaults, tactical maneuvers and psychological effects. Throughout the game, players simulate different actions of their divisions: charges and break through, artillery support and aerial bombings, organization off defenses and blocking enemy troops.&#10;&#10;All units in the game and all game events are shown as cards. Each card has an image of the unit, it's characteristics and abilities and also a text &ndash; usually it's a quotation from a historical novel or memoires, or some information on the current unit. All illustrations on the cards are done from actual black and white photos done during the war by using computer technologies.&#10;&#10;Booster packs containing new cards have been released for &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo;. Players can add any of these cards to their decks by purchasing the booster packs sold separately. This way, players can make their own unique decks by adding new cards to it. Depending on the cards in the deck victory may be easier than before. It's more important to have a balanced deck fit for different situations then just by adding strong cards. But both players need to have an equal amount of cards in their decks. It is also not recommended to have more than 60 cards in the deck.&#10;&#10;There is also a mmo game based on &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;The War Online&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Victory Day&rdquo; the board game is based mostly on &ldquo;The War&rdquo; CCG. This way, players can further customize their decks by using cards from &ldquo;The War&rdquo; CCG. This way they can combine lots of different tactics, use an assortment of squads and platoons and even simulate historical battles from World War 2.&#10;&#10;",

The key game mechanics are the avalanche of migration of lemmings that players often can not control (when number of lemmings reach critical max for a territory, they're starting to run all directions randomly). Well, usually, lemmings fall off a cliff, but not all die ...some fly away :)&#10;&#10;There are 3 ways to win the game:&#10;1. When instinct deck ends, player who has the biggest and widest swarm wins.&#10;2. When all of your lemmings situated on the game board you win instantly&#10;3. When you have 7 flying lemmings you win instantly.&#10;&#10;^_^&#10;&#10;",

In the era of &quot;Kingdoms Rising&quot; players gradually get bonuses specific to the kingdom. In the era of the &quot;End of Times&quot; all events are resolved. These two steps constitute the main part of the game, when the players give a variety of orders and fight. In the era of &quot;Destiny&quot; victory points and fines are scored.&#10;&#10;The dice are not used during the battles, so the game is not that much random ;)&#10;&#10;The game has low downtime and relatively short playing time (30 minutes per player).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The world is big and your kingdom small. Small when compared to the world, that is; it's moderate-sized when compared to other kingdoms. But in a big world like this one - big when compared to smaller worlds anyway, if such things exist; it's moderate-sized when compared to worlds of roughly the same size, and a little small when compared to worlds just a little larger - well, to make a long story short - short when compared to longer stories anyway - it is time to stretch your borders. You've heard of far-off places - exotic countries, where they have pancakes but not waffles, where the people wear the wrong number of shirts, and don't even have a word for the look two people give each other when they each hope that the other will do something that they both want done but which neither of them wants to do. It is to these lands that you now turn your gaze.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Hinterlands is the sixth addition to the game of Dominion. It adds 26 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, including 20 Actions, 3 Treasures, 3 Victory cards, and 3 Reactions. The central theme is cards that do something immediately when you buy them or gain them.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Forbidden Island themed Express game in the vein of Infection Express, Taboo Atoll Express places the player into the role of the intrepid treasure hunter, on an island that is determined to keep its secrets, and is willing to sink itself in order to protect them.&#10;&#10;The player roams around the island, looking for clues as to where the treasure is located, all the while the island is aware and slowly sinking itself to prevent the player from succeeding.  Should you spend too much time on the island, you'll sink with it!&#10;&#10;Taboo Atoll Express should take around 10-20 minutes to play, has easy setup, and can be played with a handful of colored cubes or markers, and a few custom dice.  The game is available for free in print-n-play format from the paperparachute games site.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Russian bluffing game using standard deck of cards, similar to Cheat; the main difference is that the called rank stays the same during a round, rather than changing from player to player, forcing people to start bluffing almost immediately.&#10;&#10;Play with a full deck for 4+ players, thin the deck to 36 cards (remove 2s through 5s) for fewer players.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is for a player to get rid of all cards they have. Start by removing one random card from the deck (so that there is one rank that cannot form four-of-a-kind) and deal the remaining deck out between the players. On their turn, a player must discard 1-3 cards face down and announce those cards' rank (the same rank being called for the entire round, and players may lie about what they are discarding), or call the bluff of the previous player.  When a bluff is called, the played cards are revealed and the loser of the challenge draws the entire discard pile without showing the cards to anyone. After drawing the discard pile, a player may choose to discard sets of four-of-a-kind from their hand (in some versions of the game all must be discarded; in others, only a single set). The player to the left of the challenge loser starts the next round, naming a rank of their choice.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "We get Freddy Krueger, Freddy Nightmare Worm, Jason Voorhees, Jason Carrying Freddy's Head, and the final uberpiece, Freddy And Jason Together (featuring both figures on a single base). It is worth noting that the scenarios that come with the rulebook do not recommend using this last piece&hellip;&#10;&#10;The figures are 28mm, and of fine quality, although the factory paint jobs leave a bit to be desired. And for those of you wishing to rebase, they'll come off easily enough (and provide SIX figures rather than five; the Jason Vs. Freddy piece can be separated).&#10;&#10;Altogether, a neat tabletop game awaits. Make a neat main event for this coming Halloween, and a nice diversion from the usual zombie geek bingo events&hellip;&#10;&#10;This is actually a Licensed Starter/Expansion style pack for Horrorclix, and doesn't really work as a stand alone game.&#10;&#10;",
