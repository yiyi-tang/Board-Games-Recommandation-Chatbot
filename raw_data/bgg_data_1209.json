Should you play it safe or just &quot;SEND IT!&quot;?&#10;&#10;On each turn, riders choose two actions, which can be the same or different, from the following options:&#10;1. Ride - roll the riding die and move 1-3 spaces along the singletrack.&#10;2. Train - roll the two training dice to gain the skill points you need to send the next feature.&#10;3. Prepare - draw a Prepare card to gain points (which help you recover from a crash and send the next feature) or special skills.&#10;4. SEND IT - if you are on a feature and have the necessary skills, play Prepare card points and roll the 20-sided die to try to send it and pass on to more difficult singletrack.&#10;&#10;Just like real mountain biking, crashing can happen in a variety of ways - you can crash while training, while riding or while sending it - and until you recover from your crash you can't do anything but prepare, giving the other riders the chance to get ahead.&#10;&#10;The first rider to send the final feature (the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;) and reach the Golden Burrito wins the game.&#10;&#10;For a more advanced version, add the &quot;Trail Building&quot; action which allows riders to place the features instead of randomly placing them at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Therefore, the names of all the beasts encountered in the game are palindromes:&#10;Drakard, the dragon&#10;Trollorts, the trolls, and &#10;Ruffurs, the beasts&#10;&#10;Also, the win condition of each encounter with a beast is to roll a 3, 4, or 5 dice palindrome, for example: 3-5-3 or 6-2-2-6.&#10;&#10;Move through Drakard's dark forest, encountering beasts and friends along the way.  Make it to Drakard's lair to battle the dragon.  Defeat him and your journey is halfway over.  Continue on to the edge of the map to win the game.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;After rolling dice to set your initial resources of Health, Food, Coins, and Magic, begin your journey.  Each turn, pay 1 food to gain movement points.  If the hex you land on is a beast, encounter it by rolling your dice.  Win the encounter by rolling a 3, 4, or 5 dice palindrome depending on the beast.  If you win, gain any one resource.  If you lose, pay a penalty in Health.  If the new hex is a friend, gain the indicated item.  You may also trade items on friendly spaces for other items or more weapons (dice).&#10;&#10;Win by traversing the entire forest and emerging with more than zero Health.&#10;&#10;Note: Currently, there are 2 different maps to choose from: a simple 1 page map, and and enlarged and improved 2 page map (recommended).&#10;   &#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The Board has four different colors going on each end labelled 1 to 100. The Game Board can switch color at a moment's notice thanks to Ability cards such as Earth Bending or Terraforming. When this happens, the number is switched to a different colored number. Players on 1 can be warped to 100 square, 90 square, or 10 square.&#10;&#10;Each player is designated a Mutant Gene card as their special ability throughout the game. Tokens or Weapons are collected as a player progresses through the board. Tokens are used to buy Ability cards or activate Mutant Gene abilities while weapons are used in battle with other players.&#10;&#10;A battle is conducted if a player lands on the same space as another player. There are three time capsule pieces in the game where if a player collects all of them, they are automatically warped to the 100 square. They can lose a time capsule piece during a battle.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on the 100 square, they must roll a 1 to successful launch the nuclear crystal into deep space and win the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The planet Arrakis, commonly known as Dune, is a barren wasteland. It's also the only place where spice can be found. This precious resource is essential for space travel and so every house in the known universe vies for control of Dune. The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has recently granted stewardship of Dune to house Atreides, angering the previous stewards: the corrupt house Harkonnen. But this stewardship is not intended as a reward for the noble Atreides. The Emperor secretly fears the popularity of Duke Leto Atreides in the Landsraad and the Harkonnen's unbridled ambition and hopes that his scheme will spark a war between these two powerful houses that will weaken them to the point that they no longer pose a threat to his position as Padishah Emperor...&#10;&#10;In this free Print &amp; Play game, the players have been recruited by either house Atreides or house Harkonnen to fight for control of Dune. They each start with a base and a small personal deck of cards representing the units that make up their forces. These units can be sent to sectors to claim a spice income that allows a player to purchase or build more and better units for their deck.&#10;&#10;When a sector becomes too crowded, a battle will be fought there. The winner of this battle will permanently claim the sector. A claimed sector does not give income anymore, but it is worth a number of victory points. After claiming a set number of sector cards, the game ends and the player with the most victory points will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Units can also be used to attack the opponent's base. Units in your deck and discard pile will defend against attacks on your base. If you fail to defend your base, it will be damaged during attacks and you might eventually lose the game because your base is destroyed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Long have students and faculty alike speculated about the strange possibility that these tunnels exist--and yet no one has ever proven their existence. Many have speculated that the tunnels were originally built for use by the faculty more easily and quickly move about campus, but I hardly believe that to be true. Others think it is a remnant from the Civil War--something the south had dug. Again, I disagree. Further, students have whispered about a far more sinister origin for the tunnels.&#10;This is the theory I agree with. My research and investigation into the case brings me to the conclusion that the tunnels were made like a labyrinth--something once used by a cult to summon and harness unimaginable horrors from another world. Now, it acts as a prison for those secrets. That is why I need you. I have found an old and incomplete blueprint which reveals the entrance to the tunnels.&#10;That&rsquo;s where you come in. I want you to go down and investigate, find clues to what happened there, and map out the tunnels for me.&#10;&#10;Welcome to One Page Cthulhu.

I hate to draw you away from the much-needed rest you are getting since our last encounter on the campus of Miskatonic University--but this is a matter of life and death.&#10;I have it on good authority that something strange is happening over at The Black Caverns near the edge of town. I can hardly believe it myself, but it seems the same cult we faced previously is finding a new home in the labyrinth beneath Arkham. The information I&rsquo;ve gathered is that they call themselves &ldquo;The Blind Ones&rdquo; and they prefer the dark and subterranean areas of Arkham.  It is a well-known fact among the professors of geology here at the university that there are many varied tunnels and paths in those caves. Most agree that at least seventy-five percent of the underground system has gone unexplored . . . or at the very least undocumented. It would seem that most of those who&rsquo;ve gone down there have never come back up. I hate to say it, but I believe they are being used in some sort of dark ritual. I beg you, go into those caverns, find the missing persons, and stop whatever horrific rituals are being performed.&#10;Sincerely,&#10;Herbert West&#10;&#10;Welcome to One Page Cthulhu.

This time, they mean to complete their ritual and awaken the Ancient Ones they worship. &ldquo;The Blind Ones,&rdquo; as they called themselves, have recruited countless youth from around the town of Arkham with false promises of freedom and power. Instead, they are performing terrible rituals on them to turn them into twisted and lowly creatures of the night, creatures who are part animal with horns and fur, creatures who thirst to feast on human blood. The cult calls them the Children of the Goat. They are the unholy spawn of the Ancient God known as The Lord of the Wood.&#10;I&rsquo;m calling upon you this one final time to help me put a stop to this madness once and for all.&#10;Sincerely,&#10;Herbert West&#10;&#10;Welcome to One Page Cthulhu. A simple and easy 1920s horror role-playing-game you can play with a single sheet of paper. Perfect for a plane ride, hotel room, or anywhere else. You can even compete with your friends to see who can get the most clues and solve the mystery of Arkham Woods.&#10;Based on the same system as One Page Dungeon, One Page Cthulhu takes your solo roleplaying to the streets and locations of Arkham. This version of the system introduces sanity rules, investigation, and Lore Points. Additionally, it offers a new and frightening way to level up your character.&#10;This is the third and final entry in the Herbert West trilogy for the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dear Detective,&#10;If you are receiving this letter, it is because I am dead. Dark forces beyond anything you can imagine have converged upon me and taken my life from me... or perhaps something worse.&#10;I have seen horrors beyond what the normal human mind can comprehend. Ocean waves that seem to have a life of their own, men with the face of a fish, and a looming figure over the sea--waiting just beyond some unseen veil to come into our world.&#10;It has taken all of my willpower simply not to go insane.&#10;I&rsquo;ve been investigating a strange underground society in the seaside town of Innsmouth. They claim to be a society, a social club, but I know for a fact they are a cult--a cult hellbent on bringing doom to our world. This is the very thing I was trying to prevent.&#10;Now... it is up to you to stop them once and for all.&#10;I have suspicions that the majority of their activities are taking place at the Innsmouth Docks. I fear that they may be getting close, close to unleashing some sort of dark ritual on our world.&#10;Go to the docks. Pick up where I left off. And pray that God is with you.&#10;Sincerely,&#10;A Friend&#10;&#10;P.S. For heaven sake, keep those damn lanterns lit!&#10;&#10;Lanterns on the Dock is a Roll+Write role-playing game of Horror Investigation set in 1920s New England. You, the detective/investigator, are following the pleas of a dead friend to check out the docks in the town of Innsmouth. It is there you will find the horrors you need to face.&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Combat is straight forward, you choose an opposing playing than by parties throw a dice per card they own and if they throw the card value you they get a hit and that the amount of enemy cards are discarded, the Leader card is discarded last.  In Missile combat, only cards with missiles weapons can be used.  The winner of any combat receives Booty Tokens.&#10;&#10;The other way to kill an enemy Leader is to Challenge him with your Leader in One-to-One combat, he may refused by giving you a Booty Token.&#10;&#10;Booty Tokens can be used instead of discarding cards, and in recruiting goblin cards and in a Challenge.&#10;&#10;You win, you must have the only Leader Card left in play.&#10;&#10;There are a number of Goblin and Leader cards which have special abilities.&#10;&#10;The game is free to print and is available to download below.&#10;&#10;I design the cards to be published in a games club magazine in the 1980s , this is why the cards are available only in black and white. so they could be photocopied on to card, but it was never published.

A player wins if their bits, from left to right, match their card.  The bits do not need to be in the same row, but there can only be one per column.&#10;&#10;On their turn a player moves either one of their tokens or one of the neutral tokens as far as they can in a straight line (without entering the opponent's home row).

Because somehow you know, you are not alone. Beneath these immediate drives lies something deeper, a spark, a joy, a hope. The glee, the audacity to split, to drive a wedge in your very self and become two. And through two, infinity.&#10;&#10;&#10;ORGANISM is a game of growth, multiplication, and struggle for 1-6 players. Wielding the simple actions of EAT / GROW / MOVE / CIRCULATE the minimal ruleset is maximally integrated and generates a tight yet boundless decision space. Amplified by a set of mutation cards which expand the rules in countless subtle and not-so-subtle ways, it is really a family of related games in a single box that can never be truly exhausted.&#10;&#10;Each player controls an Organism composed of three elements: EAT, MOVE, and GROW. In the beginning, each organism contains one of each element, which is a requirement for your organism to live. If an organism lacks one of these three elements at the end of the turn, it dies.&#10;&#10;Players take turns either eating food, moving into new positions (possibly coming into contact with other organisms or even dividing into separate organisms), growing new elements, or circulating food within their organism. When any elements of opposing organisms meet, the conflict is resolved by removing one or more elements from the board. You win the game if you capture a certain number of the opposing player&rsquo;s elements (or just eliminate them entirely from the board), or if you attain three separate organisms at the end of your turn, in which case they are well on their way to spreading across the globe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The top score will usually kill the target too.&#10;&#10;There is the possibility of friendly fire.&#10;&#10;Armour and penetration values have been generalised so that certain types of AFVs, ATGMs, gun penetration values, etc. can be grouped together.

When one of the kids accidentally steps on a dry branch, alerting the killer to their presence, he gives chase, intent on keeping his secret a secret. The kids hightail it back to town on their bikes and head straight to the police station to report what they saw. After several hours of searching in the forest, the police finally locate the body. However, given a recent string of disapperances, they have a theory that more bodies may be hidden in the woods. You and your colleagues at The Will Street Detective Agency have been hired to consult on this case and dig deeper for evidence that will lead to the killer&rsquo;s capture. The kids are reluctant to say much out of fear that the killer will be coming to silence them for good so you have your work cut out for you. Find out as much as you can from the kids and identify the mysterious stranger in the woods. Easthaven Forest is a place where many dark secrets live and thrive. If you investigate this case properly and turn over the right stones, you may learn what some of them are and they may change much of what you&rsquo;ve come to believe about Valley Falls.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Level: 7.5/10&#10;&#10;",

The tiny island of Gold Hook is home to a mere 32 families and can only be reached by ferry. With a few eating establishments, stretches of uninhabited beachfront, and The Kingfisher hotel, Gold Hook is a quaint tourist getaway in temperate months and is mostly cut off from the mainland in the winter. After the National Weather Service announces that a nor&rsquo;easter is headed their way, the residents of Gold Hook begin to evacuate the island using the small ferry that makes the two mile journey back and forth to the mainland. On its way back to pick up the last batch of residents, the ferry experiences a mechanical failure that renders it inoperable, leaving you and a few other people behind on the island to fend for themselves during the storm. Not long after the storm begins to hammer the coastline of Gold Hook, one of those left behind is found strangled with a length of strangely knotted rope, leading you to conclude that The Seaside Strangler is one of those who didn&rsquo;t make it back to the mainland. The police and Coast Guard are unavailable for the next twenty-four hours due to the extreme weather so help will not be coming any time soon. Leaving the island is not an option. Your only choice...determine who The Seaside Strangler is and close a case that the police have been unable to close.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Level: 6.5/10&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Shadow Brothers&rsquo; Carnival of Chaos had only been setup in Valley Falls for a little more than a day when Madame Ruby was found murdered in her fortune teller&rsquo;s wagon, bludgeoned to death with her own crystal ball. Although the killer was efficient in their killing, they left Madame Ruby before they were certain she was dead. In a last ditch effort to provide information about the one who murdered her, Madame Ruby managed to scrawl this note before passing over into the Great Beyond: &ldquo;The spirits will tell you who did this to me.&rdquo; The prime suspects for the murder come from the freak show. Those are the people you need to focus on. However, if they won&rsquo;t talk, maybe the spirits will. There have been reports of some strange occurrences going on at night after the midway shuts down. The carnies are claiming that something is using the midway games to leave cryptic messages. So you have a murder investigation, a creepy carnival, and a midway that may or may not be haunted by ghosts who are seeking to shed some light on Madame Ruby&rsquo;s murder by leaving messages amongst the test-your-luck games.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Level: 7/10&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rosemary Clark is one of the world&rsquo;s most popular and enduring cozy mystery novelists. For the past two years, however, she has lived as a recluse in her hilltop mansion, cutting off contact with friends, family, and the public at large. The reason for her withdrawal from the public eye has been a subject of much debate until earlier this week when Ms. Clark emerged to announce that she had been writing her final novel, entitled &ldquo;The Dark and Stormy Night.&rdquo; To celebrate the completion of the book, Ms. Clark invited a small group of her closest friends and associates to Winterwood Manor with the tantalizing revelation that she had featured all of them as characters in the novel. Benjamin Baker, owner of The Will Street Detective Agency and your boss, is on the guest list because of years spent advising Ms. Clark on the finer details of being a private detective. After the guests arrive and dinner has been served, Rosemary reveals that she has spent the last two years leaving her estate in secret to investigate a very specific crime and that the novel contains hints about both the crime and the one who committed it. Poised to reveal more about the plot and the main players in her mystery, Rosemary has just taken a sip of her nightcap when the lights flicker suddenly and then go out for a period of approximately ten seconds. A scream rips through the night and then the lights come back on. Inexplicably, Rosemary is gone. All that&rsquo;s left where she was standing are a few spatters of blood. After a thorough search of the house, Rosemary is nowhere to be found, and while it&rsquo;s unclear whether any sort of crime has been committed, there is a definite feeling that something is wrong here. Benjamin immediately calls you to come and investigate, insisting that he can&rsquo;t be the one to question the other guests since he is just as much a suspect as they are. Now, you are here at Winterwood Manor tasked with solving the type of serpentine mystery that Rosemary Clark was known for. Determine what happened to Rosemary Clark, search through the clues of her final novel to determine the nature of the crime and the identity of the criminal she had been investigating, and solve the mystery of The Dark and Stormy Night.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Level: 7/10&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Voodoo Mary was at the pinnacle of rock stardom in the 90&rsquo;s, charting a string of hits, playing to sold-out stadiums around the world, and even notching a Grammy nomination. Somewhat of an anomaly, the band itself was a revolving door for musicians that served as a vehicle for the band&rsquo;s namesake, principal songwriter, and only original member, Mary Kershaw. The world, however, loved Voodoo Mary and were captivated by her voice which had once been described as &ldquo;a bayou blend of cigarette smoke, attitude, and smooth whiskey.&rdquo; Yet, like so many bands, their star doesn&rsquo;t shine quite as brightly anymore, and they are a shadow of the band they used to be, playing in clubs with a capacity of 500 instead to arenas of 20,000. Desperate to right the ship and help Voodoo Mary reclaim its spot amongst rock royalty, manager Reg Kennedy announced suddenly that all of the band members and road crew would be replaced at the end of the tour in hopes of finding a group of professionals who could do justice to Mary&rsquo;s impressive catalog of songs. Tempers and tensions understandably ran high because of the decision, but the two shows leading up to the end of the tour went off well despite it all. The Carbon Underground was set to be the last show with the current band and road crew. Everything seemed to be going according to schedule until Reg didn&rsquo;t show up for the VIP Meet and Greet, leaving Mary&rsquo;s personal assistant to manage the event. A throng of fans was actually in the middle of posing for photos with Mary and the rest of the band when someone accidentally bumped one of the equipment cases near the stage, causing the body of a very dead band manager to fall out. Get your Backstage Pass to Voodoo Mary&rsquo;s Carbon Underground show and solve the mystery of who killed Reg Kennedy!&#10;&#10;Difficulty Level: 7/10&#10;&#10;",

A handful of victims were abducted at various points throughout the month, killed in gruesome ways, decorated to resemble popular children&rsquo;s toys, and gift-wrapped for the police to find. Among those &ldquo;toys&rdquo; that were created and left for the authorities: a life-sized Jack in the Box that caused a spring-loaded victim to pop out of the top when the handle was cranked, a Nutcracker doll decorated with greasepaint and blood, a robot that was created from both human and mechanical parts, and a marionette whose movements could be controlled via a series of cables that were attached the victim&rsquo;s limbs. The gift cards attached to each one were all signed by someone calling themselves &ldquo;The Toymaker.&rdquo; Police were closing in on the culprit when The Toymaker stopped killing, causing the trail to grow cold. They have continued to pursue leads throughout the year, but they haven&rsquo;t had any real breakthroughs in a while. Earlier this week, a new &ldquo;gift&rdquo; arrived from the killer, and it is reasonable to assume that the murders will start anew. If the pattern holds, there is only a very finite amount of time to investigate before The Toymaker goes underground again. No doubt The Toymaker has more &ldquo;toys&rdquo; in mind to create so lives are at risk.&#10;&#10;Difficulty Level: 7/10&#10;&#10;",

The museum group unexpectedly disappears while exploring the farm, and the S.T.A.L.K. group is left to piece together what happened. One of the only bits of evidence they have is a note nailed to the front door of the Montgomery house impossibly signed by The Gravedigger.

That&rsquo;s what passengers who sign up to &ldquo;Voyage Aboard the Black Dagger&rdquo; will experience as they set sail on a 4-day luxury pirate-themed cruise in the Atlantic. Those who book a spot aboard The Dagger will spend their time in full pirate regalia, enjoying the high seas as buccaneers of old did: imbibing on copious amounts of rum, feasting in the banquet hall, gambling, and lounging on the deck. As part of a new promotion, guests aboard the ship will also have the duration of the cruise to search for clues aboard The Black Dagger that will lead to Captain Armstead&rsquo;s treasure. Whoever finds the treasure first wins $25,000. Given your recent case load with The Will Street Detective Agency, you are eager for a break and book passage aboard the ship, thinking it sounds like fun...and a way to possibly win a nice stack of cash. A group of history and English professors from Valley Falls University has the same idea and books spots on the cruise as a last hurrah before the fall term begins. The voyage is everything the brochures describe and more.
