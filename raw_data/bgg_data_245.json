If the player lands on a brick, stick or straw square they take a house piece of that type from the pile on the table.

Players are aiming to collect both pieces of each house, which are slotted together in front of them.&#10;If the player lands on a wolf square, they spin the wolf spinner. If the spinner points to a stick or straw house, the player may take one of those pieces from another player saying &quot;I&rsquo;ll huff and I&rsquo;ll puff, and I will blow your house down!&quot; If they do not need the house piece, because they have already completed that house, they take the piece and return it to the relevant pile on the table. If the spinner points to the brick house, the wolf cannot blow it down, so the player cannot take another player&rsquo;s house piece.&#10;When a player has assembled all three houses, they have to continue to play in order to reach the safety of the middle of the playing board (throwing the exact number, or more to move there). Other players can still take pieces of their completed straw and stick houses. If this happens, then the player who loses a piece/s of their house, must replace it/them before, again, attempting to go to the middle of the playing board.&#10;The winner is the first player to reach the safety of the middle of the playing board, having assembled their three houses.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A self-contained spin-off of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game from Decipher, Tribbles is a fairly straightforward card game where you are trying to empty your 7 card hand in order to score points (&quot;tribbles&quot;) that you have been able to play. Each card represents a certain quantity of &quot;tribbles&quot; (1, 10, 1000, or 10,000.) The game play follows a sequential order, with each player needing to play the next higher value of tribble out of his hand than the one played immediately before.  If no such card is held, the player must pass and draw a card from his personal deck. There are also optional effects on each card, some reminiscent of Uno (among them Skip and Reverse), that vary the play sequence, score some special points, or allow a player to discard a card. A round ends when either a player is out of hand cards or all but one of the players are out of cards in their deck. Only the player who goes out scores points for his Tribbles played that round. Five rounds make a game. The player who scores the most tribbles in those five rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game provides four pre-constructed decks totaling 112 cards, which are color coded to fit a theme. These cards can be interchanged to create different decks. To make the game even more customizable, &quot;tribbles&quot; cards from the ST:CCG expansion set &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; are compatible with this game. These cards can increase the highest tribbles card to 100,000, plus add a new special ability (a bonus for collecting a specific set of cards) and different combinations than those included in the boxed set.&#10;&#10;Also included in the game are reference cards which list the makeup of each standard deck and explain what the special effects are. In addition, you get a scoresheet and even a small pencil.&#10;&#10;",

The last player to place a block without causing the platform to tumble wins.&#10;&#10;Hoverkraft is intended for two players, but it's fun to challenge yourself to build bigger and better structures.

Your friends may curse you for introducing them to Hoverkraft at first, but they'll be drawn back to it. There's something addictive about it.&#10;&#10;",

The rules of succession are simple.... one year from this date, the warrior that has aquired the most riches or has performed the most heroic deeds will become OUR NEW LEADER!&#10;&#10;The goal of the Snarf Quest Card Game is to take our hero Snarf through a grand adventure and acquire as much treasure as possible. Each player is making his own adventure for Snarf. At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure is declared to have the best Snarf adventure and becomes king of the Zeethvah village and WINS!&#10;&#10;There are two basic departures from most card games. One, everyone draws from the same deck (known as the storydeck). Two, nobody ever holds cards in his hand. All cards are displayed where everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;During each players turn, he controls Snarf (represented by the supplied miniature) and his actions. You must spend Action Points to move Snarf up and down the storyline (ten cards placed side by side next to the storydeck). As these storylines are activated, they are removed, the story line moves together and a replacement card is placed in the storyline next the the storydeck (the draw pile). Activated cards can help you or hurt your opponents, depending on what happens in the storyline. At the end of the game, the player with the most Treasure Points, Wins.&#10;&#10;The basic game comes with 50 cards, a snarf miniature and is made for 2 to 3 players. However, with each additional 20 cards you add to your deck, one more player can be added. 5 is the recommended maximum. 20 card expansion sets can be purchased that also include a new miniature. Each of these expansions is based around a different character from the Snarf Quest comic strip. This is not a collectable card game, all starter and expansion decks are identical.&#10;&#10;In 2003 the game was reproduced as a new version of the game which comes with a 100-card deck and one Snarf miniature. There are no expansions for this edition of the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Snarfquest Expansion 1 (Suthaze)&#10;    Snarfquest Expansion 2 (Telerie)&#10;    Snarfquest Expansion 3 (Aveeare)&#10;    Snarfquest Expansion 4 (Raffendorf)&#10;    Snarfquest Miniatures Bonus Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game in the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;Description from Kosmos:&#10;&#10;In this two-player game featuring Gallic heroes Asterix &amp; Obelix, the occupying Romans wear the usual costume for those stationed here: bumps and bruises.&#10;&#10;New Roman overseer Zenturio has let the money-hungry Gallic chief Moralelastix convince him to mount an operation against his little village. As usual, the question isn't &quot;Will the Romans get beat up?&quot;, it's &quot;How badly will the Romans get beat up?&quot;&#10;&#10;The two players play as Asterix and Obelix. Each takes the matching playing figure as well as a set of 15 beating cards (3 cards in each of 5 different colors), which he places in front of himself as a face-down deck. Each player takes the top 5 cards in hand. In addition to the beating cards, there are Roman cards. Most of them show Roman Legionnaires (in 5 different colors), but there are also Pirates, Wild Boars, the traitor Moralelastix and 5 Village Feast cards.&#10;&#10;The 40 cards are well shuffled and placed as a face-down pile. Then, the top 16 cards are drawn and placed face-down on the table in classic Phalanx formation (4x4 grid). The remaining cards act as a draw pile.&#10;&#10;The player with the longest mustache (or alternately the biggest belly) begins. He places his figure in front of one of the four Phalanx rows and turns the topmost card over. A red Roman! Red Romans can only get beat up by Red beating cards. If the active player doesn't have any, then the Roman card is turned back over again and that player's turn is over. If he does has a red card, though, then he has to choose whether to end his turn (taking the beaten Roman as a trophy) or turn another card over, hoping to press his luck.&#10;&#10;A player can keep going until (in an extreme case) he's cleared an entire row of the Phalanx. In that case, the active player gets to refill his hand to 5 cards and then start in on another row. Of course, that may not be such a good idea. Because if he keeps going and finds a Roman card he can't beat up, then his turn is over and he receives nothing. All of the Romans he would have won are removed from the game instead. Players can reduce the luck a little bit, in that they can discard one card from their hand to look at the last card in the row where they placed their figure.&#10;&#10;When a player ends his turn (freely or because he was forced to), then he refills his hand to five cards and it is the other player's turn. Any holes in the Roman Phalanx are also filled back in with cards from the draw pile. Lastly, the player whose turn just ended gets to block the next player from trying one of the rows (either horizontally or vertically).&#10;&#10;Of the 40 Roman cards, only 30 show actual Romans (as well as Zenturios himself). The remaining 10 cards are: 3 Pirates, 1 Wild Boar, Moralelastix, and 5 Evening Feasts. Pirates are easy to beat: Any card will do. To get Moralelastix, two cards of a single color are needed. The Wild Boar ends the player's turn immediately, but he gets to keep the Romans he beat up on so far. If a Feast is revealed, nothing happens and the player gets to keep going. Revealed Feasts are set aside, and once the fifth Feast shows up the game is over.&#10;&#10;Now, the players count their victory points. The purple point goes to the player who got Moralelastix. A brown point is for the most pirates. The majorities in the five Roman colors are worth the red, blue, yellow, green and black points, respectively. The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Like any farm, this farm had rodents living on it. To be honest, it was infested with rats. Lots and lots of rats. For generations these rats had been eating the Carob Beans.&#10;&#10;The farmer had a beautiful wife that loved to bake. More than anything she liked to bake pies ...All kinds of tasty pies. As the hot pies came out of the oven she would put them on the window sill of their quaint little farm house to let them cool off and the sweet aroma of the freshly baked pies would waft across the whole farm.&#10;&#10;One day one of the rats noticed the pleasing fragrance and followed it all the way back the farm house. There he found a pie sitting at the window&rsquo;s edge. He tried and tried as hard as he could but being just a single rat he could not move that pie off the window sill.&#10;&#10;Not wanting to easily give up he quickly ran off to get some of his fellow rats with the promise of a piece of the pie if they would help him lift it off the window sill and carry it away. They were successful! ...Very, very successful! Over time they learned that different pies weighed different amounts and that they needed more rats to take the heavier pies. The rats also started forming groups or &ldquo;crews&rdquo; to try and steal the pies. They were becoming competitive, even among themselves, in their attempts to steal these delicious treats.&#10;&#10;In the human world news quickly spread of this odd phenomenon and they became know as...&#10;&#10;The Pie Rats of the Carob Bean Farm!&#10;&#10;In Pie Rats of the Carob Bean Farm each player takes on the role of a Captain of the Rats and tries to build a crew of not-so-loyal rats in an attempt to loot the farmer&rsquo;s wife of as many of her pies as you can. The heavier the pie the more rats it takes to steal it, the more points it is worth. The Captain with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The winner places the difference in the battle totals on the loser's castle wall.&#10;&#10;Castle walls with three or more soldiers on them are broken through.  The owner of the castle has a coin  stolen or a soldier rescued from the castle by the owner of the soldiers, and the soldiers are returned to their owning player.  Castle walls with fewer than three soldiers on them remain standing and keep any soldiers on them.&#10;&#10;When one player has stolen at least three coins OR when one player runs out of coins, the player that has stolen the most coins is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

After shuffling each deck separately, Arrange the 3 decks (Explore, Scavenge, Craft) face down on the table in a line next to each other.&#10;&#10;The selected Player One goes first and remaining Players take turns in a clockwise direction. On your turn you can pick up 2 cards from the top of any deck. (Explore, Scavenge, Craft). You are allowed to pickup any deck of your choice, for example, 1 'Explore' card and 1 'Craft' card based on what you need.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to make your way through the 'Explore' deck and find 3 Power Switches that are hidden in the deck. The first player to do so wins the game.&#10;&#10;Once you receive foe cards totaling -4 hit points, you cannot advance any further in the 'Explore' deck. You must then craft items picked up from the 'Craft' deck, to remove dinosaur cards cards, using scavenged materials from the 'Scavenge' deck.&#10;&#10;There are also helpful cards scattered throughout each deck that are free to use once found. These are discarded once used.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The naval player tries to line up next to the scavenger and fire upon it (where the second spinner is used to determine hits). The scavenger player wins by collecting 7 gold coins without getting sunk. The naval player wins by scoring 7 hits on the scavenger ship and sinking it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Mr. de Bono's website:&#10;The intention was to produce the simplest possible game that could be played with a high degree of skill. An attempt was made to fulfill the following conditions:&#10;&#10;1. A minimum number of playing pieces, preferably one each. &#10;The smallest possible board.&#10;&#10;2. A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.&#10;&#10;3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.&#10;&#10;4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play for ever.&#10;&#10;The object is to score 12 points provided that the other player scores at least 6 points - if the other player scores less than six points then the player reaching 12 points is the loser! Whereas in most games the person scoring the highest number of points is the winner - in the 3 Spot game the 'winner' can be the 'loser'.&#10;&#10;Points are scored by the position of the tiles on the board which is a 3x3 grid. You can try to score the points you need, or force your opponent to take points.&#10;&#10;Appears with L-Game in Rex Games' Two Smart Games mini-anthology.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Odynauts are a competitive race of aliens that prosper from the feeling that winning brings them. The one place on Earth where lady luck truly smiles at you is the casino. The Odynauts decided to take the gamble and spread out to the foremost gambling cities on our planet, from Macau to Monte Carlo and from Las Vegas to Amsterdam. They turned the casinos upside down and won at every game the casinos have on offer. Slot machines were cleaned out and poker tournaments were won. The casino bosses were not amused and quickly banned the Odynauts from their casinos. To still their voracious appetite for winning, the Odynauts have made their own casino game. Casino chips are bitten into pieces and slot machines are stolen. All these well-known items from the casino form the basis of new and unique game: Chipleader. The Odynauts challenge you. Are you brave enough to accept their challenge? Are you a smart gambler and do you have the strategic insight to score the most points in putting casino chips back together? Can you protect your chips from your opponents' attacks?&#10;&#10;Chipleader is card game for two to four players. The goal is to collect as many points as you can with strategic gambling and by making casino chips before four different casinos have been visited. Players have to protect their casino chips against their opponents' attacks in an effort to become Chipleader.&#10;&#10;Casino chips are made with chip fragment cards of different colors and values. Every chip fragment card has a quarter of a chip depicted on it. Four chip fragment cards can form a casino chip and only when a player has formed such a chip can she place those cards on the table. The value of a complete casino chip placed on the table can increase or decrease with the use of Odynaut face cards. By playing these cards, a player's opponents can even entirely eliminate the value of one of her chips.&#10;&#10;To obtain chip fragment and Odynaut face cards, a player has to make sets with five types of &quot;gamble-suit&quot; cards. Five suit cards are randomly placed face up alongside each other on the table. This row of cards is called the &quot;gambling row&quot;. Each player also receives three suit cards at the beginning of the game. A set is created whenever three, four or five suit cards of the same type are aligned in the gambling row.&#10;&#10;",

Some events allow a choice of trying an average attempt, a safe attempt, or going all out (which increase the risks of fouling or injuries).  In events like the high jump and pole vault, the more attempts made the greater chance of fatigue.  Injuries and fatigue affect the results of later events.&#10;&#10;Each event is converted to the standard scoring table for the decathlon.&#10;&#10;Also known as Track Meet.&#10;&#10;",

They're evidently an important part of the game: of the 137 cards, 56 are dice cards.&#10;&#10;The combat between two players happens comparing two dice cards that players select from their hands. The one being attacked can even choose to grab the first dice card from a deck facing down, to leave the result completely to chance.

Players take turns playing their cards, with the value of the card determining how far they may move a pawn. Certain cards have special possibilities (a King or an Ace may be played to get a new pawn into play, while a four moves you back instead of forward). A few spaces on the board have special properties as well, requiring certain cards to be played to enter or leave them. If more than two players are playing, they play in teams, devils vs. angels. When you have brought all your own pawns to your safety zone, you must move your partner's pawns (without conferring with each other).&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     game board&#10;     24 playing pieces (marbles)&#10;     requires deck of cards to play (not included)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lifeline is a territorial strategy game for two players (Black and White) that is played on the cells of an initially empty hexhex board. The recommended board sizes are between 3 and 12 cells per side.&#10;&#10;The game was invented by Michael Amundsen and Luis Bola&ntilde;os Mures. Although inspired by Go, it bears a significant resemblance to Kanare Kato's Meridians.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is an entire set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.&#10;&#10;A group is dead if there is no path of connected empty cells between that group and any other group of its color. The path does not need to be a straight line.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform the following actions in order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a stone of your color on an empty cell. If it is your first turn of the game, perform this action twice.&#10;     Remove all dead enemy groups.&#10;     Remove all dead friendly groups.&#10;&#10;&#10;The board positions at the start and at the end of your turn must be different. In other words, if the only stone you remove is the one you just placed, your placement is illegal.&#10;&#10;The last player to make a placement wins. Note that, after your first turn, you will always have a placement available unless you have no groups on the board.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsThe standard game is made fair by the combination of the double first move and White's swap option, as described above. This balancing method is called strong pie. Some alternatives are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Weak pie: Instead of placing twice on their first turn, players place one stone on every turn, and dead groups are not removed until there are at least four stones on the board. White's swap option still applies, but takes place after Black has placed only one stone.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Komi pie: Before the game starts, the first player chooses a whole number as the komi value, and then the second player chooses sides. The first four stones are placed in the same manner as with weak pie, but there is no swap option after Black's fist placement. Throughout the game proper, White will have the option to spend a point of komi instead of making a placement.&#10;&#10;&#10;Unlike strong pie, these methods require somewhat large boards to be effective: at least base 6 for weak pie, and at least base 7 for komi pie.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

They have been kicked off the ship by their captain in Walk the Plank and chased by sharks in Get Bit, and now they face their final challenge.&#10;&#10;In Hold Your Breath! each player assumes the role of a pirate treading water in the ocean. These brilliant tacticians have decided to play a game of &quot;Hold Your Breath&quot; to see who is the toughest pirate because, you know, what else are you gonna do in the middle of the ocean facing certain death?&#10;&#10;The game is played in two rounds. In the first round, each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. What about the losers? Who cares, they are losers. But if you really want to know, well, they dove down and ran out of oxygen before they could resurface, so now they are just &quot;resting&quot; underwater until the next game, okay? But we digress...&#10;&#10;Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot;, and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before he runs out of air and therefore decides to take a rest. Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner. Be careful, though, because if you dove the deepest in the first round, you will surely have the toughest time getting back to the surface since A) you swam the deepest and B) no one else wants to see you make it back alive.&#10;&#10;",

Players play the part of sheriffs in the Old West, each trying to capture the highest value collection of outlaws in their jails.&#10;&#10;Your jail (aka Calaboose) is a collection of cards kept face up on the table in front of you.  Jails can only hold 5 outlaws at any one time, and each outlaw has a &quot;strength&quot; rating.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can either place an outlaw from your hand into an empty slot in your jail or into someone else's jail.  The outlaws each have &quot;power&quot; ratings.  An outlaw can be sent to replace a weaker outlaw in someone else's jail.&#10;&#10;You can defend your jail.  If someone sends an outlaw to your jail, you can eliminate him with one of your outlaws - but you have to send your defender to someone else's jail.  That person can defend against you, of course, so each turn has the possibility of generating a chain reaction that involves multiple players around the table.&#10;&#10;It's a lighthearted social game with a solid core of strategy. Higher value cards tend to be weaker, and sets (or &quot;gangs&quot;) are worth much more than singletons.  Everyone at the table can see what's in your jail, so as you gain the advantage you also acquire a bullseye. Attacking another player's jail may backfire on you, so you have to be careful and constantly adjust your strategy to the cards on the table.&#10;&#10;",

Cathala suggested a few changes, then the pair worked together to bring the game to the table.&#10;&#10;In Witty Pong the ping-pong table is recreated by laying four cards in a 2x2 square, with a ball token being placed on one of the cards. On a turn, a player flips a card and places it on one of the three cards not covered by the ball. Two situations can occur:&#10;&#10;&bull; If the card depicts a ball somewhere in the artwork, the player must move the ball token to a new card. If he says anything or hesitates too long, he loses one of the three banana tokens with which he started the game.&#10;&#10;&bull; If the card doesn't have a ball on it, the player must say the &quot;proper&quot; word, with the word being determined by the letters and colors on the three uncovered cards. The word starts with &quot;P&quot; or &quot;T&quot; depending on which letter shows more frequently, and ends with &quot;ong&quot; or &quot;ing&quot; depending on whether more blue or red paddles are showing. If he says the wrong word or takes too long, he loses a banana.&#10;&#10;Lose all your bananas, and you're out of the game. Last moneky standing wins. The game includes advanced rules that change what to say if the same letter or color is on all three paddles; additional rules allow for competitive play in which players can steal bananas from one another if they say the right word first.&#10;&#10;",

Each game turn represents 12 hours. Each aircraft strength point represents from six to 24 aircraft, depending on type and pilot quality. Naval units represent one ship for carriers, battleships and heavy cruisers, and two or three ships for other units.&#10;&#10;The rules contain a little more than 11,000 words. That works out to mean an experienced player can finish a game in about three to four hours. Rules cover such things as: leadership, random events, reinforcements, task force organization, carrier operations, surface combat, shore bombardment, transporting ground units, amphibious landings, air bases, anti-aircraft fire, fatigue, night operations, fog of war, scouting, alternative deployments, and panic.&#10;&#10;",

Beginning with the player who selected the object card, in as many rounds as needed. Bids must increase by 1000 or a multiple thereof. Once a player passes, he may not re-enter this auction.&#10;&#10;The highest bidder pays the bank and receives the object card. The player may make change with the bank. The card will have 3 objects on it. The purchaser now has to distribute each of those objects.&#10;&#10;Three possibilities  exist for the card, each of the three objects on the card are used one at a time in any sequence desired.&#10;&#10;The sequence is decided by the player who paid for the card. Each item is released after it is used:&#10;&#10;1. An object for which he has only 0-2 copies in his collection: in this case he must take the object into his own collection. He sets one mark on the first field of the item or shifts it to the right to the next field. If this is the third type of an item, he immediately receives a bonus of 30000 from the bank.&#10;&#10;2. An object for which he already 3 or more copies in its collection. In this case he sells the object to any fellow player who has from 0-4 copies of the object in his collection. The fellow player cannot reject the purchase and must pay the seller 20000. The buyer moves his marker to the appropriate field. If this causes the marker to move to the third position, he should immediately receive a bonus of 30,000 marks from the bank.&#10;&#10;Note: the fourth and fifth objects of a type are thus always sold; one never receives these two objects from an object card that they have won for auction.&#10;&#10;Buying more than 3 types of art makes ones collection decrease in value. The buyer must pay the seller the fixed purchase price of 20000 marks and he must also pay 10,000 marks to the bank.&#10;&#10;3. A type of object which is not on his play-table (recognizably from the colored beam on his play-table at the bottom left hand corner). In this case, the auction winner sells such objects - as under 2 as described  to other players&#10;&#10;The object card is placed face up in the second side of the card holder after its 3 objects are distributed among the players.&#10;&#10;The top face down card is turned up and added to the remaining 4 face up cards.&#10;&#10;The player who purchased the last card, selects the next card to auction.&#10;&#10;The game ends the moment one of the players goes broke.&#10;&#10;First the fellow player is paid off, then the bank and then buyer receives any possible bonus.&#10;The winner is the player who has the most cash.

Units moving using the actual historical map features.&#10;&#10;In February 1864, US Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick conceived a bold stroke against the Confederate capital, which local Union sympathizers had correctly reported as wide open to attack. The goals of the raid were to release the thousands of Union prisoners of war held in Libby Prison and on Belle Isle, as well as inflicting damage on key Rebel installations like the Tredegar Iron Works. Secret orders also authorized the killing of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and burning the city to the ground.&#10;&#10;Historically, at the last minute, Kilpatrick lost his nerve and withdrew without firing a shot. The game begins at that point, but with the assumption the Union commander's nerve holds. As the Union raiders enter the city, it's a race against time as they seek to commandeer transport for the sick, wreak destruction across Richmond as slaves and panicked civilians fill the streets, and escape before Confederate army reinforcements begin pouring in from all directions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An open auction game, players bid for the heirlooms in Venetian palaces, which then get sold on as groups are completed. A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.&#10;&#10;A series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot. So you might get to sell your pictures for 16 each, but you might be forced to sell when the price is only 4 each.&#10;&#10;The game is totally open, and you can do the maths to work out the potential benefits to each player, but the game remains fun and quick. Tying the next auction to the current price is a clever idea too, and it can be worth bidding a bit more to control where the next auction will be. Long out of print, Canaletto stands up well with auction games like Medici.&#10;&#10;This later saw incarnations in 1996 as Le Jardin and 2000 as Der Garten des Sonnenk&#195;&#182;nigs.&#10;&#10;",

Raid the Interstellar Express space-rail to earn loot, infamy, and the ire of C.O.W. and the Galactic Central Bank. In order to loot the train you&rsquo;ll need to first dispose of the meddlesome Tinstar Lawbots, who will do everything in their power to stop your heist. Team up with other Raiders, or do what bandits do best, double-crossing them when their chips are down. Anything goes when you&rsquo;re out to make a big score!&#10;&#10;In Rail Raiders Infinite, players assume control of a bandit raiding the Interstellar Express space-rail. Raiders move from car to car searching for loot. The player who gets the biggest haul of double-dollars before the train makes it to the station wins the game. Combat and other actions are determined by rolling a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of five or more custom poker dice. The player who scores the highest hand wins the roll.&#10;&#10;Train Cars, except for the locomotive and caboose, always start the game face down showing the roof side of the car. This way raiders don&rsquo;t know where the richest opportunities or the most Law Bots are beforehand. When a Raider moves onto, or starts its turn on, a face down car it may turn that car face up. Once a Train Car is turned face up, then Loot tokens are placed on the car and Long Arm of the Law cards are drawn equal to the numbers shown on the car.&#10;&#10;Each player takes control of a single Raider. Each Raider has a model and a card with a unique ability which only that Raider may use. A Raider may take three actions during its turn from the following choices: Move, Search, or Showdown. Any action type can only be performed twice during a player&rsquo;s turn. So while a player gets to take three actions only two of them can be the same type of action.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move: The Raider may move to an adjacent train car.&#10;     Search: The Raider may reveal a Loot token and draw the number of Loot cards shown. A Raider may not Search if a Lawbot is on the same train car.&#10;     Showdown: The Raider gets into a shootout with Lawbots or opposing Raiders!&#10;&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a Raider's turn, a High Noon card is drawn. High Noon cards have special effects which may affect the turn's game play. Additionally, the High Noon deck serves as a timer for the game. Once the High Noon deck has been exhausted, the train has reached the station and the Raiders need to jump off the train or be captured!&#10;&#10;Long Arm of the Law cards tell you how many, and what type of, Lawbots to place on the train car. Some Long Arm of the Law cards even have special effects that may swing the tide of the game allowing Lawbots to roll more dice, gain rerolls, or even speed up the train!&#10;&#10;Poker dice are used to resolve shootouts and other situations within the game. Each die features six values: 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, and Joker. Players roll a hand of five dice and then attempt to make the highest poker hand from the results. The player with the highest hand wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Crime Zoom is a series of investigation game for 1 and more players and for plays of about 1 hour.&#10;&#10;In Crime Zoom, you will conduct your investigation freely. Discuss between players to choose the tracks to follow. And as soon as you think you have solved the case, go to the questionnaire. Who is guilty? What is his motive? What is the murder weapon? And some subsidiary questions, of course. The solution will answer each of the questions. The epilogue will come to tell all this in a story or a testimony history to understand the plot that has been played.&#10;&#10;Crime Zoom: A Dirty Objective is a demo case of the Crime Zoom family (in only 38 cards). It brings you in Brooklyn in 1980.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
