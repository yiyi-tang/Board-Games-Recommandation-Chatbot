    "Description": "From the box: &quot;It is the late Middle Ages (1000 - 1500 AD.) You are a knight from a distant kingdom seeking to make an alliance with the wealthy kingdom of Agrafor.  To win the king's favor, you are bringing gifts to present to him, but beware: the king's head guard is overly protective.  If he catches you in the castle, he will evict you.  The first player to get to the king's throne and presents their gifts wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You will receive a mission card that tells you what items to collect as gifts for the King of Agrafor.  Included in your gift will be armor, a well-crafted weapon, a luxury item from he East, and a work of fine art (a painting, engraving, mosaic, or sculpture.)&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The chance cards contain historical facts and information about the period...As part of the play, students will meet and travel with prominent figures from these centuries, including artists, scientists, and authors.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

It takes the darker end of the noir murder mystery, setting the players up as Private Investigators competing/co-operating (as they desire) to solve a murder.&#10;Working alongside the police, players must uncover all the information they can about the suspect, and eliminate methods and motives for the murder until they have enough information in their hand for the &quot;big reveal&quot;, where they explain to their lesser fellow detectives the full details of the murder, and collect their reward from the police.&#10;&#10;Player interaction involves trading of cards, with constant tension about any given move aiding an opponent's victory. But should the players let paranoia get the better of them, they will be forced to collaborate, and even then their lack of cooperation may allow the murderer to escape.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sumo GRYB is a pure strategy game for the GRYB Game System.  The goal of the game is to form a GRYB spanning four branches and multiple levels.  Each turn, you make two moves (one chip twice or two chips once each):  Valid moves are introducing a new chip to the root node of the tree, moving a chip down a level to a node of the lower quadrangle, or moving sideways to an adjacent node on its current quadrangle.  In all cases, the chip's final resting space must be unoccupied in order for it to move there.  Because valid winning combinations are essentially three-dimensional, this game is not for the faint of perception.&#10;&#10;Sumo GRYB was published in the instructions for GRYB Game System 2.0.&#10;&#10;",

At this scale none of them can be considered 'big' cities. There are three off-board cities, however: Moscow, Beijing and Vladivostok. Goods have to be delivered to these cities. Goods are produced in mines and the 'Build Mine' action replaces the 'Urbanization' action. Resource locations (where mines can be built) are shown on the map and reflect actual locations of those resources (although not necessarily the most important ones).&#10;&#10;",

The Moon Portal is placed on the remaining tile (the center tile for normal difficulty, on the side for harder difficulty, in a corner for masochistic players). Villagers can follow monks when they move. To rescue a villager, you have to bring him to the Moon Portal and take a special rescue action on that tile.&#10;&#10;Villagers come in families of 1, 2 or 3 members. When an entire family is rescued, you get the family's reward. Small families give small rewards (like an extra Qi, or an artifact that can move the other monks to your tile), large families give large rewards (like a sword that lets you turn one die to white during each exorcism, or an armor that cancels the ghosts' come-into-play effects).&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, some ghosts are able to kill villagers. Each time a villager gets killed, the players suffer the family's curse (which can go from annoying -like having a tao token removed from the game- to downright brutal -like having a extra Wu-Feng incarnation come into play-). Villagers also die if their tile is haunted. Haunters also force villagers to flee (villagers that cannot flee are killed).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the rules:&#10;&#10;Card Cricket was the result of 2 1/1 years' painstaking research into the statistical records of cricket matches going back several years. But it had its lighter side, too. It involved many pleasant days spent watching actual matches - recording every single detail of the games so that Card Cricket would be as authentic as possible.&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10;i) Two packs of cards as follows: &#10;a) Bowling pack (110 cards)&#10;b) Batting pack (108 cards)&#10;ii) A scoring pad which resembles an ordinary cricket score book&#10;iii) A special die - 5 faces showing out and 1 face showing 'not out'.&#10;iv) A chart showing by means of asterisks which batting shots can be played against the various types of balls that can be bowled&#10;v) A loose scoring sheet which serves as an example of how to score with instructions printed on the back.&#10;&#10;This is a mechanically simple cricket simulation game. You are expected to 'know' cricket (but why else would you be playing it?), and thus how to arrange and score matches, etc. Each player plays one team (obviously if more than two people are playing the game, they can take the part of different players in the cricket match).&#10;&#10;The mechanism is one of hand management. The bowler picks 6 random cards for the balls in the over, which he can play in any order. The batsman has a number of batting cards which varies according to which number he is batting at. The bowler plays a card (a ball) and the batsman plays a card against that ball. If the batting card is a valid stoke for that ball (a cover drive for a half volley outside off stump, a sweep to a googly, etc), then the outcome is as printed on the batting card sometimes runs, but often just fielded. If the batting card is not a valid stroke for the ball bowled, then the batsman is likely to be out (there are appeals and not outs using the die). If he is not out, the batsman replenishes his hand, and the next ball is bowled.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the PLAAY.COM website:&#10;&#10;On the heels of the success of SECOND SEASON Pro Football Game comes it's Canadian football counterpart: COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game! It's the most realistic and excitingly detailed  simulation of the Canadian pro game that's ever been created!&#10;&#10;With COLD SNAP, you can bring back &quot;the good old days&quot; of Canadian pro football, or, re-live last year's exciting pro season! ANY time is &quot;football season&quot; when you've got a copy of COLD SNAP on your game shelf! YOU call the plays, YOU set the defensive alignments, YOU decide who to bring in when a star player goes down with an injury. Think you can do a better job with your favorite Canadian pro team than the real-life coach did? Well, now you can find OUT! (HINT: you might just gain a new respect for the real-life coach!)&#10;&#10;Recent years have seen a glut of new football games hit the market. Many of them are very good. But two key differences make COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game stand out above the crowd of pro football simulation board games...&#10;&#10;FIRST, this is a pro football game where EVERY player on the field matters. In many other games, defenders and linemen are treated almost as an afterthought--some games don't even rate them at ALL! But in COLD SNAP, the success or failure of a play most often HINGES on the performance of these players! Yes, the star Canadian passers and runners will stand out on your table-top--but so will the star interior linemen, linebackers and defensive backs! It's exciting to watch!&#10;&#10;SECOND, the COLD SNAP results book is cleverly designed to tell you not only WHAT happens on every play, but also WHY! Other games might tell you, for example, that the quarterback just threw an incomplete pass--and that's all the information you get. However, the COLD SNAP results book will tell you whether the incompletion was the result of great coverage by a defensive back, a hurried throw thanks to a missed block by an offensive lineman, a wrong pass route run by the receiver, or any of a multitude of other possible reasons! You'll know what DID happen, AND what MIGHT have happened, if not for the play made or NOT made. It's just like watching pro football on TV, with the game book serving as your color commentator!&#10;&#10;COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game is incredibly detailed, yet easy to play. The offense coach chooses a ball carrier or intended receiver for one of six basic offense plays, while the defense coach secretly decides on one of four basic color-coded defense settings. (You can play solitaire, too--there are rules included for that!) Roll the dice, look up the result in the game book, record the gain or loss, and move on to the next play! It's that simple!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This is the original version of the game, which went through several iterations before ultimately appearing as a boxed game as Railway Rivals and Dampfross. It was designed by David Watts, a Welsh geography teacher and train buff.&#10;&#10;It was always intended first and foremost to be a good game to play, but David also wanted to use it for general education &ndash; explaining why railway lines were laid where they were, etc. The game is fundamentally straightforward &ndash; players build railway lines on a map (a tesselation of hexagons) with towns, rivers, hills, coastlines, etc. After a building phase there is then a racing phase &ndash; players race between randomly generated combinations of towns. Players with the most extensive efficient networks tend to win more races, and thus the game.&#10;&#10;It always existed as 'just' a set of rules, with a number of official or unofficial maps available from various sources. The earliest and crudest manifestation was just a few (5 or 6) A4 hexagon sheets, and colouring instructions to make the maps up. When postal games players showed considerable enthusiasm for the game, David moved on to produce large size (slightly bigger than A2) hexagon sheets, also with colouring instructions. Later on the maps were printed in one colour on big maps, which you could colour highlight yourself, and cover with sticky-back plastic sheets, so that maps could be reused if water-based pens were used that could be washed off. Multicolour maps followed, which were later printed with a laminate covering.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are very simple, and there is some luck involved with the random races that appear, and in racing. Nevertheless, the better players nearly always come out on top. Despite the apparent simplicity, there are plenty of opportunities for thoughtful play, especially with tactics such as blocking other players out of areas of the map.&#10;&#10;",

It was rich in coal, and much of the rail traffic was coal being sent to ports for export. In consequence, the map has 'special runs' - so on alternate runs, one end of the run is a special destination such as any or specific ports, or to edge towns for connection to England.&#10;&#10;The hilly terrain means that this is not a good map for beginners. Playing with the 'leapfrog' variant can mitigate some of these issues.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description by Avalanche Press&#10;&#10;&quot;Among the headwaters of the Roer River in western Germany, near the Belgian border, seven dams blocked the river's flow. Used for flood control and hydroelectric power, they presented a massive danger to Allied plans. American staff officers believed the Germans could blow them up or simply open their gates to create massive flooding all the way downstream, from the Roer to the Maas River in Holland, and stop the Allied advance in its tracks. To prevent this, the dams would have to be secured &mdash; and the newly re-energized German Army would not give up an inch of national territory without a fight.&quot;&#10;&#10;Roer River Battles is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series of games, with 10 scenarios based on these events. Roer River Battles includes just this booklet; you'll also need to use boards and pieces from Battle of the Bulge and Elsenborn Ridge games and some pieces from Cassino '44 and Road to Berlin games and Iron Curtain supplement.&#10;&#10;Roer River Battles is sold BOTH via .pdf download and as a printed booklet.&#10;&#10;",

Averett&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;No country ever lost a war by being too strong&quot; &#10;Field-Marshall Viscount Montgomery of Alamein&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CONQUEST OF THE WORLD represents a significant departure from traditional game design. The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers. &#10;Electronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.The game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.&#10;&#10;Forty-three countries have been divided into eleven &quot;politectonic&quot; or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.&#10;&#10;These figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.&#10;&#10;Pp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)&#10;&#10;PERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).&#10;&#10;Future shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.&#10;&#10;If you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.&#10;&#10;Conquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.&#10;&#10;&#10;THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
