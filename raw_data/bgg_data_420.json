    "Description": "From the Publisher's web site:&#10;&#10;The Auction - can you unmask the murderer?&#10;&#10;For 12 to 40 guests!&#10;&#10;At &quot;The Auction&quot; you will play a character in a fascinating plot of mystery, double-dealing, bribery, blackmail and intrigue. You will not just be watching, you will be completely involved in the wheeling and dealing. Can you outbid the opposition, keep your dark secret quiet and unmask the murderer? There is only one way to find out!&#10; A week before &quot;The Auction&quot; all of the guests attending will receive the front page of &quot;Yesterday's News&quot; - the antique dealers' magazine. This explains the background to the auction, the unfortunate death of Baroness Audry Von Munchen and the relics found on her last archaeological expedition. There will also be a copy of the guest list with a brief description of everyone attending the auction, including the character you have been given. This might be a lord, lady, the butler, a priest or even a spy!&#10;&#10;On the day of the event the guests will be met by you, acting as the solicitor of the late baroness. When everyone has arrived you call the gathering to order, welcome the guests and introduce Inspector Clu d'Eau. As the events start to unravel, everybody opens their own personal envelopes of information and finds out what they have been up to.&#10;&#10;The guests are soon the suspects as they start questioning, bribing and blackmailing each other. Towards the end, the auction itself takes place. All the deals and maneuvering come to fruition in a competitive flurry of bidding. After the auction the various claimants to the money make their cases and the solicitor decides between them. Inspector Clu d'Eau announces that he has solved the mystery of who has murdered the baroness. Everyone has a chance to make their accusations before the inspector reveals all.&#10;&#10;More than just a boxed version of a murder game, &quot;The Auction&quot; provides you with everything you need to run a fun, participative event for 12 to 40 people. Every guest has a character, with their own objectives and money and/or props, making the game both memorable and enjoyable for all kinds of people. We have been running &quot;The Auction&quot; since 1989 for a wide range of companies and businesses such as IBM and American Express.&#10;&#10;Because some of the guests at &quot;The Auction&quot; will have to play the part of criminals (including a drug-dealer) we think this game is suitable for people aged 15 and over.&#10;&#10;If you have looked through the introduction, and like what you see, you should buy a password for the main game from our shop&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Publisher's web site:&#10;&#10;Welcome to a night of murder!  For 14 to 40 guests!&#10;&#10;The Last Gasp is a Victorian murder mystery which runs for about three hours. Everyone taking part is given a character in the plot. As well as having a murder to investigate, characters will also have their own, secret objectives. Why does the church choir only accept female members? Where is the Earl hiding all his money? Can anyone persuade Captain Ratliffe to do the decent thing? At &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;, anything can happen - and generally does!&#10;&#10;The Plot&#10;&#10;It is New Year's Eve, 1899. George Sweet, the 5th Earl of Coddingham, has lead a wicked and dissolute life. His past is finally catching up with him and, eager to keep out of reach of the law, he is planning to flee abroad. Before he goes, he is holding one final party: &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;. Invited to it are all the people to whom his appalling behavior has brought the most grief and heartache: his ex-wives, Florence and Dawn, his present wife, Jojo, his ballet dancer son, William, and his long-suffering friend, Bernard. George is determined to use his party to make up for past mistakes.&#10;&#10;&#10;People from the Earl's local village and members of his staff are also at &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;: the local vicar is recruiting new members for the church choir, cavalry officer Captain Ratliffe is breaking a few more women's hearts, and Jarvis, the Earl's loyal butler, is making sure no one steals the sherry. The Earl's plans go slightly awry, however, when the police unexpectedly turn up, hoping to arrest someone for murder. Who do they want to arrest? The Earl of Coddingham....&#10;&#10;We think this game is suitable for anyone 13 years old and over.

This involves the writing of a new school song. At the end, accusations are made, the murderer is identified and the winning song selected.&#10;&#10;Fancy dress is optional, but strongly recommended!&#10;&#10;The plot usually runs for about 3 hours and is suitable for groups of all types and most ages. If you are planning to run it in your school, bear in mind that characters in murder mysteries often behave badly: they kill, they tell lies, they have affairs!&#10;&#10;",

It's up to you.&#10; It is the spring of 1884. America's west coast is slowly being populated with small towns full of settlers, coming to prospect for precious metals, set up ranches and run dubious saloons. Now the railway is coming! Cactus Gulch is one such small town. Founded 20 years ago, tonight it has a festive air as the townsfolk get set to start their 20th anniversary celebrations. Plus, the railway is coming! However, all is not running smoothly. Land disputes, disreputable card games, strange folk from out of town and hostile Indians are all adding to a tense atmosphere...&#10;&#10;Way out West lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&#10;&#10;The free introductory pdf file (79 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests, a copy of the Cactus Gulch Gazette - plus details of how to buy the game.&#10;&#10;",

And will his last will and testament remain unchallenged?&#10;&#10;The Reading of the Will is a &lsquo;sealed room&rsquo; murder mystery. When the Duke of Felthorpe is found dead in his bath, everything suggests that his death was accidental. The room was locked from the inside and, to gain entry, the door had to be broken down. So surely no one could have got in there and killed him!&#10;&#10;Everyone taking part plays a character who is here for the reading of the duke&rsquo;s Last Will and Testament. The contents of the will are a surprise to almost all of them. So why did the duke make these last-minute changes? Was he being blackmailed? Was he mad? Should this will be thrown out &ndash; and replaced with an earlier one?&#10;&#10;The murder mystery usually takes place during a meal. Fresh clues are introduced as the plot gradually unravels and evidence of murder emerges. One of the characters is the duke&rsquo;s butler &ndash; did he do it? Or was it the duke&rsquo;s maid? His idiot son? His idiot son&rsquo;s scheming wife? By the time all is revealed, everyone will have had a great time playing their parts, working out whodunnit and trying to prevent other people accusing them.&#10;&#10;Who is the Reading of the Will suitable for? Almost anyone! No acting experience is needed to enjoy it and no one will be expected to do anything that will make them feel awkward. Although some of the characters behave badly, we don&rsquo;t believe the plot contains anything that would cause particular offense. But, because those under the age of 14 may have trouble understanding several matters referred to in the plot, we recommend it as suitable for those aged 14 and above.&#10;&#10;",

It seems that Aurora's lifeless body was found on the cold, dirt floor of her cell in the Salem Prison for Wicked Women.  The letter &quot;A&quot; had been hastily sewn to the bodice of her dress and a black candle was found in her left hand. Aurora's lips had been stitched closed, coins had been placed on her eyelids and a hazelnut was found in each ear.&#10;&#10;So what happened?&#10;&#10;Many of the townspeople had been witness to strange and uncanny happenings around and about the Nightstorm cottage.  Some say that Aurora could take down a huge oak, chop it into firewood and stack it at her back door....with just the twitch of her nose. Others testify to have seen Aurora levitate to the top of her roof to rescue her curious, black feline....her faithful companion, &quot;Wee Gee&quot;.....and children claim to have seen Aurora fly through the sky chasing vampire bats. Therefore, it should be of no surprise that Governor Giles Bickford was presented with a petition for her arrest. The document had been signed by every man, woman and child in Salem.  Hence, the Governor had no alternative but to bring charges of &quot;Witchcraft&quot; against Aurora Nightstorm.&#10;&#10;The trial was swift, the outcome, evident. Aurora was to swing from the gallows until dead.  But sometime during the pre-dawn hours someone paid Aurora a &quot;final visit&quot;. Alas, the townspeople will witness no vengeance against Aurora, their proclaimed, evil one. Who was it that dared enter her cell?  Who had reason to preempt the hangman?....and why??  To resolve this mystery one must be ready to venture back to the days of witch-hunts and sorcery. So, gather those black capes and broomsticks and come join the &quot;Sisters Three&quot; &ndash; Haggatha, Tabitha and Elain;  the Village Virgin, the Ghost of Lady Bickford, Evil Omen and the Reverend Smiley to name a few.&#10;&#10;",

The perpetual feud with his neighbors, the McCoys, and a relentless revenuer, Tommy Lee Tucker, were making his life miserable&hellip;..not to mention the fact that it was getting harder and harder to make ends meet.  When Prohibition set in, Leroy hightailed it to Chicago and brought along his wife, El-le  May, his one-armed cousin, Clyde Hatfield, his Ma and Pa, his trusty bloodhound, Billie Blue&hellip;&hellip;and most importantly,  grandpappy Hatfield's recipe for moonshine. Leroy heard that making illegal hooch, or bathtub gin, and selling it to the local speakeasies was a great way to make some big money&hellip;.and so &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; rented a cold-water flat on the southside and set up his trusty still.  It wasn't long before his potent NOTO &quot;Nectar of the Ozarks&quot; became very popular with the club owners&hellip;and their patrons.&#10;&#10;Tells us more ~&#10;&#10;A wild time was being had by all at &quot;Rosies&quot;, very popular speakeasy owned by Second-Hand Rose Romanowitz. The gin was flowing and a  Charleston contest was in full swing. It was a Saturday night and the joint was really jumpin! Outside, Leroy and Billie Blue were making the last delivery of the night when a dark automobile slowly pulled in front of the club. Suddenly, tommy guns began blasting, barrels of booze started bursting.......and when the dust settled, Leroy's bullet ridden body was lying in a puddle of blood&hellip;.and NOTO.  Who could have left Leroy belly-up?  Was this a mob hit?&hellip;the work of the vengeful revenuer?&hellip;&hellip;or do we smell a &quot;McCoy&quot;?

Everyone is given a character, and whether you end up playing a Lord, a Lady, a dustman or a horse meat wholesaler, you will encounter more skulduggery, adultery, coercion and crime than in the entire works of Jilly Cooper, Joanna Trollope and Dick Francis. &#10; Lady Amanda Cudham, founder and chairwoman of the club, has died in tragic and mysterious circumstances. Our plot unfolds during a meeting of the club, where members decide who should replace Amanda as chairwoman.&#10;&#10;Invitations are sent out in advance, so everyone knows which character they are playing and understands some of the background. The plot is usually run over a meal and, as well as solving the murder, characters are given other objectives to achieve. Some, for instance, want to become the next chairwoman. Some have guilty secrets to keep hidden. Some have scores to settle. And everyone is keen to get rich, buy and sell a few horses, and place a few bets before the Race of the Season (the Isle of Man Handicap) gets underway.&#10;&#10;No knowledge of horses is needed to run or enjoy this plot. How much guests become involved is up to each individual but, in our own experience, even the quiet ones become utterly caught up in the action.&#10;&#10;Towards the end, a live commentary of the Isle of Man Handicap is read out and winning bets are paid out. The guest playing Inspector Dawdley then gets everyone into teams and invites each of them to put forward their solution. Finally, Dawdley reads out the correct solution, arrests the murderer and brings a fun-filled, highly entertaining and irresistibly silly occasion to a close.&#10;&#10;Word of warning:&#10;&#10;The behavior of some of the characters in &quot;Cudham Riding Club&quot; is appalling: they take drugs, they gamble, they cheat on their partners, they kill. As a result, we consider the plot to be suitable only for people aged 15 and over.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Contrary to what our history books tell us, the colonists did not leave England to gain freedom&hellip;.not by a long shot. They left their homeland to gain spacious new territories, listen to jazz and enjoy fast food. However, they did not expect the numerous and unfortunate encounters with the Native Americans. Hence, the colonists needed the support of the British Army. NO WAY DID THEY EVER WANT INDEPENDENCE!  Why, they even held a tea party in Boston to honor King George and to present their &quot;DECLARATION OF DE-PENDENCE&quot;.  This document begged for more British intervention and rule. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were a little harder than expected.  Their Declaration revealed an emotional pleas for more taxes, more stern governors and the security of the Army.&#10;&#10;So what happened?  Well, unfortunately for the colonists, King George was fed up the &quot;American Leaches&quot; and wanted to sever all ties. Thaddeus Bell, Philadelphia's Town Crier, was to spread the news of the King's intention&hellip;&hellip;intention of war! &quot;Was&quot; is the key word here for Thaddeus never did get the opportunity to ring his bell. The poor fellow's body was found in bed by a rather shaken chambermaid.&#10;&#10;Come visit colonial Philly in the year 1776 and join General Eggs Benedict Arnold, Prudence Plum, Paul Reverse, the Princess Featherbed (to name just a few) and help reveal the facts that will lead to the culprit.

The socialite Evington-Browne family and guests are preparing for the annual Christmas Eve cocktail party, held by tradition at the family's hunting lodge in the White Mountains north of Boston. Snow has been falling for days - a blizzard has now set in - and the party finds itself cut off from the rest of the world. This is unfortunate, as the valet of one of the guests has been found dead in the kitchen! It looks like a heart attack - but is it murder? Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive The Night before Christmas? It's up to you.&#10;&#10;In The Night before Christmas you will discover the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Who has been wearing a Santa Suit to sneak around? &#10;    Who will inherit the Brilliant Diamonds? &#10;    Would the infamous cat-burglar 'the Puma' dare to strike here? &#10;    Are the Evington-Browne family in danger of losing their money, their reputation in society *and their sanity? &#10;    Can anyone keep control of Tracy's pet monkey? &#10;    ...and, of course, who killed the valet? &#10;&#10;&#10;Find out in The Night before Christmas!&#10; In The Night before Christmas, the stage is set for an innocent family gathering, with a few friends and strangers added to make the party go with a swing. However, not everyone is as they seem - some have dark secrets they need to keep hidden... and someone is the killer.&#10;&#10;The Night before Christmas lasts for three to four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&#10;&#10;The free introductory pdf file (78 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An &quot;intellectually stimulating variation of Othello&quot;.&#10;&#10;Abridged rules:&#10;&#10;1. The object of the game is to get to the other side of the game board.&#10;2. The game board is divided into squares, but you're not told how many squares wide or long it is.&#10;3. You can only step on a square if it has a tile on it. You can step on any tile, even if it was made by another player.&#10;4. If you step on an empty square, or the tile you're standing on breaks, then you &quot;fall in&quot; and have to swim back to the nearest tile.&#10;5. Each empty square that either borders a tile or the starting edge of the game board has a question visible on it. The questions are very simple and have single answers, such as &quot;why does water flow downhill?&quot; or &quot;why can light pass through glass?&quot; or &quot;what is heat?&quot;&#10;6. The only way to make new tiles is by making-up an answer to the question.&#10;7. A tile will only float if you can verify the answer with a reproducible test.&#10;8. A tile can only be broken by proving the answer is wrong with a reproducible test.&#10;9. A test can't break a tile if its results can't be reproduced, a tile can't float if the verifying test's results can't be reproduced.&#10;10. If a tile is broken, then all tiles ahead of it that cannot be connected back to the starting edge by another continuous series of tiles will be broken as well.&#10;11. A player is defined as someone who obeys the rules. If you stop obeying the rules you cease to be a player until you start obeying the rules again.&#10;&#10;Further explanation of the rules can be found at: &#10;http://www.disenchanted.com/technology/game.html&#10;&#10;",

It is for the players to find out what it is and what it does.&#10;&#10;The first phase of the board game is to control it before it destroys everything. If you can accomplish that, then there is a chance to see what secrets it has....if you live.

This game is supposed to be open, anything can happen, so if your ideas are well liked, they will be added to the game&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Publisher's web site:&#10;&#10;It is time for the All Saints College Class of '57 Reunion. For one night we will return to the good old days when Elvis was at the top of the charts. Sock hops, hula-hoops and poodles were radioactive. Getting pinned meant something altogether different than it does these days.&#10;&#10;The Class of '57 was written to be a little different than the rest of our games. First of all the 10 or 12 main suspects are all couples very much in love. Couples will be working together at times to achieve goals. They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor. This murder mystery game is what we would call a 'clean' game. There are no affairs &amp; people are basically good. This game is great for church groups and others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests. It can also be used for older teen groups!&#10;&#10;Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.&#10;&#10;The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups. (Remember... these are included FREE in the 12 player version, no need to purchase them!)&#10;&#10;",

A square can hold one letter tile. Some squares are black. These are like black squares in a crossword puzzle: you can't put a letter there. Other squares carry the number 10 or 20. Those are bonus squares.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of 10 randomly drawn letter tiles. On their turn they can lay down up to 7 of those on the board. The rules for playing the tiles are the same as in Scrabble. The score is one point per letter in each word created or altered, plus the value of any bonus squares covered.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The NHL Game or The Hockey Challenge (not to be confused with the Monopoly-like Hockey Challenge) is played on a square-grid representation of hockey rink's surface, and plays somewhat like a tactical simulation (somewhat like StreetSoccer). A spinner is used as a substitute for a 6-sided die to determine how many spaces the moving side may travel in a turn. The players on the puck-carrying team must skate in straight lines and must make at least one pass every turn, while the opposing team's players may change their direction of movement while moving.&#10;&#10;Some unusual elements are also introduced, however: anytime a team wishes to attempt a shot on goal, a puck-firing device is used by the shooting team, thus an element of dexterity is involved in this game. Also, optionally, players can play the game as a trivia game, wherein on each turn, the puck-carrying player must answer a hockey-themed trivia question from a provided question booklet, or he forfeits control of the puck.&#10;&#10;",

Wire harnesses, electronic components, and floppy disks had been strewn about the deserted parking lot. Detectives on the scene immediately noticed that Robo Gal's electro-cerebrum had been tampered with.... as well as her power pack units. Her legendary umbrella with its unique candy cane handle was found on the pavement along with a leaking can of acid. A set of stainless steel wrenches, a flying bat and batteries were also found on the scene as well as&hellip;a clove of garlic, a chocolate candy bar, and some French fries!&#10;&#10;Tell us more&hellip;&#10;&#10;The annual celebration of the world's most famous &quot;superheroes&quot; was just about to commence.

Each year they honor one of their peers with the &quot;Trophy of Power &quot;and this year Robo Gal was to be the recipient of this tribute. Robo Guy was preparing to make the announcement when it was discovered that our beloved Robo Gal was nowhere to be seen. While everyone searched the ballroom and the theater, X-ray Faye, with her incredible super duper infer-ray vision, turned on her powers and was able to look right through the old thick theater walls. There, to her dismay, she saw the remains of her beloved friend and compatriot.&#10;&#10;Who could have committed this horrible crime? Why would anyone want to do away with the wonderful Robo Gal? And what was with the garlic, chocolate and fries??????  Hmmmmmmm.&#10;&#10;So now it's time to grab those capes, turn on your powers and join this gang of superheroes for an evening of masquerade, mystery, and MURDER!&#10;&#10;",

The first players reaching their harbors (there are seven color coded harbors, in contrast to the maximum of six playing pieces) get bonuses. The richest player wins.&#10;&#10;The game had no money bills or tokens - instead every player had to write down his progress on separate sheets of paper (not included).&#10;&#10;",

At that time, the railroad industry was driven by an abundant source of coal from the coal mines of Western Pennsylvania. Unique features to this map include coal-producing towns and cities in Western Pennsylvania, heavily-urbanized cities in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and special bonuses for coal (black cube) deliveries: coal can be delivered twice as far as your locomotive, or you can receive double income for its delivery!&#10;&#10;Northern California: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in Northern California, focusing on San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Cruz and Sacramento, and the struggle to move goods across the San Francisco Bay Area. Unique features to this map include two bridges across the San Francisco Bay, the port city of Santa Cruz where goods line up for delivery, a three tile San Jose city with double goods growth, and the ever-changing destination of Sacramento, where the goods desired by that city are dictated by the flow of goods into Santa Cruz. This map is a redesign of the popular Age of Steam: Bay Area map (Essen 2005 Limited Edition), with modified cities and towns, with a map changed slightly in size to fit on a standard Age of Steam board. It is slightly more forgiving than the original map.&#10;&#10;From Ted Alspach, the designer of Age of Steam Expansion: Bay Area (Limited 2005 Essen Edition).&#10;&#10;",

The game details ten of these events, eight of which are playable out-of-the-box (with two others requiring &quot;Direct Hit Battle&quot; accessories, which are sold separately).&#10;&#10;The ten events are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Direct Hit Battle: Shoot at each other from across the arena, trying to disable your opponent.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     B-Daman Blast : Shoot knock-down targets.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Hard Target: Shoot marbles through a five-arch gate at the five pins standing on the other side.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     B-Daman Invasion: Knock a sliding puck across your opponent's goal line.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     B-Daman Assault: Similar to B-Daman Blast, except that now your opponent is also trying to hit the knock-down targets from the other side of the arena.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Shoot the Gap: Shoot your marble between pins without knocking any down.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     DHB Havoc: Shoot marbles through two-arch gates, attempting to disable your opponent.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Battle Hammer: Drive the sliding puck for distance.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     B-Dachallenge: Set up a free-form obstacle course and challenge the other player to make a trick shot.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ultimate Strike: Six-pin bowling.&#10;&#10;&#10;For tournament play, a spinner chooses which events will be contested. The player winning two out of three events is the tournament champion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Aseb, 'The Twenty Squares game' (frequently misidentified as Tjau, &lsquo;The Game of Thieves&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Game&#10;of Robbers&rsquo;) was played from 3000 B.C. until 400 A.D. and is one of the oldest known games. It is similar in play and design as Senet.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first player to bear off all 5 of his pieces, by landing them precisely on the last square.&#10;Once successfully borne off, a piece plays no further part in the game.&#10;&#10;PLAYER TURNS&#10;The players throw once each alternately, and move a single piece by the appropriate number of positions. A&#10;move must be made, and made in full. If no move is possible, then the turn is forfeit (passes to the other&#10;player). When forfeiting a throw, the opponent has the option of adding the forfeited throw to his own.&#10;&#10;HOW TO MOVE THE PIECES&#10;Each player enters the pieces onto the board from his reserve and moves them as follows:&#10;Pieces move forward only. As pieces reach the last square (by exact throw), they bear off; be the first to&#10;bear off all your pieces and you win! The marked squares give you an extra turn; when you land on them, you&#10;get to throw the sticks and go again. Only one piece may occupy any given square; if you land on an opposing&#10;piece, it is removed &mdash;sent back to the player&rsquo;s reserve.&#10;To bring your first piece on, you must first throw a 4 or a 6; when that happens, you throw again and move&#10;the piece in by that amount. The remaining pieces can be brought in on any throw. Waiting for that initial&#10;throw of 4 or 6, particularly while the opponent is already moving, can be quite frustrating, so it is an acceptable&#10;variant to forego that rule entirely.&#10;&#10;",

Through a very clever system the value of this number can be used to get a better pass or to move others players. &#10;Also, to score the player has to bring (literally) the ball inside the goal area.  Shooting from distance is not an option.&#10;&#10;...English version will soon be on the market&#10;&#10;",

The object of each sub-game was for White to connect left and right edges and Black to connect top and bottom, and the winner of the game was the player who won the majority of the sub-games. Each player player played one piece a turn.&#10;&#10;Later versions of the game were played on a 15x15 board, dropped the sub-game idea, and had players play two pieces per turn in a prescribed relationship to each other.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Anchor is a game of claiming territory by surrounding it with your stones. In that, it is similar to the classic game of Go. However, it is played on a hex grid and the life/death of a group is decided differently - in Go, a group is alive by having eyes; here, a group is alive by connecting to three edges (or in certain cases, two).&#10;&#10;More specifically, the six corners are marked alternately with black and white anchors. Corners with anchors of a player's own color are his home corners, and corners with anchors of his opponent's color are away corners. A group is an anchor if it touches three or more sides of the board. If a group touches just two sides, it is an anchor only if these two sides do not meet at an away corner. When both players pass consecutively, any group that is not an anchor is ruled dead and is removed from the board. Each player then figures his score, which is the sum of his territory (vacant surrounded points) plus dead stones of his opponent.&#10;&#10;",

If a player answers a question almost right, but not quite, they can ask for a vote on whether the answer will be accepted (a draw counts as a fail). They are also used in the &quot;Opinion of...&quot;-squares, for example &quot;In the opinion of men, female bodybuilders are sexy?&quot; If the majority of other players agree with how the player thinks men and women generally think, they win that card.&#10;&#10;As an elimination/game lengthening feature, there are also 'Black hole'-squares on the board; category gets chosen by opponents and if the player is wrong, they lose ALL categories so far collected, ie. start from the beginning again.&#10;&#10;Once all four categories are collected, player may proceed to the center of the board, where they need to answer one question from each category during the same turn, and get at least one right, in which case they win.&#10;&#10;Questions and answers are sometimes slightly naughty/risque especially in the &quot;Opinion of...&quot;-categories, hence the high age limit.&#10;&#10;",
