    "Description": "WYSIWYG (pronounced WIZ-ee-wig) is an acronym used in many computer applications that stands for &quot;What you see is what you get&quot;. Since in this two player card game, the players get to see what cards they are playing for before they play to a trick, it's an appropriate title. WYSIWYG borrows some elements from a couple of old games called German Whist and Honeymoon Bridge, while adding in some new ideas of its own.&#10;&#10;WYSIWYG is a trick taking card game for two players. After each player is dealt 13 cards, a hand proceeds in four separate phases. First, each player evaluates their hand and announces the total. Then, a bidding session takes place to establish the hand's trump suit and objective. Next, the players play to tricks, with the winner of each trick replacing their card with their choice of one of two exposed cards and the loser receiving the other card. Each trick is worth one mark. This continues until the deck is depleted. Finally, the players play out the remainder of their cards to tricks, each of which is worth two marks. If the player who set the trump suit has earned marks at least equal to a goal based upon the two hand evaluations and his bid, he wins the hand. Play continues until one of the players scores 50 points.&#10;&#10;(description by Larry Levy)&#10;&#10;",

While correctly presenting the theme of the game, Love simplified the rules considerably, removing much of the natural &quot;whirlpool&quot; action and reducing each player's pieces from two to one.&#10;&#10;Whirlpool is a 2-4 player game from British games maker Chad Valley and functions as an inverted race game: the last player to reach the center (the Vortex) wins. Like Goose games and most other simple spiral race games, there is no strategy, only luck. However, it is fast-paced and fun, especially for kids.&#10;&#10;Each player has two pieces of their color and must start them on the track on their first two turns. From then on, they must always move their rear-most piece. If a piece lands on another piece (of any color) they must move it forward an equivalent number of spaces to their roll, which can set off a huge chain reaction if one piece lands on another piece, which lands on another piece, etc. This simulates the &quot;pull&quot; of the whirlpool.&#10;&#10;Four &quot;Reserve&quot; spots set just before the Vortex function as last-minute reprieves, with different actions depending on whether the Reserve matches your color or not. On leaving the Reserves, pieces are flung into the Vortex - a dramatic ending! When all others have been sucked into the Vortex, the remaining piece is the survivor and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

If the eager child listens in open-mouthed wonder to the story of how Little Black Sambo met all those 4 tigers in the jungle, gave up and then won back from them his little red coat, the pair of beautiful blue trousers, the green umbrella and the purple shoes with crimson linings what do you think he will do when given a handsome game board on which he and his little friends play out the story. There is Little Black Sambo himself, he is pursued by the 4 great tigers with the clothes as forfeits,  when he is overtaken and of course returns home at the end. The game board is handsomely lithographed in colors. There is a separate carton which contains the substantial spinner and the men.&quot; Each game comes in a separate wrapper and is attractively labeled and sells for $1.00 per game.

    "Description": "From the description on the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Metagon is a game of skill in which chance plays a small part. It can be played by two, four or six players either singly, in pairs or teams of three. The components of the game are 36 different octagonal tiles or metagons and a playing board.&#10;&#10;The object of Metagon is to gain tiles from the playing ground. This can be achieved in either of two ways.&#10;&#10;1. The simplest way of winning tiles is to create a straight line with three adjacent tiles having the same coloured motifs in the same relative position on each tile. Lines may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. When a player has formed a straight line, he removes the two tiles placed earlier in the line and places these in a separate 'scoring stack', face up.&#10;&#10;2. The second way of gaining tiles is to form a parallelogram by aligning the same coloured motifs on four tiles in the same relative position on each tile. Parallelograms may be any size and aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When a player has placed a parallelogram he removes the three tiles placed earlier and adds these to his scoring stack.&#10;&#10;The game ends when players have placed all their playing stack tiles on the board.  The player with the most tiles in his scoring stack is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

During the game the players can enter in sports events (they pass them on their track and they include a ski event, horseback riding, tennis, sailing or golf). These events cost 50.000 francs to enter but can earn the player points. The players can also encounter bad luck during their journey (flat tire, accident, they can even end up in hospital).

Every turn, starting with the dealer, players ante into the pot and turn up the top cards of their stacks.  The player with the highest-ranked card wins the trick and gets to put a chip on their board in the corresponding space.  Losers all have to put chips into the pot.  The first player to get five consecutive values in a single suit (a vertical row) or four suits in a single value (a horizontal row) calls Whist-O and wins the pot.&#10;&#10;The game includes 12 boards and a bag of red plastic chips, but playing cards are not provided.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to turn your blocks until all 5 of them have the same number appearing along the row of sides facing you. The first person to accomplish this calls out &quot;Hi RO&quot; and receives a score determined by the size of the numbers that he/she lines up.&#10;&#10;The 5 blocks are set up to that all blanks appear at the top then the tray is passed around the table. The first player moves the center block 3 spaces. That in turn will reveal a number on the top block. That number determines the number of spaces that the next player must turn and so on. Each player must turn the center block with his first play.  After that he may move any of his blocks in an attempt to line up 5 faces numbered alike. The top side of each block last turned controls the move of the next player but you try to score the sides facing you.&#10;&#10;",

Players can then allocate funds from the war chest to get additional Mercenaries, Levy, or Weapons and Equipment to customize their armies further.  Players then proceed to deploy for two combats, the Van, which is an abbreviated engagement, and the Main, which is the heart of the game.  Victory goes to the side that sweeps the battlefield of all opposing units by the end of any Main Combat Round (not Van).&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rapid Fire! is a two-player shooting-gallery game in which the object is to knock down targets of the other player's color.&#10;&#10;The targets - alternating in red and yellow - rotate on a circular, battery-powered central wheel. Rotating in the opposite direction are blocking pegs, which protect the targets. For younger players, the blocking pegs may be removed.&#10;&#10;Players fire marble-like balls (also colored red and yellow to represent the owning player) up slightly inclined ramps from opposite sides of the target gallery, with play continuing until one player has eliminated all of the targets in the opposing player's color.&#10;&#10;The whole set-up measures over three feet long when assembled. Unlike many shooting gallery games, the trick here is in the timing of the shots - finding moments when an opponent's target will rotate into view and blocking pegs rotate away - rather than in the aim.&#10;&#10;",

Advanced rules provide you with concepts of the four quadrants and the signs for each function in each quadrant.&#10;Players will learn the ratios of the sides of a right triangle for the six major trigonometric functions. The triangular playing pieces are specially designed to show the direction of rotation for your playing piece around each triangular path.&#10;&#10;The simple rules for the novice is called the &quot;Beginners Game&quot; In this game you will learn the names of the six functions and what constitutes a triangle.&#10;In the &quot;Direction Game&quot; a player will find that there is a clockwise and counterclockwise direction of movement.&#10;The &quot;Function Game&quot; requires you to start your playing piece such that it moves onto the numerator for the trigonometric ratio of your playing piece and then onto the denomator for that playing piece.&#10;In the &quot;Many Triangles Game&quot; a player will make use of smaller right triangles to shorten the distance of travel.&#10;In the &quot;Quadrant Game&quot; the player will find that there are four quadrants on the playing board with a specific sign for each trigonometric function as represented by the playing pieces.&#10;In the &quot;Function Sign Game&quot; the player will need to observe the sign for each playing piece for the quadrant it is in.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Halfanutz is a card game about elephants.  Tom Wham's younger sisters couldn't say the word elephant when they were toddlers so they said &quot;halfanutz&quot; instead.&#10;&#10;The basic game consists of walkabout and scoring phases.  In the walkabout phase the player draws a card.  Then they can either push their luck and draw another card or they can take the cards they already have behind their screen and pass the turn to somebody else.  If they draw a card with the same picture as a card they already have, they lose the cards they've drawn and their turn.  After all the cards have been drawn, the scoring phase happens.  Players sort their cards by the resource pictured on it, then count the largest pile of cards and subtract the smallest pile of cards.  After two sessions the scores are totaled and a winner declared.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds resources and a trick taking phase (called &quot;the rumble&quot;).  During the walkabout for each card turned over, the player also gets a resource of the type on the card.  The player gets to keep the resource, even if the cards end up being discarded.  During the trick taking phase, the players randomly play a card from the cards they have collected.  The cards are numbered and the highest number wins.  The twist is that your card can be reinforced by resources of the same type as the card played.  The players take turns reinforcing their cards or passing.  The player with the highest card number + resources played wins the trick.  Players then score the number of cards they have taken during the rumble.  Again, two sessions are played and the scores are totaled.&#10;&#10;The tournament game is like the advanced game, except the card played during the rumble is not chosen randomly.&#10;&#10;Halfanutz is self-published by Tom Wham and is available from his web site, http://www.tomwham.com.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Salt Birds of Akarah has elements of both a pickup-and-deliver game and a combat game. Players control a number of birds, each trying to pick up salt crystals, and bring them back to their home base. Along the way, you can freeze and opponent's birds with arctic crystals, zap them with laser beams, and contend with them in an &quot;exciting fruit challenge.&quot; The latter uses a guessing game mechanic, where the object is to successfully discard disks that are marked with bad habits, such as &quot;greedy,&quot; &quot;obnoxious,&quot; &quot;reckless,&quot; and &quot;untrustworthy.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Salt Birds of Akarah has been awarded US Patent number 4927155.&#10;&#10;The inventive game may be played by from two to four players, each one of which has a home base game piece and a plurality of salt birds. At the beginning of the game, the home bases and a plurality of other game pieces are placed on the game board in a prescribed manner including a plurality of salt tablets. Each player has a plurality of bird game pieces for movement on the board. Each player has a plurality of discs describing various bad habits. The object of the game for each player is to obtain a predetermined number of salt tablets by moving their bird game pieces and landing on the spaces having salt tablets, then returning the obtained salt tablets to their home bases while getting rid of their bad habit discs.&#10;&#10;",

The game asks for at least 3 players, one acting as umpire, of a war scenario set previously by this same umpire. 3 sets of maps are used; one for every team with limited information and an overall one for the umpire with the position of both teams.&#10;The book includes the tables necessary to play as well as a scenario about an invasion of Bohemia. &#10;No verbal communication is allowed for the players, even if in the same team (except to those who are in the same spot); all must be done by means of couriers who bring the messages from one part of the battlefield to another (this is translated as a time delay among the communications of the players)  &#10;The different teams are given a map and a set of troops and some objectives to fulfill, while the umpire keeps good note of the development of both teams.&#10;Basically, the game procedure is as follows:&#10;a)    The umpire states the number of moves to be made&#10;b)    Each commander in succession states what movements he wants to make; the forces are then moved by the umpire&#10;c)    The umpire decides of the success or failure of an attack due to the given tables&#10;d)    Losses are reckoned and noted &#10;So soon the umpire has the movements, no corrections can be made for that same movement.&#10;&#10;",

The players take turn drawing from the bag, but be careful, if the wolf's head appears, you have to put an item of clothing on him! This fun game is suitable for players of 3 years and over because there are three versions of the game: all together, one against another or alone... But always against the Wolf.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a board representing a forest, onto which six different kinds of items are spread: mushrooms, strawberries, snails, blackberries, flowers and butterflies. In addition, each player receives one leaf-shaped individual board that is uniformly green on one side (for using in cooperative mode), and covered with the shapes of five of the six items on the other side (used in competitive and individual modes). The wolf is drawn on a magnetic board and its five items of clothing (shoes, trousers, jacket, hat and umbrella) are magnetic too. In the bag, eight cardboard discs represent each of the six items that can be picked from the forest, plus the head of the wolf and a clover leaf.&#10;&#10;The players draw in turn one disc from the bag. If the wolf's head is drawn, they put an item of clothing onto the wolf. If it is the clover leaf, they can take one item of clothing off the wolf or choose one item of their choice from the forest (competitive and individual mode) or two items from the forest (cooperative mode). Otherwise, they take the item represented on the disc from the forest. The disc is then put back in the bag and passed to the next player.&#10;&#10;In competitive mode, the winner is the first player who manages to pick up all the items represented on his board. In cooperative mode, the players win if they manage to empty the forest before the wolf is fully clothed. In individual mode, the player wins if he manages to pick up all the items represented on his board. The game is lost in any mode if the wolf gets all its clothes on.&#10;&#10;",
