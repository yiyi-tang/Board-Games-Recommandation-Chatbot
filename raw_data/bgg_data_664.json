    "Description": "In the midst of a heated forest conflict, an electrical storm damages the communication equipment of the telematons, telegraph-controlled war machines, of both belligerents. As the battlefield dissolves into a frenzy of nearly unguided machines controlled in only erratic bursts, the opposing sides must salvage the situation by using balloons and ground crews to locate and regain control of strayed telematons. However, the armed telematons are unpredictable in their damaged states and the battle is by no means over, so artillery has been brought to bear as well. Victory can be attained through the recouping of lost telematons or the destruction of the enemy headquarters.&#10;&#10;A strategy game where the majority of the action revolves around 33 randomly-moving unkown units in the center of the board. Players can interact with them by learning their identities (observation balloons), firing on them (artillery) or attempting to salvage and control them by forming lines of retrieval crews, telegraph wires, and telematons. Only telematons within these lines can be controlled, and control of these units is lost through the severing of the line through hostile attack or poor tactical movements. Thre are two ways to win; either recovering 10 telematons and returning them to your headquarters or destroying the enemy's headquarters before they can reach this goal.&#10;&#10;",

Nobody wants to search through three or four books in the middle of a heated battle, so we've conveniently combined them in this chapter, letting you concentrate less on flipping pages and more on shooting holes through your opponent.&#10;There are a few changes and expansions to the existing rules here, but that's not all. We've even collected all the new abilities and weapons from the GRW expansions to date. There are also the complete rules on duels and how to handle experienced and veteran troops.&#10;&#10;From Chapter Two: The Lay o' the Land Introduction:&#10;&#10;We just talked about how you fight your battles, and now we're going to talk about where you fight them. Here, we clarify a couple of areas from the GRW rulebook, but we also give you some new regions and strange locales for your battles. &#10;There's also a section detailing the Strange Locales rail warriors may encounter. We've beefed these up and given the heroes more reason to explore these outposts of the Weird West.&#10;&#10;From Chapter Three: More Magic, More Mayhem Introduction:&#10;&#10;In the Great Rail Wars rulebook, we gave you about a dozen spells to arm your spellslingers. Since then, we've come out with a stampede of Deadlands: the Weird West sourcebooks filled with new arcane incantations and miracles to make the average cowpoke's ride even rougher.&#10;This chapter contains the GRW conversions of many of those new spells. We've also tacked on complete spell lists for all the types of spellslingers in the game.&#10;&#10;From Chapter Four: Fleshin' Out the Dead Introduction:&#10;&#10;In the original Great Rail Wars rulebook, we gave you just the bare bones on using the Harrowed in your games. In this chapter, we show you how to make a Harrowed hero, plus we've got special Hindrances just for them, and a lot of powers only available only for these Boot Hill rejects. We've also included guidelines for converting your Harrowed character from the Deadlands: the Weird West roleplaying game.&#10;&#10;From Chapter Five: The Miracles o' Weird Science Introduction:&#10;&#10;There's a whole passel of strange devices that have found their way onto the battlefields. Guns that shock the opponent into next week, contraptions that let a man move underwater, and even steam-powered chainsaws! And there's the latest development in the area of science: alchemy and its potent chemical effects.&#10;&#10;",

While playing the game, hundreds of words will be formed by combining word beginnings (consonants and 'blends') with word endings ('word families'). As he plays, your child will master the use of word families and learn to read a countless number of new words independently.&quot; &#10;(From the rules introduction.)&#10;&#10;The game consists of a game board divided into eight columns and eleven rows. Every third 'cell' contains a word segment such as &quot;all&quot;, &quot;ap&quot;, &quot;ick&quot;, &quot;ay&quot;, &quot;ook&quot; and several others. There is a spinner evenly divided into two sets of the numbers 1-5 and a &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; section. A set of over ten dozen &quot;Ends 'N Blends&quot; cards or tiles each contains a single word segment such as &quot;sn&quot;, &quot;ight&quot;, &quot;ot&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;fl&quot;, &quot;ing&quot;, and many others. Forty-two &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; cards carry instructions such as &quot;Return one point marker&quot;, &quot;Take one end 'n blend. Spin again.&quot;, &quot;Take one end 'n blend card from each player. Spin again.&quot;, and so forth. A small box holds approximately 40 thin, transparent red discs used for points. Finally, a small booklet entitled &quot;Your Child's Reading: Suggestions For Parents&quot; is included.&#10;&#10;Players use the spinner to determine the number of &quot;Ends 'N Blends&quot; cards/tiles to draw. The player then places these cards on the board, matching them up to the word segments there to form as many whole words as possible. He then receives one point (red disc) for each whole word. First player to fifteen wins. If the spinner points to &quot;Hit or Miss&quot;, the player draws one of those cards and follows the instructions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's well known that monkeys and crocodiles are mortal enemies, each contesting the territory of the other and engaging in a battle of wills to see who will claim a larger swath of jungle.&#10;&#10;Manfred and Wolfgang Ludwig's Coco Schnipp trades on this antipathy, pitting the player monkeys against a nasty crocodile while also racing against one another. Each player places his monkey on the starting line of the game board and takes possession of three colored coconuts: red, blue and yellow. On a turn, a player spins the wheel:&#10;&#10;&bull; If a monkey head appears, that player tries to shoot one of his coconuts into the water hole in the center of the game board. If he succeeds, he moves the monkey ahead 2-4 spaces depending on the color of the coconut used.&#10;&#10;&bull; If a color appears, each player races to shoot the appropriately colored coconut into the water hole. Whoever does so, or comes closest to the hole, moves his monkey 2-4 spaces.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player moves his monkey, he may move the crocodile to any free space on the game board. Land on a crocodile and you're scared back five spaces on the race track. The first player to reach the end of the line wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to win the game through special resource victories, progressing the furthest, or through achievements.&#10;&#10;A single game should take 60 or more minutes to play and requires two to five players. In addition to the included component sheets, you will need 10d6 for the resource dice, and 300 cubes (320 for the espionage variant) to keep track of resources (50 cubes in 6 different colors for 300 cubes, and 20 black cubes for the espionage resource).&#10;&#10;Play starts with everyone at progress level 1 where you roll the first of the 10 dice. As you increase your progress levels, you get to roll more dice each turn, increasing your chances of gaining more resources to purchase achievements, resources, and higher progress levels. Each player can take 2 of a number of actions each turn, granting a variety of winning strategies.&#10;&#10;The first to meet one (or more) of the several goal conditions wins!&#10;&#10;Discussion thread: Die Civilization: Civ Building game for 2-5 players, 30+ minutes - Feedback wanted.&#10;&#10;",

What it does special to this board game is that the player is advancing in the middle of a fantastic world where the events and legends are happening parallel, independently of what the player does, but simultaneously they affect the destination of the heroe. The system of game immerses us therefore in an epic history, where nobles and necromantics hit in battles that re-draw the scene, and where conspiracies and disputes between races and clans modify the balances between the good and evil constant.&#10;In each of the events, the players leading the Heroes of Armarath they will try of affecting the destiny of the kingdom acquiring skills, followers and equipments that improve his inventory. The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy who waits in the catacombs of the Armarath, a hard quest that demands a powerful hero.&#10;The game is based on the Runebound play-system, but improves many aspects, like the amount of quest-cards (230), object cards (130) and game board (a detailed map of the kingdom of Armarath).&#10;&#10;Website: armarath.blogspot.com&#10;&#10;",

Build Phase&#10;&#10;Players take turns throwing the 3 ship building dice trying to make combinations of 2 and 3 colors. You are allowed up to 2 rolls for each throw and may re-roll 0, 1, 2, or 3 dice, as you choose, on your second roll. Each player will make 10 throws to build and stock their ships. Make your throw and pass the dice to the next player until everyone has had their 10 throws.&#10;&#10;Different color dice combinations will allow you to activate a section of your ship (you only activate a ship section once) and then stock it with resources for the battle phase. Each activated ship section is also worth one damage rating point towards your total ship so it is advised that during the build phase to try and activate as many sections of your ship as possible. The black die icon counts as a wildcard and can be applied to any ship section or resource.&#10;&#10;Rules include a players aid chart for resource combination.&#10;&#10;2. Battle Phase&#10;&#10;Once everyone has built their ships it is time to battle in a set of skirmishes between players. Each player should roll the 1d12 once at the start of the battle. Reroll any ties. Whoever rolls highest has initiative to begin the battle skirmishes and goes first.&#10;&#10;This person is the Attacker. They must pick one person to attack who will be the Defender. Both then roll their 3d6 battle dice simultaneously, hiding one and revealing the other two.&#10;&#10;Players may use as many resources (from the resource dice on your ship sections) as they like to get the highest possible total for the two dice showing (be strategic however, there are many battles to come and you may not want to use all of your resources at one time). If you use a resource, rotate the resource die face down one number (i.e. 3 to 2) on that ship section. If you use the last resource, remove the die from the ship section.&#10;&#10;Then the hidden dice of both players are revealed. Whoever has the highest total is the winner of that skirmish. The loser should move their damage rating marker down one skull icon to the left on their ship. The loser then becomes the next Attacker. In the event of a tie, neither player loses any damage rating points and the Defender becomes the next Attacker.&#10;&#10;If your damage rating marker ever is moved to the Tail Section, your ship has been disabled and you are out of the battle.&#10;&#10;Play until one person is victorious.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ScatterLand is a game of strategy and deduction for 2-4 players.  It takes roughly 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;The basic idea is that players are exploring an archipelago in search of islands. The game board consists of a 9&times;9 array of 81 squares, further divided into nine 3&times;3 boxes. There are 18 islands total, but these islands aren&rsquo;t distributed randomly; instead, they are arranged so that two islands occupy each 3&times;3 box, each row, and each column.  What's more, these islands are initially hidden from view.&#10;&#10;Players claim one square per turn.  A player either places an island of her color in the region (if there's an island there) or a boat of her color in the region (if there isn't).  Players are trying first to discover and then to connect together as many islands as they can:  the more islands they connect together, the more points they receive at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players use logic to determine where the islands are likely to be, but logic alone is not enough:  players must also think tactically and strategically in order both to foster their own growth and limit the growth of their opponents.&#10;&#10;ScatterLand takes no more than five minutes to learn (or to teach), but its gameplay is surprisingly deep.  There are a lot of things to try to balance when deciding where to play:  do you want to claim a new island as your own or try to connect two of your islands together?  Do you want to try to consolidate your own position or be the first to explore a given area? Do you want to focus on expanding your chains or trying to cut off your opponents?&#10;&#10;Two versions of the game are included:  the basic version (described above) and the advanced version (which limits the number of exclusive islands any one player can claim).&#10;&#10;ScatterLand can be found at http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/ -- just click the links toward the bottom of the page for both the rules and 20 additional boards.&#10;&#10;",

(Each player controls 6 of the 12 signs.)&#10;&#10;The object of Zodiakos is to move one of your 6 pieces into your opponent's Gate, which is located at the opposite end of the board, in between your opponent's Spawn Areas.&#10;&#10;Players begin at either end of a board comprised of 23 circles. &#10;At the start of the game there are not any pieces on the board. Any pieces that a player wishes to use must be &quot;spawned&quot; in one of the Spawn Circles on that player's side of the board. &#10;Players may move the pieces that they already have on the board either by moving them into adjacent circles or by jumping over friendly pieces.&#10;Players also may use their animals to capture their opponent's animals by jumping over them.&#10;&#10;Zodiakos is a simple and fast paced abstract strategy game that is easy to learn and usually plays in under 20 minutes. It comes in a little cloth bag that also serves as the game board&#10;and it can be carried in any pocket that is big enough to hold a pack of gum.&#10;&#10;Zodiakos is a complete game that can be expanded by combining it with its sister games Junishi, 12 Moons, and Neteru.&#10;(source : the publisher)&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    12 Moons&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Junishi&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Neteru&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Activity Code Word is played in teams, with each team needing to guess a secret code word decided on by the team sitting on their right. For each successfully described word, they are allowed to ask a letter in their code word. The team who first guesses their code word wins.&#10;&#10;The words that have to be described are printed on 110 cards, with six words per card, two for each of these three categories: verbal description, drawing and pantomime. One group member explains, draws or pantomimes (which of these is decided by a die); the other members of the group have to guess the word. If they manage to guess correctly before the time is up, they are allowed to ask if the first letter of the word they successfully described and guessed features in their secret code word. If the answer is yes, they write down the letter. If the answer is no, the team crosses out that letter. Then it is the next team's turn. At the start of each of their turns, if one team thinks they know their code word, they may name their solution. If it is correct, they win; if not, the game continues as usual.&#10;&#10;",

You have only 30 seconds for each challenge, and if time runs out before you meet that round's winning condition, then you score nothing. If, on the other hand, you succeed, then you score both the points for that specific challenge (5-50 points) and the sum of the pips on the dice that you collected. After six rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Included with five regular dice is one blue die, which is wild for some challenges and laden with restrictions in others. In the &quot;dice sum to 20 or less&quot; challenge, for example, the blue die must be a 6 and all the dice must be rolled together. Fail to get that 6 or break the 20 threshold, and you'll have to roll, roll, roll again...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A baseball dexterity game that uses all the rules of baseball and devices that hit and pitch a small metal ball. Advertised as &quot;The Fastest, Most Realistic Baseball Game in the World,&quot; it uses a plastic ballpark with a &quot;pitcher,&quot; &quot;batter,&quot; and &quot;catcher.&quot; The batting player uses the &quot;batter&quot; (a small metal bat attached to a spring that swings like a bat when a button is pushed) to hit a small metal ball from the &quot;pitcher&quot; (a set of three levers controlled by the pitching player that pitches the ball toward the plate and controls it) before it lands in the &quot;catcher&quot; (a pit behind home plate.)&#10;&#10;If the ball is put into play, it may land in a cup, stay in the ballpark, go foul, or be hit outside. Various cups are labeled as to the result, which may be an out or an extra-base hit. If the ball is still inbounds but not in a cup, it is a single. If it leaves the ballpark, then it is a homerun.&#10;&#10;The controls of the pitcher allow the ball to be shot forth at varying speeds, moved with a magnet beneath the playing field, and dropped through a trapdoor so the batter is unable to hit it. The game rules describe six different &quot;pitches&quot; that can be thrown: a fastball, change-up, curveball, screwball, slider, and sinker. The game revolves around this element of the pitcher/hitter struggle. While it is very difficult to hit any pitch but a fastball or change-up, if the batter does not swing at anything else it is a ball, as in baseball. Various deceptions by the pitcher can be employed, such as opening the trapdoor while the ball is approaching the bat then closing it at the last moment so it will be a strike.&#10;&#10;",

The game was created around the mid 16th century (presumably by priests) and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the rediscovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant (if not board game) ever. It has not been shown that Taikyoku Shogi was ever widely played. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves.&quot; - Wikipedia&#10;&#10;Two players, Black and White, play on a board ruled into a grid of 36 ranks (rows) by 36 files (columns) with a total of 1,296 squares. The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. Each player has a set of 402 wedge-shaped pieces of 209 different types. All pieces are the same color. The orientation of the piece tells which side it is on. The pieces are wedge-shaped with the name of the piece written in kanji on it's face in black. If the piece can promote, then the name of the piece's promoted form is written on the back face, usually in red. Pieces are turned over when promoted.&#10;&#10;An opposing piece is captured by displacement: That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece. Unlike standard Shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured.&#10;&#10;Like other large board Shogi variants, this game uses the promotion-by-capture rule. When a piece first makes a capture, it promotes if it can (this is compulsory, not optional). few important pieces do not promote. Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves.&#10;&#10;The players alternate making a move, with Black moving first. A move consists of moving a single piece on the board and potentially displacing (capturing) an opposing piece, promoting that piece if it is able to promote.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s King and Crown Princes, of which players start with one of each. Both pieces must be captured to win. Also present is a piece called the Drunken Elephant, which if promoted becomes another Crown Prince which would also need to be captured to win.&#10;&#10;A player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games.)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Designer Terry Coleman has served up VPG's first ever sports strategy game, TC Tennis. Choose from 24 of the greatest tennis champions in history and pit them against each other in a fun, fast-paced game that isn&rsquo;t packed full of tables and charts. Instead, the entire game is designed to get you thinking about strategy right from the first strike of the ball. Each player in the game is rated for various Strokes such as 1st Serve, Backhand, Forehand Volley and Touch, from a low of F (a terrible shot for a pro player), to AA (one of the legendary Strokes in tennis history). Play Strategy cards to increase your scoring chances, defend against your opponent&rsquo;s Strokes, or try a variety of Tactics (Crowd the Net, Pick up the Pace, etc.) to shake things up.&#10;&#10;The fun comes not only from the wide variety of Strategy cards in play at any particular time, but also from the effects different cards have on each other. Do you risk hitting a Cannonball Serve, knowing that your opponent might have secretly played a card that negates it? Can you keep using Go for the Lines as a Tactic, knowing that you might miss, and hurt your scoring chances? And depending on which players are involved, the strategic decisions each set only multiply. As you master the Basic game and move on to the Intermediate and Advanced games, we add the possibility of a Set ending earlier, more Random Events, Tiebreakers, and even Fatigue and Injuries, for those who want more realism, without much increase in complexity.&#10;&#10;Stage your own tournaments, find out which courts best fit your style, and serve up some of the greatest Strokes the world has ever seen!

Eventually leave the city to the Black Mountains, and find a place called &laquo;&nbsp;The Throne&nbsp;&raquo;. That is the lair where the Persians are hiding. And now the hardest is to come: defeat the enemy!&#10;&#10;10,000 in my Pocket is played with Event cards on an easy-to-make modular board, ensuring you that all the games are different.

One of the running gags of the Gaston Lagaffe comic books involves a businessman, Demesmaeker visiting the office building in which Gaston work to sign contracts with Gaston's boss, Prunelle. Each time the contracts are about to be signed Gaston screws up or tests one of his inventions and the contracts are ruined.&#10;&#10;In the game, the player roll dice and move around the board, attempting to collect three Contracts cards representing Lagaffe, Demesmaeker and Prunelle. Once the three cards are gathered, the player must exchange them for a &quot;Signed Contracts&quot; cards and take it to the photocopier to win. Cards are drawn or taken from other players according to the board space the player lands on. If a player can't give a card to another player, he receives a &quot;blunder&quot; token. If he has three, he exchanges his blunder tokens for the &quot;mega-blunder&quot; card, which prevents him from getting a &quot;Signed Contracts&quot; card or using the photocopier. The only way of getting rid of a &quot;mega-blunder&quot; card is to wait until another player gets it.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;For centuries, the powers of the Inner Sphere have looked down on their brethren in the Periphery  with thinly-veiled disgust. To the &quot;civilized&quot; worlds of humanity, the Periphery is a backwater, not a place where any respectable person would want to live. And many still remember that the nations of the Periphery fought tooth-and-nail against the Star League's attempt to unite all of humanity in a new golden age. Full of hardship, immorality, lawlessness and danger, it is a vast and little-understood region of space.&#10;&#10;But that's not the whole story. The Periphery is all of the things that people say about it, but it is also much more. The Taurian Concordat has a better educational system than most Successor States. The citizens of the Magistracy of Canopus enjoy more freedoms than their counterparts in the Inner Sphere. Even the bandit kingdoms are getting into the act, with realms such as the Circinus Federation and the Marian Hegemony making moves towards legitimacy.&#10;&#10;ComStar continues its series of sourcebooks detailing human space with a look at the Periphery in all its facets, good and ill. Learn the history of the various nations beyond the Inner Sphere, including the Rim Worlds Republic, home to the treacherous Amaris clan. See how life differs out in the wilds, where every danger is balanced by the freedom to live unfettered by the petty oppressions of the Successor States.&#10;&#10;",

Then, it occurred to me that Mike Selinker already did a race game around Stonehenge, so I felt it appropriate to connect this game to his chariot racing game. Due to the odd play nature of the betting, it is a natural that it would be alien in nature. The name is Mike Selinker's name spelled backwards, in honor of his Chariot racing game. Spelling it backwards also gives it an alien sounding name.&#10;&#10;Number of players: 2&ndash;5&#10;&#10;Object of the game: To score the LEAST amount of points.

These figures represent chariot drivers.&#10;&#10;The player who has the least amount of points shows themselves the best predictor of the worst racer, and wins the game. If players are tied, the player who has the most disks amongst all the tied players wins. If still a tie, then the player with the least amount of first place disks wins. If still a tie, the player with the least amount of second place disks wins. If still a tie, then least in third, fourth or fifth.

Players simultaneously play one card and place face down.&#10;4. Players then flip their cards face up.&#10;5. Non-black card playing players go first, highest to lowest, players put their figure next to the pile of disks matching their color. In event of tie, the player closest to start player places first, then the second place player goes.&#10;6.

It is recommended players sort their disks by color to make tracking easier. Which disks were taken prior is public knowledge. In addition, any disks they set aside to be put back, go back into the pile(s) the color(s) of the disks they are to put back. Also, if there are not enough piece to take or set aside, players take or set aside whatever they can. This means that players may take and/or set aside no disks.&#10;10.

Each player takes back their figure.&#10;&#10;Game ends when all players are unable to replenish their hands to five cards. At that point, game is over, and players total up their points. The player with the most points wins. In event of a tie, all the players who are tied look at their remaining cards in their hands. The player with the highest card wins.

    "Description": "Number of players: 2&ndash;5&#10;&#10;Object of the game: Be first player to score 6 points, get 10 pieces in a row, or the last remaining player. Whenever a player scores, they move their figure from one side of the bluestone track to the other side.&#10;Getting Started&#10;&#10;Equipment: &#10;The Stonehenge board.&#10;10 disks of each color for each player.&#10;1 figure per player, matching the set of colored disks that a player has.&#10;Grey neutral figure (tracks where player removes piece from).&#10;&#10;The outer track consists of 30 spaces, each with four parts, for each number (30 in all) from inside most to outside (making for a total of 120 spaces). In this game, the two day-night spaces, next to the number, on the inside are considered one space. The the next most outside space is the number space. After this comes the colored space. Outside most is a light or dark space. Each of these spaces is considered able to hold one piece in this game. As players place their pieces on the board, in a space, the first piece is put on the day-night space, the second on the number space, the third on the color space, and the last piece is placed on the light or dark space outer section.&#10;&#10;Overview of gameplay:&#10;Players alternate turns putting their pieces on the board into one of four spaces on the outer track. A piece either immediately comes from their reserve, or it is taken from the board and put into their reserve and then played, if the player as no pieces in their reserve at the start of their turn. After a player places a piece on the board, pieces may end up sliding towards the inside part of the outer track, and then the board is checked for scoring conditions. If there are scoring conditions, pieces will be removed from the board and put into reserve(s) and scoring occurs. After this more pieces may end up sliding towards the inside part of the outer track and the scoring process is repeated.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player scores 6 points (player's figure hits the last space on the bluestone track), gets 10 pieces in a row, or is the last remaining player. In event of a tie, all players not tied for win at the end of the game eliminated. Then the remaining players play until one player score more points than anyone else in the game. This player wins the game. Players eliminated from the game are treated as they normally would be in the game, with their pieces remaining on the board, but can't win the game.&#10;&#10;",
