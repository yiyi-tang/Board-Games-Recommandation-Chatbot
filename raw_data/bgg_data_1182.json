The game has three wooden boards with 4x4 grids, and 48 chips marked on one side.&#10;&#10;Donden was created through collaboration, born out of a project to see if something could be done using thinned wood from Sagamihara City. The game is packaged in a wrapped sleeve, made of Japanese paper. The chips are stored in the back side of the boards.&#10;&#10;The three boards are arranged in a line. The players place two chips each from their supply in the centre, one player using the marked side.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, a player either places a chip on the board, looking to attack as in Reversi, by flipping opponent's chips. Or a player may discard a chip and move one of the three boards around (a disturbance), thus causing an attack.&#10;&#10;By taking an end board, for example, the player can place it at right angles, making an L-shape. This puts one of their pieces outside their opponent's, causing an attack.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player runs out of chips. The other player gets a final turn. Then the players get a point for each chip they have on the board, plus a point for each chip left in hand (not discards). The player with the most points wins.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pippinzip is a square board connection game for 2-3 players. Various sizes of boards are possible, from short games on a 5x5 grid played with pencil and paper, to longer games on a Go board (9x9, 13x13, or 19x19). &#10;&#10;&#10;THE BASIC IDEA:&#10;&#10;The game begins with an auction phase -- a sort of mini-game of chicken (reminiscent of Unlur), in which an initially empty board is gradually seeded with a growing number of initial stones.  The auction phase determines who will play the role of &quot;Pip&quot; (using black stones) and who will play the role of &quot;Zip&quot; (using white stones).&#10;&#10;After the auction phase ends and the roles are thereby determined, the players take turns playing stones of their color to the board.  Play continues until a winning condition is reached. (Draws are impossible.)  Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides of the board via a chain of orthogonally-adjacent black stones.  Zip wins connecting all FOUR sides of the board via a chain of 8-way-adjacent white stones. (&quot;8-way-adjacent&quot; = either orthogonally or diagonally adjacent.)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;IN MORE DETAIL:&#10;&#10;There are two varieties of play, &quot;Zipline&quot; and &quot;Pipline&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pipline:&#10;&#10;This is the standard version of the game. The game begins with an empty board and an &quot;auction phase.&quot; In this phase, on his/her turn a player places 1-3 BLACK stones onto empty points on the board. (Each player has a free choice of whether to place 1 black stone, or 2 black stones, or 3 black stones on his/her turn.) Players alternate turns, playing black stones exclusively in this phase of the game, until one player on his/her turn says &quot;Take&quot; instead of placing any stones.  This taker is henceforth known as &quot;Pip&quot; and will play a SINGLE black stone on each future turn.  The opponent (i.e. the non-taker) is &quot;Zip,&quot; who will play a SINGLE white stone on each future turn.&#10;&#10;Immediately after &quot;take&quot; is announced, the non-taker (i.e. Zip) has his/her turn and places a single white stone, followed by a single black stone from Pip, then a single white stone from Zip, etc.  Turns alternate in this fashion until one player achieves his/her win condition (or until one player resigns). Zip wins by connecting all FOUR sides of the board with a chain of white stones that are orthogonally and/or diagonally adjacent; Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides with a chain of black stones that are orthogonally adjacent.&#10;&#10;Pencil-and-Paper Play: Pipline is the recommended version of the game for pencil-and-paper play (draw four vertical lines and four horizontal lines to make a 5x5 grid, as depicted here: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5173760/cdunc123)&#10;&#10;&#10;Zipline:&#10;&#10;This is an alternative version of the game. To start the game, on each turn a player places 1-3 WHITE stones in the auction phase. (Each player has a free choice of whether to place 1 white stone, or 2 white stones, or 3 white stones on his/her turn.) Players alternate turns, playing white stones exclusively in this phase of the game, until one player on his/her turn says &quot;take&quot; instead of placing any stones.  This taker is henceforth known as &quot;Zip&quot; and on future turns Zip will play a SINGLE white stone per turn.  The opponent (i.e. the non-taker) is known as &quot;Pip.&quot; On future turns, Pip will play TWO black stones per turn, with the following restriction:  Pip's second black stone of a given turn is NOT allowed to be placed orthogonally adjacent to the first black stone of the turn. (Placing two diagonally adjacent black stones in the same turn IS allowed. Also, note that in the extremely rare case where ALL remaining empty cells are orthogonally adjacent to first black stone, the second black stone is forfeited.)&#10;&#10;Immediately after &quot;take&quot; is announced, the non-taker (i.e. Pip) has his/her turn and plays two black stones, followed by a single white stone played by Zip, then two black stones from Pip, then a single white stone from Zip, etc.  Turns alternate in this fashion until one player achieves his/her win condition (or until one player resigns).  Zip wins by connecting all FOUR sides of the board with a chain of white stones that are orthogonally and/or diagonally adjacent; Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides with a chain of black stones that are orthogonally adjacent.&#10;&#10;&quot;Freestyle&quot; Variant: For variety you can play Zipline with free placement for Pip's two black stones, that is, with no ban on orthogonally adjacent placements in the same turn.&#10;&#10;Three-Person Pippinzip: The Zipline version of Pippinzip can also be played as a 3 player game.  In 3 player Zipline, the taker plays as Zip and the two non-takers play as a single Pip team.  Each non-taker plays a single black stone on his/her turn, for a total of two black stones for Pip for every one white stone for Zip.  Roles are determined in the auction phase using the same process described for 3 player Unlur in this thread: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1706872/unlur-three-people.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;MISCELLANEOUS NOTES&#10;&#10;&#10;     Before the game, players should agree whether to place stones on the intersections of the game board grid (as in Go) or alternatively, place stones within the cells of the game board grid.  Either mode of play is fine; it is a matter of personal choice.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The board starts out empty.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Placement must always be to an EMPTY intersection or cell (depending on which mode was agreed before the start of the game).  There is no capture or displacement of enemy stones in Pippinzip.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Once placed, stones never move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     If during the auction phase, a player creates the win condition for the color being used in the auction phase, then that player wins the game.  (However, this won't happen if both players play competently!)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Wait for it...when the red light turns green and the sound stops, all players try to press their trigger button as quickly as possible. If you're the last person to hit your trigger button, you get an electrical shock. As an added bonus, if you hit your button too soon (before the center light turns green and the music stops) you give yourself an electric shock.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: To have the quickest draw and the best timing of your opponents to avoid the shock.&#10;&#10;Lightning Reaction: ReLoaded differs from the basic Lightning Reaction game in that this version allows player to adjust a variable shock control on the machine--to determine whether the loser will receive a shock of low, medium, or high intensity (although still only provided by three AAA batteries).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Font HUNT is a Japanese game made in collaboaration with a Japanese font foundry, Fontworks Co. Ltd. In the same way that European language fonts come in different designs (Times New Roman, Gill Sans) and different styles and weights (Gothic, Bold), many fonts are also designed for the Japanese alphabet Hiragana. Fontworks produced a popular commercial font called &#231;&#173;&#145;&#231;&#180;&#171; (Chikushi), which is then produced in various styles and weights.&#10;&#10;The game uses a set of tiles which only show a single character &#227;&#129;&#130; (A). The tiles are all varied though, because of the variations in the different Chikushi fonts used.&#10;&#10;The game Font HUNT comes in three different foil packs. A pack holds 12 tiles with 6 different fonts.&#10;&#10;Each pack can be used for the basic game, and each pack has its own game variant. The basic FONTHUNT (&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;) game requires players to identify specific tiles by describing certain aspects of the font. &quot;Huh? It sticks out here?&quot; &quot;A little thick here?&quot; &quot;A little bent?&quot; &quot;A little round!&quot;. Players can co-operate to try to discover which tile is being described, or have tiles in hand and try to have the other players work out which they hold. The game is intended to be more of an exasperating fun exploration of the nature of fonts, than a competitive challenge.&#10;&#10;&#231;&#173;&#145;&#231;&#180;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175; &#233;&#157;&#146; (Chikushi Gothic Blue) has a blue badge, and the game Font IMPRINT (&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;).&#10;&#231;&#173;&#145;&#231;&#180;&#171;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#230;&#156;&#157; &#233;&#187;&#132; (Chikushi Mincho Yellow) has a yellow badge, and the game Font TONE (&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;).&#10;&#231;&#173;&#145;&#231;&#180;&#171;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#228;&#189;&#147;MIX &#231;&#183;&#145; (Chikushi typeface MIX) has a green badge, and the game Font MIMIC (&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;).&#10;&#10;In Font IMPRINT, players conveys the impression of a font by using similies: &quot;This A looks like Asaoka!&quot; &quot;This A looks like Amoeba!&quot; &#10;In Font TONE, players have to imply the font by use of the tone of their voice.&#10;In Font MIMIC, players have to use hand and body gestures instead of words.&#10;&#10;The packs are normally sold separately (quite cheaply), but the publisher has sold them at the Tokyo Game market in a bundle with a bonus set of new tiles.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dumpster fire is a fast paced, hand based, card game for 3 to 8 players. In it, players assume the roles of scandal plagued politicians each struggling to deal with their own problems while sabotaging their opponents' efforts to do the same.&#10;&#10;The game consists of approx 100 cards, split into 8 general types which are differentiated by color. Some cards can be played alone, others only in combination as part of a larger play. There are also cards which must be played, and a class of cards (scandals) which cannot be played at all. Mechanically, the game uses a traditional turn order structure, but emphasizes cross-play, off-turn, and table-wide cards to keep all players involved throughout a hand.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of 8 cards (9 in a 3 player game) to start. The cards are then separated into playable cards which are held, and scandals which are placed face up in front of the player. At the start of their turn the player draws a card from the deck, and can make a single play. The effects of cards vary but typically involve giving cards to another player or forcing them to draw. In many cases the target of the play can attempt to defend or retaliate with cards of their own, and there are even cards that allow intervention by otherwise uninvolved players. The emphasis on cards being drawn and given rather than discarded leads to escalating plays as the hand continues, and due to the number of cards changing hands, the players' prospects and opportunities change rapidly.&#10;&#10;Victory is awarded to the first player to get rid of all their cards, and is determined on a per-hand basis, or across a series of hands using card scoring.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each of the five buildings has three possible scoring rules, randomized before the game for 3^5 = 243 different setups.&#10;&#10;The game ends in a maximum of 18 rounds when all spaces are filled; sooner if any one player produces enough of one resource over the course of the game to reach the endgame section of the resource track. Players total points for all the buildings they've built and the builder with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Official description: As one of Egypt&rsquo;s most respected builders, you have been selected by the Pharaoh to expand the land. Each builder is given their own plateau to develop. Producing resources will be critical to your success, but do not be too tempted by your ambition, lest you should unleash a plague upon your growing city. Manage your resources and plan your city wisely to become the best builder in all of Egypt and earn a coveted place beside the Pharaoh!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each turn players take up to three actions. Possible actions include drawing a card from the deck, playing a path card or moving your pawn. The first player to build a path to the treasure and reach it with their pawn wins.&#10;&#10;Watch out! Ancient totems sprawled across the island give players special abilities with exciting twists.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in 1909, after a large earthquake had collapsed the largest cave system on Cocos Island into a valley. It had been rumoured that the island's caves had been used by pirates for centuries to hoard their riches. Players take the role of famous treasure hunters that have raced to the island to explore it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each tile has a number of paths, and each branch has a number from 1 to 9.&#10;&#10;The players put a starting tile on the edge and a central tile in the middle of the next. Each player draws a tile and tries to place it such that paths join.&#10;&#10;Players are trying to place tiles so that the connecting numbers add up to 10.

Players represent one of three political factions each composed of a group of famous characters.  They must find solutions to the problems of state raised by this turbulent period whilst wrestling one another for political control.&#10;&#10;Each political faction, and in the advanced game each character, has their own agenda to promulgate whilst simultaneously denying their opponents power.  Like all forms of politics power is exercised by a series of votes. Players may use debate, bribery, bullying and scurrilous accusation to win these votes.  To win this game you must be prepared to engage in all of these activities at some point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns asking questions, and lose a point for every question they ask. Points can be gained by asking specific key questions which also help players to figure out the true version of the story.

The Japanese title translates more closely as 'Galactic Powers' and the designer uses 'Galapa' for short.&#10;&#10;Players develop planets by constructing facilities, improving technology, and developing spacecraft. Victory points can be earned through construction of the orbit elevator, the status of spacecraft development, and the population settled.&#10;&#10;The game of space exploration wars uses worker placement with an rondel action track. When the game starts, players focus on infrastructure development, such as building facilities on the home planet and developing and strengthening spacecraft while advancing technology. Then, players build a subspace transfer device and move to an unexplored planet to pursue exploration. However, this involves the dangers of space pirates.&#10;&#10;Discovering planets and building orbital elevators can also give you victory points, but the most points come from the population of settlers on exoplanets. The most settlers on the planet will be awarded the total number of facilities built on the planet as victory points.&#10;&#10;But runners-up will be given the final total population of that planet as victory points. This means players must balance the development of facilities with the growth of the settlements. Produce too many settlers against facilities and the other players gain. Judging this expansion is important and the designer says it gives the game high replayability.&#10;&#10;The game was released at Game Market in Spring 2019. The designer found some errata in the rulebook, and gave out a free card to fix an error on one card.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Set in Portugal in the late 15th century, King Afonso V enters into a trade agreement with Lisbon's great merchant Ferdinand Gomez. Instead of granting subsidies to explore, the agreement entitles Gomez to exclusive trade in the specialty products obtained from the voyages. Players become one of the admirals employed by Ferdinand Gomez, pioneering the wilderness, discovering unknown creatures and natural wonders, building harbors and trading posts, trading, and preaching Christianity. Players want to increase their fame and become the world's best admiral.&#10;&#10;Proving that the world is round, a new world map similar to &mdash; but not identical to &mdash; the real world will be created. Initially the game board shows a large map of the world known to Europeans in the 15th century, with all of Europe being depicted along with parts of Asia and Africa. The rest of the board is blank, and players place land tiles as they travel across the seas. In this way, they literally complete a new atlas (rather than trying to mimic the actual globe), and the game will play out differently each session.&#10;&#10;As players draw tiles and discover new lands, they also close off potential sea routes. Balancing the need to discover and the need to trade is one of the game's challenges. Building a church and propagating Christianity to a greater extent also increases a player's fame.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Collect Kritters with splotches in three primary colours Cyan, Magenta and Yellow, and get hold of mixing bowls and paintbrushes to fill them with life. Use magic wands to change colours as needed to buy more Kritters, and add to your collection with bonus Kritters in secondary colours Red, Blue and Green.&#10;&#10;Colour MY Kritters is a classic deck builder card game designed for younger players. You start with a few cards, and every round you have the chance to buy another card from the table. Cards have colour splotches (in three different primary colours, plus a wild card &quot;colour&quot;), and you use these to buy new cards. In the end you score the number of cards in each colour, but only for the colors you can supplement with a mixing bowl and/or a paintbrush. In addition comes bonus points on cards with Kritters in secondary colours.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Tabletopia: Play Colour MY Kritters for free on Tabletopia - you can try the game yourself and see how you like it :-) Find it there or on the official website (link below).&#10;&#10;Print-and-play: A free PnP file can be downloaded from the official website (link below).&#10;&#10;Kickstarter: A campaign for the printed edition of Colour MY Kritters was successfully funded on Kickstarter in December 2020 (link below). Late pledges will soon open so you can get your own copy even if you missed the Kickstarter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Beyond the Monolith is a gaming system based on Batman: Gotham City Chronicles Versus Mode.&#10;&#10;It's a two player scenarised skirmish miniature game in which each player control its characters using a command board.&#10;On the command board, each character cost more energy to activate as you move left to right down the line. Once a character is activated, they move to the end of the line, boosting their cost to the maximum value should you want to use them again immediately, and decreasing the cost of the other tiles.&#10;&#10;Beyond the Monolith aims to separate the game core engine and the universes in which the game will be played. For that purpose, the &quot;Core Box&quot; is  not a full game playable by itself but a core game set that include only a basic ruleset and all common components (dices, tokens, ...).&#10;&#10;You will need to combine it with an &quot;universe&quot; that will supply the theme, the specific rules, the campaigns, the miniatures and tiles, the maps.&#10;Monolith will provide two way to get universes :&#10;&#10;     Universe Products : contains everything needed for an universe (ex : Conan, Batman : Gotham City Chronicles, Lord of the ring) &#10;     Second Life Products : provide extra components to play &quot;Beyond the Monolith&quot; with an existing miniature game universe [you will need to have or proxy this game miniatures to play] (ex : Zombicide, Cthulhu wars)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Over the years, the town was destroyed time and again: by outlaws, demons, cultist fanatics, and more. Most recently, it was ravaged by the Fourth Ring Circus and the Sloane Gang.&#10;&#10;In the aftermath, the deputies Xiong &ldquo;Wendy&rdquo; Cheng and Lucinda &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo; Clover left for greener pastures. Unfortunately, the pastures they chose were Tombstone, Arizona. They arrived just in time to see the conflict between the Cowboys and Earps reach its fever pitch.&#10;&#10;On top of that, the mysterious Bayou Vermilion Railroad had also set up shop in town, and Tombstone&rsquo;s been suffering its own supernatural problems.&#10;&#10;And back in Gomorra, a familiar figure rides northward: Jonah Essex, a mysterious huckster associated with the worst events in Gomorra&rsquo;s recent years. He rides toward Deadwood, Dakota, and if the town knew what was good for them, they would fear his coming.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It features an enlarged 2.2&quot; hex scale, making ASL more playable than ever. There is sufficient room in each hex to place over a dozen counters without stacking, making the game both easier and faster to play. Informational counters can often be laid alongside units to avoid obscuring them, and the need for some informational counters (like Covered Arc markers) is eliminated based on unit placement within a hex. Some players even use miniatures on these boards to increase their enjoyment.&#10;&#10;Deluxe ASL includes all the boards and all the scenarios from the long out-of-print STREETS OF FIRE and HEDGEROW HELL. The eight original boards (a-h) have been repainted by Charlie Kibler and finished in the &quot;tri-fold&quot; style of Deluxe maps i-l from Winter Offensive Bonus Pack #9 (with which they are completely compatible). The original 18 Deluxe ASL scenarios are included, all updated and rebalanced as needed. Charlie has also repainted the original Deluxe ASL overlays (from the 1995 ANNUAL), four additional sheets of wooden and stone rubble overlays, and two sheets of new terrain overlays to provide maximum flexibility for future scenario designers. Twenty additional, out-of-print Deluxe ASL scenarios are also included, updated, and rebalanced as needed.&#10;&#10;These features make this package attractive to all ASL players, whether they have been Deluxe fans for 30 years or never before got the chance to play on the bigger hexes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;",

In games using this system, each player controls a champion and a number of associated reinforcement in battle. Players can battle one-on-one or in teams, and the side with the last champion standing wins.&#10;&#10;Battles can take place in a variety of environments, each of which offers different challenges and opportunities.&#10;&#10;The initial game release will include two boxes, Blood and Magic, and Into the Wild, with each game box containing six champions and their associated reinforcements, as well as two maps with customizable obstacles. The contents of each box can be seamlessly combined with other boxes to offer players  greater variety, and plans include multiple expansions to be produced later.&#10;&#10;Instead of dice, the Champions Combat System&trade; uses a unique and intuitive card-based system to resolve combat. The use of cards rewards strategic thinking and careful resource management, while providing  each champion with a unique playstyle that captures their abilities and personality. The Champions Combat System&trade; provides strategic depth without sacrificing intuitiveness, and a new player can learn to play in only a few minutes. Of course, mastering each of the varied champions will take much longer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Skill cards are played face down next to your athlete, only you know what skills you have. All other cards are played face up, the Course cards are played along the corresponding course. Action cards are used to cause some mischief, with Action cards you can steal skills, cards, remove pieces of the race course and stop other players actions. Phase one ends when a player uses their turn to play the 'Start The Race' card at the end of the running course.&#10;&#10;In phase two, players use their accumulated skills to race on the course they made in phase one. The Course cards are used as a board game with coloured player tokens that match each athlete. Add up all skills your athlete has gathered and these are now your movement points. Each player takes turns moving their token the number of swim points they have, then cycling, then running, stopping at each race transition until their next turn. The winner is the first player to make it past the finish line to the Gold 1st place position at the end of the running course.

    "Description": "Welcome to the The Pie Game card game! Grandma needs your help, she signed up for the local bake sale to make one of her award-winning pies, but her bursitis is acting up and this is preventing her from making her pie. Can you help Grandma make the pie and save the day or will you disgrace Grandma by not getting your pie made?&#10;&#10;For 2 to 8 players ages 6 and up. Game setup is simple as each player is dealt 1 of 8 unique recipe cards, such as: Apple Pie, Chocolate Cream Pie, Key Lime and others. Each recipe card lists the 5 ingredients that you need for your pie recipe. Next, each player is dealt 5 ingredient cards. The ingredients are all fresh and delicious with favorites like: Whipped Cream, Lime Juice, Chocolate Cookie Crust, Brown Sugar and Milk.&#10;&#10;Game Play is just as easy, each player attempts to collect all recipe ingredients for their Pie as game play progresses through card draw and discard. Players draw new ingredient cards from the pile and discard unwanted ingredient cards from their hand to maintain 5 ingredient cards at all times. But watch out, because three could be trouble at every turn with Fudge and Double Fudge cards with the likes of: &ldquo;Your neighbor wants to borrow some eggs&rdquo; or &ldquo;The cat knocked the sugar bowl off the counter&rdquo;, these can cause you to discard, trade or pass your pie ingredient cards or even, lose a turn!&#10;&#10;The first player to collect all 5 ingredients needed for their Pie recipe wins that round. Once someone completes their Pie, all recipe and ingredient cards are collected and redealt and the first person to win 3 rounds (or as many, or few rounds as everyone wants to play) wins the game&hellip; all other players have to disappoint Grandma and tell her they did not get their pie done (or maybe they just lose). So, don&rsquo;t let Grandma down!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players go around each city to buy goods and fulfill their orders. Getting the goods sold by other players will help a player become the best peddler. Become one of the world's richest and prestigious merchants by successfully managing your products in multiple cities.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, nine city tiles are arranged in one of the suggested ways, with each tile being divided into colored zones to match the player colors. Six order cards are dealt from a deck, which show various demands from these nine cities.&#10;&#10;Players get two actions on a turn from a move action, a cargo action, or a shipping action. Players can move to cities; can pick up cargo from a city and place the goods in their wagon (but not goods they dropped previously); or ship goods to their storehouse in the city with the demand. By fulfilling demands, players collect order cards, gaining victory points. By taking the most prominent order cards, players receive jewel bonuses. By building up sets of order cards, players can increase the capacity of their wagons and build trading houses in cities; trading houses give the player a third action each round, which gives the player an advantage and is one of the endgame conditions.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when the decks are exhausted, the special cards (difficult orders) are lost, or when a player has four trading houses.&#10;&#10;All players get the same number of turns, then a final score is taken, most points wins. Points come from order cards, jewels, and from getting the last wagon card (marked fin).&#10;&#10;",
