    "Description": "Attack of the Intergalactic Gherkins is a whacky space-vegetable-themed card game.&#10;&#10;Having been sucked through a black hole whilst escaping the terrifying Intergalactic Gherkins, the stranded astronauts must rebuild their ships and return home to their own galaxy.&#10;&#10;Players draw cards to move around the four planets of the solar system, collecting missing ship parts and rebuilding their spaceships before escaping.&#10;&#10;Opponents can play a variety of action card combinations in order to win, which can either help them or hinder opponents. These might include such cards as Meteor Showers (stops a player moving), Cosmic Ray (take a card from another player's hand) or stealing turns by combining cards to create word-matched 'Conjunctions' such as Pole + Star. Players must also deal with Gherkin Attacks which slow their progress. This could be by using cards such as Antimatter to make them disappear or a Rocket Pickle Jar to send them to another player to deal with.&#10;&#10;Card drafting and hand management are crucial in this light-strategy game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The air is thick, charged with coal particles. The land is dark, muddy. Coal Mines spread everywhere. Yet people are starving. The Belgian industrial revolution is in motion and Belgian Railways Companies are about to emerge.&#10;&#10;Players act as investors in the emerging Belgian Railway Companies. Their largest shareholder is the Director, and they alone make decisions for the company. Players will spend their starting funds to either launch, promote, upgrade, operate, or develop their companies in an effort to accumulate the greatest wealth in cash at game end. To achieve their goal, players may also invest in companies shares, speculating on future returns and market values.&#10; 18BE introduces a 3D map board with overlays and unique features to ensure each session delivers their very own challenges. Companies may purchase different types of trains, invest in different trade opportunities (the so-called &quot;Links&quot;) and/or Upgrades. Thus each company will most probably be played in a totally different way from one session to the next. Experienced gamers should be able to play the game in less than 6 hours. The rules also include a solo mode, and a challenging 2-player mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In order to play with them you need the basic rulebook.&#10;&#10;Coal &amp; Guns! is a three-dimensional tactical naval wargame for the era of the so-called &quot;Pre-Dreadnought&quot;.&#10;&#10;Above all, it wants to be a very simple and fast way to arrange on the table some models of those picturesque ships that marked the transition period between sailing ships and warships as we know them today.&#10;&#10;It was a short period of only a few tens of years, between the end of the 19th century and the very first years of the 20th century (conventionally from 1880 to 1905), but which, from a technical point of view, was literally upset by new inventions or applications that followed one another at a frenzied pace.&#10;&#10;The intensive use of steam energy, the construction of increasingly efficient breech-loading guns, the production of enhanced explosives, the invention of the electric motor and the radio, the use of torpedoes, the continuous development of steel armor and aiming devices are just incredible examples of applied technology that changed the way of waging war at sea in those few years.&#10;&#10;The shipbuilding industry, of course, had to keep up and in less than half a century they passed from sailing ships to battleships, through a series of intermediate stages that made the obsolescence of the projects very rapid.&#10;&#10;All this caused the flourishing of projects among the most imaginative and disparate that have ever been seen, with ships that were a synthesis, with different shades, between the pomp and romanticism of sailing ships and the solid reality of steel, the dirt of coal and the cold effectiveness of modern technologies.&#10;&#10;Those vessels, especially in the bright pre-war colors, with white or black hulls, wooden decks, light or ocher superstructures, bright yellow chimneys, red or green keels, gold finishes, were a triumph of Art Nouveau style applied to instruments of death, often destined to be torn apart by the cannon fire of opponents who are perhaps less attentive to aesthetics but with the most advanced technology.&#10;&#10;From a wargame point of view, playing with these ships is very interesting, because they are often very different from each other and because, despite being equipped with powerful guns, they did not fight at unimaginable distances on the gaming table.&#10;&#10;The individual ships of the different nations, even within the same fleet and the same category, have great differences between them in terms of armament and armor, so the game can become quite varied and exciting.&#10;&#10;Here, on a 180 x 120 cm table you can use models in 1: 2400 or 1: 1500 scale, in order to allow a good representation of the ships involved.&#10;&#10;Coal &amp; Guns! is very simple and intuitive and the heart of the system lies in the &ldquo;status&rdquo; cards of the ships.&#10;&#10;Drawing free inspiration from the very nice Brigade Models steampunk rules Imperial Skies, we tried to create a very linear and pleasant game system, but with rational mechanisms that, even in a few rules, aim to give you the flavor of that way of fighting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One player takes on the role of Katsuhisa, a businessman who grew a large company, and his daughter, Kumiko, whom he left the management decisions to when he grew older.  However, Kumiko thought her father's ideas were not for the modern times and changed many company policies, which made Katsuhisa furious.  Through their roles and Chairman and President, the two set the stage for a proxy fight at the next shareholders' meeting.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over several rounds as each player tries to woo the shareholder for the round, such as the institutional investors or the employee stock ownership plan, over to their side.&#10;&#10;Each shareholder to be courted presents a number of shares (victory points) and some conditions for the current round, such as determining the trump suit.  In addition to the cards for playing the tricks, each player has a hand of &quot;Proposal Cards&quot; which represent the policy proposal they are using to win the shareholder's votes, and these have game effects, such as reversing the ranks of cards or making certain suits worth negative points.&#10;&#10;After a volley of proposals, the two players complete a series of tricks and evaluate who earned more points in the current round.  The winner collects the shareholder and their votes, represented by their number of shares.  The player with the most votes at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

The speed will determine how far down the race track you travel, and the limit is a restriction of how many of that type of Ogre is allowed at one time.&#10;&#10;Will you risk playing a faster Ogre with a small limit, or will you play it safe and creep along the racetrack slowly.&#10;&#10;There is also a pile of Training Cards available for a 'take that' element to give players the edge.&#10;&#10;By far the best part of this game is the simultaneous decision and turns.

    "Description": "Perfect for beginners and pros alike, Zombie Chase is a great choice for the next family game night! Set at Lake Nomby amusement park, everyone was having a wonderful time until the sun began to set and an ominous crash is heard at the center of the park. From within the dark and creepy park maintenance shed, a moaning sound emerges. The owner of that sound quickly becomes clear as the Zombie Janitor appears and begins his search for brains! In a panic, the park guests and security flee the park and lock the gate behind them to keep the zombie trapped inside. The problem is the janitor isn&rsquo;t the only one left behind! YOU&rsquo;RE trapped too!&#10;&#10;Players roll two Dice. Move your Character the number of spaces shown on the white die, then move the Janitor Zombie the number of spaces shown on the green die. Your goal is to find a flashlight by landing on and flipping the item tiles. Once you have found a Flashlight, go to the maintenance shed, grab a Key, and proceed to any exit to escape the park!&#10;&#10;Watch out for Zombies though. If you end up on the same space as a Zombie, flip your pawn over, and now you become a Zombie and your strategy changes. Now your goal is to chase the other Human Characters and turn them into Zombies!&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s two ways to win Zombie Chase! Find a flashlight, grab a key from the maintenance shed, and be the first to escape through one of the gates or you can win by being the one to infect the final human player as a Zombie. With two ways to win, everyone has a shot at coming out the winner and every playthrough is a new adventure. One thing is for sure: to win at Lake Nomby amusement park, alive or undead, you&rsquo;ll be needing plenty of brains!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high-rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population &mdash; and the player with the largest population at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost &mdash; and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!&#10;&#10;The add-on expands the game with new tiles of the boundaries of the playing field, which bring bonuses to the owner. The expansion includes over a dozen new building tiles, as well as new income-boosting bonuses and reputation-raising tasks when completing intermediate in-game objectives.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 1-4 players over the age of 8. The duration is about 1.5 hours.&#10;&#10;",

Players place tiles representing a different industry (service, trade, hospitality, leisure, residential) into matching districts and score points based on which where it was played and how many other tiles had been played there.  There are also three, black-bordered wild plots that can be from any industry.  The game comes with 60 tiles and show actual companies and organizations from Ratingen ... or at least were in Ratingen in 1998.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, the tiles are shuffled and placed face down in a general supply.  Each player draws 6 tiles and places them face up in front of them.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the following may happen:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Exchange: The active player may give two tiles to another player and take one of their tiles.  This cannot be refused.&#10;     Place Tiles: The player may place as many tiles as they want onto empty plots in one district.  Tiles much match the plots by color.  The player then scores points according to what is printed on the board for that district and the number of tiles placed there.&#10;     Draw Tiles: The player draws 0-3 tiles from the supply.  This number must be announced before the first tile is drawn.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each action is optional, but they must be performed in the above order.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all plots have been filled, or if one player has placed 5 sets of tiles on the board (i.e. placed tiles on 5 separate occasions during the game).  If that happens, all other players get one more turn each.  Each remaining unplayed tile is -5 points for the player holding them, and then whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#231;&#139;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#140;&#182;&#233;&#135;&#156; (Tanuki to Chagam) is a card game from Japan. Each player predicts how many times he will win from the dealt hand and declares all at once. After that, each player takes out one card from his hand, compares the strength of that card, and the player who puts out the strongest card receives all the cards in the field. Basically, you have to play a card of the same color as the first player to play, and if you don't have that color in your hand, you can play any card you like.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a tea pot card among the cards, and if you meet the following three conditions, you can change the card you issued to 0, which is the same color as the tea pot card.&#10;&#10;1) The tea pot card is already in play. &#10;2) The number of the raccoon dog card you put out is larger than the number of the tea pot card. &#10;3)The tea pot card is not already used for another raccoon card.&#10;&#10;Make good use of the timing when the Chagama card is issued and adjust the number of times you win. When everyone runs out of hands, they move on to score calculation, and the score is determined by the difference between the number of wins they declared and the actual result.&#10;&#10;The player who plays the game for the number of players and has the highest total score is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;-translated from Jellyjelly Cafe website&#10;&#10;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#152;&#148;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#140;&#182;&#233;&#135;&#156;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;4&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;1-9&#227;&#129;&#174;36&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#167;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;2&#227;&#128;&#129;5&#227;&#128;&#129;8&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#140;&#182;&#233;&#135;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#139;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#140;&#182;&#233;&#135;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;1&#229;&#140;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#139;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#139;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Boardgame following basic rules and theme of the Card Game Kleine Fische.&#10;&#10;25 randomly drawn cards, which are either fish cards or cave cards, are laid out face down on a game board. The aim of the game is for the players to score the most points by collecting fish and treasure.&#10;The players diving through the sea, starting from the boat adjacent to the playing field, which can be moved as first step. The diver (players figure)can always move to neighbouring fields, but must keep to the swimming direction. As soon as the diver reaches a fish card, he uncovers it and decides whether to stop or continue swimming.&#10;If he continues to swim, the next fish card must be turned over. You have to stop your turn as soon as a fish type is revealed twice. You then lose both of this type.&#10;There are also caves to be explored. You need to uncovered as many fish as the number on the cave card indicates, before exploring it. If this is successful, the diver receives the advantage of the cave card.&#10;As soon as you end (freely or forced to), the 2nd phase is carried out. In this phase, the octopus is moved depending on the number of octopus symbols on the revealed fish cards. As soon as the octopus lands on a field with a diver, it tries to steal a fish from the diver. This is done like in the origiginal card game by a setting a number of cards and rolling a dice from the active player. In case of success (equal or higher the number) the octopus robes this number of cards for the active player. With a -1 he loses 1 card, which he has to give to the robbed player.&#10;&#10;The active player now gets all cards which are open.&#10;The places are refilled from a stack. The game ends when this is not possible for all empty fields.&#10;From the fish cards only the highest card from each fish type counts. The points from the treasure cards and from the fish cards are added. &#10;The player with the highest points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
