    "Description": "Ortho is a game where players form words from letters on cards. The Ortho deck has 52 cards, each with a letter at either end; the two letters may be the same or different, and if different the player chooses which letter is used. There are also two &quot;Chief&quot; cards that are wild and can stand for any letter.&#10;&#10;Players start with seven cards each. In a turn a player draws the top of the deck or discard pile, and if possible either plays a word onto the table, or adds cards to a word on the table to make another word. In either case a word of 2 letters scores 1 point, and doubling for each additional letter (e.g. 3 letters 2 points, 4 letters 4 points, 5 letters 8 points, etc.). 32 points is the maximum allowed for any word.&#10;&#10;The hand ends when a player uses all their cards in play, calling &quot;Ortho!&quot; and also earning from each player one point per card left in their hand.  (Presumably a hand also ends when the deck is gone.) A player wins by either Ortho'ing with a total of 104+ points, or ending a hand with 128+ points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A tin board with a felt green tabletop mini-golf game. Endorsed by Arnold Palmer himself, the game was released in the mid 1960s and came with a number of plastic obstacles to create 9 holes of play. The obstacle pieces were brightly colored plastic and varied in various editions of the game, but were primarily yellow, blue, and red components. The tin board had a number of small holes numbered for the various plastic components to recreate each of the 9 holes, as the 1st hole was intended to be a straight shot to the hole. The board also has small indentations for a fairway tee and a near green tee. The game utilized plunger putters to play. The putters could be used with the putterhead on either side to be used in a pushing or striking manner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

These goblins have adapted their diets to be able to consume the armor, weaponry, and trinkets that are unknowingly tossed to them, and as such, gain powerful abilities from them!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will move their goblins across the board, attempting to reach treasure tokens that tumble down the four corners of the game board each turn following a specific colored path. The colored path that token will follow is determined by a tumble path card that is played the second a new treasure appears on the game board. Players will attempt to pick up those treasure tokens to obtain treasure cards that imbue them with special powers while they are held in their goblin's stomach. These treasures can be turned in for points to be added up at the end of the game, but hanging onto certain treasures can be helpful as you lose their abilities once they've been removed from your stomach.&#10;&#10;More treasure cards are pulled from the deck and treasure tokens will continue to move across the board until all the tumble path cards have been discarded or made inactive. Once this happens, players will add up the value of all the treasure cards they've stashed, as well as any remaining Vomit Tokens (the goblin's currency), and whoever has the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After having a future sight and still aiming for justice to reign around the world, Bruce Wayne made official the creation of a new international organization founded by Wayne Enterprises: Batman Incorporated. This super-heroes network, chosen by the Dark Knight himself, wages a battle against crime all over the world, shares information and provides help to one another. The vigilante therefore became famous worldwide. This notoriety brought to his cause other vigilantes, like El Gaucho, the Nightrunner, the Knight, Chief Man-of-Bats accompanied by Raven Red, the Dark Ranger, Batman of Japan, Batman of Moscow and many others&hellip; &#10;Through this organization, Batman managed to set up a plan against the mysterious institution called Leviathan.&#10;&#10;During a character&rsquo;s creation, our teams think of them as the comics describe them. Once the profile has been set up, our teams check if it fits what we want the character to do and if their role is the one we defined for them. There are several modifications along the playtests to adjust the different characteristics, skills&hellip; Once a hero (in the case of the Batman Inc. Expansion) is validated, they are tried in missions as replacement of heroes of equivalent roles. Numerous playtests of the many possible team composition for the heroes then occur, before making the hero fit without breaking the mission up.&#10;&#10;Each miniature from this expansion can be played as another choice of hero in missions of the corebox. Therefore, the heroes will have much more choice than they already had. For example, Dark Ranger will be another possible choice of hero in the mission &laquo; An Icy Welcome &raquo;, and he can also be picked as 2nd hero in &laquo; To Sink a City &raquo;&hellip; The Knight will make a good replacement for the 1st hero in &laquo; Biological Scourge &raquo;. Chief Man-of-Bats as well as Raven Red in &laquo; A Golden Opportunity &raquo;, and so on&hellip;&#10;&#10;Each of those heroes owns one or several equipment cards related to them. 5 new bat gadgets are also included to be added and bring more choice to the already consequent amount of bat gadgets, offering new possibilities to players.&#10;&#10;Batman of Japan&#10; Batman (the one from Gotham City) maintains a network of correspondents around the world who use crime fighting techniques similar to his own. In Japan, Mister Unknown&mdash;a vigilante of who trained a promising young man named Osamu&mdash;took up the mantle. But tragically, Mr. Unknown was killed before Osamu&rsquo;s training was finished. After Batman and Osamu fought together, Bruce Wayne came to support Osamu as Batman of Japan. Osamu may still be young, but he is an excellent detective and a martial arts expert. Though sometimes duty calls him elsewhere, as member of Batman Inc. his primary responsibility is protecting Japan. &#10;Gameplay&#10; That martial art expert is a great fighter capable of competing with Batman himself. He excels in hacking and is able to move wherever he wants, as heights do not frighten him at all. &#10; In Adventure Mode, he can show up with his teammate, Lolita Canary. This flying small version of Black Canary has got a good breath and is able to neutralize her opponents through ultrasounds. &#10;Versus Power&#10;Lolita Canary: Batman of Japan uses his girlfriend&rsquo;s blast to neutralize his enemies.&#10;&#10;Batman of Moscow&#10; Batman Incorporated was Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s attempt to extend the Club of Heroes into major cities around the world. It was his belief that Batman could become a symbol of justice that defied borders. Crime fighters from all over the globe were equipped with their own variations of the iconic Batsuit. As one might expect, these new Batmen were as varied as the nations in which they fought. Ravil, the Batman of Moscow, was no exception. To wage a war on crime in the streets of the Russian capital was no easy task; it called for a brutal fighter&mdash;one whose methods differed from his American counterpart&rsquo;s. Subtlety wasn&rsquo;t going to work. &#10;Gameplay &#10;He's a demolition expert, and therefore knows everything about explosives. Would it be to throw grenades of arm and disarm explosive engines, he is second to none. &#10; In Adventure Mode, he accomplishes his missions with an incendiary grenade, which spreads fire while exploding. This makes him sure no one will stand against him. &#10;Versus power &#10;Demolition expert: Batman of Moscow can clear an area close to him by triggering an explosion (level 2) there that leaves one flame token. Or he can destroy a wall thanks to his explosive devices.&#10;&#10;Chief Man-of-bats&#10; Dr. William Great-Eagle, aka Man-of-Bats, understands that being a hero is about more than just beating the bad guys. William is a Chief of the Dakota Sioux and a pillar of his community. He is ceaselessly dedicated to providing social and medical assistance to those in need and a long-time member of the Club of Heroes. During the Infinite Crisis, he helped heal Bl&uuml;dhaven&rsquo;s wounded. With his son and sidekick &ldquo;Raven Red&rdquo;, he joins the Club of Heroes. Wanting to take his philanthropic actions a step further, he also became a member of Batman Inc. &#10;Gameplay&#10; He is a true support character. Helping others or sacrificing himself for them not to be wounded, he can recover, slowly, because of his knowledge in traditional and native American medicine. &#10; Chief Man-of-Bats owns two equipment cards. A tomahawk that can be used during melee fights, or than he can throw (but he then loses it). He also has a medicine man&rsquo;s bag, with which he can go beyond his limits for a time. &#10;Versus power&#10;Duo: Chief Man-of-Bats always works with his sidekick Raven Red, recruited as his lieutenant. They heal themselves (up to 2 lifepoints each) when the event tile is activated, and Raven Red performs his small attacks against opponents in his line of sight.&#10;&#10;Dark Ranger&#10; As a member of Batman Inc., Dark Ranger battles crime in the &lsquo;Land Down Under&rsquo;. Originally, Australia had its own heroic duo similar to Batman and Robin known as Ranger and Scout. But when Ranger was killed, Scout (John Riley) took over lead duties and became Dark Ranger. After the death of his mentor, John Riley became violent, but Batman made sure to check the younger man&rsquo;s direct and sometimes extreme methods. Dark Ranger is not only a formidable fighter but also an excellent tracker&mdash;a useful skill to have when investigating crimes. &#10;Gameplay&#10; Always willing to save the widow and the orphan, never would he hesitate to sacrifice himself for others. Good investigator, he is always gifted with explosives. All he lacks he can find in his utility belt that he never gets rid of. &#10; The Dark Ranger is heavily equipped. He can carry a jet pack; therefore, he may move free like air. He also owns an electric gun that can stun his opponents. &#10;Versus power&#10;Stun: Thanks to his weapon that generates electrical pulses, he can put a &ldquo;stun&rdquo; token on a villain&rsquo;s tile. This tile will have a higher cost the next time it is played.&#10;&#10;El Gaucho&#10;Santiago Vargas is a man of mystery. He once worked for the covert operations agency known as Spyral, but eventually followed Batman&rsquo;s example and joined the Club of Heroes, an international group of vigilantes. &#10; Though Santiago is without superpowers, he arms himself with knives, bolas and a grim determination. He occasionally teams up with others, but his operations are usually confined to Argentina and other parts of South America. &#10;Gameplay &#10;El Gaucho tends to be Batman&rsquo;s equal. He&rsquo;s a great fighter, would it be in melee or distance fight, he performs combos when fighting, and can counterattack. His past experiences granted him investigation and munition specialist skills. He is a true hero now. &#10; El Gaucho is a bolas master. He can throw them at a long distance and shackle any opponent. &#10;Versus power&#10;Gaucho bolas: El Gaucho uses his favorite weapon and can inflict severe damages. If the target isn&rsquo;t neutralized, they become immobilized.&#10;&#10;Nightrunner&#10;In the wake of a deadly riot in the Paris suburbs, a vigilante rose up to defend the weak and vulnerable. To accomplish this mission, Bilal Alsselah employed his mastery of parkour&mdash;a means of traversing urban environments with spontaneous and dynamic acrobatics. The Dark Knight took notice of his exceptional skills and recruited him for Batman Incorporated. Bilal has since expanded his area of operations and has become Nightrunner, the dedicated protector of Paris, France. &#10;Gameplay&#10; The french Batman is the master of parkour. No heights can frighten him, no jump, nothing. He is unstoppable, too agile for anyone to catch him, and also difficult to target from a distance. &#10; The Nightrunner has a taser that grants him a higher power in hand-to-hand fights. &#10;Versus power &#10;Parkour master: The event tile doesn&rsquo;t cost any Activation Potential Disk to activate and the Nightrunner performs a movement.&#10;&#10;Raven Red&#10; Charles Great Eagle, aka Raven Red, son of Chief Great Eagle, leader of the Dakota Sioux. Charles is a member of both the Club of Heroes and Batman Inc. Being a young man, he is more impulsive than his father and longs to enter the big league by taking on the serious super-villains rather than assisting his community. He and his father were the targets of the evil organization known as Leviathan. They also helped fight the Black Glove. Regardless of these lofty ambitions, when it comes to trouble on the reservation, Charles passionately solves challenges with his two greatest weapons: his fists. Put a bow in his hands and he is an expert shot to boot. &#10;Gameplay&#10; Raven Red is out of anyone&rsquo;s league when using his bow. But as impetuous as he is, he doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to use his fists when the situation calls for it. &#10; He never goes without his bow and is quick to retaliate when taken by surprise. &#10;Versus power &#10;Duo: Raven Red is never far from his father, so Chief Man-of-Bats is recruited as lieutenant. When the event tile is activated, the Leader and his lieutenant regenerate (up to 1 lifepoint each), then Raven Red shoots the sharpest arrow he owns.&#10;&#10;The Knight&#10;Knight and Squire were English crime fighters similar to Batman and Robin. But unlike the Dynamic Duo, these two were inspired by the heraldry of the medieval era. Cyril Sheldrake is the modern version of Knight and a colleague of Batman. Being of a heroic dynasty, Sheldrake sometimes doubts Batman&rsquo;s methods, but the two share a mutual trust. Regardless, he can always count on his trusted Squire to help him. Knight also has a tenacious set of armor for when he must endure the inevitable hard knocks that come with fighting crime.&#10;Gameplay&#10; He is a living swiss army knife, adapting himself to every situation he bumps into. This athlete is capable of astonishing prowess despite his heavy armor that protects him. Just like Batman, he is a seasoned investigator.&#10; Equipped with this gauntlet, lockpicking becomes easy for him, as well as hacking into computers. &#10;Versus power &#10;Squire support: Have you ever seen a knight without a squire? They are never apart. The event gives the hero player a token that grants one of their character the luck skill level 2 for an action, because of the Squire coming to the rescue.&#10;&#10;5 new bat gadgets&#10; The 5 bat gadgets you will find in this expansion will offer you new gameplay possibilities: &#10;Artificer Gel: This bat gadget is really helpful when it comes to disarming bombs or any explosives. &#10;Adrenaline Shot: Need to perform more actions, to go further than what you were capable of? Push your limits with this one-use adrenaline shot.&#10;Sharp Batarang: This new batarang will always inflict damages&hellip; as long as you don&rsquo;t aim too far from your target.&#10;Electric Batarang: Another batarang, capable of neutralizing the most enduring opponents.&#10;Strenghtened Armor: A new piece of equipment made of a new alloy, more efficient in melee fights.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The League of Assassins is a thematic expansion for BATMAN&trade;: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES that offers players a chance to play a 3-mission campaign, in which the heroes try to thwart Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul and his league&rsquo;s plans to wipe out Gotham City.&#10; Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul is among Batman&rsquo;s most dangerous and formidable foes. Backed by an international eco-terrorist organization, Ra&rsquo;s has returned to carry out his Machiavellian plans. His daughter Talia, her twisted son Heretic, and the fearsome lady Shiva make their BATMAN&trade;: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES debut in this exciting, action-packed expansion. &#10;The League of Assassins expansion includes 12 new minis, their tiles and 3 New Adventure mode missions, that can be played sequentially as a campaign.&#10;The Assassins and Assassins with rifle can be used as substitutes in corebox Adventure Mode missions and are fully recruitable in Versus Mode missions.&#10;&#10;Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul goal: to Cleanse Gotham City, creeps ever closer in this 3-mission mini campaign &ndash; He&rsquo;s going to need all his cunning to outwit the Bat-team. &#10;To even up the odds &ndash; Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul plans to augment his faithful assassins, increasing their destructive capacity and giving them an edge to stand firm against Gotham City&rsquo;s guardians. &#10;Creating these boosted troops is going to be a challenge- he&rsquo;s going to have to obtain a DNA sample from his Grandson Damien, Prof Langstrom&rsquo;s formula and hardest of all-- some DNA from the Batman himself. Once these elements are gathered together, the Demons Head will create his Man-Bat commandos, poor copies of The Man-Bat augmented by Bruce&rsquo;s DNA.&#10;&#10;What this villain succeeds in amassing during mission 1&amp;2 determines the Man-Bat commandos stats in mission 3.&#10;&#10;Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul (The Demon&rsquo;s Head) &#10;Just how old is he? This scheming terrorist that cannot die - at least not permanently? Six centuries? Longer? His real name remains unknown, but the Egyptian name &ldquo;Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul&rdquo; (the Ghouls head&rdquo;) has long been whispered in fear. &#10; His secular experience makes him a formidable opponent: he is one of Batman&rsquo;s few enemies that knows his secret identity.&#10;Additionally when his luck runs out, Ra's can count on the strange Lazarus Pits, filled with a mysterious rejuvenating liquid, located in places loaded with mystical energy, to come back to life.&#10;Life, moreover, is his obsession, and he is ready to erase all traces of humanity to enable nature to regain its rights and create a world in perfect environmental balance.&#10; Over time, Ra's has had several wives, and several children, the most formidable of which is his daughter Talia, who aspires to take over his terrorist organization, the League of Assassins. She also gave him a grandson, Damian, Bruce Waynes&rsquo; son.&#10;Gameplay&#10;In contrast to his corebox profile, where he supported his men, this time The Demon&rsquo;s head is leading from the front, showcasing his superb munitions skills and taking full advantage of his Lazarus Pit dips induced regeneration skill.&#10;Versus power&#10;Indoctrination&#10;As Head of the League, his Assassins accompany him at all times &ndash;the event tile with an Assassins tile. At the beginning of the mission replace the event card with the Assassins tile. This tile provides 2 Assassins minis instead of the normal 4.&#10;&#10;Talia Al Ghul&#10;Talia is the daughter of Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul and the on-and-off romantic interest of Batman. Her relationship with Bruce has always been complicated; the two belong to two very different worlds and often take conflicting moral stances. On one occasion, when Bruce lay drugged and injured, Talia conceived his child&mdash;a fact that would remain unknown to him for many years. Talia raised Damian according to her own standards and beliefs and this tale of secrecy did little to settle Talia and Batman&rsquo;s tumultuous love-hate relationship. Regardless of her connection to Bruce or her father, Talia remains a powerful individual in her own right.&#10; Gameplay &#10;Trained since childhood, Talia has grown into an accomplished warrior. She is equally proficient in melee and ranged combat, which are boosted by her martial arts and marksman skills. &#10;As with all league members- handling explosives is an innate ability.&#10;Versus power&#10;Bodyguard: &#10;Talia Al Ghul, worthy daughter of Ra&rsquo;s ramps up the firepower.&#10;recruits 3 assassins with rifle and replaces the event tile by their tile.&#10;At the beginning of the mission replace the event tile with an Assassins with rifle tile. This tile provides 3 Assassins with rifle minis instead of the normal 4.&#10;&#10;Lady Shiva&#10;There are many hired assassins in the world, but few as formidable as Sandra Wu-San. She is arguably the most accomplished martial artist in the world, even challenging the likes of Richard Dragon and Batman. She tends to work for the highest bidder as long as the contract doesn&rsquo;t break her curious code of honor. She has even worked for Ra's Al Ghul and the League of Assassins. Her only weakness is that she seeks an opponent who can actually defeat her. At this point she has yet to find one, but perhaps someday her daughter, Cassandra Cain, will provide the challenge she so desperately craves. &#10;Gameplay&#10;A Master assassin, this lady annihilates her opponents. And if a hero is foolish enough to throw down, odds are they won&rsquo;t live to regret the decision.&#10;Versus power&#10;Fatality&#10;Expert in assassination, she targets an opponent&rsquo;s Leader or Lieutenant, hunts them down and strikes (Melee attack) with 2 orange dice and level 2 poison.&#10;&#10;Heretic&#10;When the League of Assassins created Damian Wayne, it was a complex and delicate process. In the end, Talia Al Ghul was not completely satisfied with her son&rsquo;s loyalty or his capabilities. To improve on this design, she employed blasphemous arts and cloned him in the hope of creating a perfect warrior&mdash;one who would be fully grown, merciless, and, most importantly, obedient. What she ultimately got was a monstrous killing machine&mdash;another creation she deemed a failure. &#10; Gameplay &#10;This fearless product of the Al Ghul&rsquo;s experimentation with Damian&rsquo;s DNA delivers devastating blows, this combined with his ability to take on multiple opponents make him the League member of choice to break through the other sides lines and take out its leader.&#10;Versus power&#10;Fury of the clone&#10;Damian&rsquo;s clone performs a melee attack using berserk skill level 2.&#10;&#10;Assassins with rifle&#10; Gameplay &#10;Adept at ranged combat, these new troops are also explosives experts.&#10;They can be substituted in the following corebox Adventure Mode Missions &ndash; &#10;&ldquo;To Sink a City&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chain Mutation&rdquo;, &ldquo;An Icy Welcome&rdquo;, &ldquo;Suicide Escape&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sleep Well Children&rdquo;.&#10;Heads up &ndash; when a villain chooses to replace a tile in their river, he does so BEFORE the heroes form their team from the available choices.&#10;&#10;Assassins&#10; Gameplay &#10;The triple skilled troop type, they are good in a fight, move quickly and avoid ranged attacks, but remain fragile in melee in comparison to other Elite troops.&#10;They can be substituted in the following corebox Adventure Mode Missions &ndash; &#10;&ldquo;To Sink a City&rdquo;, &ldquo;An Icy Welcome&rdquo;, &ldquo;Good Cops / Bad Cops&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sleep Well Children&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This map-focused expansion for BATMAN&trade;: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES offers a new double-sided game board representing two unique and iconic locations. Wage viscous battles amid the reeking waters of the Gotham City Sewers, and defend justice at the GCPD Police Headquarters. &#10;In the accompanying booklet you will find 10 new missions for Versus mode for use with these new maps as well as the expansion boards found in Season 1 (Arkham Asylum, The Joker&rsquo;s Funhouse and Wayne Manor). &#10;Additionally, for when the Dark Knight needs a little extra power, this set includes a new double-tile for Batman&rsquo;s Trasher Suit.&#10;&#10;The Sewer&#10;The sewers spawn a game board with a tight almost claustrophobic environment, obstructed lines of sight, a warren of walls and snug quarters full of villainy.&#10;However, a section of the board is higher than the rest, which opens up lines of sight into many of these otherwise hidden zones, while providing the promontory bonus. But that aside, you are still going to have to sneak through the maze of abandoned quarters to look your opponent straight in the eye as you shoot.&#10;These flophouses are excellent hiding spaces but achieving mission objectives will require you to hunt down evil in its&rsquo; lair, then melt away before the tide of approaching goons overwhelm you.&#10;The board is separated into four large areas, the sluice clearly delineates 3 boundaries and the height difference between the zones adds another. Getting around the board requires a significant amount of movement, crossing the stinking sewers or jumping across takes a toll.&#10;If you want to move about this board, better keep some cubes in reserve. Smooth area movement is a strategic requisite, hindering can shut your mobility down hard, so maintaining control of area boundaries is essential.&#10;All this restriction is counterbalanced by highly mobile or parkour talented characters. They can easily navigate over the torrenting sluice and continue onwards, while highly mobile characters, like Killer Croc or King Shark can cross the board with ease as if the water wasn&rsquo;t there allowing them access to an impressive amount of the board. &#10;These characters are a valuable asset on this board, as the open up the possibility of sneaking behind enemy lines or quickly providing reinforcement to overrun areas, in other words, it&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg time.&#10;&#10;Police Headquarters&#10;With this brand new game board we are presenting another important and exciting location in Gotham City. This building serves as a bastion of law and order and a shield against chaos. From this location, brave men and women organize and mobilize to ensure the innocent are protected and the wicked are brought to justice. Under the dedicated watch of Commissioner Gordon and his trusted officers, the GCPD prevails time and again against the looming threats of the criminal underworld. &#10; The Police Station allows you to play through new adventures, such as protecting (or destroying) compromising evidence or ensuring the safe release of significant prisoners.&#10; This board is organized into several sections, spanning several levels. On the ground floor, a long hallway allows characters to benefit from various lines of sight; but there are also intermittent columns which create advantageous cover. &#10; Some areas, however, are more confined. These are ideal for the placement of objectives, such as cells, interrogation rooms, and the medical examiner&rsquo;s facility. These areas are more difficult to access and well protected, so players will need to carefully consider the best routes to securing scenario objectives. &#10; Each level offers different gameplay opportunities. On the first level, there are chief inspectors. This office, completely surrounded by walls, offers a necessary refuge for when the police station is under siege. The second floor overlooks a large corridor offering many tempting lines of sight. The archives sector, however, is a more enclosed space, offering only limited lines of sight. Those who can breach walls will, of course, have the option to cross over into adjacent rooms. Finally, the statue and columns of the police station allow particularly agile characters to quickly and easily access different levels and to avoid opponents&mdash;should that be of strategic benefit. &#10; Because of its difficult terrain and the hidden paths created by columns, this board favors mobile characters. Centralized areas can be very dangerous due to the various lines of sight, and those attempting to cross should do so with caution.&#10;&#10;10 Versus missions&#10; This new game boards pack comes with:&#10;&#10;     A booklet with 10 new missions for the Versus mode expansion which allows to play new skirmishes on these two new game boards and on those of the expansions:&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull;2 missions on the police station game board.&#10;&bull;2 missions on the sewers game board.&#10;&bull;2 missions on the Wayne Manor game board (Wayne Manor expansion)&#10;&bull;2 missions on the Arkham Asylum game board (Arkham Asylum expansion)&#10;&bull;2 missions on the Joker&rsquo;s Funhouse game board (Arkham Asylum expansion)&#10;&#10;     8 new tokens that represent new types of objectives and allow to play with hidden objectives.&#10;     Since many of you requested, one of these new missions for the Versus mode is to be played with double tiles. This is why you will find in this pack the double tile of Batman Trasher Suit (from the Wayne Manor expansion) as well as its life points marker.&#10;    All the new Leader powers for all the new miniatures from season 2 (expansions, picking zone...). Those powers allow the new characters to be selected as Leaders when playing the Versus mode expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Upon completing each mission, players may flash the included QR codes to uncover additional information regarding the ulterior motives lurking behind the antagonists of this campaign.&#10;&#10;Because it&rsquo;s somewhat uncomfortable and disingenuous to call Squad members &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;, in this expansion they will be identified as &ldquo;Anti-Heroes&rdquo;&ndash; a replacement term for heroes.&#10;&#10;&#10;     10 new miniatures and 13 hero screens, including Season 1 characters such as Harley Quinn and Killer Croc. &#10;     11 tiles &#10;     15 equipment cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;All Suicide Squad characters are Versus mode compatible and have individual powers.&#10;&#10;You can expand your anti-hero mission pool further by adding the following core box components. This component mash-up maximizes the thematic campaign experience. &#10;&#10;     Katana, mini, hero screen and the katana equipment card.&#10;     Killer Croc mini.&#10;     Harley Quinn mini.&#10;     1 service gun equipment card, allocated to Rick Flag&#10;     1 service gun equipment card, allocated to Amanda Waller&#10;     Poison Ivy mini. *&#10;     2 Carnivorous Plant minis and their tile *&#10;     1 Fire Axe equipment card allocated to The Joker's Daughter (Duela Dent)&#10;     4 Guard minis to use in with the Belle-Reve's Guards tile included in this expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;* If you own Poison Ivy (new 52) and the Carnivorous Plants Rex, you can substitute them for the corebox Poison Ivy and Carnivorous Plants.&#10;&#10;Build your own Suicide Squad: select from a 14-character pool (13 in this expansion, plus Katana) and prepare to get your hands dirty.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each mission, when choosing heroes, you can decide to rebuild a new team or continue with the one you assembled for the previous mission.&#10;&#10;Your choices are made from three types of anti-heroes: Leaders, members of Squad S and those of Squad X.&#10;&#10;Each anti-hero enters play fully loaded with a preset selection of equipment cards.&#10;&#10;Last, but not least, the Belle-Reve Guards tile adds to the game wide available henchmen/elite pool from Versus mode or Adventure mode if a hero has the command skill.&#10;&#10;These upgraded veterans are capable of performing complex actions but cannot share a mission with &ldquo;Guards&rdquo; tile &ndash; so make your choice between the two carefully before each mission. Their hindering skill is a painful thorn in your opponents&rsquo; side when they are after your leader or lieutenant.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This edition of the game, contains additional deluxe content unlocked during the Kickstarter that is packaged inside the box:&#10;the Lanterns Mini Expansion  (4 Torch tokens, 7 Lantern tokens, 4 Tactic cards).&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Tactics utilizes a simple combat system with variable player powers and 3D terrain to achieve endless layers of strategy and fun.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Tactics offers competitive play, cooperative play and solo play!&#10;&#10;Conquer your opponents in tactical combat where every calculated move matters... or journey across the land and through the caves in a grand cooperative/solo adventure!&#10;&#10;Nesting inside the game box are 5 smaller boxes and a map/scroll. Players will set up the game by placing these 5 boxes, plus the box bottom, onto the scroll in designated areas. This creates the environment that players will explore and battle across.&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Tactics, players will have a team of 4 unique heroes: a Fighter, a Wizard, a Rogue and a Beast. Each hero type, and each character within that type, offers unique advantages to movement, attacks, and/or support. Finding the synergy in your team is key to victory.&#10;&#10;In competitive play, players will pit their teams against one another in effort to score the most victory points by the end of the game. Each turn, players will have 3 actions to assign across their team. They can move and/or attack with their heroes. Victory points are rewarded for area control, enemy heroes captured, and keeping your own heroes alive. Gaining complete control of one, or multiple, specific areas offers the most victory points in competitive play. Gaining control of said areas requires your heroes maintaining majority presence in these areas over the course of a few turns. This requires a careful balance of offense and defense. The control of these areas can easily shift from one player to another based on which player has the majority heroes present in the designated spaces. Once a set number of areas are captured, or one of the players has lost all of their heroes, the end game is triggered.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Tactics offers a distinctly different experience for solo and cooperative play. In these modes, players will adventure across the map, fighting spawning enemies and exploring caves (printed on the interior of each of the boxes). The goal is to acquire treasures, that belongs to the enemy, from these caves while keeping your heroes alive. Once the end of the game is triggered, victory points are tallied based on how many treasures you took from the enemy and how many of your heroes you kept alive.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "OVERVIEW&#10;Glaves is a trick-taking card game for 2-4 players.  A standard 52-card deck is used; aces are high, and twos are low.  It is a modified combination of two old card games named German Whist and Knaves (hence the name Glaves).  The object of the game is to get to a winning score before the other players do by playing several hands.  See total winning scores below based on the number of players.  The score for each hand is the number of tricks taken minus any penalty points for Jacks (Knaves) taken.  Several hands are played until one of the players gets the winning score (or more).  The player with the highest total score is the winner.  In the case of a tie, which is rare, the youngest tied player wins.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Shuffle the deck.  For 2 players, deal 13 cards to each player.  For 3 or 4 players, deal 9 cards each.  Place the remaining cards face down as a draw pile and turn the top card face up.  If playing with three players, take the bottom card from the draw pile and put it aside, face up.  Its suit is the trump suit for the entire hand and is not otherwise used in the game.  With 3 players, taking the bottom card out makes the deck evenly split across the three players.  For 2 or 4 players, the face-up card on top of the draw pile at the start of the hand is the trump suit for the entire hand.  Subsequent face-up cards don't affect the trump suit in any way.&#10;&#10;PLAY&#10;The person to the left of the dealer plays a card from their hand face-up in the middle of the table.  They can choose any card from their hand of any suit.  (NOTE: The face-up card on the draw pile does not determine which suit is played, it's just the card that the winner of this trick will take into their hand.)  Each player must play the same suit led unless they don't have that suit, in which case, they may play a card of a different suit.  The highest card of the suit led takes the trick unless trump cards are played, then the highest trump card played takes the trick.  The person who takes the trick takes the face-up card on top of the draw pile into their hand.  The person to their left takes the next face-down card from the draw pile into their hand and so on until the last player has taken a card into their hand.  The last player to take from the draw pile then turns the next card face-up.  The person who took the trick goes first in the next trick.  Since each player draws a card from the draw pile each trick, the players will have the same number of cards in their hands until the draw pile is depleted.  Once the draw pile is depleted, play continues without drawing cards from the draw pile so that each player's hand decreases in size by one card per trick until all cards in their hands are gone.  That ends that hand and scores are totaled and recorded.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;Each trick you take counts as one point.  Each Jack you took in those tricks counts as -4 points for the Jack of hearts, -3 points for the Jack of diamonds, -2 points for the Jack of clubs, and -1 point for the Jack of spades.  It is possible to have a negative score if you take enough Jacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Jack Suit &#10;         Penalty &#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Hearts &#10;         -4 points &#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Diamonds &#10;         -3 points &#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Clubs &#10;         -2 points &#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Spades &#10;         -1 point &#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The total points across all players scored per hand for two players is 16, for 3 players is 7, and for 4 players is 3.  That's the total number of tricks minus 10 (the total Jack penalty).  You can make sure all scores each hand add up to those totals to make sure everyone counted correctly.  Play additional hands until one player reaches a total of 46 or more points for two players, 20 points for three players, or 9 points for 3 players.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Players &#10;         Cards Dealt &#10;         Total tricks &#10;         Total points per hand &#10;         Winning score after multiple hands&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         2 &#10;         13 &#10;         26 &#10;         16 &#10;         46&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         3 &#10;         9 &#10;         17 &#10;         7 &#10;         20&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         4 &#10;         9 &#10;         13 &#10;         3 &#10;         9&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;SHOOTING THE MOON&#10;Any player may &quot;shoot the moon&quot; by taking all 4 jacks (instead of avoiding them).  This gives them the total number of available points for that hand (for example, 7 points for a three-player game), and everyone else gets zero points.  If you think someone is trying to shoot the moon, then you need to figure out how to eat the least painful jack before they end up with all the jacks.  Unless a player has the jack of the trump suit and perhaps one more jack, it can be difficult and risky to shoot the moon.  A player who is trying to shoot the moon might pretend to be disappointed at taking each jack, but not too disappointed, or the other players might catch on.&#10;&#10;STRATEGY&#10;Queens, Kings, and Aces are often dangerous cards since they take tricks with Jacks in them.  The strategy for this game is to pay attention to what has been played and what that implies about each player's hand, to be careful not to take Jacks by playing more conservatively the closer you get to the end of the game, and to purposefully run out of suits so you can drop a non-trump Jack on someone else's trick when the suit you don't have is lead.  Be sure to laugh and talk trash when you drop a Jack on someone who was happy to be taking a trick only moments before.&#10;&#10;ORIGINS&#10;My two coworkers and I invented and play-tested this game from 2-4 players for over a year to refine and balance it.  3 players is the optimal number, but 2 and 4 work fine as well.&#10;&#10;GLOSSARY&#10;Trick: One round of play where each player plays one card in the middle.  The highest-ranked card of the suit led (or the highest-ranked trump suit card, see below) takes the trick (the pile of cards played).&#10;&#10;Trump Suit: This is the suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades) which is selected as being higher than the rest of the suits.  If a card of a trump suit is played on cards of non-trump suits, then the trump suit card takes the trick.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You have to lie to your fellow players right in the face. You have have to catch them lying. You need to remember what cards left the game - even tough cards leave the game face down! You need a strategy. You need a second strategy if the tides change. You need to organise your hand so the others won't get a read on you. There's a million tricks to learn. You need to stay calm.&#10;&#10;The game is for 3 to 4 maniacs, and one lunacy lasts about 5 - 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The player moves around the board and hunts deer by playing cards from their hand to take actions and deploy useful items. Once deer are spotted, cards are used to try and identify the deer while remaining hidden from their keen senses. If a suitable target is identified and the deer haven't detected the hunter and run away, the player can then take a shot. Dice are used to resolve checks for hunting, identifying, hiding, and shooting.&#10;&#10;The scenario will specify the set up for the modular board as well as the goal of the game. The player's goal will typically involve bagging the largest buck possible before their deck runs out thereby ending the game.&#10;&#10;This game is by the same designer as Whitetail Wilderness but is a wholly separate game sharing only the title.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rats is a trick-taking game where each player is dealt a hand of 7 cards and an initial trump suit is determined by revealing the top card of the deck. The suit of this card is the trump suit for the first hand of cards.&#10;&#10;The player left of the dealer leads the trick and everybody follows suit. The highest card takes the trick. If you cannot follow suit then you have the option to trump. A trump card beats everything other than another trump card. A card plaid which does not follow suit and is not a trump has no trick-taking capabilities. Trumps cannot be led until you have no cards left to lead other than trumps or until a trick has been taken by trumping another suit.&#10;&#10;After the entire hand has been played, anybody that took 0 tricks is on &quot;stand-by&quot; for the rest of the game. The player that took the most tricks declares the next trump suit. Ties are broken by having each player draw from the remaining cards in the deck until one player draws a higher card than the other, and they decide the trump suit for the next hand.&#10;&#10;A second hand of 6 cards is dealt, and then the player that decides trumps declares the trump suit. Play continues until all tricks have been taken. Any player which is on stand-by and took no tricks is eliminated from the game. Any player which was not previously on stand-by and took 0 tricks is now on stand-by. Whoever took the most tricks declares the next trump suit. Ties are broken as before.&#10;&#10;Play continues with each hand decreasing down to 1 card or until all players have been eliminated. If two or more players remain after the hand of 1 card, play continues with hands of 1 card until only one player remains.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On To Vienna! &ndash; simulating the Austro-Prussian War (1866) &ndash; is a sequel to On To Paris! using a wargame system adapted from Victory Games&rsquo; The Civil War. Players familiar with On To Paris! will be immediately familiar with the scale, system, rules and game play of On To Vienna!, taking the action to central Europe and Italy in 1866.&#10;&#10;The systems challenge players to control the leadership, organization and military operations of Armies and Corps during the later 19th century, this time between Prussia and its ally Italy against Austria and the independent Federal German States, including Bavaria, Saxony and Hanover, with the exciting possibility of French Intervention.&#10;&#10;Designed for two players, On To Vienna! is also suitable for solitaire play. Eleven scenarios include various &lsquo;early start&rsquo; situations and the historical start of the war as well as a number of key points with the conflict already underway that can continue past the historical end of the conflict. An introductory &ldquo;learning&rdquo; scenario introduces players to the system and several scenarios look at exciting variations such as Austria being able to focus and bring more effort against either Prussia or Italy. Players can also pick any scenario as a starting point and determine their own period of the conflict to simulate. Most scenarios can be played on sections of the maps for smaller, shorter and faster games and as before with On to Paris! many optional rules explore interesting historical options for both sides.&#10;&#10;On To Vienna! is a fast moving competitive game where players do their best to control their forces and where every decision creates excitement and tension. The game system features interactive game play with flexible initiative and variable turn length as well as extensive defensive player reaction ability. The game puts players in charge of all the famous Corps and Army leaders of the Austro-Prussian War which are all rated for their individual leadership qualities and occasional unique characteristics like resistance to following orders.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Calling is a Social Deduction game where players are Investigators in the FBI, following up with reports of insanity and murders by the local docks. Soon after, the same symptoms begin to rise within the Precinct causing the Investigators to suspect the work of a Cultist of the whispered Cthulhu, acting as an Investigator by day, and doing the Profane work of the Deep one by night.&#10;The Calling plays similarly to most Social Deduction games with a day phase and a night phase, but the distinctive difference is that it is moderatorless, and part of completing a night action, players wake up the next person. The Calling also uses a &quot;Murder Party&quot; mechanic, where during the day any three players can band together to instantly kill a player, Dead players can also instigate or contribute to murder parties, allowing them a lot of power as the balance of alive and dead players tips towards final day. Finally All dead players become evil once dead, as the Cultist assembles an ever growing army of the dead, to help defeat the astute investigators.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
