The game is #1 in a series of 5 games, published as a bookshelf volume 'Ars Combinatoria'. The game is published in both Japanese and English.&#10;&#10;The key of the game is the ultimate decision between these two: circulating time which denies changes, and flowing time which accepts changes.&#10;&#10;Players always have eight cards during play. At the end of the game, the player who has the highest value in their hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;They maintain their own schedule in front of them, which determines their actions. Each turn, you may add and remove activity cards in your schedule or your opponent's. Time to be consumed is printed in each card.

In addition, you have to flip over a number card whose number is at least as high as the number of steps you move. When moving onto the same field as another tractor, you push that one one field ahead. If you land on a field behind another tractor, you move up next to that one.&#10;&#10;When you cannot make a legal move, you skip a turn. When the first player has no cards left, the game ends and whoever moved furthest is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Seven Season Soup takes place in a fantasy world inspired by the Japanese feudal era and Asian mythology. In the game, players encounter fantastic creatures like the towering Daikon, a radish demon, or Slime, an adorable yet dangerous pink blob. The art is colorful and is reminiscent of a colored version of Japanese calligraphy.&#10;&#10;The players compete in the Banquet of Seven Suns, a cooking competition hosted by the Emperor. The dishes earn points, and the goal of the game is to get the most points awarded for the cooked dishes. The ingredients required for the dishes are sometimes guarded by monsters and demons; other times, the monsters and demons are the ingredients! The players travel the variable game board with a hero outfitted with unique abilities and proficient in several equipment disciplines. Different random quests award money and loot in the form of weapons, armor, scrolls and other equipment. Each player can also improve their abilities by recruiting up to two companions to build up their group.&#10;&#10;The players take two actions in each turn and have to get the most out of the limited turns they get. The game time is limited by the number of event cards in the event pile. Once the event pile is depleted, the players each get one last turn. The game ends by scoring the dishes. The player with the most points wins. If two players are tied, their groups of heroes will duel to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description &amp; Theme&#10;Wrestlers! Management has asked you to stick around and put together a dark match to keep the fans in their seats. There isn't enough time to choreograph the whole match, so it is up to you to put on and improvise the best match possible. The only requirement is there are specific spots management wants you to hit because the fans want to see what the fans want to see! Can you put on the most electrifying match and keep the fans cheering or will the only sound you hear after the 1-2-3 be the sound of crickets?&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game&#10;Unlike other head-to-head wrestling themed games or fighting games, the goal is not to beat your opponent by depleting their hit points. The goal is to put on the best match possible and getting the most fans (victory points)!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;1. Separate the cards into a Momentum Deck (cards 1 &ndash; 7) and a Spot Deck (cards 8 &ndash; 13).&#10;2. Place 3 pairs of Spot cards in the center of the table face up. The sum of each of the pairs is the goal you are trying to reach for each Spot.&#10;3. Place the Momentum Deck to another side.&#10;4. Each player draws 5 cards from the Momentum Deck.&#10;5. Choose a player to go first.&#10;&#10;Players now take turns playing a card from their hand on one Spot, trying to reach that goal on their turn. Reaching that goal perfectly wins the Spot and equates to more fans, but passing (when a valid card can't be played) forfeits the Spot to the opponent and giving them more fans. Cards played from the hand represent simple wrestling moves, like strikes and holds, that escalate to the Spot, which are power moves like DDTs and spears!&#10;&#10;When there are no Momentum cards or Spots remaining, players enter the Pin Fall attempt! Play turns into a War-style game, flipping over remaining cards in the hand to see who wins the pin. After the pin, all Perfect and Botched (passed) Spots are scored up.&#10;&#10;Reading your opponent, evaluating the cards in play, the cards in your hand, and measuring the potential outcomes on future Spots will determine the bright fan favorite in ASWG: Dark Match!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The story&#10;&#10;Athena is known for being the goddess of war, but she was also the goddess of peace, the protector and the guardian of the city. She didn&rsquo;t like battles, and on the contrary, she was delighted when she was able to stop a fight. This is why she asked to the gods of the four elements: Poseidon, god of seas and waters, Gaia, goddess of earth, Aether, god of air, and Hephaestus, god of fire ; to build a prestigious city-state: EPHYRAN! Each deity would be represented by its element and the aim would be to bring all the mythological creatures representative of the elements to live together! The deities got quickly down to work: a Blue Lagoon for the sea creatures, a Sacred Land for the earth creatures, a Forbidden Forest for the flying creatures and a Fire Mountain for the fire creatures&hellip;&#10;&#10;It seems Athena couldn&rsquo;t meet the challenge and today, the city-state has totally disappeared. Totally? It is heard that the present-day town of Corinth is a vestige of the city-state and that is was actually built on EPHYRAN ruins&hellip;&#10;&#10;The proof is that the city symbol is nothing but a winged stallion: Pegasus!&#10;&#10;Game overview&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of one of the gods and has to build the city-state of Ephyran as prestigious as possible. The city-state must be composed of the 4 gods&rsquo; territories (each territory being divided into 4 areas): Poseidon&rsquo;s lagoon (blue), Hephaestus&rsquo;s mountain (red), Aeolus&rsquo;s forest (green) and Gaia&rsquo;s lands (brown).&#10;To get the highest prestige, you will have to vary the mythological creatures that will live in your city, and add magical tokens offered by the gods. You can also try to get some of the areas which already come with these tokens...&#10;&#10;A game round&#10;&#10;On each round, the players can choose between one of the following actions:&#10;Add a Territory to their city (if possible) displaying them according to the territory type next to its god (only one copy of each territory is allowed in a city!).&#10;Play a Support card. &#10;Change a (non-covered) territory of their city by discarding it and replacing it immediately by another one.&#10;Discard a card.&#10;To end their round, the players take a new card on the top of the pile or of the discard pile.&#10;&#10;End of the game&#10;&#10;The game ends when the pile is empty (without taking into account the discard) or when a player puts the 16th card of his city-state.&#10;Then the turn ends so that the players play the same number of cards, then it&rsquo;s time to count the prestige points.&#10;&#10;",

The game was inspired by the diagrams of Mark Lombardi, and by the idea that every way can be represented by a series of colors, a concept we named WayDNA. At every turn, players try to spot low budget travel routes with two stops and to visit new attractions around the world. They can also use an online companion app to win missions and money. The game has over 10 different types of missions and 1000 trivia questions for all ages. It is an intuitive and fun way to learn about geography, low budget travelling and graph theory concepts.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2+ players based on The Pacific Rim Movie and representing Kaiju vs Jaeger Combat.&#10;&#10;Players share a common 52 playing card deck. Each face card has a unique ability for each type of Jaeger or Kaiju which are described in each unit&rsquo;s unique face card lists (there are six different Jaeger, and six different Kaiju). Number cards are used the same way by all units depending on their suit.  Hearts = Attack, Diamonds = Dodge, Clubs = Damage, Spades = Armour.&#10;&#10;Each player picks one Kaiju or Jaeger to control. There should be equal numbers of each if possible. Players may play 2 units, but must have a separate hand for each. Each unit (Kaiju and Jaeger) start with 20 Hits.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 8 phases:&#10;&#10;1.    Draw Phase&#10;-     Each player fills their card hand to their base hand size. Seven is the base hand size of all units but hand size can be decreased as a result of card play.&#10;&#10;2.   Tactics Phase&#10;-    The current player may discard up to 4 cards and draw replacements.&#10;&#10;3.   Attack Phase&#10;-     The current player (the attacker) picks a target enemy unit to attack (the defender).  The attacker plays an Attack (Heart) card. The attacker may play 1 or more face cards to increase his attack score.&#10;&#10;4.    Dodge Phase&#10;-     The defender may play a Dodge (Diamond) card. The defender may play 1 or more face cards to increase his dodge score. If the dodge score is equal to or greater than the attack score, the attack misses in which case skip the Damage and Armour phases.&#10;&#10;5.   Damage Phase&#10;-    If the attack hit (i.e. was not dodged), the attacker plays a Damage (Club) card. The attacker may play 1 or more face cards to increase his damage score.&#10;&#10;6.   Armour Phase&#10;-    The defender may play an Armour (Spade) card. The defender may play 1 or more face cards to increase his armour score. If the armour score is equal to or greater than the damage score, the attack does no damage. If the damage score is higher, the defender takes hits equal to the difference. Units are destroyed when they are reduced to zero or less Hits.&#10;&#10;7.   Combo Counter Phase&#10;-    The attacker may play a face card with the Combo ability to attack an additional time this turn. This attack may be against a different opposing unit. After this, the defender may play a face card with the counter trait to also make an attack this turn (against the current player).&#10;&#10;8.   End Phase&#10;-    All players may discard up to 2 cards.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all enemy units are destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Boarding Party is a family game suitable for age 9 and above. The game may be easy to learn but it is no easy task to master and packs with lots of fun! Players may build and upgrade their ships, send them to war and capture treasure ships. They will go through and have to make strategic and tactical decisions every turn. The more ships and upgrades you have, the more damage you do but often also the hardest you will get hit as your ships become more lucrative for other player to plunder. The player gains influential point as he acquires, attacks and plunder ships and other pirates that roam the waters of Caribbean!&#10;&#10;In Boarding Party, there are 2 game scenarios, 1 draw pile, 1 event pile, 1 discard pile and each player has a fleet of ships. You start the game by drawing a hand of 4 cards and each turn you may draw 2 cards from either draw piles and play up to 3 cards on your hand. Each player assumes the role of a pirate captain with a unique ability. Balance comes from trying to increase your influence by expanding your fleet or attacking or protecting them from rival pirates. The player or faction with the most number of Ships and Upgrades in play when the game ends wins the game.&#10;&#10;The 1st scenario (2-7 players), pitches all pirates against each other in the quest to dominate the Caribbean Sea and be the king of Pirates in the Caribbean. Meanwhile the 2nd scenario (5-7 players), players are divided into 3 factions, most with hidden identity and contribute to respective faction to gain influence and control of the Caribbean Sea by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Boarding Party is designed to be easy to learn and hard to master. It features 130 pieces of high quality illustrated cards thus being highly portable, easy to setup and durable while delivering an exciting gaming experience anytime anywhere&#10;&#10;",

What followed was three days of epic action which destroyed the German chances of victory.&#10;&#10;Six battlefields provide a campaign which sees the Germans attacking and infiltrating to isolate the US defenders, initially with infantry but soon with armoured support while a gallant band of men fight on to the end.&#10;&#10;This classic Pint Sized Campaign is designed to be run using the campaign rules in At the Sharp End and with Chain of Command rules.  Can you break through and open the route to the Meuse and Antwerp, or will you make an heroic stand and halt Hitler&rsquo;s lunatic vision of victory in the West?&#10;&#10;Thirty-two pages long, this Pint Sized campaign provides the background history to the campaign with situation maps.  Uses period maps to show the location of the actions and then provides a complete campaign with forces for both sides, support options for players to select from and full victory conditions for all six battles and the campaign as a whole.&#10;&#10;",

The Trivia Deck contains 1,375 questions that span the entire history of horror cinema. The Categories Deck is used to play Slash Cards' two game modes: The Slasher and The Survivor. In The Slasher, players take turns drawing Category Cards and answering questions. The first player to collect a card from each of the game's five categories wins, but watch out! If you draw a Slash Card you forfeit all your cards and start over. In The Survivor, each player begins with a full suite of Category Cards. Each time a player answers a question incorrectly they lose one of their cards. The last player with at least one card in their hand is the winner. The trivia cards cover everything from the silent era all the way up to 2015, including questions about classics like The Exorcist and Halloween, lesser-known movies like Motel Hell and Session 9, and foreign horror films like Eyes Without A Face and REC. Horror fans of all levels will love Slash Cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simulator of karma. Magical game with dices and cards.&#10;That is a unique game about rebirth, desires and karma. As a bonus, a solo mode for fortune telling and cooperative mode without conflicts.&#10;&#10;Brief description of the game&#10;&#10;The ancient sages have said: &ldquo;we are alive only if we have desires&rdquo;. Someone has a lot of dreams, other has only one dream, but everyone who lives in our world constantly wants something. It&rsquo;s a pity, but accomplishment of  desires  is not a simple thing. Sometimes we need to do any serious actions. These actions can be as good, as bad. And our actions develop karma, which can be as light, as dark due to our desires...&#10;&#10;In the game 7 Desires''we become souls embodied in our world. There are many disadvantages in this world. For example, illness and death. Therefore, every player wants to leave this cruel world as quickly as possible. We would like to liberate the soul, and, of course, fulfill all the desires which have brought us here.&#10;&#10;The world is multilevel. Souls rise, and then fall, because they are so different! There is a plan of being for each level of consciousness.&#10;In the beginner of the game everyone starts at the level of human being.&#10;&#10;To win the game 7 Desires, you just need to move from the level of human being to the level of angels, then to the level of the gods. And when all the desires of the divine level are accomplished, you can go home, away from the world of births and deaths. We wish you good luck with that!&#10;&#10;In summary, every turn looks like this: a player draws a card, fills his hand with three cards, and then plays one card, placing it in the discard deck face -up. This card becomes an active desire. Next step, the player chooses whether he wants to accomplish this desire. If yes, then he discards the crystal (s) of desires indicated in the upper left corner of the card, and if he does not want to accomplish the desire, he adds to his avatar the item which is indicated in the upper right corner of the card. If it is more than one crystal on the left, you do not need to reset all the crystals. You can have any number of crystals indicated on the card. For example, accomplishing of &quot;A cherished Desire&quot; you can reset 1, 2 or 3 red crystals.&#10;&#10;If you have accomplished the desire, then karma comes for the actions you have taken to. This karma is described at the bottom of the card. All the received karma is placed under your avatar. Clearly pointed crystals (white and black) of karma are simply added, and undefined karma (tricolor crystals) is played with 3 dices of dark, light and red colors. The result is determined by the largest value of the dice. If the largest number falls on a light dice, light karma is added, if it is dark on the dark one, and if the red cube &quot;won&quot;, then at the value of 5 and 6 - you add an additional desire crystal, and for 1, 2, 3 or 4 &ndash; one crystal of desire is removed. If two of three dices have the same value, the third is always considered to work, even if it has a lower value than the other two. If the same value falls on all three dice - this is a big luck, and you can choose any action you want: to add light karma, or remove the dark, or remove the desire crystal, or add a crystal of desire.&#10;&#10;",

Brooks is (a 1-Player Guild in-joke) and gain as much Geek Gold as possible, while avoiding Albert (founder of the 1-Player Guild), his army of sock puppet accounts, and his trusty sidekick Julius.&#10;&#10;The game is a simple and quick dice-rolling push your luck game where you have to stay ahead of Albert and navigate the traps and boons on the board. Albert gradually ramps up his speed thus ramping up the tension of the game.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who's Gary&quot; is free PnP game with no cutting, gluing, etc. required. Just print the 1-page game board, print the 1-page player's aid/have it available electronically, and read the 1-page of rules. Finally add in 6d6 and 7 tokens (e.g. eurocubes).&#10;&#10;Designer's warning: Don't play this if you're not familiar with the 1-Player Guild at around 2018, since it's designed as one big in-joke for a guild event instead of as a good game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ynavi is a game where you play for victory points, and there are several mechanics to attain them. the main way is by scoring 'drakkars', the viking ship. Each drakkar needs to be filled with cubes of specific color in order to be scored, each scored earns 4 victory points.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, the first player rolls 5 dice of different color each with 2 sides of values 1 through 3, each of which correlates to a different color of cubes and pile of cards. Then, players rotate in choosing a die. For a selected die, the player can either take a number of cubes equal to the number on the die, or draw that many cards from the pile, but may only keep one and discard the rest.&#10;&#10;The 5 piles are as follows: blue, green, red, black, and yellow. Blue cards are equipments that stay with you for the rest of the game. Green cards are 'chiefs' that need to be filled with cubes to use, and can do powerful things, and stay for the rest of the game. Filling chiefs with cubes earns a victory point, failing to do so loses a victory point. Red cards are one time spells that can do cool things. Black cards are negative statuses you assign to an opponent that they may only remove by filling it with cubes. Lastly, yellow are quests, that if satisfied in the scoring phase at the end earn victory points.&#10;&#10;Once an option is chosen, a player may use a card if applicable, or place their cubes on their drakkars, chief, or black card inflicted on him/her. Then turn rotates until all players go and all dice are chosen (first player gets 2 turns each round), and then the first player token rotates and a new round begins. The game ends when either a pile of cards or cubes remains empty at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A worker placement game for 1-4 players themed on the Pioneer Settlement of Kentucky in 1780.  Settlements simulate places such as Harrods Fort, Logans Fort, and Boones Station with each player representing the settlement leader.&#10;&#10;Each player has a Resource Board, a Structure Board and a set of cubes/tokens to track resources and activities.&#10;-    The resource board is a 5x5 grid of 25 spaces and is used to keep track of the 25 different type of players&rsquo; resources (Folk, Housing, Clothing, Happiness etc.)  Each resource has a specific starting value between 0 and 10 and will go up and down during the game as a consequence of decisions made and a range of random factors. Resources are used to expand and develop the players&rsquo; settlement and their use will need to be balanced to ensure a positive outcome.&#10;-    The Structure Board is a 4x4 grid of 16 spaces and used to keep track of a player&rsquo;s structures.  Each player starts with 10 cabins and 2 corral pens but additional structures can be built to expand the settlement.  Structures will require varying combinations of resources (labour, wood and lumber) to construct but will generate benefits for the settlement once built.&#10;&#10;Players share an Action Board.  The Action Board is used in the action phase and consists of a 6 x 5 grid of 30 spaces representing the 30 actions that can be taken by players.  Actions (e,g, clear land, hunting, soap making etc.) represent the activities undertaken by the settlers.  Most actions have limits such as resource availability or need for specialists but, if requirements are met, will lead to additional resources and/or advancement of the settlement.&#10;&#10;Players can take their turns simultaneously with each turn comprising 2 phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Growth Phase&#10;-    Roll once on the Growth Table per 20 Folk you have. Results will result in births or the arrival of immigrants (with some additional resources)&#10;&#10;2.   Livestock Phase&#10;-    Gain additional livestock per 5 livestock you own.&#10;&#10;3.   Boon Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D10 to gain benefits, normally in additional resources.&#10;&#10;4.   Action Phase&#10;-    Players get actions equal to their Folk resource score. Cubes are placed onto the action squares of the Action Board to reflect actions taken.  Adjust resource levels up and down accordingly.  At the end of the phase all cubes are removed from the Action Board.&#10;&#10;5.   Hardship Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D10 on the Hardship Table and resolve.  Hardship will result in loss of livestock, grain, food or folk.&#10;&#10;6.   Mishap Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D10 twice on the Mishap Table and resolve. Mishaps result in the loss of resources.&#10;&#10;7.   Raid Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D10 on the Indian Raid Table and resolve.  Results will be trade, fighting, theft of resources, and in certain cases the settlement might be overrun and the player eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;8.   Consume Phase&#10;-    Each of a player&rsquo;s folk consumes 1 Food and every 10 folk consume 1 salt.  Insufficient food or salt may lead to folk moving away or dying.&#10;&#10;9.   Seasonal Phase&#10;-    Each turn represents three months - keep track of the seasons - Spring to Summer to Fall to Winter.  If it is Winter roll once on the Winter Table and resolve.  Dependant on the severity of the winter additional fuel (wood and lumber) may be required and there may be a loss of livestock or folk.&#10;&#10;10.  Storage Phase&#10;-    A player adds up the total number of Grain, Food, Lye, Salt, and Gunpowder units he has. If this number is more than the number of containers held he must lose the difference.&#10;&#10;11.  Happiness Phase&#10;-    Gain 2D6 Happiness. Gain or lose happiness dependant on conditions within the settlement.&#10;&#10;12.  End Phase&#10;-    Ensure all counters and tokens are correctly placed, and no phases or players were skipped.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 years (20 turns).  The Player with the most awards at the end of the game wins.  There are 5 awards: &#10;-    Population Award: Most Folk&#10;-    Happiness Award: Most Happiness&#10;-    Builder Award: Most Structures + Plots&#10;-    Prosperity Award: Most Money&#10;-    Hoarder Award: Most Grain + Livestock + Food&#10;&#10;",

Most soldiers provide 1 to 3 skills (from a total of 18). &#10;-    Aid Deck - these are help and friends you acquire during the game.  Most aid cards provide 1 to 2 skills. &#10;-    Mission Deck - this is the one main objective you are trying to achieve in the last game turn. Most missions require 4 specific skills to complete. &#10;-    Encounter Deck - these are the foes and difficulties you encounter along the way.

    "Description": "A card game based on the TV series Arrow.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 2 decks: Arrow Deck (green cards) and Villain Deck (pink cards).  As the game progresses, players will create their own personal hero decks composed of Arrow (green) cards they have previously played.&#10;&#10;Each card has a power level. Green cards range from 1 to 4. Pink cards range from 1 to 7.  Certain Green cards will also get extra power depending on their text.  Each card will also have usually 2 or more traits: Criminal, Guns, Archer, Petty, Brawler, Drugs, Psycho, Police, Tech, Government, Organization, Money, Political, Skill, Equipment, Action, Arrow, Romance, Ally, Friendship, Family.&#10;&#10;Each round has 6 phases, with players taking it turns to act first each round:&#10;&#10;1.   Foundry Phase&#10;-    At the beginning of each round flip over the top 3X cards from the Arrow Deck and place them face up in a row (Foundry Row). X = the number of players.&#10;&#10;2.   Starling Phase&#10;-    At the beginning of each round flip over the top 2X cards from the Villain Deck and place them face up in a row (Starling Row).  When you flip over a minor card (power of 1 or 2) flip over another card and stack the minor card with it. The stack counts as a single card on the Starling Row, but has the combined power of all of the cards in the stack. (The stack may contain several minor cards under the major card (power 3 or higher)).&#10;&#10;3.   Hero Phase&#10;-    Starting with the round leader each player picks one card from the Foundry Row and puts it into their hand. This continues until each player has picked 3 cards. If you pick a card that says draw 1 immediately draw one card from the Arrow Deck and put it in your hand. If the drawn card also says draw 1 then draw again and so on. If the Arrow Deck is used up draw 3 cards from your Hero Deck instead. At the end of the phase the lead player passes to the player on his left.&#10;&#10;4.   Capture Phase&#10;-    Starting with the (new) lead player, each player captures one or more cards (or stacks of cards) from the Starling Row and puts them into their Victory Pile. The total power of the pink cards you capture must be equal to or exceeded by the total power of the green cards you picked/drew this turn.&#10;&#10;5.   Bonus Phase&#10;-    Put a victory token in your victory pile if you have played in capture phase 2 or more skill cards, 2 or more money cards, 2 characters with a romantic relationship or 2 characters with a family relationship&#10;&#10;6.   Recovery Phase&#10;-    Place all green cards you played this turn into your Hero Deck discard pile.  Any Villain card not captured remains in play.&#10;&#10;Each player has his own victory pile. During the course of the game players will acquire victory tokens and villain cards which they will keep in their victory pile.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the villain cards are captured. Players add up the value of all the cards and tokens in their Victory Pile. Each villain card is worth victory points equal to its power rating.  2 extra victory points are gained for each Super Villain captured. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

These components simply replace their plastic equivalents, with the arms, heads and armoured shoulder pads giving you that authentic Orcland Raiders look with a minimum of fuss.&#10;&#10;There are also 2 coins and 2 markers included. In all, the kit comes as 76 components &ndash; 40 plastic, 36 resin &ndash; and includes 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases.&#10;&#10;",

Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &quot;Silver Medal&quot;).&#10;&#10;Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The &quot;explainer&quot; must change every turn. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the word that is written on card by using sentences to describe the word. For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game for 2-4+ players based on the TV show Agents of Shield.&#10;&#10;There are 2 decks:  the SHIELD Deck and the PLOT Deck.  All cards have a numerical level and most cards have one or more traits (Combat, Leadership, Support, Espionage, Computers, Engineering, Biochem).&#10;&#10;Flip over the top 5 cards of the PLOT Deck. These are called the revealed plots.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 phases:&#10;&#10;1.    Recruit Phase&#10;-     A player fills his hand to 7 cards from the SHIELD deck.&#10;&#10;2.    Action Phase&#10;-     A player may reveal one card from his hand (do not discard it) and get one special benefit from it dependant on its trait (e.g. If it is a Spy card, look at an opponent&rsquo;s hand and steal any 1 card)&#10;&#10;3.    Investigation Phase&#10;-     Play (discard) SHIELD cards from your hand with a total level matching or exceeding the level of a target revealed PLOT card. The SHIELD cards must also have traits that at minimum match the traits of the target PLOT card.  If this is done the PLOT card is captured and put into the player&rsquo;s victory pile. If possible, you may capture multiple revealed PLOT cards in a single turn. Every time a revealed PLOT card is captured immediately flip over another one from the top of the PLOT Deck so that there are always 5 revealed PLOT cards available.&#10;&#10;4.    Recovery Phase&#10;-     You may discard up to 2 SHIELD cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all PLOT cards have been captured. The winner is the player who has the greatest number of PLOT cards in his victory pile when the game ends.  If tied the player with the most levels worth of PLOT cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Chiyawa is a casual game where players who assume to be Farmers seek to feed their animals. The game is played by rolling a dice and then moving to feed your own animal with the grass thus the origin of the name CHIYAWA (which means GRASS in Hausa Language).&#10;&#10;Player: 2-4 players&#10;&#10;Time: 15 minutes average&#10;&#10;Content:&#10;&#10;I Game board&#10;40 Playing Token&#10;1 dice&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;1.    Players set their animal pen (each player has 10 animals which is signified by the same colour)&#10;2.    Players start the game by rolling the dice (any player can start the game)&#10;3.    Rolling 6 or 3 on the dice allows you bring your animal o the GATE. When players roll a 6, they play again. The difference between 6 and 3 is that, rolling a 6 allows you to roll the dice again while 3 doesn&rsquo;t.&#10;4.    Once animals are brought to the gate, any number rolled can move them on the board either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. They can also move forward and backwards. However, animals will move towards one direction at each turn. For instance, if a player rolls a 4, if they choose to move vertically, they cannot change direction until their next run.&#10;5.    Players can bring in as much animals to the gate as they want till there is no animal to bring as long as they are getting 6 and 3 or they can decided to move the animal already at the gate.&#10;&#10;Moving on the board&#10;&#10;1.    Players can move forward or backward&#10;2.    Players can move vertically, diagonally, horizontally but can&rsquo;t combine them at once in a turn. If player starts moving vertically, they have to finish it.&#10;&#10;Eating Grass&#10;&#10;Once any animal is eating grass (when an animal is on a grass box), it is considered that the space/grass is gone in the game and so will not be counted anymore. This means that when any player is moving their animal, they MUST JUMP the space that has another animal on it to the next available space in that direction.&#10;&#10;Water&#10;&#10;The water on the board is a bonus attraction. Once on it, it simply means to move one step immediately to any direction.&#10;&#10;Balance of SIX (6)&#10;&#10;If all your animals are in play (that means there are no more animal in your pen) or at the gate and you roll a 6, it means you would have to withdraw an animal that is not already eating grass back to the pen.&#10;&#10;End of game&#10;&#10;The game ends when any players finish feeding their animals.&#10;&#10;To Win&#10;&#10;The first farmer (player) to get all their animals to feed (eat grass) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
