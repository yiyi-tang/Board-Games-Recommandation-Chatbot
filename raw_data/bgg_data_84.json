    "Description": "COGZ is a mad scientist strategy board game set in the steampunk era, where someone has broken the mad professor&rsquo;s chromatic cogtraption!&#10; You are a cognizant cogineer trying to repair the broken cogtraption before the professor returns. The other cogineers all seem to think they have the superior cognition needed to rebuild the chromatic device. It&rsquo;s time to prove you are the true cogineer genius!&#10;Hurry!

As long as the segment is different, cogineers gain cognition (game points) for doing so. When a mechanism is repaired fully it can no longer be modified by the other cogineers who all have their own agenda for repairs. There is bonus cognition and bonus turns to be awarded for clever repairs as well.&#10;&#10;COGZ is a very simple game though it hides a huge amount of strategic depth which is normally discovered as cogineers gain experience.

    "Description": "The year is 1979, and the U.S. government has just deregulated the airline industry, opening it to competition in terms of fares, routes, and the airline companies themselves. You represent a new airline that's trying to set up business in the U.S., but you have an entire country open to you, so where will you set up shop and how can you profit more than the other newcomers to ensure that you survive?&#10;&#10;In Blue Skies, the game board presents players with thirty airports in thirty cities. Each airport has four gates, with you using 2-4 gates depending on the number of players. To set up, draw airport demand cards from the deck to seed airports with passengers. Whenever you place passengers on the board, draw from a bag that initially contains 100 red cubes and 25 green cubes; for each airport, continue drawing until you draw a red cube, then redistribute passengers at the open gates of that airport as evenly as possible.&#10;&#10;(Note that at most the first five airports drawn will have an open gate, and even those will start with only one open gate run by a local airline. All of the other passengers are just bunched up at the gate waiting for you to serve them!)&#10;&#10;Each player starts with three demand cards in hand, and they take turns choosing two gates with a purchase price of at most 6. Players adjust their income from 0, with their income being set to equal the number of passengers now waiting at their gates, then the game begins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player in turn buys new gates at airports of their choice, spending at most 6 points and adding any unspent points to their score. You can buy out a local airline, set up gates in new cities, or purchase multiple gates in the same airport to try to dominate that area.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then plays a demand card from their hand, drawing passengers form the bag to place one or more passengers at that location. Then demand cards equal to the number of players are drawn, and more passengers are ahead to those airports. The game board lists the number of cards for each airport, so you somewhat know the odds of where passengers might arrive.&#10;&#10;Players adjust their income to account for the opening of new gates, the redistribution of existing passengers, and the arrival of new passengers, then they add their income to their score. If a player now has at least 100 points or has placed their twentieth and final gate, the game ends immediately; otherwise, you add a local airline gate to each airport with passengers but no open gates, pass the first player marker, then start a new round.&#10;&#10;At game's end, score the seven regions of the United States based on the player's dominance of those regions. Each airport has a scoring value, e.g., ORD is worth 4, and each gate you have in Chicago is worth 4 for determining dominance in both the Midwest region and the Central region. (ORD is one of four airports in two regions, with the others being JFK, LAX, and DFW.) If you have the most dominance in the Central region, you score 13 points, whereas second place is worth only 6 points. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

These include fierce tank battles and infantry actions, including the failed drive of Jochen Peiper's battle group toward the Meuse River, 3rd Armored Division's destruction of 2nd SS Panzer Division, the American stand along Elsenborn Ridge and the collapse of the 106th Infantry Division.&#10;&#10;Pieces include American paratroopers, German Tiger II tanks, American P47 fighter-bombers, German &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; rocket launchers, and much more. Both German regular army and Waffen SS troops are present. There are four semi-rigid mapboards, created by artist Guy Riessen.&#10;&#10;The 2015 printing of Elsenborn Ridge sports a new cover, and includes the Panzer Grenadier Fourth Edition rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the glow of the rays of the orange giant, an interplanetary clash of two empires is approaching...&#10;&#10;In Aldebaran Duel, you are the leader of a space fleet with which you want to control as much of a newly available planetary system as possible. Over three epochs, you will discover new planets, populate them, use their mineral wealth to build spaceships, and try to gain superiority over your opponent.&#10;&#10;During the game, you obtain cards that represent planets, shuttles, mining stations, and colonized parts of planets. Planet building is one of the game's key mechanisms, and using it correctly can be a crucial winning strategy. By building a fleet of merchant, diplomatic, and battle ships, you gain influence in the explored universe &mdash; and in the laboratories, your scientists might discover new technologies that can turn the duel in your favor at the right moment.&#10;&#10;At the same time, however, you can &mdash; and must! &mdash; use cards as raw materials to build your empire, so during the game you are always considering how to use them most effectively. Is it better to play out the card &mdash; or pay with it? Laying out the right combinations of cards will allow you to have better and more varied options in subsequent turns. Whoever builds the best functioning new civilization after three epochs wins.&#10;&#10;Aldebaran Duel includes a variant for solo play.&#10;&#10;",

But Heading Forward isn't about how you got here. It's about what happens next.&#10;&#10;In this unusual solitaire game, you will take on the role of someone going through rehabilitation. To win, you must relearn and develop skills, achieving goals in at least three different areas in the time you've been allotted by your insurance company. Fail to do so, and they will discontinue payment, resulting in your loss.&#10;&#10;Skills are developed by rotating and switching out cards, upgrading in sequence from weak Level 1 skills to powerful Level 4 skills. To do so, you'll need to carefully manage your emotional and physical energy (&quot;spoons&quot;) as well as other resources. But lurking in the deck is the memory of your trauma &ndash; the trigger card. It's a hard road ahead of you &ndash; even the simplest things feel so impossible at first. But as you stubbornly push forward, you'll slowly regain the skills you'll need to take on the bigger challenges ahead of you.&#10;&#10;Based on designer John du Bois's own recovery, Heading Forward is a stunning and expressive example of what board games can do and can be.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

During the construction period numerous prestigious architects, master craftsmen, and apprentices came from all over Europe motivated by financial rewards, prestige, and, importantly, the pursuit of knowledge.&#10;&#10;In Moesteiro, players are architects in charge of teams of workers and master artisans and they compete for the glory of becoming the most prolific and important architect of their time.&#10;&#10;The game is played over five rounds.

After you choose your character, you play the game with a corresponding Character Deck.&#10;&#10;In the UNO Ultimate card game you match colors, numbers, and symbols just like classic UNO.  Each Character Deck has special power and Wild Cards designed just for that character.  There's also a Danger Deck with &quot;Event&quot; cards and &quot;Enemy&quot; cards that can really change the game! Like any great superhero battle, there's gonna be a lot of powers and stuff lying around, so buckle-up and pay attention!&#10;&#10;There are also two ways to win!  Get rid of all your cards in your hand or be the last player standing with cards in their character deck.&#10;&#10;Collectible foil cards in each box.&#10;&#10;Don't forget to call Uno when down to 1 card!&#10;&#10;Characters:&#10;Black Panther&#10;&#10;        Black Panther is in it for the long haul by trying to stay in the game as long as possible. As Black Panther's ability comes from defeating Enemies, you will want to hold onto your Danger Icon Cards and play them when you have cards in your Burn Pile. You might not always get an Enemy when you play them but you don't want to waste the chance at recovering cards early on by defeating Enemies.&#10;&#10;&#10;Captain Marvel&#10;&#10;        Captain Marvel is always looking for the right strategy to do the most damage. With her character power letting her always have the right color to play, use it to never miss your plays. Change the color when you can to prevent other players from being able to defeat their attacking Enemies. Sometimes you may want to use her power to change the color to play a powerful Action Card such as Skip or Draw Two.&#10;&#10;&#10;Iron Man&#10;&#10;        Iron Man always likes to be on the attack. Iron Man wants to burn as many cards as possible from the other players decks, and try to eliminate multiple players at a time to win. So, you want to play as many Danger Icon Cards as you can to keep the pressure on. Keep in mind that every time you play a Danger Icon Card you will have to flip a Danger Card.&#10;&#10;&#10;Thor&#10;&#10;        Thor is great at attacking other players and trying to eliminate them one at a time. When playing as Thor you want to decide either to focus on one player at a time or spread out your Wild Cards to affect all players. That means when you play your Wild Cards you want to make sure you are using them to change the active color o get the most effectiveness out of your character power.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Iron and Oak is game of ship-to-ship combat set during the American Civil War. As a tactical representation of naval warfare, each of the ships is accurately modeled for offensive capability including gunnery, ramming and spar torpedoes; for defensive capability including damage and five distinct armored or wooden hit locations; and for maneuverability, crew size and draft.&#10;&#10;You command 70 famous ships of the era, including the Union: Onondaga, Tecumseh, Winnebago, Monitor, Osage, Minnesota, Brooklyn, Hartford, Essex, Carondolet, Kearsarge, Ossipee, Queen of the West, Iroquois, Spuyten Duyvil; and the Confederate: Tennessee, Virginia, Atlanta, Palmetto State, Arkansas, Albemarle, Alabama, Florida, General Beauregard, Sumter; and many more.&#10;&#10;Many of the 14 scenarios, in this easy-to-learn game, are playable in an hour or less. Included are 13 historical and 1 hypothetical engagements featuring Hampton Roads, Mobile Bay, Trent&rsquo;s Reach, Wassaw Sound, the duel between Alabama and the Kearsarge, and the saga of the Arkansas, which may be played as three individual scenarios or as a linked mini-campaign.&#10;&#10;In addition, forts bristling with guns make their appearance to challenge the will of the ship captains. If that was not enough to heat things up, scenario based optional rules add a few interesting &lsquo;what if&rsquo; situations to expand on play.&#10;&#10;If you are interested in commanding your own fleet, Iron and Oak includes a standalone campaign module where player selected forces fight it out in the many rivers, bays, inlets and costal areas. The campaign game recreates the brown water actions, typical of the period, in a series of randomly generated battles. As play progresses, the players do not know the exact length of the campaign or the specific mix of the battles. Players must not only manage the unfolding battles, but must also strategically allocate resources and repair and refits their ships. The 16 card Navy Yard deck is used to plot a course through and influence the challenges of the campaigns.&#10;&#10;Two or more players battle it out on an 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map that features an area movement grid. This simple approach controls ship movement as well as all combat action. Gone are the long periods of inaction, typical of ACW tactical naval games, as these early steam-era ships struggled to maneuver into battle.&#10;&#10;This innovative game system places the emphasis on quick action and tactical decision making. The 50 Action Cards are used to assist and enhance play, not drive it. Each time you battle it out, whether in a scenario or campaign game, the action unfolds in a very different manner. Do you wish to employ hot shot or incendiary shells? Is now the best time to rapid fire or is it wise to maneuver and ram? Should you allocate part of the crew as a repair party? Is that enemy ship going to maneuver into your torpedo (mine) field? These and many other possibilities exist through the play of the action cards. Or, you may decide to not play any action cards at all and just maneuver and shoot. You control how and when the action will unfold.&#10;&#10;At its core Iron and Oak is a naval simulation. It accurately models the close-range slugging matches typical of the period. You have the opportunity to play out the various battles to their conclusion. Will history repeat itself, or will a new account be written? Will the Monitor&rsquo;s 11&rdquo; Dahlgren smoothbores blast through Virginia&rsquo;s armor plating or will their battle again end in a stalemate? Will the powerful Tennessee win out against Admiral David Farragut&rsquo;s Union fleet or again fall to his superior numbers? Will the Atlanta defeat the two Union monitors in kind or again slip aground and strike her colors. This time, you get to determine the outcome. You are not bound by history&rsquo;s stories.&#10;&#10;",

During that crucial night, amid the flashes of German anti-aircraft fire, many paratroopers were scattered a long way from their drop zones as their planes were either destroyed or unable to reach their drop points. You are among those troopers. But as luck turns out, the winds have blown you directly where you are needed the most! As you were descending, you discovered a terrible sight: the Germans have installed two 24.0 cm Guns in a hidden bunker. Those cannons are set to fire at the beaches of Normandy. You alone can stop them from killing the Allied troops!&#10;&#10;During your jump, you lost your equipment bag which contained all your necessary gear. The only thing you have left is your trusted Colt .45 and your ingenuity. As you fold your parachute, you look at your watch: it&rsquo;s 0700, the landings are starting. Will you have time to sabotage the German battery before they decimate your comrades? All you need are some explosives...&#10;&#10;Airborne In Your Pocket: Free Trial Version can be simple (Basic Game) or more involving (Scenarios &amp; Campaigns), as the player wishes. Advanced Game and Scenarios allow you to play as American, British, Canadian, French and even German soldiers.

To make the game duration shorter, a change was made on the setup of the game.&#10;&#10;12 cards are always removed from the deck for each game. 36 cards are evenly distributed in piles according to number of players.&#10;&#10;The rest of the rules are the same.&#10;Game play and turn sequence are the same as before.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "DESCRIPTION: Darkrock Ventures is a worker placement game about mining and exporting in a hostile outer space. Players will be controlling a mining company working in harsh conditions to acquire the most credits.&#10;&#10;GENERAL INFO: A euro game for 1-5 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;THEME: Science Fiction. Space is a hostile environment with a known alien presence. Resources are scarce and it is commonplace for companies to mine asteroids to acquire them. It is known that aliens raid these asteroids and therefore mining companies are geared accordingly in preparation of being attacked. Lives are lost in this line of work daily, but if you run a good crew you can make it out alive and rich!&#10;&#10;HOOK: Richly thematic euro incorporating dice and dice manipulation, with worker placement, resource farming and exporting.&#10;&#10;WINNING CONDITION: Highest Credits when the end of the game is triggered. Credits are acquired primarily from exporting minerals mined from the asteroid.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS: A round begins with rolling a set of Power Dice, these are community dice that players will use in order to successfully mine the asteroid. Players then take turns placing workers throughout different space stations and on a mineral rich asteroid.&#10;&#10;After all the workers have been placed a third and more volatile Power Die is rolled. A player starts his/her turn by rolling his/her Rig Dice, these represent the a power element of his/her mining equipment that is to be paired with the community Power Dice in order to successfully mine resources from the asteroid. Then he/she resolves all his/her workers. As soon as players begin exporting minerals, hostile alien ships begin patrolling and will attack every round making it more difficult to resolve all the workers successfully.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will be increasing their worker count, gaining and spending credits (which are the victory points), gaining additional Rig Dice and acquiring explosive Neutronium bombs to protect them from the alien attacks.&#10;&#10;When 3 of the 6 resource nodes on the asteroid are void of minerals the end of the game is triggered. The round is finished and the player with the most credits wins the game.&#10;&#10;Darkrock Ventures will also include special 2-player game rules, as well as a Solo/Co-Operative variant.&#10;&#10;",

During the game you will collectively explore the islet to collect materials, while competing to create the best nests to spawn, thus guaranteeing the continuity of your species. On each of your turns you choose to either explore the islet to receive resources, or position yourself to create the perfect nests in which to spawn your precious eggs.&#10;&#10;This way, together - as much as against one another - you&rsquo;ll build a tropical islet with its different biomes, and whoever spawns all their eggs on the islet first will be the winner.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Whoever has touched an egg most recently starts the game.&#10;&#10;Starting with that player, take turns clockwise. On your turn, you must take either an EXPLORE or a MOVE action.&#10;&#10;When you EXPLORE, EXPLORE you lay 1 to 4 tiles from your reserve, expanding the islet, and receive resources in return.&#10;&#10;When you MOVE, you can ADVANCE your pawn and SPAWN (lay&#10;eggs), as many times as you want and in any order and combination, as long as you can pay the required resource cost.&#10;&#10;The end of the game can be triggered in 2 different ways:&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; When a player SPAWNS their last egg, their turn ends as normal and then the current round ends (so that everyone plays the same number of turns).&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; When a player takes the last islet tile from the bag, the current round ends and a new round is played (so that everyone plays the same number of turns).&#10;&#10;In any case, the player who spawned the most eggs wins the game.&#10;&#10;ISLET in the 2nd game in the series that started with Coral.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flash Duel: Second Edition is a simple, fast card game that simulates sparring matches amongst Fantasy Strike characters. The fight takes place on an 18-space linear track, and it's all about striking from the right distance and getting to the right range. This edition contains 20 characters, each with their own special abilities, allowing for hundreds of different matchups.&#10;&#10;There are seven different modes of play:&#10;&#10;     Simple mode, for first time players&#10;     Full mode, using the character abilities&#10;     Custom Clockwork: build your own character!&#10;     2v2 team battle&#10;     Solo play, with 10 achievements to earn&#10;     Raid on Deathstrike Dragon: 2, 3, or 4 players cooperate against a powerful 5th player controlling the Dragon&#10;     Betrayal at Raid on Deathstrike Dragon: A more difficult raid where one player is secretly on the Dragon's side!&#10;&#10;&#10;Changes to the Revised Second Edition:&#10;&#10;--All game modes now use a 40 card deck, rather than different modes using 25, 40, and 50, and the game will come with 40 numbered cards rather than 50. In all modes other than the Dragon Raid, you start each round by shuffling the deck and setting aside 5 cards without looking at them. In 2v2, you reshuffle the discard pile twice when it runs out before reaching timout. In the Dragon Raid, you reshuffle it 1, 2, and 3 times for 2, 3, and 4 mortals, respectively. Overall, rounds last longer in all modes.&#10;&#10;--Last-hits is no longer a mechanic in the game. At timeout, you just check who advanced farthest. This is simpler and turns out to have better dynamics by forcing action to take place during the actual gameplay part of the game.&#10;&#10;--Whenever a round ends in a tie, now both sides get a win token.&#10;&#10;--A new rulebook makes the game less mathy and more about improv and bluffing. Players don't know the exact contents of the deck anymore, so they can't compute things so completely. Also, players now draw more cards each round, so they have more chance to win before timeout.&#10;&#10;Part of the Fantasy Strike universe.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Napoleon Against Russia - From Smolensk to Moscow and beyond August 16-October 24, 1812 contains five battles from the critical phase of the Campaign, when the Russian Army finally gave Napoleon the decisive battles he so greatly desired. His first maneuver starts out well&mdash;with the French poised to slip into Smolensk behind the Russians. However, the opportunity to bring an end to the campaign will remain unfulfilled. After that, Moscow became the default destination of the Grande Arm&eacute;e. As Napoleon stated, &ldquo;The wine has been poured and must now be drunk.&quot;&#10;&#10;Napoleon against Russia is one of the games from OSG's THE LIBRARY OF NAPOLEONIC BATTLES series. Details on the series are below, as all the games share a common rules set and game system.&#10;&#10;BATTLES SIMULATED:&#10;&#10;     Smolensk, A Battle Postponed, 16-17 August&#10;&#10;&#10;When he recognized that the enemy had withdrawn into the city, the Emperor&rsquo;s plan was stymied. He either had to seize Smolensk on the 16th, without waiting for the arrival of the entire army, or cross the Dneiper River east of Smolensk. Instead he waited for the Russians to make a mistake, and gave them time to pull out along the Moscow road.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Valutino, Rearguard Action, 18 August&#10;&#10;&#10;When the Russians did give him an opportunity to catch the First Army disunited after a confused night march, Napoleon had already returned to Smolensk, expecting nothing more than a rearguard action. Hence he was not on the scene to coordinate the actions of his Marshals, who, left to themselves, were unable to crystallize a victory out of the opportunity.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Shevardino, Fight for the Redoubt, 5-6 September &#10;&#10;&#10;The preliminary battle opened with the arrival of the French cavalry who immediate attacked Konovnytsyn. On the 6th, more French forces arrived including the IV Corps and the Polish Corps. The French captured the Shevardino redoubt at a cost of 4,000&ndash;5,000 French and 6,000 Russian casualties.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Borodino, The Russian Army is Saved, 7-8 September &#10;&#10;&#10;In the climactic battle, Napoleon has been criticized for making a simple frontal assault. With our large map the French player will have plenty of maneuver room to try and outflank the Russian army to the south, or even to the north. He will also have the option of attacking the north flank as Kutusov expected.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Maloyaroslavets, The Retreat Goes Awry, 23-24 October&#10;&#10;&#10;Trying to secure a bridge over the Luzha River, the Italians of Eugene's IV Corps lost about 5,000 and the Russians about 6,000 men as the town changed hands eight times. Except for Davout, all the French marshals advocated a return to the main highway to Smolensk, through the depleted zone, a detour that doomed the Army.&#10;&#10;DESCRIPTION&#10;Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: &#10;&#10;     480 meters per hex, &#10;     1 hour per turn, &#10;     400-800 men per strength point. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns. The Full campaign links the individual battles.&#10;&#10;(Text from the OSG pages)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A war game that fits in the pocket! In Pocket Battles: Confederacy vs Union &mdash; the fourth title in the Pocket Battles series &mdash; tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army; just determine the size of the battle, then create your own army from a pool of existing troops. Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits that can affect their whole unit or army.&#10;&#10;The basic rules of the game are fairly simple: Two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide at the start of the game how many points they will give to their armies, which then determines how many points you must defeat to win.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you choose which faction of your army to send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just one token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round costs you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus one. (If one token is on a unit, it costs two additional tokens to activate it again; with three tokens on the unit, it costs four additional tokens, etc.)&#10;&#10;After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy your units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment costs no Order tokens. The battle ends when one army has eliminated at least half of the points in the opposing army.&#10;&#10;",

The set-up includes a throne room and various gates to be passed through (provided one finds the right keys).&#10;&#10;Heroica: Fortaan can be combined with any or all other games in the Series: LEGO Heroica series.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, other hosts may find it advantageous to invite a rejected guest inside just to collect their accumulated Regrets for later use.&#10;&#10;Hosts may also choose to ignore the competition for guests and instead try to earn the favor of&nbsp;the Belle of the Ball herself, whose charms&nbsp;can make or break any party.&#10;&#10;",

Play character cards, watch out for opponents' actions...and may the Force be with you!&#10;&#10;The game is played with only 17 cards. At the beginning of the game, one card is removed at random, then each player draws a card. The game is played in several rounds. Each round represents a stage in the escape plan. At the end of each round, one of the players will get closer to the plan's realization and receive a special token. As soon as someone's got enough tokens, that player will rescue Leia and take her to the Rebel Base.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws a card, then plays one of the two cards in hand. Each character card &mdash; Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, Han Solo, Stormtrooper and Boba Fett &mdash; has a special ability. In this version of Love Letter, Boba Fett functions the same as a Stormtrooper, with each having the Guard ability of naming a player's role and eliminating them from the round, but with Boba Fett if you miss on the first shot, you can try again. Miss a second time, though, and you're out of the round yourself!&#10;&#10;The other difference to regular Love Letter is that the Baron ability is split between the two droids, but with R2-D2, the highest value is out of the round.&#10;&#10;",

Both sides were poised for a battle which would be the largest of the war.&#10;&#10;Although the battle clearly was a Prussian success the victory fell short because Prague succesfully withstood the enemy siege until June 16 when Marshal Daun's Austrian relief force dealt Frederick his first defeat on the rolling hills near Kolin.&#10;&#10;The map and time scale: 100 yards per hex and 20 minute game turns.

Now the cardboard tiles on the board get revealed and you score each of your disks by totalling the values of the cardboard tiles that are orthogonal to your disks. Depending on the tiles the value can be positive, neutral or negative. Your score is the sum of values of all your disks.&#10;The player with the most positive points wins.&#10;&#10;From the box&#10;According to legend, Osiris brought agriculture to Egypt, the foundation of its culture.

    "Description": "Slither is a dynamic square board connection game in which players move and place stones.&#10;&#10;Objective: White's objective is to connect the right and left hand sides of the board while black aims to connect the top and bottom edges.&#10;&#10;Materials: A square board of any size and a supply of stones in two colors.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Starting with Black, players on their turn either place a stone on any empty cell or place a stone and move another  stone already on the board by a chess king's move. The only condition on these actions is that, at the conclusion of the turn no two stones of the same color can be diagonally adjacent unless they are orthogonally connected by a common like-colored stone.&#10;&#10;Forced Passing: In the very unlikely event that a player will not have a legal move on his turn, he must pass his turn. passing is otherwise strictly prohibited.&#10;&#10;pie rule: The pie rule has questionable efficacy in classic Slither, as any stone can be translated to the middle of the board without even a loss of tempo. This rule states that&#10;&#10;No draws are possible in Slither.&#10;&#10;Advanced Slither: Seasoned Slither players may want to upgrade to Advanced Slither, which is a variant from late 2018 which aims to resolve issues generated by the perhaps excessive mobility of stones, chiefly making the pie rule less superfluous. The only additional rule in advanced Slither is that a stone may only move if its part of a contiguous orthogonal group consisting of stones of both colors. In addition to making pie more effective and foiling opening templates, this rule makes the game both more static, and therefore strategic and more tactically rich. speaking as its designer, I would have released this version of Slither if I had discovered its relative merits in 2010, despite how this may have effected Slither's reputation.&#10;&#10;",

It covers the bold&mdash;some would say &ldquo;foolhardy&rdquo;&mdash;dash by Army Group South to take Rostov in the late fall of 1941. Amazingly, the attack succeeded, resulting, however, in the Germans being isolated at the end of a logistical shoestring. The regrouping Red Army, stung from a long series of defeats, saw this as the perfect opportunity to launch its first coordinated attack of the war, thus paving the way for the Moscow Counteroffensive just a few weeks later.&#10;&#10;Rostov &lsquo;41 covers all this swirling mobile action in turns representing 3 to 6 days and at a map scale of 2.5 miles per hex. Units are battalions to divisions. Low counter density and a wide-open map bring all the action and possibilities to light in some wild gameplay.&#10;&#10;Both players will find themselves under the gun.&#10;&#10;The German player must use his limited and overstretched forces to pull off a brilliant coup. Playing it safe won&rsquo;t cut it; speed is all-important. With a lot of skill and a bit of luck, Rostov will be yours. Then you&rsquo;ll have to pay the piper.&#10;&#10;The Russian player must conserve his forces as the German rapier expends its energy. While the capture of Rostov requires a lot of skill and some luck on the German part, don&rsquo;t begin to think your job is easy. Derailing that German drive can easily consume precious forces needed for your main effort: turning the tables on the Germans and taking back great swaths of the Motherland.&#10;&#10;Rostov &rsquo;41 components:&#10;&bull; Standard Combat Series (SCS) rulebook (version 1.8) &#10;&bull; Rostov &lsquo;41 game-specific rulebook&#10;&bull; one full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; map&#10;&bull; 280 counters&#10;&bull; 4 scenarios:&#10;  Fritz on the Don (Campaign), 14 Turns&#10;  Fritz on the Mius, 4 turns&#10;  Fritz Grabs Rostov, 7 turns&#10;  Soviet Counterpunch, 4 turns&#10;&bull; box and dice&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Its detection and interception mechanisms allow for simultaneous actions and reactions from both sides. Having to constantly monitor the battlefield minimizes player downtime and maximizes their ability to recreate a very fluid &ldquo;What if&ldquo; representation of a Cold War gone hot. The mechanisms can seem complex at first, but will soon become second nature.&#10;&#10;The rules that make Red Strike so interactive, also make it perfect for team play. Players can divide responsibilities between air, ground and possibly naval forces. The ground forces could be split by army/front or corps.&#10;&#10;The crucial naval/air war over the North Atlantic can be played either as a standalone game, or as part of the Campaign Scenarios. As would have happened historically, its impact on the battlefield in Germany can be decisive; the interception and sinking of convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements making the difference between success and failure.&#10;&#10;Awards and Honors&#10;&#10;&quot;Red Strike&quot; wins 2023 Charles S.

    "Description": "In the Burg Theater in Vienna 1788, secret information is passed on unnoticed, and players of echoes: Die Violine will need to decode a secret code in order to be able to solve the case.&#10;&#10;echoes is a co-operative audio mystery game. Using the free app, players listen to mysterious noises and voices that are connected to the playing material. Together they look for hints in the sound bites to bring the story parts in order and solve the case.&#10;&#10;In more detail, your task is to assemble the 24 parts of the story in the right order; each part is represented by an object &mdash; either a game board or a card &mdash; and its associated echo. The entire story is divided into six chapters, with each chapter being represented by a game board. By scanning the objects with the app, you'll hear the echo connected with each object, and by using conversations and noises in the echo, you try to figure out which three object cards are associated with a chapter and in which order they should be placed. If you're not correct, the app will inform you which cards are incorrect or in the wrong place; if you are correct, you can listen to the entire chapter all at once &mdash; and you should since new, additional hints can then be heard.&#10;&#10;The objects themselves also provide you with clues from time to time, so neglect no details.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On 22 June 1941, under the codeword &quot;Dortmund&quot;, the German Wehrmacht and other Axis powers started the invasion of the Soviet Union. Over 150 divisions &ndash; ca. 3,6 million troops &ndash; of the Axis invaded the USSR along a front of 2,900 km. In addition to troops, Barbarossa involved 600,000 motor vehicles, 750,000 horses, 3350 tanks, 7300 guns, and nearly 2000 planes &ndash; the largest invasion in the history of warfare.&#10;&#10;BLOCKS IN THE EAST is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the strategic level. It recalls the most decisive battles fought on the Eastern Front from the beginning of the invasion in summer 1941 until the dramatic end in Berlin in spring 1945. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for two or four players: one/two control the Soviet Red Army and the other one/two control Germany and the other Axis powers. In a threesome, one player controls one faction while the other two players control the other faction. The game is furthermore suitable for solitary play: the single player just controls both sides. In this case, a play with Fog of War is suggested.&#10;&#10;Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over an astonishing 125x87 cm (49&quot;x34&quot;) full laminated multicolor mapboard, the only paper component in the box is the rules manual. In total, more than 600 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time:&#10;&bull; The Basic Game Rules introduce the basic concepts of BITE and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.&#10;&bull; The Advanced Game Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for enhanced realism, such as the use of Fuel and the Advanced Production System.&#10;&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Technology Research, Strategic Warfare with the bombing of Germany and U-boat campaigns in the oceans, Amphibious Landings, Airborne Assaults, and more.&#10;&#10;In BLOCKS IN THE EAST, a hexagon is approximately 53 miles (70 km) across, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation (normally corps size) with 300 planes, 300 tanks, or 30,000 men, depending on the unit type, equipment, nationality, etc. The game can be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent) or off (all units are visible).&#10;&#10;Players can compete in the full 1941 Codeword Dortmund Campaign, in one of four six-turn scenarios (&quot;Operation Barbarossa 1941&quot;, &quot;Case Blue - The Drive to Baku 1942&quot;, &quot;Operation Citadel - The Battle of Kursk 1943&quot; and &quot;Bagration Offensive in Summer 1944&quot;), or one of the shorter, easy-to-learn scenarios (&quot;Road to Rostov&quot;, which lasts six turns, or any of these scenarios: &quot;Road to Leningrad&quot;, &quot;Road to Moscow&quot; or &quot;Short Barbarossa&quot;). Each scenario has different victory conditions and length, with a playing time from 1 to 49 turns.&#10;&#10;BLOCKS IN THE EAST can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the West and Blocks in Afrika.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "My First Bohnanza serves as both an introduction to Bohnanza and as a children's game in its own right, with the goal of the game being the same as its parent: Have the most Talers at the end of play.&#10;&#10;As in the original Bohnanza, the game includes multiple types of beans, with each bean having a number on it to indicate how many copies are in the game as well as a &quot;beanometer&quot; at the bottom of the card to show you how many cards of this type you need to harvest in order to collect Talers. My First Bohnanza has simplified beanometers, with four types of beans having only a single exchange value &mdash; e.g., five Gemeine (common) beans get you one Taler &mdash; and six types of beans having two exchange values. Games with the youngest players (or newcomers to the Bohnanza universe) should use the single beanometer cards with the other cards forming a Taler stack.&#10;&#10;To play, each player gets five cards, which they lay in a face-up row, and a beanfield tile that shows spots for two types of beans. On a turn, a player must plant the first (leftmost) card in one of her fields and she can choose to plant a second. Players try to group cards of the same type in the same field, but they can cover beans of different types, if needed. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and either keeps them or trades them (and cards from her hand, if desired) for cards held by other players; all traded cards must be planted. To end her turn, the player draws three cards and adds them to her row.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has the proper number of bean cards in order in one of her fields, she harvests them, placing these cards in the discard pile and collecting a Taler from the stack. If those cards covered beans of another type, she can then start building on those beans again. After going through the deck 1-3 times (depending on the number of players), the game ends and whoever has the most Talers wins.&#10;&#10;Once players have played My First Bohnanza a few times, you can swap the single beanometer cards for the double beanometer cards, which now gives players a choice of when to harvest. Subsequently, you can combine the two decks, which introduces the rule about using one of the bean cards to serve as the Taler (which adjusts the quantity of that type of bean in the deck). With additional plays, you can add in the remaining rules of Bohnanza, such as needing to harvest for no Talers when planting, paying for a third beanfield, keeping your cards in hand, and not being able to harvest a field with only one card.&#10;&#10;",

While they may dominate 6 squads, others may swear their allegiance to the infernal magi. The cave is endless. Battles for territory will forever ensue. The forbidden wizards must raise troops from their species, create Warriors from the weak and shoddy, inspire Command and demand the allegiance of their greatest Warlord. The warrior path begins!&#10;&#10;Warcults is an introduction to a Warrior Path - the first expansion for CAVE EVIL.&#10;&#10;A Warrior path is a way to play Cave Evil. It is a modified Sequence of Play to accommodate players that prefer to play with just a Warlord Character or with both a Warlord and a Necromancer.&#10;&#10;The Warlord is a branch of Necro command and is under the allegiance of a Necromancer. The Necromancer is NOT needed to play!&#10;&#10;A Warlord commands an army and the divisions of command below them.&#10;Apart from WARCULTS features, the game introduces new actions and adjustments to the overall Sequence of Play.&#10;&#10;Victory is dependent on each scenario.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Scotland Yard Master &mdash; a new version of the 1983 Spiel des Jahres-winning Scotland Yard &mdash; one of the players takes on the role of Mr. X. His job is to move from point to point around the map of London by taking taxis, buses or subways. The detectives &ndash; that is, the remaining players acting in concert &ndash; move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X and capture him. The tricky part is that while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is known only intermittently throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Scotland Yard Master includes six additional game elements, four of which are part of a free app for iOS and Android that offers detectives limited tools to locate Mr. X. For example, the detectives can use radio towers to get a rough sense of where Mr. X is located, with the color of the radio waves hinting at whether he's close to each tower. The two-dimensional game board can also be converted to a 3D view, and the detectives can ask witnesses on the buildings whether they've recently seen Mr. X. The app also allows for pass-and-play, with Mr. X having a self-generated PIN so that the detectives can't accidentally discover his location.&#10;&#10;Scotland Yard Master also has new action options for Mr. X: &quot;Helicopter&quot; and &quot;Sabotage&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

The cherry flower is a symbol of vitality called &quot;sakura&quot;.&#10;&#10;The players in Sakura aim to play cards without taking any hands. They have to play two cards each time, one on each side of the Jin-Jang card following the rules, which by default require higher number on the Jin side and lower on the Jang side in the same color. (Alternatively, a player can place the same number in any color.) Also, the players are aided in their success by several characters, who require payment (money). The game ends when everyone has only two cards left in their hand. The player who earns the fewest points wins the favor of the goddess and glory will be theirs until next spring.&#10;&#10;&#10;This edition was later replaced with Sakura Extra Box, which contains previous Kickstarter extras (not exclusive).&#10;&#10;",

Since then a force known as Tenebris has enveloped the seven kingdoms of Telios in darkness. After an endless age of war humanity was on the verge of destruction &mdash; but just as the last light was fading away from the land, when humanity was on the brink of ruin and all seemed lost, hope broke through.&#10;&#10;Three adventurers made their way to the great valley where the ancient city of Lux used to stand. They were drawn by the very stones in the land which seem to call out to them. These stones soon became known as speaking stones as they were able to speak into the very souls of the adventurers, granting them power to push back the Tenebris. Once they arrived they found out they were not the only ones summoned by the stones.&#10;&#10;The Stonebound Saga is a skirmish style card game that offers a variety of elements such as resource management, dice rolling, card positioning and tactical gameplay. The game is for 2 to 6 players played on a large grid-based playmat. Matches take 45 minutes to an hour to complete.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with a group of adventurers who have made their way to the valley to train and prepare for the upcoming battle against Tenebris (Standard play is 3 characters per player). Throughout the game players will use speaking stone cards drawn from a community resource deck in order to perform various abilities in battle.&#10;&#10;The Stonebound Saga is a great mix of unit positioning and strategy requiring each player to carefully plan their turns and manage their resources to achieve victory against their opponent. With a large number of character cards to fit many play styles, each match is always a unique experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The presidential election of 1860 was one of the most critical in the history of the United States. With civil war looming as a near inevitability, the challenge was to find a way forward after years of degenerating political discourse in the increasingly divided American electorate. In the end, after months of contentious campaigning between four (!) major parties and over a dozen smaller ones, the election was won by the Republican dark horse candidate, a little known Illinois politician named Abraham Lincoln who hadn't even been the first choice of his party's senior leadership.&#10;&#10;Divided Republic is a card driven two to four player game representing the last calm before the storm that was to become the American Civil War. Players represent the four major parties (Constitutional Unionists, Northern Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Democrats) and attempt to win the presidency by defeating their opponents with dirty tricks, platform speeches, and the manipulation of key historical events. All the while, President Buchanan interferes, radicals riot, and the country continues the downward spiral toward civil war. If one party wins the election by achieving the necessary 152+ electoral votes, or wins in the case of an electoral tie thrown to the US Congress, history may well change. Nevertheless, there is always the chance that the population of South Carolina will finally explode into open rebellion and secede, ending the game, at which point everyone loses!&#10;&#10;This is a light to medium weight game with intense player interaction, card-driven play, and a play time of about 2-3 hours depending upon how events proceed. There are even a few laughs along the way as the mudslinging between parties heats up. Literally anyone can win - it's not simply a cut and dry Republican victory. This is a different kind of US election game, a game where there are not two, but four parties, set in a period when candidates did not generally campaign for themselves, and run in an era when the Republicans were still liberals and the Democrats were the vanguard of traditional American conservatism.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a very novel take on the old parlor game, Parcheesi or Sorry or even Trouble, that many people remember. Players are trying to get their pawns from their starting position around the board into the safe zone. If a pawn is either landed on or passed over by another player's pawn, the jumped pawn is returned to its starting location. However, players don't simply roll the dice and move in Zap Zerapp. Instead, two dice are rolled and results are announced to the table. Players simultaneously start picking up one of the thirteen little wooden containers and shaking them. Inside the containers are one to thirteen lead pellets. Players are trying to select the container with the highest number of pellets, so long as it doesn't exceed the result of the dice. Once all players have selected their container (the number of pellets are denoted on a sticker on the bottom), players move one-by-one from highest to lowest, assuming their selection allows them to move at all by being lower.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the Funkoverse Strategy Game, you combine your favorite characters and go head-to-head in four exciting game scenarios. Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Jaws 100 is a standalone game that includes the characters Quint and the shark. This set may be combined with others, giving you the ability to assemble the team you want!&#10;&#10;",
