    "Description": "The name Banana Balance pretty much tells you everything you need to know about this game: It involves bananas and balancing.&#10;&#10;Okay, you probably need to know a bit more than that in order to play, so here it goes: Before the game starts, you assemble the banana tree, add four spiky leaves to the top of the wobbly tree, then place a banana at the tip of each leaf. On a turn, a player rolls the special LEGO die, then:&#10;&#10;&bull; On a brown, hangs the monkey on a leaf with a banana, then claims all the bananas from that leaf, taking care not to knock over the tree.&#10;&bull; On a green, adds a new leaf to the tree.&#10;&bull; On a yellow, adds a banana from the stock to any leaf.&#10;&bull; On a green/yellow, does both of the actions above.&#10;&#10;Any time you can't do a yellow or green action, you take a monkey action instead. If no bananas are on the tree, you can steal a banana from an opponent. Knock the monkey out of the tree, and you have to return a banana; knock over the tree or unbalance it so it topples, and you have to return all your bananas, ending the game and giving the win to whoever is the best banana baron. Variants include new ways to move the monkey and a suggestion to take monkey actions with your eyes closed.&#10;&#10;",

The two players place their own stones on the board, one stone per turn. Players are not allowed to pass.&#10;&#10;All placements are to unoccupied cells.  A Friendly Connection is an adjacency between the stones of the same color.

Then, starting with Player 2, players take turns placing a stone which forms exactly one enemy connection and no friendly connections.&#10;&#10;The last player to place a stone wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Odd number grids are not recommended by the designer.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Things they don&rsquo;t teach you in school is definitely not your traditional trivia game with boring questions about who wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories or where the 1996 Summer Olympics were held. Instead, this is a hilarious trivia game with more than 400 unexpected questions and answers you&rsquo;ll never see coming! Loads of laughs and interesting discussions guaranteed!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Players start by choosing one person to keep score (this person will also play). They then take turns drawing cards and reading the questions on the cards aloud. The player sitting to the left of the card drawer chooses to either answer or skip the question. Then the player to their left gets a chance to answer the second question on the card and so forth until all four questions on the card have been asked. Each player gets 1 point for every correct answer, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Napoleon's Grande Arm&eacute;e launched an attack against the Russian army, driving it back from its initial positions but failing to gain a decisive victory. Both armies were exhausted after the battle and the Russians withdrew from the field the following day. Borodino represented the last Russian effort at stopping the French advance on Moscow, which fell a week later. However, the French had no clear way of forcing Czar Alexander to capitulate because the Russian army was not decisively defeated, resulting in the ultimate defeat of the French invasion following the retreat from Moscow in October.&#10;&#10;Two scenarios are provided: a historical scenario (where units are placed as they were actually deployed) and a hypothetical scenario (where players are free to deploy where they wish).&#10;&#10;Victory is solely based on Russian strength losses, the French player must eliminate at least 90 strength points to win.

Get it before it's cool.  It even has a pretentiously  hipster name, since it only includes one die.&#10;&#10;The rules are characteristically evasive but the gist is: there is a six-sided die. Each side of the die represents a category: music, drink, literature, fashion, movies, and food. One player rolls the die and has one minute to declare a factoid concerning the rolled subject. If everyone accepts the factoid as true, then play passes to the left. If someone challenges the factoid, then that player has two minutes to disprove the statement using whatever electronic device is handy. The winner in the challenge scores one point. The winner of the game is declared when that person scores five points. Players will have to provide their own score keeping units and electronic device for research.&#10;&#10;",

As you rise in power, your Nobles acquire Lands and Serfs, you'll add a Wife and Heir to your throne and move slowly toward becoming the most powerful Kingdom in the land. But wait... your opponent works to undo all you've built! You face opposition from his Minions, Magick spells and Armies. You are forced to Wage War with your Generals and Arms to seal your legacy in stone.&#10;&#10;In the end, only one CASTLE can prevail!&#10;&#10;Fast paced and fun, the game is quick to learn but challenging to play. While a session can be over in as little as 30 minutes, aggressive play and thoughtful strategy will keep you on the edge of your seat in game after game!&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing from a deck of 168 cards. As the game progresses, players may decide to try to Block their opponent&rsquo;s next card draw by using the combined values of either Minions/Magick or Champions/Arms. As players gain more cards in their Kingdom, they may decide to wage war with their Army, attempting to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s Kingdom while delaying paths to victory.&#10;&#10;During the game:&#10;The players will be building their own Kingdoms while attempting to hinder their opponent's progress by waging war or blocking their draws.

Draw a card from the deck&#10;2. Wage war against their opponent by combining the strength of their General, Champion and Arms&#10;3. Use a Wizard card's ability&#10;4.

Three block conditions can occur based on the opponent's card draw value:&#10;1. Lower value than the block total - drawn card is discarded &#10;2. Equal value - both the drawn card and all blocking cards are discarded &#10;3. Higher value - Drawn card is kept. Blocking cards and additional cards (equaling or exceeding the drawn value) are discarded&#10;&#10;To Win the Game:&#10;Be the first player to complete their Kingdom, consisting of 18 total cards in a specific arrangement.&#10;&#10;",

All three titles are lightweight party games with simple mechanics accompanied by amusing cartoons.&#10;&#10;In Korporacja (&quot;Corporation&quot;) players assume the roles of employees trying to climb the career ladder by moving around and solving certain tasks.&#10;&#10;Players move about the game board (representing a corporation) by die rolls, receive cards with tasks from superiors in form of cards, and then have to perform these tasks. Tasks are a combination of mini-games.&#10;&#10;With the successful navigation around obstacles and completion of tasks they move up the corporate ladder up to the top. Players can hinder other players in the completion of their tasks with certain action cards.&#10;&#10;",

Hounds can only move diagonally one field forward (towards row 1) onto an empty adjacent square.&#10;&#10;Since only diagonal moves are allowed the game is played on the 32 dark fields of the chess board only.&#10;&#10;There is no capturing by jumping and no stacking of checkers. Neither by jumping the opponent as in Checkers nor by moving onto its field replacing the opponent.&#10;&#10;Fox wins by reaching the other side of the board (8th row where hounds started their hunt).&#10;Hounds win by blocking the fox such that it cannot move anymore (when fox has no legal move left).&#10;&#10;If moving perfect then hounds will win.&#10;&#10;Due to simplicity of the material it is sometimes part of family game collections where a Checkers or Chess set is already included.&#10;&#10;See this thread for more information: Same name but played 4:1 on chessboard&#10;&#10;",

Then take any chips in front of other players that have the same number! Any chips that remain in front of you by the beginning of your next turn are placed onto your plate and are safe from being stolen.&#10;&#10;The game ends once only one chip remains in the bag.

At the start of play, the tiles are scattered on the table, creating twelve stacks that are each one tile high. On a turn, you take one stack and place it on another stack that is either (a) the same height or (b) topped by a tile with the same symbol. Stacks cannot be divided. Players take turns until one player cannot make a move; that player loses the game and the other player wins.&#10;&#10;Soluna is nearly identical to the earlier Bruno Faidutti game Babylon, but the double-sided discs create a new starting set-up for each round. The first player to win four rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Babylon&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game board is composed of 3 by 3 game tiles, so the game board on which is played is a huge square of 63 cm x 63 cm. This is large enough for several players to be able to play the game at the same time. The game board is &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, it is not a static board as the tiles are flipped over, turned and moved. So it is not possible to memory map the board. The mechanic of an ever changing board makes it not only fun; also the challenge is kept into the game all the time.&#10;&#10;A game turn &#10;Players will have to throw a color dice at the beginning of their turn. According to the color thrown (3 possibilities) they must draw a mission card of the same color. There are 3 kinds of missions.&#10;&#10;How to win the game? &#10;Be the first one to have successfully accomplished 10 missions. Each successful mission gives 1 point, so be the first one to get 10 points. &#10;The artwork is something not to be found in &lsquo;standard&rsquo; games. The personal drawing style of the artist Eugene makes this a kind of playing artwork.&#10;&#10;",

Who will be the first to use up all of his ingredients, and thus become the new voodoo master?&#10;&#10;In Voodoo Mania, each player starts with a hand of three cards and a reserve ingredient pile of 18-45 cards, depending on the number of players. One card starts in the center of the table. Each card is double-sided, and each side features four of five symbols on it (mask, amulet, voodoo doll, magic potion and top hat) in four of five colors.&#10;&#10;All players play at the same time, trying to play their cards in hand. To play a card, the card must depict the symbol missing from the top card of the discard pile in the missing color or it must also be missing the same symbol in the same color. In the latter case, the player laying down the card says &quot;Voodoo!&quot; and all other players must draw a card from the bottom of the discard pile and place it on the bottom of their personal ingredient pile. Then all players start playing again.&#10;&#10;At any time, a player can place a card from his hand on the bottom of his ingredient pile, then draw the top card of this pile. Whenever a player plays a card, he draws a replacement card to keep three cards in hand.&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and everyone scores one point for each card still in hand or in the pile. After three rounds, the player with the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game can be played in either two player  or team mode. &#10;More about the game: The Queen, being tired of a male dominated game that either features only the King or the Queen in a lesser role, created a 2/4-player game that  shows the Queen&rsquo;s ability to be the master of the game . &#10;Queen and Kings ...A Checkers Game, introduces a Queen scepter in the center of the board, upon capturing it the King is introduced.
