What constitutes a good play? The contestants must discover this for themselves, more by intuition than by logic&quot;&#10;&#10;Osmosis is played with a normal deck of cards, but without some cards according to the number of players. Each player starts with a eight card hand and to win a round he must gather more than 11 cards, when he scores alone or he loses when he reaches 4 cards, then all other players scores. Cards are gathered by trading with the other player is very specific ways.&#10;&#10;",

All the cards are face up on the table, so there are no mysteries. Play is in moves, which are determined by the relationship of the cards to one another. Some players find the interplay of the &quot;patterns&quot; a fascinating challenge. Other never see it. To find out whether it is &quot;your cup of tea&quot; you'll have to try it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player takes twelve cards from a normal deck of cards numbered from 1 to 13 (Ace to K). Then shuffles his cards and deals then in two lines of six cards each. The objective is, by moving two cards each turn, complete a pattern before the other player. The catch is that the moves you are allowed to make are based on your opponents' cards. If you do a difficult move, you win points, if you make an easy one you lose points. When you win a hand, you score the number of point you get that hand (can be zero).&#10;&#10;",

The major obstacle for the Red Army was the Dniepr river, especially since south of Kiev only one bridge was left - the railway one near Kanev.&#10;Expecting an attack of Kiev, the German forces were unprepared for a Soviet attack aimed at siezing the bridge.

Prices are rolled for before each round. Also, each round has an accident field that is secretly determined beforehand and often requires re-building a section of the route. Rails, roads and waterways must follow the lines printed on the board, while air transport always takes the shortest possible route.&#10;Teams compete to complete the route first (to get a bonus) and as effectively (=cheaply) as possible. The team with most cash at the end of round 3 wins.&#10;&#10;",
