The higher card wins, unless the smaller card divides it evenly, or is one less than the higher. After five tricks the hands are swapped and played again. Whoever takes the most tricks wins.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Pico and Pico 2, but predates both by at least 15 years. It was published in Sid Sackson's Card Games Around the World in 1981.&#10;&#10;The ten card deck consists of 2-10 and 12. A longer version can be played with fourteen cards and seven tricks, using 2-10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18. A normal deck of cards can be used, with one suit for 2-10 and another for 12 and higher.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;Sitting astride the Mediterranean sea lanes, Malta stood in the way of Axis dreams of world dominion. To conquer North Africa, Italian and German troops would have to take the island. To hold on in Africa and turn back the rising tide of evil, the British-Maltese garrison would have to hold out against overwhelming odds.&#10;&#10;Island of Death is a game based on German and Italian plans to capture the strategic island, a battle that never actually took place. Now Fortress Malta extends the game to look at other alternative plans and defenses. It is not playable by itself; Island of Death is required to enjoy the scenarios presented in Fortress Malta.&#10;&#10;New variations include:&#10;&#10;    The 1940 Italian plan to invade Malta. With a single division and a handful of Libyan paratroopers, Air Marshal Italo Balbo proposed a radical strike at the outbreak of war. While the invading force was slender, so was the defense.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Mercury over Malta. The German plan to strike Malta instead of Crete in May 1941, with 7th Flieger Division.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Alternate Defenders. The attackers did not have a complete idea of the defenders awaiting them on Malta; we give you variable defenses to re-create this uncertainty.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Alternate Attackers. Axis planners had numerous options available to them, and you get to try them out: additional German paratroopers, another Italian division, captured Soviet tanks in German service, and more.&#10;&#10;&#10;Plus the book includes looks at Italian and German planning for the Malta invasion, the British garrison and Malta's place in World War II history as well as historical background and design notes. With 420 (!) new laser-cut playing pieces, this turns a small game into a major study of the invasion of Malta, with vast re-play opportunities.&#10;&#10;",

The investigators will find every hand turned against them as they explore its rotting docks and fetid beaches. In the end, perhaps the only way to save Innsmouth is by destroying it along with the terrible creatures that haunt its waters near Devil Reef.&#10;&#10;Innsmouth Horror introduces several new game concepts to the Arkham Horror Series, including Personal Stories unique to each investigator as well as the Innsmouth Look. The town of Innsmouth is hostile to the investigators, and they may well find themselves thrown in jail and fed to a Shoggoth while they search the town for evidence to call in the Feds. However, leaving Innsmouth to fester is a bad idea, since the Deep Ones will gather and rise, bringing with them the Ancient One. Innsmouth Horror also adds 16 new investigators, eight new Ancient Ones, two new Heralds, Epic Battle cards for the new Ancient Ones, over 30 new monster markers, plenty of new encounters, and an expansion board featuring the town of Innsmouth. Over all, this expansion adds over 300 new cards to the base game.&#10;&#10;",

The warden may change two adjacent ships in position. There are two mule cards being used when playing with less than five players; these cards cannot be chosen. When all players have chosen a card, the car of the president moves to the position of the remaining card; remember, there are six cards that each turn are shuffled and randomly placed.  &#10;                                                 &#10;Under each card on the board are symbols that come into effect when the car of the president stops there. The first makes all law proposals go into effect; the second makes it possible to move the supervisor anywhere on a player board in the next round. The next symbol also is in effect for the next round: it allows you to pay one money and overbuild a building with another; the difference in resources must be paid as well. One symbol makes the leading player to go back two points on the score track; another allows players to purchase market wares at discount prices. Players must now not only consider which role they would like to take, but also which position they likely want to be visited by the president.  &#10;                                                  &#10;There are 2 additional laws in each of the four categories, so that the game can now last up to 8 rounds instead of just 6. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

The disaffected must be coerced. &#10;- Captain Pasley, acting Aide de Camp&#10;&#10;The troubles on the Victorian Goldfields that culminated in the Eureka Stockade are a misunderstood event in Australian history. Reports in England, Canada and California at the time show exaggerated expectations that this was the start of a widespread revolt against British Colonial misrule. In Australia, it was usually reported as a minor aberration of no serious or immediate consequences, merely a protest against taxes that got out of hand rather than the culmination of a chain of events. So, who was correct ? The colonial Governor, Sir Charles Hotham reported to the British colonial secretary George Grey that if the battle was lost at Ballarat then the colony of Victoria was lost to British Sovereignty. The game is designed to both teach about the events at the stockade and to serve as an introduction to military and historical boardgames.&#10;&#10;Each map hex is approximately 60 meters from side to side.

The idea is to roll the 3 dice and to follow up with cards from your hand to make point-scoring series; for example, 3 triangles from the dice followed by 3 triangles from your hand scores 10 points. Triangle and circle are 'normal' suits while star is a kind of joker suit in that it can be combined with the other suits as well as stars, and the square is a negative suit but only if you get 3 of them on the dice; the other players can then follow with more squares from their hand to give you more negative points. There are also 9 different special cards which allow you to steal points from other players, change the direction of play, etc., while the empties are only there to mess up your hand. The board has slots for each player's point card and players use the transparent chips to keep track of their scores.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first to score 100 points or win the game directly by getting the Jackpot ie. 3 stars from the Pop-O-Matic followed by 3 stars from your hand.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10; &#10;     1 plastic gameboard with Pop-O-Matic dice roller&#10;     150 cards&#10;     8 transparent plastic chips&#10;     4 point cards&#10;     4 point tables&#10;     Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Once they choose a song, they get a Subject card and the fun begins.&#10;&#10;Players then begin rewriting the lyrics to the song they chose about the subject they receive.  There is a timer, and you can write as much or as little as you like in the allotted time.&#10;&#10;Once everyone finishes writing, its time to &quot;perform&quot; your new song.  This is the part I love.  Everyone take a turn singing (or just reading) their new lyrics.  Needless to say, the results can be extremely funny and usually have people laughing.&#10;&#10;You can write as much or as little as you want - and still win.  For example, my niece had the subject Roadkill and the song Brick House - all she wrote was &quot;It was a dead, mouse!&quot; and she won the round.&#10;&#10;After everyone performs or reads their new song, everyone becomes a critic (think Simon Cowell).  Players secretly give Smash point cards or Trash (funny insult) cards to the other players.&#10;&#10;The points each player receives during the round are recorded, and after playing as many rounds as you want - the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The best thing about this game is the memories it creates.  And players can take their songs home with them and share them.&#10;&#10;",

This new board provides new challenges and requires new ways of thinking. The new gameboard is arranged portrait-style rather than the landscape orientation of the original, and the five roads have been replaced by a network of intersecting and overlapping roads, so you can continue on a different color or even choose which way to go. The point values also change during your way, not simply increasing.&#10;Also  you have 5 cairns on the board, with each cairn having a stack of five stones in a particular color. When you reach a spot on that track, you claim the top stone. Stones of all five colors are awarded 10 points; collecting three stones of the same color is also worth 10 points, too.&#10;&#10;This expansion is included in the 2012 edition of Keltis.&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of the game, the players may also become the patron of famous historical characters such as Ludvig Holberg, Carl von Linne, and Tycho Brahe.

Will Karl XII create a greater Swedish empire or die of a musket ball through the temple at some obscure Norwegian fortress? Can the Russian bear be stopped, or will Finland once again fall to the Tsar of Russia? Which nation will rule the North? The player who best maneuvers the vagaries of history and influences events to their advantage will be the winner of the Crowns of the North.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Southern Cal ASL Club web site:&#10;&#10;Melee Pack II has six scenarios, with a little something for everyone! We take you to the steppes of the Crimea, the jungles of Ecuador and the heart of Stalingrad. We&rsquo;ve got vehicles of all description waiting for you to shift into gear; from a trio of AVREs to a quartet of ISU-122s to a&#10;lone StuIG 33B to a T-60 conga line. We give you battles between titans, from Assault Engineers fighting Assault Engineers to Dogfighting Air Support. Our scenarios range from tournament-size to super-size.  Like things simple, without all those tanks and guns and things? We&rsquo;ve got you covered! How about a complex challenge you can sink your&#10;Grognard teeth into? Take two, their small! Wanna fight on the Red Barricades map? Done! Did I mention the AVREs? Did I mention the Firefly backing them up? Bam!&#10;&#10;Melee Pack II also contains a set of our wildly popular Scenario Cheat Sheets! If you haven&rsquo;t seen one before, a Scenario Cheat Sheet depicts vehicle and gun notes based on the forces involved, the date and any special rules. What you wind up with is a sheet of information specially tailored for each vehicle and gun for that scenario. It saves us a lot of time looking up rules and we hope you&rsquo;ll find them useful also.  Melee Pack II is packed with great ASL...you&rsquo;re gonna love it!&#10;&#10;The scenarios are:&#10;&#10;July 5, 1941&#10;Border, El Oro Province, Ecuador:&#10;Peruvian regulars of Agrupamiento del&#10;Norte have crossed the border trying&#10;to push along the coast of southeastern&#10;Ecuador. An Ecuadorean Border&#10;Detachment has taken up defensive&#10;positions in the dense jungle, ready to&#10;block the invaders&rsquo; path.&#10;&#10;June 6, 1944&#10;Juno Beach, Normandy, France:&#10;The AVREs, Shermans and men of the&#10;26th Assault Squadron and 79th Armoured&#10;must break through the entrenched&#10;positions of the 736th Regiment.&#10;Of course there is also the little&#10;matter of the minefield, the shattered&#10;bridge, the stream and the pillboxes.&#10;MP8: CRATER LAKE&#10;&#10;December 18, 1944&#10;Rocherath, Belgium:&#10;Dietrich&rsquo;s 12th SS Division must capture&#10;the Elsenborn Ridge and only the&#10;village of Rocherath stands in his way.&#10;Can the troopers of the American 2nd&#10;Division and 744th TD Battalion hold&#10;their positions against this powerful&#10;combined arms SS force?&#10;&#10;April 12, 1944&#10;The Crimea, Russia:&#10;The 4th Ukranian Front has assaulted&#10;the Crimea from the north, forcing the&#10;German 17th Army to hastily retreat&#10;towards Sevastapol. Can the 49th&#10;Mountain Corps&rsquo; landsers hold their&#10;line in the steppe until the men of the&#10;10th Romanian Infantry pass through?&#10;&#10;November 11, 1942&#10;Stalingrad, Russia:&#10;Operation Hubertus&rsquo; push for the&#10;Volga has been blunted.

Refilled bottles cannot be used for a combat bonus, even with a cheat card.&#10;     A sealed bottle contains three swallows - that is, doses - of Munchkin Water. Each swallow gives +1 in combat.  You must unseal the bottle and actually drink one swallow for each +1 you want.  You may drink all for one combat, to get +3, or spread it out between combats.  You may give swallows of your Munchkin Water to other players, but be careful not to share Munchkin germs.&#10;     After each swallow, you must mark off one of the three boxes on the label.  When all three boxes are marked off, the bottle is empty for game purposes, though you should still finish all the water, because it's good for you.&#10;     For alternate expanded rules see www.sjgames.com/munchkin/water&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is game for the Decktet card game-system, loosely based on Waving Hands by Richard Bartle. Players become wizards casting spells and trying to eliminate all their opponents. Spells need both energy runes and activation runes. Players play cards in front of them, one after the other each turn, forming their spell sequence. When a card with an activation rune is played, they choose which energy runes to use to cast a variety of effects.&#10;&#10;Unlike in Waving Hands, the spell table is very small with just 10 spells which are grouped by the type of activation rune needed: Moons (spells directed at the caster for protection or healing), Wyrms (spells directed at an opponent, usually damaging) and Knots (more complex effects that can be played on both caster or opponents). Also the fact that you have a hand of cards and are limited to those cards for play introduces an element of hand management and randomness not present in Waving Hands.&#10;&#10;The rules can be read at: http://decktet.wikidot.com/game:dueling-runes&#10;&#10;There's a pocket mod version of the rules too: http://decktet.wikidot.com/local--files/game:dueling-runes/duelinrunespocketmod.pdf&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is called SHADRACK and was distributed &quot;exclusively by the John Ladell Company&quot;. The game was made in TAIWAN and has the number (no.412) on the box.&#10;&#10;The game is a well-made wooden game. It comes with a 10 X 10 board and some hard wood pieces. Those hard wood pieces include 14 tiles with number 1 on them, 10 tiles with number 2, 6 tiles with number 3, and 4 tiles each with N,S,E,and W. The tiles fit into the spots on the game board. Also included is a black covering which lays over the gameboard. That covering has an opening cut in it which allows a 4 x 4 area of the gameboard to become visible. On the covering is printed the name of the game, the company the game is made by, the letters N,S,E,and W and some fancy scrolls in each corner.&#10;&#10;SHADRACK'S THE NAME. GAMBLING IS THE GAME!&#10;&#10;Take Tic-Tac-Toe, flavor it with a hint of Craps, toss in a soupcon of Dominoes... and you've got a swinging new game called SHADRACK! Can be played for matches, pennies, dimes or dollars. Two to eight players. Solid mahogany board makes conversation piece worth the price alone.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "ROMMEL IN FRANCE&#10;Panzers at Dinant, May 1940&#10; The German&rsquo;s 5th Panzer Corps drove the Belgian and French screening forces through the Ardennes forest, then sought to cross the Meuse River near Dinant. A breakthrough here, as well as further south at Sedan, would split the Allied forces in two. A protracted and bloody battle was not in the German war plans...speed was of the essence...the blitzkrieg depended on it...Hitler demanded it!&#10;The French forces, caught off balance by the sudden attack, were initially aided by the terrain but not for long. Rommel was a determined foe and the Meuse River was looked upon as only a temporary delay. It proved a little more than that and provided the vital time for the French armor division to move into the area despite harassing Ju-87 dive bombers and a lack of fuel and organization.&#10;The Panzers soon found how inferior their little armored tanks were against the likes of the Char B, which could split any of the panzer metal from long range. Even the lighter French tanks were as good or better. In fact, Rommel only had 24 Pz IV's, which could take on the French tanks. His remaining 68 Pz II or 91 Czech-38 were simply too weak in armor and and in gun.. The French 47mm gun could rip a Pz III apart from 1500 yds. However, the French use and slowness negated their armor and gun to a large extent. German tanks were faster and well commanded and could take on the French tanks by firing from the rear or flank.&#10;The Battle at Dinant was a tough fight, but across the sweeping vistas of France, the fast moving Germans caused a French command in chaos. Rommel would also have another surprise in another week or so at Arras. There, the British sent chills down the German command when Matilda IIs launched their counterattack. German fire simply bounced off their thick armor causing Rommel to get desperate. He ordered his four 88mm AA guns to be used at antitank weapons. The rest is history.&#10;&#10;The game scale:&#10;Each day turn represents about one and half hours (night turns are 5 to 6 hours). Infantry, cavalry, and armor units are battalions, artillery units are regiments. Each hex is approximately one mile across.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by Blitzkrieg Challenged: Dinant.&#10;&#10;",
