    "Description": "The little mice want to grab the juicy apples that the wind has shaken from the tree. But here comes the sly fox, who also likes to eat apples. The little mice quickly climb the apple tree to hide. In order to get to the ripe apples in the meadow, the mice climb up and down: The little climbing mice hang onto each other and rappel down the tree. But who is the fastest and grabs the most apples from the meadow?&#10;&#10;Two dice depicting different colors are rolled in turns. The main task for the players is to pay attention and react fast by finding the matching color combination of double-colored mice tokens by putting their hands on them.&#10;&#10;Whoever gets the right mice first may take them - and either hang them on his branch of the large apple tree in the center of the table or - if they don't match in color - keep them for a later turn.&#10;&#10;When a wind icon is rolled, the mice on the branches may be re-sorted and can be put together with the same colored sides, hanging from a branch in a domino-like fashion. If the chain of mice reaches 5 tokens, they get to the ground and players may pick up an apple token. The player, who gets to 2 apples first, wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Light color player goes first, alternate turns taking one move with a stack their control (That is, a stack with your color at the top).&#10;&#10;Stacks move a straight line the distance exactly its height, dropping bottom disks exactly one by one for each hex. Dropped disks may capture opponent's stacks and/or merge with own stacks. If your mono-color stack of 3- or more height can make capture, you must do so.&#10;&#10;And there are important restrictions; if you do not have the highest stack on a straight line, your stacks on the line cannot make any move along the line. And if both of you and your opponent have the highest stacks of same height on a line, your stacks on the line can move and merge but cannot capture.&#10;&#10;The object is to make all stacks you control adjacent each other as a group. You can also win by having two bi-color stacks of 6-height.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The world of tomorrow. It took a few decades to set aside our differences. In the end, we stood together as a united nation, and took a step into the future. This is the Age of Steam!&#10;&#10;Everyday life has been changed, and we offer an American dream to anyone willing to brave new frontiers. Railroads run by the biggest trains connect most cities, making travel fast and secure. Prosperity helps engineers create the most daring inventions. And going West will offer even more opportunities. Wild territories, vast resources: a better life! Steam carries us to these promising lands, protects us against all perils, and heralds a new dawn for civilization.&#10;&#10;And yet...&#10;&#10;Yet, rumors talk about frontier towns being erased from the map, of people going mad and hurling themselves into murderous rages. Is it some kind of exotic illness? Who knows, and honestly, who cares? You cannot stop progress. Full steam, in the name of science!&#10;&#10;Gears &amp; Guns is a campaign expansion. This means its ten missions form a single ongoing story that the Survivors experience, accumulating experience, skills, and equipment as they go. Their actions and choices each Mission may have dire ramifications down the line.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge is the second in the Card Conquest game series in which players recreate epic military contests of history in short, comparatively simple, easy-to-learn but hard-to-master games. As with the first game in the series, Hitler's Reich, Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge  sets up in minutes and plays to a conclusion in one sitting of two hours (or less). These are not simulations but games, albeit ones packed with enough historical flavor and decision-making to give players the feeling that &ldquo;you are there&rdquo; at the highest levels of command.&#10;&#10;In Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge, the 23 uneasy years of peace between the arch-rival republics of Rome and Carthage come to an end by Hannibal Barca. Son of the Carthaginian hero in their earlier conflict, he vowed since childhood to take revenge for his country's humiliating defeat in that war. Now the time has come to redeem that pledge, and he laid siege to the city of Saguntum in Spain. Rome, incensed over this attack on their ally, mobilizes for war in response.&#10;&#10;It is now 219 B.C. (or in the Roman calendar 534 Ab Urbe Condita -that many years since the founding of the city). As the Senate and People of Rome, will you succeed in making Carthage pay for this insult and once again force upon them a humiliating peace? Or as the elders of Carthage, will you restore your city&rsquo;s rightful place in the Mediterranean world to bring honor and glory to your people through victories gained in Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge?&#10;&#10;Hannibal&rsquo;s Revenge mixes deck building mechanisms with area control on a map of the Western Mediterranean. There are several ways players can win: by capturing the enemy capital (without losing their own), reducing your opponent's hand size to zero, or (as Carthage) holding out until the game ends. To accomplish all this, players can capture cities and/or play event cards that help them strengthen their hand&mdash;or weaken that of their opponent.&#10;&#10;A player&rsquo;s hand is composed of conflict cards ranging in strength from 1 to 13. Some of these cards have special powers, such as the ability to re-roll one or more dice. In conflict, the strength of these cards is complimented with the roll of the dice (standard 3, but up to 5 with events and leaders). Rome&rsquo;s deck is divided into two &ldquo;suits&rdquo;: one for the Republic of Rome itself (e.g. &ldquo;The Legions&rdquo;) and another for its Latin Allies. Cathage&rsquo;s conflict cards are similarly divided: one suit representing the core Carthaginian army and another for their Gallic, Spanish, and other Allies/Mercenaries.&#10;&#10;Conflict cards can also be used to move leaders (e.g. Hannibal or his brother Hasdruble and a pool of Roman leaders of varying quality whom a Senate game mechanism assigns to command Rome&rsquo;s field armies). These leaders represent their armies which move upon the game map&mdash;a map divided into sea and land areas (yes, Hannibal can again perform his legendary march across the Alps!) with some land areas identified as Roman, Carthaginian, or Neutral, some of which contain Fortified Walled Cities. Such Cities may be besieged&hellip;a sometime perilous and time-consuming enterprise.&#10;&#10;Players may also use one or more Event cards to influence the outcome of the conflict. Conflict arises when a player tries to capture a territory or when he tries to acquire a new Event card from one of three available decks: Roman, Carthaginian, or mixed (available for both parties).&#10;&#10;Hannibal's Revenge includes a built-in solitaire bot system to enhance solo play. For those who want to play with more than two, it also includes optional rules for 3-4 players.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;One 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; Mounted Map&#10;54 Conflict Cards (four suits of 13 cards plus 2 Prodotis - i.e. &ldquo;Traitor&rdquo;- cards)&#10;72 Hannibal's Revenge Event Cards&#10;16 Leader Cards&#10;Ten six-sided dice (five white, five black)&#10;140+ Assorted Wooden pieces, Cubes, and Cylinders&#10;2 Player Aid Sheets&#10;1 Solitaire Player Aid Sheet&#10;Rules of Play manual (this booklet) -&#10;Playbook (which includes Rules for Solitaire Play)&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: When both players' Conflict Card decks get shuffled, a sexennium (6 years) is complete. The game can end at any moment, but will last no more than three such sexennia.&#10;&#10;MAP SCALE: Land Areas, Major Cities, and Sea Zones (some of which can be hazardous to traverse).&#10;&#10;UNIT SCALE: Combat strengths are determined for each combat by card play and dice rolls.&#10;&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 1 &ndash; 2 (with optional rules for 3-4)&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately for Skrull, his receivers were Dwarfs, and as he waited for one of them to trundle slowly into position, the opposition executed a career-ending tackle on the unfortunate Thrower. This beautiful game wasn't done with Skrull, though, and he was resurrected by none other than famous Necromancer coach, Tomolandry, eager to try out a long game for his own Champions of Death.&#10;&#10;A Dwarf Thrower, they ask with eyebrows raised incredulously? Your opponents won't underestimate him more than once... This unconventional Star Player can be Induced by any Sylvanian Spotlight and Worlds Edge Superleague team to add a frankly impressive passing strategy. As befitting a player with no flesh and blood, Skrull is cool under pressure and very survivable (so to speak, anyway) &ndash; ideal for mixing it up on the Line of Scrimmage and then sending the ball sailing out to a breakaway catcher on the other side.&#10;&#10;This finely-detailed resin model is supplied in 7 pieces, and comes supplied with a 32mm Round Blood Bowl Base. You can find all the rules you need to use Skrull in Blood Bowl &ndash; The Official Rules.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;The 2016 edition rules to use this player can be found in Blood Bowl (2016 Edition): 2019 Blood Bowl Almanac&#10;&#10;",

Important dates and anniversaries are ignored or forgotten, and family functions are avoided. Before long, the unfortunate lover begins to resent the beautiful game. In time, a strong hatred of Nuffle, and all his wonders, is fostered and domestic bliss becomes a thing of the past! Such was the case with Gretchen W&auml;chter, whose husband was utterly obsessed with Blood Bowl when they were still alive. The Necromancer and aspiring coach Dirk the Abhorrent turned the animosity Gretchen held for the game into a finely-honed weapon and unleashed her scorn against her rival players &ndash; the pitch has never been the same since.&#10;&#10;The legendary 'Blood Bowl Widow' is a frighteningly solid Star Player, despite being wholly incorporeal. Gretchen's set of skills make it hard for your opponents to get their hands on her, robbing their momentum and frustrating even their Big Guys. She can be Induced to play for any Sylvanian Spotlight team, bolstering their defensive line and skipping right past their biggest players on offence.&#10;&#10;This finely-detailed resin model is supplied in 7 pieces, and comes supplied with a 32mm Round Blood Bowl Base.

The small geographic location and the addition of subsidiaries, operating costs, and the looming shadow of the LPTB are some of the main features that set it apart.&#10;&#10;Each turn players can open new, or buy/sell shares in existing companies. These companies expand their underground network by laying track and running trains to generate revenue. This can be paid as dividends to share holders or retained to purchase new trains and cover expenses.&#10;&#10;The end of the game occurs when either the last train is purchased or only one company remains. At this point the player with the highest personal wealth in cash and assets wins. With no luck involved, success is found through careful planning, shrewd decisions and ruthless actions.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

(If a stick slides onto other colors later as the tower tilts and wobbles, that's okay, but you need to match when placing!)&#10;&#10;If any sticks fall off the tower on your turn, collect them and place them in front of you. When all the sticks have been placed onto the tower or when the tower falls over, the game ends immediately. If you caused the tower to fall, you don't collect any of the sticks, but you do score five points (which isn't good). Every player scores one point for each stick in front of them.&#10;&#10;If anyone has eleven or more points, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Stick Stack Cool Black is a new version of the origin Stick Stack game.

In the first half of the game, children do not need to write, so they can focus on their creation. The second half is &quot;writing&quot;, using associative memory, writing out keywords, and recreating the scene of the story. In the game, there are 200 frequently used words from the Chinese primary school vocabulary list. The vocabulary list requires children to master the dictation of the words and be proficient in basic Chinese words. Using the form of &quot;oral composition&quot; and &quot;extract keywords&quot;, the game lowered the difficulty of the composition and raise the children's learning interest in this subject. The game also makes full use of the means of &quot;listening, speaking, reading, and writing&quot;, combined with a real-time feedback mechanism that children can fully use their imagination to break the shackles of thinking and master the skills of composition.&#10;&#10;Game setup: Each player takes a player map and its corresponding scoreboard, a pencil, and a sheet of notepaper. Each player draws 5 word cards. Hold them in the hand and don't let other players see them&#10;&#10;To start the game: Reverse the hourglass for timekeeping. All players have 30 seconds to prepare an impressive story with the 5 words on the card. After 30 seconds, all players place the cards face down on their map from left to right, starting with the first player and telling each player's story in a clockwise manner. To end the game: When all players have finished telling the story, invert the hourglass and wait 30 seconds, then write down the other players' words in order on a sheet of notepaper. When one player has written all the words can be remembered, place the paper in the center of the table and turn the hourglass around again. The other players have another 30 seconds to continue to recall and record words.&#10;&#10;After all players submit their answers, the words will be revealed by the order of storytelling. Players will give their scoring marks to the player who first turned in the notepaper with all words in a correct manner. 1 point for each correct word (correct order and spelling), 2 points for each player who memorizes 5 words from your story, 2 points for each score mark earned from another player, and -2 points for the player's own score mark. The player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Come to appreciate the classic Chinese poetry!&#10;&#10;Poetry Express contains 75 classic poems that are required to be learned in Chinese primary school. Children can read and appreciate these classic works of &quot;painting in poetry, poetry in painting&quot; through the form of games. In the game, children enjoy the learning experience of poetry with their endless imagination by describing the picture expressed by the poem, knowing the poem, expressing the poem, and imagining the artistic conception of the poem.&#10;&#10;Game setup: Shuffle the cards into a deck, use the top card of the deck to form a 5*5 square matrix with the cards face up. Shuffle the question stick, put them into the container and set it at a convenient place, put the hourglass aside&#10;&#10;To start the game: Shake the question stick container, randomly draw 2 sticks, show the 4 keywords on both sides of the display to all players. After all of the players have confirmed the keywords, the first play reverse the hourglass, all players find and take the poem cards that meet the requirements from the square mix. Players check each other's poem cards after taking the cards that meet the requirements or after the hourglass's time is over. If a player picks up a poem card that doesn't match any keywords, the player should put all the poem cards taken from this round in front of them with the frontside of the cards facing up. If the poetry cards you take meet more than 1 requirement, for each additional keyword meet the requirement, you can take an additional poetry card from the deck (with the backside facing up, without checking the frontside of the card) as a reward, put all the poems cards and reward cards in front of you with the backside of the card facing up&#10;&#10;To end the game: The game ends when there is no more question stick to draw or cannot complete the 5*5 square matrix with the poem cards. Each backside-up poem card counts 1 point, and each two frontside-up poem cards counts -1 point. Less than two frontside-up cards will not count the score. The player with the highest total score is the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

But since everyone wants to win, there is of course the possibility of repeatedly putting a spoke in your fellow player's wheel. Action cards can be used to attack them and prevent someone else from playing their last card first.&#10;&#10;Up to this point, the principle sounds familiar to many, but in &quot;DOPPELT ODER NICHTS&quot; (German for &quot;DOUBLE OR NOTHING&quot;), some things work a little differently: For example, it is possible to defend yourself by deflecting the attack on a fellow player, who in turn has the same option to defend himself. In this way, it can hit anyone and you can never be sure to reach the goal without being disturbed.&#10;&#10;Constant action is therefore the order of the day and does not end with the cards. Those who are willing to take risks can, sometimes under full physical effort, gain an advantage in this card game. Through interactive, cognitive or coordinated tasks it is possible to prevent the drawing of penalty cards. However, one should then think twice, because whoever fails the task receives double the penalty. The deal is: &quot;DOPPELT ODER NICHTS&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

This campaign covers those critical days. The Campaign consists of seven new missions featuring a new Terrain Deck for the forests, fields, and villages of the Ardennes. The counter sheet includes a U.S. heavy machine gun platoon, Bangalore torpedoes, anti-tank mines, wire entanglements, German tanks, assault guns, Panzergrenadiers, and Volksgrenadiers.&#10;&#10;We left the &ldquo;Manchus&rdquo; of World War Two in Fields of Fire: Volume I at the close of the Normandy Campaign. The 2nd Infantry Division was rapidly moved to join the assault on the port city of Brest, in Brittany. The city was captured after heavy fighting from August 21st to September 18th. By that time, the German resistance elsewhere in France had collapsed, and the 2nd Infantry Division raced to Paris, arriving on September 29th. The rapid advance ended on October 4th when the Division entered the region just east of St. Vith, Belgium called the Schnee Eifel on the highly symbolic German border. The 2nd Infantry Division relieved the 4th and 28th Infantry Divisions, completing the relief on October 5th. Ahead lay the German border, defended by the Siegfried Line cutting across difficult terrain.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Manchus&rdquo; were able to incorporate replacements and prepare for whatever would come next throughout October and November. This period saw frequent patrol activity but no major combat actions. On December 10th, the 2nd Infantry Division began a relief in place by the 106th Infantry Division. By the 11th, the relief was complete, and the Division gathered at Camp Elsenborn to prepare for the renewed offensive. The attack north through the Siegfried line would commence on December 13th.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Germans will be trying to blast stubborn Soviet defenders from their positions using flamethrowers, demolition charges and close combat.  Meanwhile the defenders will be fortifying locations, setting up crossfire, using the sewers to infiltrate behind the attackers and generally be as difficult to root out as their real-life counterparts were.&#10;&#10;As a module, it is not a complete game in itself but requires ownership of the Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rulebook and Beyond Valor module as a minimum.&#10;&#10;There are 11 scenarios ranging from small engagements to larger battles which will enable players to experience the struggle whilst attempting to capture (or defend) a significant industrial complex.  The Winter Map expansion adds a further 4 scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

Each character is assigned to 1 of the 6 towers at the start of the game. If that tower is destroyed, the character is lost, and the player must continue without that ability.&#10;&#10;Players will need those abilities too, since there are now quests that the players must try to survive to win the game. At the start of the game, players choose 1 Standard Quest and 1 Endgame Quest. Until both of those Quests are completed, the pile of Monsters will refill over and over.&#10;&#10;Standard Quests include searching for magic scrolls, looking for a cure for a plague of madness, holding off magical stones that cause the Monsters to spawn closer and closer to the Castle, and much more. Once the Standard Quest is achieved, players move on to the Endgame Quest, which they either complete or perish trying. Endgame Quests feature challenges such as collapsing caves to stop the flow of Monsters, racing against time to destroy a cursed obelisk, and placing magical portals to teleport the entire Castle to safety. There are 11 Standard and 7 Endgame Quests to choose from, providing hours and hours of replay as players explore all the different challenges.&#10;&#10;",

With a correct guess, the players win the game together.&#10;&#10;Game contents:&#10;&#10;4 shoulder capes&#10;1 palette drawing board&#10;5 dry-erase markers&#10;50 question cards&#10;1 die&#10;Game guide&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Bear Game is a comedically styled card game inspired by Battle Royales, Russian Roulette, and our other favorite party games. It&rsquo;s got bears that attack, bears that defend, and bears that kill you. It's got it all really.&#10;&#10;Players must either outlast their opponents or be the first to obtain 12 cards. But you must beware of the Evil Bear cards. If drawn, you&rsquo;ll have to face the deadly consequences or hope someone (including yourself) can save you with a Bear Mace card.  The other cards included will allow you to gain more cards, attack your opponents, hurt yourself, switch up the physical setting, and even accuse opponents of cheating! While playing you&rsquo;ll run into familiar characters, but with a fun and cartoonish art style.  This 2-6 player game can be strategic, chaotic, and most definitely fun.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
