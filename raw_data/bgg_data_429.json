Each square on the board has one, two, or three dots.  Players have tokens that move around the letters of the alphabet that encircle the board.  These letters have a numerical value associated with each, with (like Scrabble) the less often used letters having a higher value.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players guess a letter in a single word, but are restricted to guessing the letter their token is on or one of the next seven letters.  The Leader moderates.  Players get points based on the value of the letter correctly guessed times the number of dots in the square it rests on.  Players may move their token ahead seven letters around the board instead of guessing, to get within range of a letter they want to guess.&#10;&#10;The Leader keeps score, and the leading scorer when all the words are guessed wins.&#10;&#10;",

Upheaval features an exciting campaign system, giving players new strategic choices as they guide a band of green troops through battle after battle, guiding their experiences and upgrading their abilities and equipment until they either become an elite force or are destroyed and replaced by new green troops.&#10;&#10;Available exclusively in digital download format, Upheaval is a 48-page PDF written by Jason Lauborough, designer of the original &AElig;therverse and featuring art and fiction from the &AElig;therverse print rulebook. The game leverages aspects of the revolutionary &AElig;therverse army design system to provide a highly flexible upgrade path for units as they progress through the game. The gameplay portion of Upheaval features a revised and pared-down version of the &AElig;therverse rules, optimized for small-skirmish play between two to four small units of troops (roughly 8-30 models per army).&#10;&#10;Upheaval is suitable for sci-fi play of military or &quot;gang warfare&quot; variety, historical and modern skirmishes, and fantasy war band campaigning. The PDF also contains options for adding even more detail to your campaigns, as well as providing rules for creating units that are already experienced, allowing for &quot;one-off&quot; games to be played between interesting armies without having to go through a full campaign system.&#10;&#10;Upheaval's gameplay rules are ideal for 2-4 players, and the campaign system supports as many players as desired.&#10;&#10;Upheaval is fully supported by the Triskelegames.com website, including an active forum community, and will receive periodic free updates through the release of the semi-monthly &AElig;thergate Newsletter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A SIMPLE CIVIL WAR GAME DELUXE &copy; 2004&#10;Simple wargame rules for re-fighting the Battle of Gettysburg&#10;Game includes:&#10;&#10;16-page rule book&#10;32-page Armies of Gettysburg (Ratings for all regiments and leaders)&#10;50 card movement and firing deck of cards (using Avery Business Card Template 5377)&#10;Full Color cover sheet with &ldquo;Grand Battery&rdquo; errata on reverse side &#10;Players Aid sheet, 1- unit record sheet, and 1-sheet of game tables.&#10;&#10;This simple tabletop game can be played with any Civil War miniatures you may have, or with something as simple as a set of wooden blocks painted blue and gray.&#10;&#10;Combat is based on the &ldquo;stand&rdquo; (each stand representing 100 men, or 2 guns and crew)&#10;&#10;Movement, combat, and morale are based (and modified) for the levels of command.&#10;In these rules, leaders can make a real difference when units of equal capability and morale meet on the table-top. Card draw effects movement, combat, and time.&#10;&#10;The 16-page rule book is easy to learn as the rule is on the left side of the page, and a photo, illustration, or highlight is on the right side of the page to clarify that rule or statement.&#10;&#10;The 32-page &ldquo;armies&rdquo; booklet that rates each regiment, battery, and officer in the Army of the Potomac and Army of Northern Virginia for their performance during the Battle of Gettysburg and is organized by the UNION Corp or CONFEDERATE Division&#10;&#10;1-set of 50 cards that control time, firing, movement, and &ldquo;special situations&rdquo; that might occur during a table-top battle. Each cycle of the deck is &ldquo;1-hour&rdquo; of game time.&#10;&#10;These rules can use any of your existing miniatures, stand size makes no difference as long as both sides are mounted the same. If you do not have miniatures, or do not want to paint miniatures, a product called &ldquo;ACW Paper Armies&rdquo; is available for both sides. Individual &ldquo;stands&rdquo; show infantry, cavalry, artillery, commanders, wagons, and limbers in full color overhead photos.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In August of 1914, the airplane had barely made its tenth anniversary, and had only just become a weapon of war. The Italians had used air power (if it could be called that) in North Africa in 1911, and Louis Bl&eacute;riot&rsquo;s famous trip across the English Channel was still a fresh memory.&#10;&#10;The Great War was a time of heroes and villains, a war where everyone knew who was fighting whom and for what cause. Both sides had their great victories, huge defeats and plenty of trench foot. While this game is designed to simulate the greatest battles over the trenches of the World War I battlefield, we should not forget that men and women died for their beliefs and for their countries. Heroes were born of this combat on both sides.&#10;&#10;At no other time in our warring history has there been such a change as the airplane. Not only did combat change forever once our soldiers were airborne, but a whole generation became enamored of this newest weapon in our military arsenal. Even into the twenty-first century, the romance and joys of those first years in the air evoke the deepest respect for these new knights, these men of the airways.&#10;Aces at Dawn is a game of quasi-historical combat in the skies. Set at the turn of the century, the game models the man-to-man combat of the World-War I flying ace and his dreaded enemies. As with all Majestic Twelve games, Aces at Dawn is fun and easy to play, works with any line of miniatures, and encourages players to use their imagination and have fun, which is the way wargaming is supposed to be.&#10;&#10;With 36 planes at your disposal and a fully-customizable points system, you can build existing planes we haven't included and also try out designs that you think would have wreaked havoc in the skies of France.&#10;&#10;The flexibility of the system allows players to recreate the man-to-man air jousting at the turn of the twentieth century. A simple combat and maneuver system means you can dispense with complicated maneuver charts and intricately detailed plane record-keeping. What&rsquo;s left on the board is just plain fun.&#10;&#10;The ZIP file includes both full-color and printer-friendly PDF versions of the rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

The referee then chooses the Thing that appeals to him most and awards the card to the player who played it. The unusual combinations of Things and Descriptions are humorous to the extreme, and will quickly have the entire room in an uproar.

The player with the highest double places it on the table facing horizontally. This becomes a separator that divides each player's base. On their turn, each player can place a domino only on their side of the divider, unless the other player runs out of viable plays, in which case their base becomes open to invasion by the opposing player.&#10;&#10;Dominoes with blank ends have unique special-ops graphics printed on them. When special-ops dominoes are played, one of several events can occur, such as swapping domino tiles with the opposing player, or engaging in domino &quot;combat.&quot;&#10;&#10;The first player to shed all their dominoes wins the round. Points are tallied by adding up the number of pips from the dominoes still remaining in the loser's hand. The first player to accumulate 100 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Babylon's Burning is a near-future, post-apocalyptic skirmish game combining a gritty, atmospheric setting with rules that are both easy to learn and highly realistic.&#10;&#10;The year is 2025 - 10 years after the Hit, the catastrophic meteor impact that tore society apart and set in motion a chain of events that left cities in ruins and 95% of the world's population dead and buried under a blanket of dust and ash. The survivors have banded together for mutual protection, resources are scarce and every other group is either a threat or an obstacle.&#10;The background of the Babylon's Burning game is it's core - not a few paragraphs tagged on to the rules as an afterthought. You're introduced into the game with an extensive history of the Hit and an overview of the world of 2025 and drawn in further with the extensive fiction and the beautifully rendered and atmospheric original artwork that appears throughout.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are detailed but intuitive. This is a skirmish level game suitable for anything from a handful of troops to forty or so miniatures per side. Squads, solo elements (officers, snipers, medics and runners) and support weapons move according to a variable initiative system - there is no waiting around twiddling your thumbs while your opponent moves their entire force and the system is perfect for games with more than 2 players.&#10;&#10;While it uses a fictional setting, Babylon's Burning recognizes the realities of modern combat. In order to come out on top, players need to keep moving, pick their targets well, take advantage of suppression and, most of all, utilize the terrain of tomorrow's shattered cities. This is a game that rewards players who ask themselves &quot;what would I do?&quot; - pushing blindly forward in tight formations is a good way to get very dead, very quickly.&#10;Another advantage of the realistic setting is that there are no &quot;super units&quot; - in the confines of a dark alley, a nail-studded baseball bat is as deadly a weapon as any other...&#10;&#10;The game accommodates a wide selection of faction types - Enclaves, Street Gangs, Mercs, Scavs, Ghouls, Culties, Mobs and Syndicates - all of them complete with their own restrictions and advantages. These factions don't just look different; they play differently too. From well armed Enclave militia built around a crack corps of pre-Hit professionals to street kid gangs moving about the table with dizzying speed on skateboards and roller blades, Babylon's Burning allows the player to choose the faction that best reflects their style of play.&#10;&#10;FEATURES -&#10;&#10;100 pages - looks great in color or black and white&#10;Full-color counters and burst templates&#10;Quick reference sheet and record sheets&#10;Extensive scene-setting fiction by Jay Forster&#10;Beautiful artwork by Elena Vanin, Jim Campbell and Craig Humpston&#10;&#10;REVIEWS -&#10;&#10;&quot;The first thing to strike me was the very well produced and laid out format&hellip;the rules themselves are well thought out [with] plenty of examples interspersed in the text [and] are framed by an engrossing piece of fiction.&#10;&#10;The best point of the rules is simply the fact that they are generic in their outlook - they are intended for use with any figures on the market, so they are not bound to a specific company's miniatures. This is a bonus, because you can use any figures you want, unlike some systems that insist on the sole use of 'official' figures.&quot;&#10;(From the WARGAMES DIRECTORY review)&#10;&#10;&quot;The background material is very plausible and I think well researched as to the possibilities of this occurrence actually happening. I&rsquo;ll not go into details about the background but lets just say it is indeed refreshing from the old nuclear exchange routine and I do think quite believable.&#10;&#10;Gives a multitude of campaign and scenario options&hellip;the gaming possibilities are endless and I have admiration for these guys for the concept being a quite in depth look at what could happen in the near future, and I surmise a lot of thought and research must have gone into the whole planning of the background.&quot;&#10;(From the WARGAMES FORUM review)&#10;&#10;&quot;We've been playing it, and loving it. The game is complex, detailed and easy to learn.&quot;&#10;(From the APOCALYPSE FICTION review)&#10;&#10;&quot;Well produced and nicely laid out...the rules are supplied with a hefty set of appendices detailing the various forces that battle within the futuristic world of Babylon's Burning. There is no need to go out and buy an army book. There is plenty of choice here to keep you interested.&quot;&#10;(From the MINIATURE REVIEW review)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Goola is a advanced adaptation of &quot;Connect Four&quot; with some twists.  Players alternately drop one of their twenty &quot;Goola&quot; beads into one of the five slots in the Goola Tower trying to form a line of 4 or 5 beads of their color in order to accumulate points (1 point for a line of 4 and 2 points for a line of 5).  The twist here is that scoring only happens after all the beads are placed.  After the initial placement, each player then alternately operate one of the five mechanic valves at the bottom of the tower under each slot to make the beads drop one by one out the bottom of the tower.  After each bead drops out, each player count all the points they get for forming lines of 4 or 5 beads of the same color. The player with the higher points scores the difference in points on the scoreboard.  The first player to reach 8 points on the scoreboard wins.  A further twist can be found in the blind-play option built in the Goola Tower.  This advance play is similar to the basic game except that the bead placement is shielded from the players' sight, and the players must reply on memory to calculate where to place their beads.  After all the beads are played, the lock mechanism is released allowing the beads to drop into sight and the game continues as normal.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;40 Goola beads in two colors&#10;1 Goola tower&#10;1 Tower base with scoreboard&#10;2 Goola stickers&#10;1 Rulebook&#10;&#10;",

In the game, you control the climber's hands and feet and also the position of the body in relation to the extremities. Find a way to move upwards choosing spots that are strong enough to support your weight.&#10;&#10;The tiles make up the wall and the coins (suit up) the spots you can hold on to. 4 dice represent your 4 extremities and a pawn your &quot;center of gravity&quot;. When you place an extremity in a spot you can hold on to, you flip the coin and it shows the maximum weight it can support. In addition, the farther an extremity is from the &quot;center of gravity&quot; the less weight it can support too. After moving the die to the new spot, you place it showing the weight it supports. The trick is to support your whole weight between the 4 extremities. Then, move your center of gravity to a new position where you can reach newer spots, finding your way through the wall.&#10;&#10;",

The Greek Army had been unstoppable up to now and the Turks were reeling back to the last stand defenses in the hills just across the Sakarya River. Their morale had taken a serious blow, so serious, that orders were to shoot any Turk soldier caught fleeing during the battle. The Greeks paused for two weeks before advancing across the river, giving the Turks time to build a two lines of defenses. Greek divisions averaged 10,000 men, while Turk divisions averaged 5000. Both sides were feeling the pinch of supply issues, both quite determined to crush the other. If the Greeks won, Ankara, Turkey's new capitol, would fall and perhaps part of Turkey would become part of Greece. The battle and war all reached this pivotal situation, critical to both sides. It would be bloody--over 18,000 died on the hills from August 23 to 30.&#10;&#10;Game scale: 12 hr. turns, battalions. Each hex is around 400 yds. Owners of The Great Attack 1922 will easily assimilate the rules, although there are some new ones to learn.&#10;&#10;The game comes with one 11x17 inch map, 280 counters and rulebook.&#10;&#10;Related game:&#10;Bir Buyuk Turk Saldiri&#10;&#10;",

There are 4 sets of 6 cards with each set having a die value printed on the cards: 1 through 4. The cards within a set have a number of colored pawns on them, 1 through 6, and have to be played onto their 'home' pile in that order.&#10;&#10;The object is to play out all your cards onto the 4 'home' piles while hampering your opponent.&#10;&#10;Card play is done &quot;Shut the box&quot; style, where the eyes on a standard D6 determine the total value of cards that may be played onto their 'home' piles. A [6] rolled allows for another die roll and play of cards.&#10;The pawns printed on the cards come into play when hampering the opponent. When one of the 'home' piles -represented by the dice- reaches the same size -represented by the pawns- as the opponent's identical pile, the opponent has to empty that 'home' pile.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player who 'brings all pawns home' first.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "By August 1919, the British 45th and 46th Battalions, together with over seven river monitors and gunboats mounting up to 9&quot; guns, over 25 aircraft (mostly DH9A bombers) were in place for the final blow on the Red virus known as Bolshevism. By this time, the French and Americans had all left. It was now a British show and one that was destined to leave a bloody nose upon the Reds. At least that was the plan! As the troops gathered along both sides of the Dvina River (the river was very large), the opposing forces were as determined. The Reds fielded the 3rd Brigade\\18th Division amounting to the 160, 161, 162 Regiments, numerous large artillery barges, six fighter aircraft, many gunboats, lots of mines, trenches. The overconfident British had not factored in the effects of Mother Nature, which as the battle wore on, smiled too often on the Red forces. Clearing BOTH sides of this major river ( think Mississippi) and advancing hundreds of miles to Kotlas (the main Red base) in hindsight, seemed like a crazy idea, but at the time, was a tempting objective. And so it was. The Dvina River Offensive had it all: dogfighting aircraft, ground combat, naval surface action, naval bombardment, bombing, machine guns, artillery, river monitors and gunboats, unpredictable river currents, water levels, sandbars, floating mines sent down by the Reds, foul weather, balloons. The offensive lasted four days. One part went extraordinarily well-another part nosedived into hell-both sides get to enjoy this game!&#10;&#10;Game scale is 750 yds a hex, turns are 12 hrs, 10 in all. Ground units are platoons, artillery batteries, single aircraft include: Sopwith, Spad, Avro, DH9A, Re 8, Neuiport, M20 and Short. River ships include: monitors, gunboats, each representing one ship. Ground units include Lewis guns, MG, Stokes mortars, leaders, infantry. There are two game maps, one covers the ground action and the other the air to air combat at a different scale (50 yd a hex). Aircraft are rated for speed, bombing, size, maneuver, altitude. Thus, the game is really two games: an operational ground game, a tactical naval and air to air combat game!&#10;&#10;",

The game is somewhat of a Hearts with a retirement theme, but there are some rule ambiguities that make it unclear.  There are 40 cards, 10 each in 4 suits.  The black &amp; white artwork on each card depicts various advantages to retirement (more time, relaxation, etc.)  The lead player lays down a card.  Players must follow suit if possible, but also &quot;always trying to get red of heart cards first&quot;. It is not clear if this is a rule or strategic advice.&#10;&#10;The person who plays the &quot;highest card in the group&quot; wins, but it is not clear if group refers to cards which followed suit or all cards played. Later, the rules indicate that players could have different numbers of cards in their hand, and that the game ends when one player is out. This seems to indicate that the proper interpretation of the rule that the winner &quot;takes the hand&quot; is that the winner takes the cards from the trick into their hand.&#10;&#10;All cards left in players hands are worth face value, except hearts are worth 10 each. The person with the least points - at the end of one hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;Neither the rules nor the box specify the player count range.&#10;&#10;",

A property can be purchased only by landing on it and each time a player must decide whether to invest his limited funds or to hope for something better among the 28 farms and 9 businesses available along the track. Cheaper properties are easier to develop but have a smaller payoff when landed on by an opponent. (just like Monopoly). Another decision must be made regarding the 3 different kinds of crops that may be planted on each farm. Again cheaper pays off sooner but in smaller amounts. Once the crop is in a player can add farm equipment in the form of plastic &quot;silo sections&quot; which are piled in strict color sequence. Limited quantities of the best crops and the highest silo section adds to the decision making process. A player may mortgage a property to pay debt or to make other investments and can still collect 10% of his normal fee from a visiting opponent. Other features include taxes, becoming incorporated, luck cards which can be disastrous, selling properties to an opponent or the treasury.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Inspiration is one of Wolfgang Kramer&rsquo;s not so well-known games, which he designed together with his wife Ursula. It is a party game in the vein of Taboo or Activity, although the players do not paraphrase terms or play charades. Rather, the players try to solve picture puzzles faster than their opponents. In each round, one of the players acts as the moderator and chooses two picture cards, that together represent a two part noun (e.g. ball game (cards 73 and 20) or treasure chamber (cards 54 and 104)). The player may choose between asking an easy, medium or difficult question. Then the other players try to solve the puzzle, while a sand timer runs down. Depending on the difficulty, the player who calls out the correct answer first, may advance 2, 3, or 4 spaces on the track.  The first player to reach the goal is the winner. &#10;Inspiration features a clever card index box, to keep the picture cards organized and two bookmarks to quickly find where to put back the previously selected cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;Millennium &ndash; the millennium game&rdquo; (as it would be literally - and rather silly - translated into English) is a memory game with a twist meets a historical trivia game. The game board shows an event, an important person or anything characteristic for each decade from 10 to 2000 (with the exception of 500, 1000 and 1500) represented in nice comic art as well as text and arranged in a huge spiral covering almost the complete board.&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players cover 10 of the decades one by one with cardboard disks numbered from 1 to 10, while reading out the year and the accompanying text. E.g. &ldquo;10 Emperor Augustus&rdquo;, &ldquo;1060 William the Conqueror&rdquo;, &ldquo;1190 The third Crusade&rdquo; or &ldquo;1770 The USA&rdquo;. &#10;Each player then gets ten transparent plastic chips. The goal of the game is to get rid of these chips by correctly remembering the events etc. under the numbered cardboard disks. In each turn, initially the player rolls a d12. Then he has to repeat the decade and the text under the corresponding disk. Only if he succeeds, he may return one chip to the box and replace the disk on a new decade; in any case, the next player gets to roll the die. The 11 and 12 on the die have special functions:&#10;When rolling 11, the player may place one of his chips on a cardboard disk of his choice. The next player who rolls the corresponding number has to take this chip before trying to remember what is underneath.&#10;When rolling 12, the player asks the player with the most chips left to remember what is under a disk of his choice. If the other player succeeds, he may place one of his chips on the disk and replace the disk, otherwise, the first player has to solve the task. If he does not succeed either, the player with the most chips may give him one of his chips.&#10;Apart from the material described, Millennium contains a small almanac (30 pg.) with a short description of each decades event, person etc.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Script is the third of the small box games published by Pseudon and is noted with &quot;#3&quot; on the spine, and it is a word game. The game consists of a set of letter tiles each with a number, as in Scrabble. The unique thing about the game is that over the course of the game players must come up with 20 words each beginning with a different letter of the alphabet, and all the words must be different.&#10;&#10;",
