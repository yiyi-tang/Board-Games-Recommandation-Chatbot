On your turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Choose one card that is next to the pawn. Take that card into your area, called your birdhouse. Move the pawn into the space left behind by that card.&#10;    If you divide the flock, place the group with fewer cards on the discard pile. If they are of equal quantity, you decide which group to discard.&#10;    If the pawn is next to only one card, take that card as well. Continue until the pawn is next to at least two cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more cards remain to be claimed. At the end of the game, each player may discard one card from their birdhouse to the discard pile. Check which type of bird appears most frequently in your birdhouse. Resolve the scoring effect of each card that is part of that majority. If two or more types are tied for majority, resolve the scoring effect of each of those cards, so try to keep the types balanced so that you can score as many of your cards as possible.&#10;&#10;By combining two Plume decks, you can have up to four players compete in the same game.&#10;&#10;",

Well, partly.&#10;Forget about joining the two cities with a wonderful infrastructure, just try to use the material as it is ready and build as much as you can!&#10;&#10;Going Further is a very fast solo game, estimated playing time with standard rules is between 1 and 5 minutes (depending on the tiles you have). Its playing speed makes Going Further ideal to be played in group, challenging the score of your mates.&#10;&#10;Going Further, in its standard playing mode, is a tile placement puzzle, as all the tiles are visible to the player. However, every game is different because only 32 randomly selected tiles, out of a 72 deck, are used for a single game.&#10;The objective of the game is to built a continuous road by placing tiles picked from a limited number of available ones. As long as tiles are connected to the road, others become available to be chosen and played. The game ends when no more playable tiles are available.&#10;The player shall choose the best strategy to unlock new tiles and prevent the game to end, while scoring as much points as possible. &#10;In fact, each tile grants a different number of points; the total score consists of the sum of each individual tile points.&#10;Additional points can be added or removed from the total, depending on the achieved road final configuration.&#10;&#10;The game can be customized making it more or less difficult, or by introducing a luck element.&#10;&#10;When more than one person is playing, each player takes his turn as for a solo game. The winner is the player able to score more points, after each one had his chance.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A round ends when the card pile empties. Each player then scores as many points as he succeeded missions. If XIII has an ally, they both share their points and the next player around the player takes on the role of XIII.

All the heroes have movement and attack abilities and a different deck of cards to play their action. The baker can summon new gingerbread every turns.

For that matter, I consider Hecate, referenced by HPL as &quot;Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon&quot; as an Elder Goddess. And also possibly the Magna Mater. So the Elder Gods are clearly able to be inimical.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "At midday on the 31st of October, 1517 in Wittenberg, Germany, an unknown monk named Martin Luther raised to question a total of Ninety-five Theses criticizing the Catholic Church for selling indulgences, among other issues. This courageous act was to become the beginning of the Protestant Reformation that would rock the entirety of Europe.&#10;&#10;In this game, you become one of four celebrated historical reformationists. You and the other reformationists will meddle with each others' affairs, all the while aiming for victory by trying to achieve the as many meaningful results as you can, building your way towards the Reformation.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game, create the action board by placing 12 tiles together in a ring. Each player will receive 5 cooperators and 1 disc. Each player's disc will be placed randomly on a tile on the action board.&#10;&#10;The Luther player starts the game. The active player moves their disc to a tile of their choice that is 1-6 tiles ahead of their current location, moving clockwise.&#10;&#10;If there are other players' discs stacked on top of your disc, keep those discs stacked on top as you move yours. If there are other players' discs below yours, leave those behind. If there is already other players' discs on your destination, stack your disc on top of the others.&#10;&#10;After moving their disc, the active player must place 1 or 2 cooperators in their hand on the destination tile. Each tile has 3 cooperator spaces on which to place a cooperator. The active player can only place their cooperators on empty cooperator spaces on the destination tile.&#10;&#10;During this time, if there is a cooperator placed on all of the cooperator spaces on that tile, an action will be performed. The player with the most cooperators on that tile will perform the action and is called the action player. The action player is not necessarily the active player.&#10;&#10;There are 2 different actions printed on each tile. The action player is allowed to perform both of these actions 1 at a time in the order that they desire. They are also allowed to perform either of the actions or neither of the actions.&#10;&#10;Each player who had a cooperator on the tile for which the action was performed can declare Hallelujah and receive 1 blessing counter each. The action player does not receive a blessing counter through Hallelujah.&#10;&#10;If an action and Hallelujah were performed, all cooperators on the tile will be removed from the cooperator spaces and placed in the center of the game board. If neither was performed, the cooperators will be left on the tile. Either way, the next player becomes the active player.&#10;&#10;However, players that do not own any cooperators can no longer become an active player in this round and will have their turn skipped. Also, if there are no players with a cooperator, and nobody can become an active player, the round ends right then.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, each player can return up to 3 of their own cooperators back to their hand. They can also return as many of their own cooperators placed on tiles as they please.&#10;&#10;6 rounds are played in total. At the end of the 6th round, each player performs 1 action of their choice. Once everybody has performed their final action, the game ends, and points are calculated. The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game comes in a plastic suitcase, with a quite large board, 120 cards and two dice.&#10;&#10;It's a kind of roll and move game, but special rules make the playing time longer and the gameplay more exciting. On certain places of the board there are specific 'challenges' or random 'challenges' according to the card the player takes. Challanges can be solved by a 12-sided die, and even 3 helper cards can add a bonus. For every solved challenge the player gets so called 'Omnitrix' cards.&#10;&#10;Players have to use a 6-sided die for moving, but only the numbers 1, 2 and 3 can be found on it, and if they roll 3 then they may move backward, too.&#10;&#10;The game ends for a player when he/or she reaches the center of the board, however the winner is the player with the most Omnitrix card. So it's a good strategy to move back every time if possible.&#10;&#10;The story according to the prologue from the rulebook is that Ben Tennyson and his team (Kevin Levin and Gwen Tennyson) look for a 4th person to the team. The players compete for this opportunity.&#10;&#10;",

The negative cards usually send a player back spaces due to negative actions (overslept, missed the bus, poor manners, failed to finish work).  The positive cards reward players with advancing spaces for positive actions (on time to work, took a bath, cleaned work area, remembered to use safety equipment).&#10;&#10;The game seeks to reinforce positive work habits and demonstrate the consequences of negative work habits.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to advance to the Steady Job square at the end of the line.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

But be careful, the board is littered with distractions that will make your animals lose focus during the heat of battle. Can you lead your animals to victory?&#10;&#10;Each player gets 10 pieces which are set up hidden from the opponent. Players move on a grid showing several houses and a street from the neighborhood. When two pieces occupy the same square, both players will reveal their piece and play a card adding to its value. The player with the highest total will win the battle. However, if you're fighting in a square with a distraction, you total battle strength will be reduced.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who can occupy his opponent's yard on the far side of the board. This is a lighthearted game that plays quickly and is simple enough for young children but with enough strategy to keep their parents entertained as well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Cats vs Dogs by Chris Hansen is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.&#10;&#10;",

Team spirit and deductions will be required to decrypt these cards using the information provided by players as they play.&#10;&#10;Pick randomly one card of each colour and place them face down in the middle of the table. These six cards are called &quot;encrypted&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the rest of the selected cards and deal them all to the players.&#10;&#10;Important: Players cannot communicate with each other about the cards in their hands. A player can only see the colour of other players' cards by looking at their backs.&#10;&#10;During their turn, a player must perform one of the following two actions: &#10;&#10;     Place a card: The player takes a card from his hand and places it face up in front of the &quot;encrypted&quot; card of his choice, without covering the one (s) already placed. This card can be placed in front of an &quot;encrypted&quot; card of a different colour.&#10;     The player takes a card from their hand and puts it face down in front of them. Players may at any time consult the backs of cards that have been discarded from the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when the players have no more cards in their hands or when all players have successively discarded a card.

Although there are plenty of sci-fi wargames, PMC 2640 has many interesting features which make it unique and very enjoyable.&#10;&#10;PMC 2640 is designed as a &lsquo;true company scale&rsquo; wargame, which means that it runs smoothly both with a few as well as a few dozen units on the battlefield. This was achieved by eliminating sophisticated, but unnecessary special rules, and limiting the number of counters to morale markers only, represented by D6 dice. The ruleset itself is compact and elegant, written in simple, &ldquo;international&rdquo; English, leaving no place for vagueness and multiple interpretations. On the other hand, PMC 2640 offers countless possibilities, as the rulebook contains a few dozen of unit entries, six scenarios and seven terrain generators, all of which ensure that no two games will look the same. The classic alternate activation (with small balancing modifications) makes the game fast and addictive.&#10;&#10;",

If, on your turn, you add a domino with a giant on it to your kingdom, then you must also add a giant token, covering up any one crown of your choosing in your kingdom. If you add a tile with footsteps to your kingdom, then you get to remove a giant token from your kingdom and give it to an opponent, who then covers up a crown in their own kingdom. Covered crowns do not score points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Traditional end-of-game bonuses are also eliminated. Instead, before the start of each game, two challenge tiles are drawn. These provide additional ways to earn points. For example, get 5 bonus points for each lake tile that surrounds your castle or get 20 bonus points if your castle is located in one of the four corners of your kingdom.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Napgammon&quot; is a light weight wargame of luck and maneuver. It takes the core roll-and-move mechanism of Backgammon and applies it to a two-dimensional point-to-point map with differentiated terrain and movement costs. As in Backgammon, players roll two dice at the start of their turn and make one move for each die. Rolling doubles allows four moves, but also enables multiple divisions that begin the turn stacked together to move as one, potentially achieving superior combat odds and an advantageous column shift. Combat is resolved using an odds-based, but completely deterministic, CRT, and losses are permanent. A pool of reinforcements can be brought in from your Capitol city. The game is won by either completely surrounding your opponent's Capitol, or by Eliminating sufficient enemy units that you outnumber them two-to-one.&#10;&#10;This is the second of Hollandspiele's annual holiday mini-games, the first of which (Christmas at White Mountain) gave birth to the successful Table Battles. It will be packed in, free of charge, with any order placed during the 2017 holiday sale containing at least two games. After the sale, it will be made available for purchase as a downloadable PNP game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In between wars players can move troops around, get reinforcements, hire mercenaries, etc.&#10;&#10;Land units are represented by a small set of metal miniatures (included with the game); army strengths are presumably recorded on paper although this is not made very clear. Naval units are represented either by paper counters cut from a possibly-included sheet or by borrowed counters. Historical leaders with special abilities enter and leave the game on a schedule.&#10;&#10;Combat uses a fairly standard CRT but with die roll adjustments provided by players simultaneously choosing maneuvers which are cross-referenced on a separate table.&#10;&#10;In addition to the leaders chrome is provided in the form of special rules for various locations, e.g. Sardinia has a chance of revolting starting on turn 16 unless it has a sufficiently large garrison.&#10;&#10;Much about the game is unclear since Taurus Games' rules were written in a barely coherent stream-of-consciousness style.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
