    "Description": "Card Game is a communal card game where the rules are only limited to the submission requirements. The end goal of the game is defined entirely by the players and the cards they decide to play as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;A Player is/has: 1 Deck, a 4 card starting hand, and a zone to play cards. The cards tell the players everything else, and players must fill in the blanks.&#10;&#10;This game requires you to play it before there is a clear end state, but as long as you follow the instructions of the cards, you will reach it. ~10% of cards contain win and loss scenarios. Normal gameplay revolves around setting up a zone in anticipation for a way to win, and all actions are done with the cards.&#10;&#10;Players draw 1 card per turn, and play cards from their hand. [Places] are played in the player's respective zones, as are [People] and [Things]. [Things That Happen] are played, and then discarded.&#10;&#10;1. Each card has a NAME.&#10;2. Each card has a TYPE (Person, Place, Thing, or Thing That Happens).&#10;&#10;Cards can have any optional keywords alongside their name and type. Common examples include: &#10;Hand, Deck, Zone, Space, Discard, HP, Damage, Can't, Point, Win, Lose, Friend, Draw, Move, Tie, Counter, Opponent, Turn, Player, You, Look, Stack, Game, Card, Flip, Effect, Gain, Choose, Facedown, Drift or any others you may think of.&#10;&#10;Percentages of each card type are constantly changing with every submission and print run.&#10;&#10;This is a collectable card game. All proxies and bootlegs of official &quot;Card Game&quot; cards are legally sanctioned and considered &quot;genuine&quot; cards for casual or constructed play. This includes cards that are altered in terms of effects, art, printing quality, or physical alterations and damage.&#10;&#10;",

To succeed, you must put your workers in harm's way. Bumps and bruises will take their toll and send many loggers to an early grave. But do not despair! Injured workers will enter trade buildings where they become foreman, freeing you up to recruit day laborers, flip flapjacks, or moonlight as an impresario.&#10;&#10;Players who move timber along the supply chain and compete in logging games will earn valuable resources that will help them improve their homesteads. Will you tend to corn and chickens, build bunks and barns, or furnish the river with bridges and rocker boxes? Your chore list is as tall as the day is long! A trip to the trading post will pay huge dividends, while a visit to vaudeville might strand you on skid row.&#10;&#10;So grab your axe and pike, muster your morale and might, then marvel your fellow timbermen with exploits of mythic proportions!&#10;&#10;",

The gravity-defying blocks and pigs and a handheld launcher allow kids to build, launch and destroy like never before! Includes: handheld launcher, planet base station, mounting bracket, 3 popular Angry Birds, 3 pigs, 10 blocks and bonus pieces and 2 x 3M Command strips. Suitable for ages 5+.&#10;&#10;Object:  To score points by knocking down pigs, blocks and bonus pieces to score the most points.Level 1&bull;  Decide who will build the castle on the planet base and who will launch birds to    try and knock it down!&bull;  Build a castle on the Planet Base.  You may design your castle any way you want,     but you must use ALL the blocks, pigs and bonus pieces.&bull;  Launch the birds at the castle.  You get three tries, one for each bird.When launching a bird, hold the launcher in one hand, and then put your finger in the launcher ring to pull it back.  Then let go and watch it fly!&#10;&#10;Any pig you knock off is worth 2 points, and any bonus piece you knock off is  worth one point. NOTE:  if the pig or bonus piece    is still attached to a block when you  knock  it off, it still counts.&bull;  Add up your points, then switch roles so that the player who launched the birds now builds the castle, and the person who built the castle will now launch the birds.&bull;  After both players have had a chance to score points, compare the results.  The player with the highest score wins the round.&bull;  If there is a tie score, the round doesn&rsquo;t count and you must play it over.&bull;  First player to win 2 rounds is the winner!Level 2&bull;  Level 2 is exactly the same game play as Level 1 but the scoring is different.  It&rsquo;s a little more complicated but there&rsquo;s also a      chance for more points!&bull;  Just like in Level 1, you have 3 chances (1 for each bird) to knock things off.  But in Level 2, you also get points for knocking off    blocks!  Also, EVERYTHING is worth more points.&bull;  Pigs are worth 75 points, Long Blocks are worth 50 points, Short Blocks are worth 25 points and Bonus Pieces are worth 10     points. &bull;  Just like in Level 1, compare points to determine the winner of each round.

In a world where bank accounts have lost value, tribute is collected in goods: from tankers - oil, from trawlers - fish, and so on.&#10;&#10;So far, no one has dared to resist the brazen sea racketeers, but there is a limit to everything. When the British Overprotector demanded offshore oil platforms from the Norwegian government, the King-Queen of Sweden stood up for the allied country, threatening nuclear retaliation...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Britain vs. Sweden&#10;Naval and AirLand combat.&#10;OGRE-like structured ships mechanic.&#10;Nuclear weapons available for both opponents.&#10;&#10;",

Players join an epic, centuries-old war for the realm of Quadrenna. Here, four Kingdoms battle over a centrally located territory known as the Wastelands. The main Battlefield of this war is the intersection of these Kingdoms, where each struggles to prevent the other from achieving victory.&#10;&#10;Through their Queens, the four Kingdoms summon Guardians from throughout time and around the galaxy in an attempt to gain control of the Wastelands. The Kingdoms&rsquo; main tools for winning the war are their two Guardians, each of which has unique strengths and weaknesses. Although the Guardians&rsquo; attitudes about being summoned vary, they all loyally serve their Kingdoms and find high honor in their duty.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of 3 phases, in this order: Move, Card, and Action. The Move and Action phases are optional, but the Card phase is required. Both Guardians act during each phase; you can choose the order in which your Guardians act.&#10;&#10;A Kingdom achieves victory when it obtains ownership of the Wastelands. This is achieved one of three ways: kill all enemy Guardians, kill all enemy Kings, or take ownership of the Red Jewel Platform in the center by sacrificing 5 Red Jewels to it after your Kingdom is fully Upgraded.&#10;&#10;",

As you move closer to your opponent you will find new terrain and different weather systems which may help or hinder your progress. When you meet your opponent's army, be ready to attack and/or defend yourself so you can stop or slow down their advances on your homeland. Your survival is based on your success in keeping your opponent from advancing. Your goal is take over their homeland before they take yours.&#10;&#10;In the base game you will start as Viking or knights with other types of people to come later. Each type of person comes with historical aspect to each person on the team.&#10;&#10;This game also comes with a great twist of the dice roll. In a game that would normally have a pair dice to roll and move your army's around you draw cards instead. These cards are call Math dice and they come in different levels of Math. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, division and Algebra and all the choices you could use. Each player would draw a card and have the opponent draw it solve it to get a bonus for each battle.&#10;&#10;So for this game you will learn a little fun history and solve a few math problems. With the upgraded armies to miniatures you gain a great chess set.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Simply set up the boxes in descending order, with the smallest upside down as a target basket. Looks simple, huh? But it takes a steady hand to succeed! Get the ball bouncing down each successive box and you'll know you won. The acoustic design of Box &amp; Balls sounds like a wooden xylophone!&#10;&#10;Select a bounce game and use the numbers on the boxes for scoring; the smaller the box, the more difficult the shot, the higher the number.

As you draw cards and put them into play you'll attack your opponents on their home turf, collecting points along the way. The first to reach a designated number of &ldquo;kill points&rdquo; by destroying the other players' minions is crowned the winner of that game.&#10;&#10;The world of Grimpath is divided into different realms of power: Shadow, Fury, Nature, Honor and the Arcane. These realms make up a broad array of strange creatures, spells, and magical items that you can combine to bring your own unique flavor to the battleground. Your minion&rsquo;s mastery in these realms and the construction of your deck will determine how well it can perform during play. Players are encouraged to get creative by mix and matching cards as much as they like. But be mindful when constructing decks so that your minions will be able to perform the abilities you give them with the cards you chose.&#10;&#10;Grimpath is a game designed to bring your fantasy miniatures to life by accompanying them with colorful artwork and abilities provided by your cards during play. The base game will provide you with everything you need for a match of Grimpath including miniatures, but players are encouraged to dive into the hobby and to bring their own custom creations to the table to face off against each other.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s up to you to choose to fight alongside the citizens of Grimpath in the endless war against the darkness that plagues their world&hellip; or to help it spread&hellip; The choice is up to you and your deck of cards and mini&rsquo;s!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Building off of Mark Herman and Volko Runke&rsquo;s legendary game Fire in the Lake, the Sovereign of Discord Expansion provides a prequel to the events depicted in the base game, covering the years 1961-1963. The expansion allows players to see how the war escalated from an insurgency between ARVN and Viet Cong, assisted by the US and North Vietnam, to the eventual conventional interventions by North Vietnam and the United States at the start of the base game. New scenarios allow players to extend the game backward to 1961 right after the formation of the Viet Cong, or to 1963 during the tumultuous last year of the Diem regime. Players owning both expansions, Sovereign of Discord and Fall of Saigon, will be able to experience the full Indochina War from 1961 to 1975. This allows players to see how the war evolved from the lower intensity insurgency of the Diem period all the way to the massive conventional offensives of the last years of the war. A copy of Fire in the Lake will be necessary to play the Sovereign of Discord expansion.&#10;&#10;New mechanics are introduced to reflect the war prior to escalation by the US and North Vietnam and the unique aspects of the Diem Regime:&#10;&#10;     1961 and 1963 Scenarios with a Fall of Diem Sequence allow players to continue play into the Fire in the Lake Campaign Scenario (1964-1972), or even through to Fall of Saigon (1973-1975) if players also possess the sequel expansion.&#10;     New ARVN Strategic Hamlet pieces and mechanics reflect the Diem regime&rsquo;s strategy of relocating the population into fortified villages.&#10;     Hanoi and Washington Tracks control the number of available pieces and some abilities of the Viet Cong and ARVN factions. In addition, rather than possessing Troops, the US and NVA each use Advisor pieces, which allow them to enhance and control the units of their South Vietnamese allies.&#10;     A Regime Stability Track affects the cost of ARVN Operations to model the rising urban instability and coup plotting against the Ngo Dinh Diem regime.&#10;     A head-to-head 2 player scenario uses the Initiative system from Brian Train&rsquo;s Colonial Twilight for players wanting to focus on the internal clash between the Viet Cong and ARVN, and might also be suitable as an introductory scenario for players new to Fire in the Lake.&#10;     72 new Events cover the 1961-1963 period, and four new Pivotal Events represent debates in Washington and Hanoi over their level of aid, the Strategic Hamlet Program by the Diem regime, and the major summer offensive by the Viet Cong. In addition, a new ARVN leader Card, Ngo Dinh Diem, is in play throughout the early 1960s scenarios and new Coup! Events reflect threats to Diem&rsquo;s hold on power.&#10;     A solitaire system using the card-based Non-player system, similar to those provided with the Tr&rsquo;ung Bot Update Pack and Fall of Saigon. &#10;&#10;&#10;Fire in the Lake Bonus Content&#10;In addition to extending Fire in the Lake back to the early 1960s, Sovereign of Discord also includes additional bonus content for the base game: &#10;&#10;     40 new Events (8 new 1964 Events, 16 new 1965 Events, 16 new 1968 Events) covering themes such as women&rsquo;s role in the war, civilian victimization, the effect of the war on South Vietnamese society, North Vietnamese strategies, and the 1964 escalation debate. Among the new Events is also one new Capability Event for each faction.&#10;     Two new short scenarios:&#10;         Turning Point (1967 to 1969), covering the period of fiercest offensives by both communist and allied forces to win control of the countryside.&#10;         Long 1964 (Mid 1963 to Early 1965), covering the period that historian Frederick Logevall refers to as the &ldquo;long 1964,&rdquo; representing the crucial escalation debates in North Vietnam and the United States.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Then he turns the card over to see what instructions he has to follow. This are fairly predictable; Miss a turn perhaps, roll the die and move backwards, and so on. The player then takes the card and keeps it in front of him where all the players can see it. The card will have a value ranging from 5 to 30, with the value being commensurate with the penalty value of the instruction on it. If a subsequent player lands on a numbered field that has already been taken, then he treats the space as a normal space without number.&#10;&#10;When the numbered space 30 has been reached, that player has finished.

After that the players guess the number of connected pieces on top of a pylon of their choice (i.e. the left most pylon consists of a 3-piece nugget, a single piece nugget and another 2-piece nugget on top). If they guessed the correct number they receive the nugget. If they are incorrect they discard that nugget.&#10;&#10;After all nuggets are either taken or discarded the player with the most nuggets wins.&#10;&#10;",

Tricks are won by the highest card in the lead suit, or the highest trump card if any trump cards are played.&#10;&#10;The soloist wins points for tricks, attempting to win the amount that they had bid in the auction phase.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after several hands wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
