    "Description": "Steal This Game was designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi on the spot at SPIEL 2016 after an unfortunate incident left the publisher a full cash box short.&#10;&#10;This nanogame, playable by two players in five minutes or less, fits on a postcard (with two dice supplied by the players). The players take turns being robbers and exhibitors at a board game trade fair &mdash; rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.&#10;&#10;The exhibitor tries to hide cash in one of the cash boxes and keep it hidden - shell game style. The robber secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves to gain more information about the location of the cash and move the clerk away from the full cash box. If the exhibitor catches the thief in a lie, the thief must immediately risk stealing from a cash box without additional information.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to win by playing runs of 3 or more, 3 or 4 of a kind, or melds (or watching players having to meld) to your tableau (the winner's tableau must be the amount of the initial hand + 1 more card) and running out of cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;The active player may use the the obligatory drawn card to lay down a run  or 3+ of a kind. Your tableau may be arranged in to different melds or runs to accommodate new arrangements. When a set or multiple sets are laid a card must be discarded. If a card is passed, then next player clockwise and likewise is able to utilize the card. If during the same turn someone utilizes the discards (thus laying down sets and ending with another discard) then the process repeats. If no one has won, then the next player clockwise from the current active player continues with a draw.&#10;&#10;Any cards melded to another player's tableau allow the opposing player to discard a card.&#10;&#10;",

A while back, Guillaume showed us a prototype of a game in which players had to find English expressions through their literal French translations - averaging about two clues per phrase. This idea, highly innovative in terms of a game, went over very well in tests. We were reminded of the book &quot;Sky my Husband&quot;, which was based on a similar idea (it included literal French translations of English phrases) - and sold over 200,000 copies over the last 10 years. It seemed logical to us, then, to contact the book's author, Jean-Loup Chiflet. He was excited by the concept and helped us out greatly with the content, as well as getting permission from the book's publisher to use the same title.&#10;&#10;In the game, 460 expressions, each with two clues, are read out by a player. The object of the game is to deduce the original English phrase the fastest. As an example, one English phrase is &quot;Tie-break&quot;. The literal French translation &quot;Repos de cravate&quot; (Resting tie) is provided, along with two clues: Tennis and Deciding Game.&#10;&#10;",

Take one card from the top of one deck, and insert it face-down halfway through that deck.&#10;&#10;All players compete at the same time. One player rolls a die that has one of the six animals on each face. The first player to yell out the name of the animal rolled will score &ndash; except if that animal is on one of the face-up cards; in this case, players must yell out one of the animals not visible on the top of the decks, with the first player doing so scoring &ndash; except for the final rule for animal calling, that being that the animal named correctly in the previous round cannot be called out in the current round, even if it would otherwise be correct. If two or more players yell an animal's name correctly at the same time, they all score. (The largest correct animal is the one that players cannot name in the subsequent round.)&#10;&#10;If you score, you either:&#10;&#10;    Take one card from the top of one face-up deck and place it in front of you, or&#10;    Turn all the face-up cards in front of you face down to make them safe.&#10;&#10;&#10;Safe for what, you may ask? If you call out an animal incorrectly, you must discard all face-up cards in front of you; if you have no face-up cards, then you must turn one safe card (if you have any) face up to put it at risk again.&#10;&#10;Once the face-down card in the deck appears, you split this deck to create a third face-up pile, increasing the difficulty of the game. Once all the cards have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

There are two decks, one full of fallacious arguments, and the other full of everything else - which includes logic to debunk the arguments, ways to improve your hand (such as resurrecting a card from the discard pile), and, most importantly, ways to mess with your opponent (such as making them skip their go). It&rsquo;s very simple to learn, but hard to master&hellip; like logic itself.&#10;&#10;There are 2 decks, 1 full of fallacious arguments, and 1 full of everything else. Place 1 argument in the middle and then deal 5 cards to each other.&#10;&#10;On your turn you can play as many cards as you like. For example, you could debunk two of the fallacies committed by the argument, discard a card from your opponent, and make your opponent skip their turn. Opponents may have cards which burn your logic or block your actions.&#10;&#10;Once the argument is fully debunked, players receive one point per fallacy they successfully laid, plus 1 point for the player who finished the argument, and then the next argument is placed in the middle (giving the player who finished the previous argument first dibs).&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more arguments to debunk, and the sweet song of reason finally echoes peacefully. The player with the most points wins and the player with the least points believes in anything and everything!&#10;&#10;",

Establish your land and plant your seed. Watch your seeds sprout turn into plants, than finally transform into tasty fruits and vegetables! Who will be the first in complete the job? Can you hamper or even block your opponent's work? Make good use of the &quot;Tractor&quot; and you will be the winner! The Vege Tables playing deck consists of 4 series of cards (coloured red, green, black, yellow) numbered from 1 to 20 and 8 Jokers card (&quot;Tractors&quot;) giving a total of 88 cards.&#10;&#10;Vege Tables is a true card game, like Spades or Hearts: at each turn a player can use all the cards he wants, but at least one must be used, in order to terminate all the cards dealt in the game preparation. The basic strategy is to hold the cards needed by the opponents, avoiding to open the sequences which can help other players&hellip; but opportunities to score points during the game can drive players to very different strategic approaches.&#10;&#10;The game is for 4 players, but on the website you can find (and download for free) the rules for three a and five, the chess-like version for 2 players, the tournament variations and the play in partnership. Vege Tables is a mathematic game with very simple rules but to become a great player is not so easy...&#10;&#10;",

By cleverly choosing when to go on the offensive with your knights, and by spending gold on special units like vassals, bishops or catapults, you can gain the upper hand in this strategic card battle between two medieval lords.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Both players receive a deck consisting of the same cards.&#10;    Players start the game with 7 cards in their hand.&#10;    Players take turns after each other, switching between offensive and defensive roles.&#10;    Attacking player may choose to attack or draw new cards.&#10;    Defending player may choose to defend.&#10;&#10;&#10;To attack your opponent's castle die, choose up to four knight cards &ndash; which have 1-3 attack points &ndash; from your hand and place them face down in front of you. The defending player may choose to defend his castle by playing up to four cards from his hand face down in front of him. Whoever has the most combined attack points wins the battle &ndash; but both the attacking and defending player can use special cards, which cost gold, to turn the tide:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Feint: lets you temporarily remove your opponent's strongest Knight Card.&#10;    Vassal: doubles the combined attack points of your Knight Cards.&#10;    Bishop: steals your opponents strongest Knight Card.&#10;    Catapult: deals 10 damage directly to opponents castle die.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the attacking player doesn't attack he may draw cards from his deck in one of two ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Large Draw: if you have less than 7 cards on hand, draw up to 7.&#10;    Precise Drawif you have 7 or less cards on hand: discard 1 card, then draw 2 cards and pick one to take on hand.

It's fun to mix them up!  Arrange the 27 picture cards face down on the table.  Roll the color dice.  If the colors rolled match the 2 colors of a turtle and its shell, you get to choose a card.  With any luck the card will match one of the 3 turtles.  If not, place the card face down again.  It's the next player's turn.  As cards are revealed, players are challenged to remember them.

Players are trying to arrange their path cards so that all paths connect, while trying to make the arrangement of their path cards match the pattern on the assignment card. The first player who does this correctly wins the round and takes a treasure card. The game ends after four rounds, and the player with the most treasure wins.&#10;&#10;",

The invasion posed a number of problems for the Soviet high command. The German defenses were organized in depth, and consisted of powerful permanent fortifications, a series of trench lines and anti-tank ditches, artillery emplacements, etc. In addition, the terrain was difficult, laced with lakes, rivers, marshes and canals.&#10;&#10;The two attacking Soviet fronts mustered between them some 3,800 tanks and assault guns, 25,000 artillery pieces, 3,00 aircraft and 1.2 million assault troops. Opposing them were 780,000 Germans, with 8,200 cannon, 700 to 800 tanks, and about 775 planes. Bolstering the defense were such elite units as the Hermann Goering and Gross Deutschland Divisions. With the Germans fighting on their own soil, and the Soviets determined to deliver the death blow to the Third Reich, the scene was set for what became the most bitter fighting since Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;LAST BATTLES: EAST PRUSSIA, 1945 -- from PEOPLE'S WAR GAMES via CoSi via 3W.

Leave some space on the table for a Play Pile and a Discard Pile.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;Choose a player to go first and rotate clockwise. They can play any card to start the Play Pile.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you must match or beat the top card of the Play Pile. You may play more than one of the same number or face card on your turn. Higher numbered cards beat lower numbered cards. Special Llama cards have their own rules. You can find these rules on the cards themselves or on the Llama Hierarchy instruction card.&#10;&#10;If four cards of the same number or face are played in a row (either in one turn or over consecutive turns), the Play Pile is discarded and the last player plays again. When the Play Pile is empty, a player can play any card to restart the Play Pile.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, if you have fewer than five cards, draw cards from the Draw Pile to have five in your hand. If on your turn you can't play a card, pick up the Play Pile (yes, the entire Play Pile) and add it to your hand, ending your turn.&#10;&#10;Special Rule:&#10;Four cards of the same value played in a row discards the current play pile from the game.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;Once the Draw Pile runs out, your objective is to get rid of all of your cards. Once your hand is empty, you must play your face-up cards. If none are playable, choose one, and add it to the Play Pile. This pile will become your brand new hand! Yes, you have a hand again. Aren&rsquo;t llamas fun?&#10;&#10;If you pick up cards, you must finish the cards in your hand before you can play your face-up cards again. Once you play all your face-up cards, you must attempt to play your face-down cards, without looking at them. If the card you flip fails, you must pick up the Play Pile with that card, ending your turn. You must once again finish the cards in your hand before you can play your face-down cards again.&#10;&#10;The first player to finish all of their cards wins!&#10;&#10;Card Types:&#10;Numbered Llamas -  Numbered Llamas can be played on themselves, lower number llama cards and some special llama cards.&#10;&#10;Baby Llama -   The Baby Llama can be played on any card.  The next player can then play any card.&#10;&#10;Shy Llama -   Shy Llama can be played on any card other than Big Llama.  The next player can then only play Numbered Llama cards 1-4 or other special llama cards other than Big Llama.&#10;&#10;Big Llama -   Big Llama can be played on any card other than Shy Llama.  The next player can then only play other special llama cards other than Shy Llama.&#10;&#10;Magic Llama -   Magic Llama can be played on any card.  It discards the play pile and allows the player to play a second card, thus starting a new play pile with any card.&#10;&#10;Ghost Llama -   Ghost Llama can be played on any card.

    "Description": "THE RUSSIAN FRONT&#10;THE SOVIET UNION vs GERMANY&#10;&#10;Frustrated by the stalemate in the west, Hitler turns his fierce ambitions eastward. But standing in his way is an empire with vast resources, determined people, and a leader whose lust for power and ruthlessness could be Hitler's match. The Soviet Union rises to the challenge with great tenacity and a seemingly endless supply of soldiers willing to give their lives for the state. Can the Red Army overwhelm the Wehrmacht? Can the Luftwaffe hold the skies against the growing Red Air Force? Will Hitler or Stalin be victorious in the largest single battle-front in all of history? You make the orders, you choose the targets, and you reap the glorious victory or the final defeat!&#10;&#10;Battlecards is a card game in which you and your opponent(s) build up forces and conduct battles in many of the&#10;great conflicts in history. This particular starter set deals with the Pacific Theater during World War II. The game consists of 154 card set. Based upon the draw of Conflict cards, players may build forces, learn about their opponent, gain a secret advantage, or enter into a battle.

In addition, 20-card expansion packs are available to improve the selection and capabilities of Arsenal cards and Conflict cards for this set. Additionally, this set can be combined with the other World War II Starter Sets so you and your friends may play the entire war as you please.&#10;&#10;",

For two players, the Head-to-Head Mode urges players to pile up their Pixit cubes, pick a card, and then twist, turn and tip their 16 cubes into place to be the first to recreate the pixelated image shown on the card.&#10;&#10;For Solo play, create images as fast as possible against the clock, and the aim is to beat your best time! Alternatively, the Memory Mode is for 2&ndash;6 players, in which one player is the builder and must recreate the image as the other players guess what is being formed. Each player has only one chance to guess what is being built, and if a player guesses incorrectly, they are out for that round. The faster you guess, the more points you win!&#10;&#10;Whether Pixit is played in teams, in pairs or as a solo activity, each mode is exceedingly addictive and gets tremendously tense as the Pixit cubes twist and turn. With each game taking between 15 and 30 minutes to play, it&rsquo;s the perfect entertainment for a long journey or a cosy afternoon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Imagine if Guess Who and Red Flags had a spooky baby. That would be this game!&#10;&#10;One player will be acting as a Ghost, looking to get a little lively with the living.  They will draw a Ghost Profile card and learn their secret identity before shuffling it with 7 other profile cards and placing them face up on the table in view of all players in a 2 x 4 grid. All the other players will be acting as Mediums looking to be the first to correctly guess the ghost player&rsquo;s identity from among the 8 face up Ghost Profile cards on the table. They will do this by asking the Ghost player questions using S&eacute;ance cards.&#10;&#10;However, the Ghost has a hard time communicating across the veil and will be restricted in how they share their information based on the s&eacute;ance performed. The types of s&eacute;ances may require the ghost to knock their answers, use charades, make faces, or use non-verbal sounds to clue the mortal morsels in to their identity. There are limited chances to perform these rituals and if you take too long, the Ghost thinks you're playing games and the round will end.&#10;&#10;When a Medium thinks they know who the Ghost is they can tap the card on the board.  If they tap correctly, they successfully hooked up and both they and the Ghost score a point.  If they tap the wrong Ghost, they have made an awkward misjudgment and won't be able to guess again this round.&#10;&#10;Then the Medium to the left of the Ghost becomes the next Ghost and play continues in this manner until someone has 5 points and is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the roles of various monsters from horror movie lore, and compete for the most prized victims &ndash; when the sun rises, the player with the most total point&rsquo;s worth of victims wins!&#10;&#10;Create a stack of six &quot;victim cards&quot; and compete to kill the top victim card in each of the six rounds by creating a gruesome tale with your murder cards explaining what you intend to do to said victim.  Story cards numbered 1 to 6 that describe just how you intend to pummel them to death and with what, where, your ritual, when you'll stop the pummeling, and why you finally decide they're dead.  But as you weave your tale other players might add on to you story with frustrating &quot;But&quot; cards that nullify part of your plan.  Every time you play a card, you must read the entire story aloud which is really where this game shines, however other than a good laugh, the story you weave is irreverent for the victory, as the player with the most cards (1 thru 6, only one of each number may be in play per player) claims the victim. Different victims have different points, and and the end victim points are added up to see who wins the game.&#10;&#10;Look it's a cheerleader, I'm going to skin her, with a chainsaw, in a creepy motel, while laughing maniacally, until the prophecy is complete, because she knows too much.  But..... you won't be using that chainsaw because she knows your secret weakness!&#10;&#10;",

After latching, the tray springs when a mechanical timer expires.  The tray has 24 slots lined in a spiral path; the final slot (in the centre) is labeled with the word UNO.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the tray is latched and the timer wound up.  Each player draws five tiles and keep their hand secret from the others.  The first player places a numbered tile in the first slot on the tray and starts the timer.  Continuing with the next player in sequence, the players follow the standard UNO rules in playing their tiles (color succeeds color, number succeeds number, draw when unable to play, etc).  They also have to say &quot;Madness&quot; to signify the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;Play stops when a player has played his or her last tile, has played a tile on the last slot, or when the timer expires.  In the first two cases, the player records his score (according to UNO rules, summing up values of the tiles in other players' hands) and the game is reset (tiles reshuffled and redrawn, etc).  For the last case, everybody keeps their hand and the player who has yet to finish his or her turn when the board has sprung draws four more tiles.  Play then continues.  The game ends after a certain accumulated score has been reached or a certain number of rounds have been played.&#10;&#10;",

Players jointly contribute to the construction of the cave.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to finish alive with the most experience points gained during the race.&#10;&#10;Each turn, player's put a small part of the cave on the table, representing either the ceiling or the floor of the cave. By doing so, a long small cave is created on which different dangerous objects or animals (vampiric bat, giant centipedes, laser beams, etc) are shown. During movement the bat-planes fly either along the cave ceiling or along the cave floor until they arrive at a cave and have to encounter its horrors. The dice-fight that follows during an encounter can be won (experience points are gained) or lost, depending on the strength and equipment of the bat-plane. Players can strengthen their bat-planes by upgrading various parts of their plane (shields, short-range attack, plate armor, power, maneuverability and navigation &amp; control), however only at specific locations in the cave. Players can not only invest their money in upgrades, they can also decide to buy long-range missiles or booster fuel. The long-range missiles can be used to shoot rivals, caves and obstructions. Booster fuel is used to outmaneuver other players by playing an extra turn or to move diagonally. Some cave locations also offer the possibility to explore the local environment, and with a bit of luck player's  might find special upgrades there.&#10;&#10;Each game, the layout, the length and the difficulty of the cave is different. It is a tactical game, thrilling to the last turn, based on a few simple rules, in a steampunk sci-fi technological world, where players have to continually cope with limited resources.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cinelinx is a fast paced card game of connecting movies, actors, genres and more together to form cohesive links between them. With a dynamic play area based on every card played, the game constantly adapts itself to film fans of any level of skill or knowledge. Want to throw a wrench into things? Director's Cut cards can often hinder your friends or change the rules to keep things interesting. Now you finally have an outlet for that wealth of movie trivia building up in your brain!  &#10;Cinelinx is a new take on movie trivia games and is the perfect way to test your movie knowledge and challenge your friends during your next movie or game night!&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;1) Separate Director&rsquo;s Cut cards from the main deck and set them aside nearby. Then shuffle the main deck and allow each player to draw 10 cards.&#10;2) An anchor card is needed to start the game. We recommend locating a genre card from the main deck and dropping it in the center of the table to begin. The remaining genre cards should stay in the deck to be drawn randomly during gameplay.&#10;3) Decide amongst yourselves who will go first, and then continue playing clockwise.&#10;4) Players should take turns connecting cards in their hands to cards in play. Players can only play ONE card during their turn, unless instructed otherwise by a Director&rsquo;s Cut card.&#10;Tip: Cards can be dropped vertically or horizontally and connected to any open side of a card in play. The reels that are formed as cards connect should not touch unless a valid connection is made.&#10;&#10;5) Connections must be verbally announced to be considered valid. A connection can be defined as the relationship between two cards. See our official rulebook for complete connection details.&#10;Example announcement: &ldquo;Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio can be connected because they were both in &lsquo;The Wolf of Wall Street&rsquo;. &ldquo;&#10;&#10;6) During their turn, if a player does not have a playable card in their hand they can DRAW a card and play it immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card in their hand they can draw a second time and play the card immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card then their turn is over. &#10;Instead of drawing, if a player cannot play a card in their hand they can choose to SWAP up to three cards in their hand with three random cards from the main deck. Once a player has swapped cards their turn is immediately over. A player can only SWAP once per game. Cards that are discarded should be placed back into the main deck.&#10;7) A connection can be challenged at any time.&#10;8) The first person to shed their full hand wins.&#10;&#10;Director&rsquo;s Cut&#10;During gameplay, when someone plays a Directors card from their hand they are allowed to draw from the Director&rsquo;s Cut deck and should follow the instructions on the card they draw. Most Director&rsquo;s Cut cards can be played immediately. &#10;Challenging a play&#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven VALID then the challenger must either draw a card or lose a turn. The player who was challenged can decide which option the challenger should proceed with.&#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven INVALID then the player who was challenged must take their card back and draw an additional card. Their turn ends immediately after they draw.&#10;&#10;Download the Cinelinx Rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Calling on villagers and peasants the Lords mount armies worthy of their kingdoms. Defenses are fortified and new attack forces enter into play, such as the terrifying cavalry and destructive war machines.&#10;&#10;You can resist the enemy by building new strongholds. But watch out for the ever-present black plague; it can hit at any time, eliminating your armies and hindering the expansion of your kingdom.

Raising an army, recruiting new troops, building new defenses, fortifying your city and laying siege to your enemy are some of the challenges ahead. By building a diversified army and carrying out secret missions, you can amass great power to become Lord of the entire realm.&#10;&#10;",
