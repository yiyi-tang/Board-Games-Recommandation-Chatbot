    "Description": "A game to help very young children (Ages 4 - 6) learn to count. Game develops counting and pattern recognition skills.&#10;&#10;Each player takes on the role of a seal catching fish.&#10;&#10;Role a die (value 1-3) and move around a track on the edge of the board (with a wooden seal figure) which depicts patterns found on fish in the middle of the board. After moving, a player must find/identify all the fish in the middle of the board with the pattern corresponding to the space on the track they have landed on. The players then collect a number of small wooden fish equal to the number of fish they have found. When all the wooden fish are collected the game ends and the player with the most fish wins.&#10;&#10;The game also includes rules and extra equipment for a slightly more involved game (requiring just a touch more counting skills).&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&quot;The little sea lions frolic  about at the pool edge. They hunt, catch, count and share many little fish. The colorful game board converts counting into an exciting search game.&#10;&#10;A game for 2-4 little sea lions ages 4 and up. Two simple game ideas for an exciting first approach to the numbers 1-10.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

When he has done his stunt, he gives the board to any lady he chooses for the next stunt.

The game comes with 5 playing pieces, 5 travel cards, 16 plan cards, a score card, dice, one marble, Tom Swift cards, a playing board and a Polar Ray Gun.&#10;Players try to make a complete tour around each of the four travel areas of the board in an effort to get a plan from each of those areas.&#10;&#10;There is also a ray gun in this game. It is used to shoot a marble into a area with holes valued with differing points.&#10;&#10;Once a player has gone through all sections and has a plan from Space, Air, Land and Undersea and returns his travel card his turns ends. On the next turn he puts the pieces of the plan together, takes a shot with his ray gun either for more score or to end the game.&#10;&#10;",

The gameboard has a series of turntables on it, which can be rotated so as to alter the paths in front of the players: the skillful manipulation of the turntables lies at the heart of the game. Each turn the player's piece (a small racing car) moves 1,2,3, or 4 squares forwards, at the player's discretion. If he lands on a space with black dots, he can rotate a turntable anywhere on the board, either to clear his path to the finish line or to hinder someone else. The Finish squares when reached give you points, and then you return to the start, only winning when you have 100 pts. It is possible to become completely trapped in an area with no black dots, and this carries a penalty of 20 pts and return to start. &#10;The theme is pasted on, but the deduction and 'screwage factor' involved should appeal to many.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the web page-&#10;&#10;Overview:&#10;The Mayan calendar is one of the oldest and most accurate calendar systems in human history. Using no more than their knowledge of the Earth, Sun, and stars, the Mayans were able to tabulate days, weeks, months, and years from 3113 BC until December 21, 2012 AD. No one knew why the Mayan calendar ended on that date..&#10;&#10;On December 22, 2012, a small asteroid swung in from the outer solar system and clipped the moon.&#10;&#10;For over a year astronomers had been tracking the asteroid, but due to its small size had not thought it a serious threat. It proved, however, to have a much higher density than expected. Its impact with the moon imparted a distinct 'wobble' to the lunar orbit and ejected megatons of lunar material into Earth orbit.&#10;&#10;Scientists estimate the moon's orbit will return to normal in a few years. But, its erratic orbit will have catastrophic effects on Earth's biosphere during the first year. By the end of 2013, all life on the six northern continents will be extinct.&#10;&#10;Welcome to mankind's last year&hellip;&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are available:  A PDF (Print and Play) version and a Vassal version.&#10;&#10;",

Players proceed through law school; the nitty gritty of running a law practice (hiring a secretary, paying office rent); and the ups and downs of bringing a case (preparing papers for court, going to trial). Players also land on spaces, where they are directed to pick cards describing all sorts of interesting and amusing (and family-friendly) case scenarios.&#10;&#10;When a card is chosen, a player must decide whether to accept the result or appeal it. On an appeal, a player may double or even triple his award -- or lose some or even all of it.&#10;&#10;Instead of advancing when it's their turn, players may also choose to settle a case by drawing a Settlement card. Like appealing, settling a case can result in gaining -- or losing -- part or all of one's winnings.&#10;&#10;Players may also double the stakes by buying into a partnership. All awards and costs are doubled for partners. Whether or not to become a partner is therefore a key strategic decision, and adds to the suspense and intrigue, as everyone wonders whether it will pay to have become one.&#10;&#10;",

A port has two ways of moving: It can either reorient (that is, spin so that its right angle is flush with any corner of the space it occupies), or it can glide across the board like a chess rook. A port forms a teleport by landing on a square with another of its color, with each right angle in opposite corners of the square. A teleport enclosing an enemy pole sends the pole back to one of its home spaces.&#10;&#10;A pole teleports between any two of the following:  friendly teleports, home spaces, and goal spaces (except that a pole can only teleport to a goal space from another goal space). Poles can be blocked by port walls or other poles, but they can also move between the board's left and right edges as if the edges were connected. A pole completely blocked by the opponent teleports home.&#10;&#10;",

The big difference is that bankrupt players, though they can no longer win, are not eliminated; they instead go on &quot;Swellfare&quot; and are given rubber checks with which to pay their rents.  To win the last solvent player must pass the start/finish line with at least $100.  This is hard to accomplish and most games end with everybody losing.&#10;&#10;",

The players are members of a jury who get to examine evidence against an accused person. They each then try to unravel the case and decide if the defendant is guilty or innocent.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Each series of The Jury Box comes complete with six different court cases that you get to solve. The cases have an outline with state's evidence against the defendant, along with two pictures of the crime scene and ballots for the jurors to cast their verdicts. You even get the actual solutions to these realistic cases.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

In scoring the player caught out gets a letter marked against then, first the letter &ldquo;S&rdquo; then &ldquo;N&rdquo; and so on the game ends when one player goes out having spelled SNATCH, the winner being the player with the fewest letters. The second difference is that a greater number of sets are used in play compared to the number of players. 3 players 5 sets, 4 players 7 set and for the rest it also uses 3 more sets than players.&#10;&#10;",

Additionally it can be played as a parlor game (when the dice are used) or as a skill game without dice. The game is either for 2 players or for 4 players in which case two teams are formed.&#10;&#10;First players choose which type of game is played and then they set game pieces on the board depending on the size of the board used. There are round and square pieces with different heights. In the parlor game the dice is used to tell whether the player may move round or square piece or if the player misses his/her turn. The object of the game is to reach the other players end of board or to eat the other player's every piece.&#10;&#10;In the skill game the dice is not used.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;IntroductionSymbio is a game where each player's groups of cells, or pieces, attempt to surround each other. It was inspired by the immune system's ability to surround pathogens.&#10;&#10;Two players, Black and White, take turns to either place or move one of their pieces adjacent to another of their pieces, on an 8x8 board. In order to make a move, the players' formations of pieces must have an open space adjacent to them. The game ends when one player can no longer make a move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;. A body is an adjacent set of pieces of the same colour. A foreign body is an opponent's body. A body has freedom if at least one of its pieces is adjacent to an empty square.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayAt the start of the game, Black pieces are placed on b6, b7, c7, f2, g2 and g3, and White pieces are placed on b3, b2, c2, f7, g7 and g6.&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must first move one of their bodies and then add a piece to the board adjacent to one of their bodies.&#10;&#10;The movement of a body involves taking a piece from the body and moving it to a different square adjacent to the body (including squares adjacent to the piece itself). A body cannot move unless it has freedom.&#10;&#10;A body's move may land on a foreign body piece, thus removing it from the board, if that foreign body has no freedom.&#10;&#10;A player wins if their opponent cannot add a piece next turn. This will occur if the opponent has either no remaining pieces on the board or no remaining bodies with freedom.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesThe movement rules result in a pseudopod-like movement which may split a body into two smaller bodies (meiosis). Conversely, movement may result in two or more bodies coalescing.&#10;&#10;Players should strive to surround foreign bodies and eat them away while giving their own bodies as much freedom as possible. Keeping a foreign body surrounded ties up pieces.&#10;&#10;It is thought that cycles cannot occur due to the addition of a piece per turn. Neither player can move on a full board, but the player to place the last piece must by definition win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "How do you win a game if you have more control over your opponents&rsquo; pieces than your own? Figure out the answer in Snowblind, a quasi-strategic Icehouse game for 4 players.&#10;&#10;Object: To maximize your score and minimize your opponents&rsquo; scores by putting pieces in taller and smaller stacks, respectively.&#10;&#10;You Need:&#10;&#10;* Four Icehouse stashes of different colors.&#10;    * An opaque bag (or other opaque container).&#10;    * A 4&times;3 grid. A Volcano board or chess board with some squares blocked off works just fine.&#10;    * Some paper and a pencil for tallying scores at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;On your turn, take a piece out of the bag and put it on the board. When you put a piece on the board, it must point upward. Pieces are played by these rules:&#10;&#10;* Any piece may be placed in a vacant space.&#10;    * A smaller piece may be 'engulfed' by a larger piece if the smaller piece is resting directly on the board.&#10;    * A piece of smaller or equal size may be placed on another piece of equal or greater size.&#10;&#10;Once you have placed a piece, play passes to the left. The game ends when all pieces have been played. After this, all the stacks are scored. Stacks have a value equal to the point value of the pieces in the stack, multiplied by the number of pieces in the stack. Points are tallied separately by color. A piece that is 'engulfed' is scored by the color that&rsquo;s engulfing it, not by the 'owner' of the engulfed piece. Engulfed pieces do not count for being in a stack.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest total at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Several variants to the rules are also available on the website.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.invisible-city.com/play/174/snowblind&#10;&#10;",

The mechanics are fairly trivial:  one attempts to collect question cards by answering trivia questions: in this case, perhaps surprisingly, questions about North American plants and animals.  Each card has six questions by default, three each graded Hard and Easy.  (The suggestion is that parents should choose Hard questions and children Easy when playing together.)  The player rolls a d3 to select the question randomly.  If answered correctly, the card is retained by the answerer; if incorrectly, the card is returned to the bottom of the pile.  Occasionally, a card contains a special &quot;claim a card from another player&quot; action instead of a question.&#10;&#10;",
