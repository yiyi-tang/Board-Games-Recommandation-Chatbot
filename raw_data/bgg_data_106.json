    "Description": "The Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series hits harsh and unforgiving desert terrain in Heroes of North Africa. As World War II unfolded, Mussolini and Italy&rsquo;s colonial expansion in Libya and East Africa were at stake, as well as the Axis&rsquo;s desire to control the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal. In the beginning, only Britain and her Commonwealth Allies could stop them. From 1940 to 1943 a relentless, bloody push and pull of forces across the desert, from Egypt to Morocco, ensued.&#10;&#10;We have had a few name changes along the way, Mare Nostrum and then Heroes of the Mediterranean. God willing we hope to be sticking with Heroes of North Africa. We have done away with all the overlays so we have expanded the game to 14 Maps. all pre-orders will include 14 X-Maps as well.&#10;&#10;Play 18 dynamic scenarios that feature everything that makes the award-winning Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series stand out&mdash;fluid, impulse-based turns; squad-level and individual heroics&mdash;plus lots of armor and unique rules to bring desert combat to life. Italians, including paratroopers from the rugged Folgore Division, and Rommel&rsquo;s vaunted Afrika Korps take on the resolute British Eighth Army. The Free French and Americans also get into the action. The battles start in 1940, with a few in East Africa, and Sidi Barrani, Egypt, and continue up to El Alamein and the Americans&rsquo; first taste of combat during Operation Torch, in November of 1942. Heroes of North Africa has the most components of any game in the series to date, so find a pair of goggles; the dust and sand of the desert is going to fly!&#10;&#10;- - - - - -&#10;&#10;Previously and variously advertised as Mare Nostrum and later Heroes of the Mediterranean on its way from concept to to publication.&#10;&#10;UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.  We add some every few weeks.  You can find all the LnLT manuals at the link below.&#10;&#10;LnLP Online Library: http://library.lnlpublishing.com/&#10;&#10;",

The game is designed to put the emphasis on command and control on the battlefield, with the players commanding a company a side plus a range of support platoons.  The rules cover infantry and armour combat between 1939 and 1945 and may be used with our four theatre specific handbooks which provide full information on organisational structures and weapon capabilities.&#10;&#10;The smallest tactical unit in I Ain't Been Shot Mum is the infantry section or squad of the weapons team with support weapons such as mortars or machine guns.  The basic command units are the platooons.  The rules handle fire by section or weapons team and the turn sequences are dictated by the Game Deck of cards which can be tailor made to suit any specific situation.  With sections covering infantry and armored combat, artillery and air support, and morale covered by the elegant and &quot;test-free&quot; shock system, the rules allow smooth flowing games where the players have minimal contact with the rules and maximum contact with the tactical situation.&#10;&#10;Included in the rules is the Normandy Handbook which covers the periond June to August 1944.  There is a scenario generator which will provide fast set-up games with no advanced planning, a section on writing historical scenarios and four specific scenarios, two starter games and two historical actions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As thieves in search of loot, you and your partner stand in front of a mansion and rub your hands. Heaps of money are said to be behind these walls, money that you would only love to steal &mdash; even though both of you are anything but professional thieves. You want to try your luck, but the rooms are equipped with numerous lasers that must be avoided, and you must work quickly before time runs out...&#10;&#10;In the co-operative game Complices, players have two minutes to steal as many coins as possible without hitting the security lasers present in the room. To do this, each player puts on glasses with a red or blue color filter that prevents them from seeing one of the types of lasers. The player with the red glasses must then trace a path in the room with the marker in order to recover the coins and treasures, while the player with the blue glasses is their guide. Communicate as well as possible to avoid obstacles! Each coin recovered is worth 1 point, while each laser hit causes you to lose 1 point. If you collect enough coins to fill your hideout after four rounds, you win the game.&#10;&#10;Complices contains sixteen rooms in four levels of difficulty, with new laser shapes and new mechanisms for each level.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Barbarians at the Gates, The Decline and Fall of the Western Roman Empire 337 - 476, is a card-driven game for two players set during the final century of the Western Roman Empire. The Roman player commands the Roman legions loyal to the failing central authority and those Germanic peoples who have settled peacefully inside the Roman Empire, while the Barbarian player leads Usurper Emperors, and controls the migrations of the savage Germanic peoples, who are the Barbarians at the Gates.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a point-to-point map of the Western Roman Empire, divided into 11 diocese (administrative districts) such as Gallia Belgica, Caledonia or Italia Suburbicaria, each composed of spaces such as Roma, Massilia or Nova Carthago. These spaces are connected to each other through the network of Roman roads, rougher connections (mostly in uncivilized territory) or river connections (mostly the Donau and the Rhine).&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing cards in order to activate Generals (Loyalist Roman generals such as Aetius, Usurper Emperors like Magnentius, and Barbarian leaders such as Atilla or Alaric) for movement and/or sieges, bring new Barbarian invasions into play, recruit new Legions, lead barbarian bands in raids across the border into the Roman interior, settle formerly hostile tribes on Roman soil, or even successfully usurp the Imperial Throne from its previous occupant! As leaders move, they will encounter enemy armies and battle, earning eternal glory or an unrecognized grave. Barbarian tribes will probe the fortified border for weaknesses, while the outnumbered Legions have to use interior lines (and the excellent Roman road network) to face each threat to the unfortified Italian, Iberian and Gallic diocese.&#10;&#10;From the days of Valentinian I and the first Vandal and Frankish migrations through Theodosius I and the Gothic invasions to Attila and the Huns, Barbarians at the Gates will allow players to vie for the future of Western Europe. Will enough of Roman civilization remain to eventually spark a Renaissance, or will Europe remain forever in the Dark Ages?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The King's birthday has arrived! Wealthy aristocrats from across the land have gathered to throw a lavish ball in the King's honor, sparing no expense in an attempt to impress him. Of course, everyone knows that the best way to impress a father is to win the favor of his daughters. At the ball, one more bit of business needs to be settled &ndash; each aristocrat has bet a parcel of land that he can curry the most favor from the seven sisters over the course of the party! With their land and honor on the line, each aristocrat is rushing to gain the favor of the daughters, and to cast derision on his opponents.&#10;&#10;In Seven Sisters, a hand-management, area-control Euro-style board game, the players play the roles of wealthy aristocrats who are trying to gain the favor of the king's seven daughters, who happen to be named after the seven deadly sins: Wrath, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride, and Envy.&#10;  &#10;The game consists of four rounds, with the players being dealt six cards each round. Using five of the six cards, players influence the sisters by sending servants to do the sisters' bidding. Multiple options when playing each card create opportunities for players to use both strategic and tactical play to influence the sisters more than their opponents do.&#10;&#10;Each round after cards are played, scoring occurs with each sister granting her favor (victory point) and a special reward or action to the player who has influenced her most that round. These rewards and actions are thematically tied to the name of the sister (e.g., Greed rewards players with gold). Gaining this favor is important not only for the victory point, but also to gain advantages and resources for following rounds.&#10;&#10;After four rounds are played and scored, another scoring round happens immediately. Victory points are tallied, including bonus points for having gained the favor of all seven sisters and for having the highest quantity of unused resources remaining (gold, fruit, and servants). The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

During each turn, players roll these dice and each colored screw that&rsquo;s rolled can be used to collect a resource of the same color. Collected resources can be used for various effects, mainly for playing cards.&#10;&#10;Improve your dice, train your army and show your enemies that you would rather die than surrender.&#10;&#10;The game features two different game modes: Cooperative Mode, and Competitive Mode. In Cooperative mode, players collectively take on Celesta and her forces and try to stop the Invasion. In Competitive mode, players challenge each other in one-on-one combat.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The golf-inspired deck-building game Duffers is based on how us non-professionals play golf. We hook the ball, we slice it, we end up in the trees, but every once-in-a-while we hit that perfect shot that keeps us coming back for more &mdash; more punishment, that is.&#10;&#10;As with traditional golf, the objective is to finish the course with the lowest score (# of Strokes). To set up a round of Duffers, players choose up to nine holes from the 18 included with the game. Gameplay is all about building the perfect &quot;bag&quot; or deck. Each player opens with the same starter deck. Every turn is a new hand and a chance to purchase clubs, crew, and equipment from the Pro Shop or attempt to complete a hole. Fun fact: You can finish the holes in any order, which is important because any holes not completed by the end of the game are marked as triple par on your score card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player finishes the course or the Pro Shop runs out of cards. The only thing left to do is add up the scores, crown the Duffers Master for this round, and plan your next tee time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

At its most advanced, the game can be customized to breathe life into any science fiction background that players might imagine.&#10;&#10;Novices shouldn&rsquo;t fret; the core set of rules has been designed with simplicity and ease of play in mind, accessible even to beginners. On the other hand, seasoned veterans should find the concise nature of the rules quite refreshing. It allows players to concentrate on the finer points of squashing their opponents rather than arguing about rules interpretations, without sacrificing any of the flavor or excitement of more complex games.&#10;&#10;Simple, but not simplistic, is the guiding principle.&#10;&#10;The Admiralty Edition represents the latest incarnation of the Universal Game of Starship Combat. Included in the 80-page Core Rulebook:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The &quot;essential&quot; Starmada rules, including a new inertia-based movement system. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Over 80 different options from which players may pick and choose to create the perfect game. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A fully-customizable weapon design system, with almost five million different combinations. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A complete set of rules for fighters, allowing for nearly half a million different types of small craft. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A comprehensive construction system, allowing players to design their own starships with which to do battle. &#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to the core rulebook and 48-page Starmada Universe guide, a number of different settings are planned for the near future, including collaborations with several other companies.&#10;&#10;Available both in Print and PDF print-n-Play.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Imperial Starmada Sourcebook&#10;    Starmada: Dreadnoughts&#10;    Starmada: Hammer and Claw&#10;    Starmada: Iron Stars&#10;    Starmada: The Admiralty Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Rules Annex&#10;&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Klingon Armada&#10;    Romulan Armada&#10;&#10;&#10;Later editions:&#10;&#10;    Starmada Nova Rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;1866: The Struggle for Supremacy in Germany&quot; is a two-player simulation dealing with the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 in Central Europe. One player controls the forces of Prussia and its allies, to include the young Kingdom of Italy and the other player controls the forces of Austria and its German Confederation allies. Using a shared deck of 55 Operations Cards, each player makes decisions concerning the deployment, combat and political-military operations in support of his forces and his general strategy. Orders of battle include all the historic corps/divisions (with some brigade counters) and all major generals involved in the conflict. The mapboard covers an area from Hamburg to Florence and Metz to Cracow. The system includes unique mobilization rules that reflect the difficulties of mobilizing for war while attempting to garner as many victory points before war is actually declared. Once war is declared, you must fight with the forces mobilized, so shrewd judgement is required as to what to mobilize, where those forces will operate and who commands them. Always waiting in the wings is the French 2nd Empire under Napoleon III, prepared to intervene if neither side appears able to clinch a quick and decisive victory. Other features include cavalry superiority, railroads, Prussia&rsquo;s mobilization advantage and coordinated attacks. 1866 includes two scenarios, the Mobilization to War scenario (the Campaign scenario) and the Seven Weeks War scenario (covering the post mobilization situation). The cards are sub-divided into Mobilization and War decks, which are combined after war is declared.&#10;&#10;&quot;1866&quot; is designed by John B. Firer (designer of &quot;Spartacus&quot;). In addition to the basic game components, &quot;1866&quot; includes a comprehensive Playbook, which includes an extended Example of Play, Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Optional Rules, a select Bibliography and complete and extensive Card Explanations.&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Average&#10;Time Scale: Weekly turns&#10;Map Scale: Point-to-Point depiction of Central Europe from Denmark to Northern Italy and East Prussia to Eastern France&#10;Unit Scale: Corps/division&#10;Players: 2 players&#10;Playing time: 4 &ndash; 6 hours for the Campaign Scenario&#10;&#10;",

Game's world is a bit more darker than heroic Talisman.&#10;&#10;The basic layout of cards etc is the same as in Talisman except that Strength is replaced with Might and Craft with Magic.&#10;&#10;A version of the game was later made without license by Phantom, a Russian firm.&#10;&#10;Sfera produced a second edition of the game, which changed the style of the cards, but kept the art. The board was recreated using photo art and new character art was used. Only the base game was produced.&#10;&#10;",

As one of the members of that search party, you will need to trespass into the sacred forest and cross the boundary that separates the realm of humans from the realm of the Slavic deity Radgost.&#10;&#10;Inhabiting the forest are strange beings such as the Psoglav, Lesnik, or Todorci, none of which take kindly to human intruders.&#10;&#10;You'll need to use all your skills, wisdom, and instincts to survive the numerous encounters with these strange creatures.&#10;&#10;Along the way you will develop your character, collect items, gain skills, separate and rejoin with other members of the search party, and, possibly, discover the secret reason why the druid chose you to join the search party.&#10;&#10;Forest of Radgost is a role-playing game where each player controls a character with a fleshed-out backstory, motivation, and skill-set. Players navigate the web of interconnected forest footpaths with a pair of dice that determine the distance and direction of their movement, evoking the feeling of being lost in the woods, with creatures lurking at each crossroad.&#10;&#10;At each encounter, players must decide whether to run, hide, flee, or communicate, without knowing which creature they are about to face. Depending on their choices, the encounters are resolved according to the numerous scenarios provided in the accompanying book of encounters.&#10;&#10;Nine decks of cards add an open-world dimension, allowing players to explore the rich game world based on four years of research into Slavic mythology. Numerous scenarios, map details, and cards interact to weave a unique storyline ensuring that players will never have the same adventure twice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Five Arab armies, poised at the borders of the newly declared state, launch their determined invasions &ndash; and each must be pushed back in turn before any reaches West Jerusalem, the new Israeli capital.&#10;&#10;As the headlines unfold and the vast forces of the Arab League relentlessly press forward, can you successfully allocate the precious few resources of the new Israeli Defense Force (IDF) to conduct daring offensives that will send them reeling back? Can you push the Arab legions back so far that an armistice can be achieved and these threats removed? Or will you be over-whelmed and defeated, seeing Zionist aspirations crushed?&#10;&#10;Wargames recreate situations so that they can be studied and played, and Israeli Independence is particularly well suited to classroom use.

    "Description": "(from Compass Games website)&#10;&#10;Nations in Arms brings one of the most famous periods in history to your gaming table: the French Revolution and the legend of Napoleon in Europe, from 1792 to 1815. This epic treatment of the Napoleonic period covers 24 years of warfare at the strategic level.&#10;&#10;Nations in Arms uses a extensively updated, modified and streamlined version of the Le Grand Empire game system from Pratzen Editions (that game covered the 1800-1815 time period). The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer Fran&#195;&#167;ois-Stanislas Thomas.&#10;&#10;Players control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest. This allows anywhere from 2 to 7 players to participate in the game. Players are challenged with strategically managing their annual national production, diplomacy, and most importantly, war.&#10;&#10;The game systems emphasize the military importance of lines of communication, the command and control ability of skilled leaders, quality of troops above quantity, and the impact of battle, epic sieges and attrition on a nation. You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.&#10;&#10;Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns. A Chit Activation system is used to recreate the &lsquo;chaos of war&rsquo;, and events occur using an Historical Event card deck. This combination of variable chit pull and card play ensures a high replay value of the ten (10) scenarios. Nations in Arms features a one-turn tutorial scenario , four epic campaign scenarios, and five smaller scenarios.&#10;&#10;Now it&rsquo;s your turn to either fan the flames of The French Revolution throughout Europe, or to preserve the Old Order&hellip;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    2 map sections making a 56&rdquo; wide by 39&rdquo; high playing area&#10;    4 countersheets&#10;    6 full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cards with various tables, charts  and player aids&#10;    1 card deck (110 cards) of historical and tactical events&#10;    1 rules booklet&#10;    1 scenario booklet&#10;    2 dice&#10;    1 box and lid set - the big 3&rdquo; deep box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

He was one of the most famous executes (at that court) and his execution was watched by thousands. Nevertheless, not much about the man is known.&#10;&#10;In the game the players have to find out, where Schinderhannes' crimes took place. They play cards (&quot;rumours&quot; or &quot;police files&quot;) with information like &quot;In the Autumn of 1798, Schinderhannes and Peter Petrie tried to steal a donkey in one of these places: Antes M&uuml;hle, B&auml;renbach, Hundsbach, Meddersheim&quot; or &quot;The Livestock theft took place in the South&quot; or &quot;The Donkey Theft was in the neighboring district, next to the Arrest&quot;. For each clue marker a player removes due to this, he receives one point. If all crimes are defined (only one place left for each crime), the game ends and the player who has gathered the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nature is a strategy board game that stands on the shoulders of the award-winning blockbuster Evolution. It's been completely redesigned from the ground up to make it more streamlined, more forgiving, deeper, and easily expandable. The innovation of Nature is a modular game system that allows players to create and explore a unique ecosystem each time they play. There is no limit to the number of modules that can be added. You can play Nature on its own, or combine modules to create over 20 unique ecosystems.&#10;&#10;The goal of Nature is to adapt your species in an ever-changing ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk. You will receive points for growing and sustaining the population of your species amidst two threats: starvation and predation. Adapt your species with traits like Fast to evade predators, Nesting to grow your population, or Climbing to reach fruit high in the canopy.&#10;&#10;A game of Nature takes 4 rounds, or 5 when you play with modules. Each round, players gain a new species and draw a hand of cards, bringing new life and opportunity into the ecosystem. Rounds have 2 main phases: Adapting and Feeding.

    "Description": "As part of the D-Day landings in Normandy in 1944, the British 6th Airborne Division took part in Operation Tonga, to capture and destroy several bridges on the Orne River and Caen Canal and to secure important villages in the area. Bad weather and difficult landing conditions meant that units were scattered and often had to fight in smaller, weakened forces. Fortunately, the German resistance was, on this occasion, inefficient.&#10;In Battles of Normandy, you will be commanding whatever British units happen to be available in order to take strategic positions on the map. German forces may not act with the full efficiency that the German army was known for, but they will nonetheless put up a fight.&#10;This book builds on my previous book-based game, The Fields of Normandy. It is not a sequel, and the rules are different, but it is aimed at the same audience &ndash; those who are relatively new to wargaming and would like to &ldquo;dip the toe&rdquo; and those who, like me, would rather play something than have time for nothing.&#10;The aim here was to produce a fairly traditional hex and counter wargame experience with simple rules and a manageable &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; which will not take up too much time or effort to operate, especially once you have grasped the basic system.&#10;&#10;",

When all the tiles are gone, the first player to use up all the tiles in their hand wins.&#10;&#10;There are also variants included in the rules, and the game is suitable for solo play.&#10;&#10;In this new Target-exclusive version, six wild monkey tiles are added. They can be used as any letter and switched it up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;There! Captain! Upon the Horizon!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Words shouted upon the mast of the ship Ishara. She sails, slicing through the endless waters of the 1840s&rsquo;. Whalers at the end of their hunt voyage toward a nearby lighthouse. The waters darken. It is Halloween night. Upon the Mast a strange shape in the waves is spotted. Is it Whale? Or perhaps an innocent shipwrecked sailor in need of help? The Captain considers the tone of the voice, there is certainly something more haunting within the call, a fear. A shark? A tidal wave? What is upon on that horizon? In the blackness of night?&#10;&#10;Earlier in the evening a floating body was pulled aboard. Dead. Scrawled in its flesh were visions of impossible Sea Serpents, man-like forms of Seaweed, satanic Crabs, and a haunting ancient people. It could not be real?! The Sea Peoples?! Sirens?! Impossible! The journey has been far too long and demanding, the crew, weary. They will get to port soon and be home with their families. What is on that horrible Horizon?!! A Kraken?! A Hurricane?! It could not be! There is a story of a Witch, a Sea Witch! But it cannot be real?!&#10;&#10;The Captain, composing himself, whispers a prayer and asks, &quot;What is it? What do you see?&quot;&#10;&#10;Sea Evil is a horror simulation experience. Unlike games that tend to aim for a perfect balance, Sea Evil's main focus is delivering the terrifying experience that occurred on this Halloween night. Characters and situations are not balanced to equal one another but created to simulate the actual experience as it happened. The game begins with a whaling ship on the sea waters, Evil begins to unfold each turn adding greater potential to destroy the Whalers. Through sea navigation and harpoon hunting skills the whalers can possibly reach the shining rays of a coastal lighthouse. THE WITCH RETURNS! DARKNESS DESCENDS UPON THE WATERS!&#10;&#10;Sea Evil is a tactical hex and counter game with each token representing an individual character. Characters have sheets with some individual stats related to speed, strength and will to live. The Whalers can win if they can navigate themselves to the Lighthouse or slay the Sea Witch. Evil triumphs if it can destroy the Whalers in the waters.&#10;&#10;Sea Evil, and Halloween Nightmares Horrorgame Magazine are a very visceral experience and we have rated it X. Anyone one under the age of 18 is NOT permitted to play. Pregnant or players with a fragile or nervous disposition are strongly encouraged NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Spiel des Jahres&quot; contains events related to the games of the year, the sometimes odd jury decisions and almost anything, true boardgame geeks should love. It can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

The player that spends the most campaign dollars on the state wins the state's electoral votes. Once that money is spent, win, tie, or lose; that money is gone. Big advertising networks thank you for your campaign dollars.&#10;&#10;The game starts when the 15 minute timer begins, and with every new round, time pressure escalates as more states will be up for grabs. Ties on state cards leaves the state card and creates stacks of state cards for rebid in the next round. Swing states let you steal the last won state from other candidates. And every player gets more money as rounds pass plus bonus money as you win more states.&#10;Think you have what it takes to win the presidency in 15 minutes?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from Coozies Games&#10;&#10;",

Players reveal their cards one at a time, moving forward on the track; if a player would finish his movement on an occupied space, he moves his vehicle the same number of spaces once again, repeating this process, if needed. Once everyone has finished, each player pays the leader the amount showing on the space where his car stands.&#10;&#10;If a player chose 1-3 for his movement, he draws a replacement Power card; otherwise, he must use one of the cards remaining in hand. The round ends once a player reaches the end marker or once all players cannot or choose not to play a Power card. The first two (or three) players on the track advance on a central scoring path, with players being able to pay money to advance additional spaces.&#10;&#10;Players then reset for the next race with a new hand of Power cards and continue playing. The game ends when one or more players reach the dream island at the end of the central scoring track, with the player who advances the farthest winning.

    "Description": "Endure the Stars is a 1-6 player cooperative action survival game set on the planet-colonising ship, the N.W.E. Hikari. Players pick up the story one year into the Hikari's colonisation efforts and everything has fallen to ruin. Scientists aboard the ship were attempting to genetically engineer life forms to explore the planet below, unbeknownst to the ships general populace. But a series of tragedies lead to the truth being discovered and the ensuing chaos released the creatures from containment, where they rampaged through the ship, killing anyone they came across. Now the remaining crew live in small groups, salvaging whatever they can to survive.&#10;&#10;Game overview&#10;&bull;    In Endure the Stars, players take control of one or more survivors and attempt to complete missions by exploring the ruins of the once thriving ship. Players control 6 unique character classes, each with their own special abilities that can turn the tide of any game.&#10;&bull;    Complete various missions as a standalone game or an overarching campaign&#10;&bull;    Search the ruins of the once thriving ship for powerful weapons, items, helmets and armour&#10;&bull;    You&rsquo;re not the only thing still alive on the ship. The escaped genetic experiments, known as the GEPs, are lurking everywhere and if spotted will not stop hunting you&#10;&bull;    The GEPs are controlled by the game itself and start each mission represented by radar tokens. You&rsquo;ll not know what lurks under the token until you make visual contact, so you must be ready for anything&#10;&bull;    One GEP stands more powerful and dangerous than all others, the fearsome Titan. Its actions are controlled by its own deck of cards, making it unpredictable, gargantuan and deadly. It will take everything you&rsquo;ve got to bring this leviathan down&#10;&bull;    The game tiles that represent the ship have been designed in a modular style, which allows for near limitless map sizes and set-ups. Games can last anywhere between 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on the chosen scenario and difficulty, so there's never an excuse not to play!&#10;&bull;    The ship is in a constant state of decay and is prone to black outs, power failures and much more that affects how the game is played and causes you to constantly adapt&#10;&#10;Endure the Stars contains:&#10;&bull;    6 unique character miniatures&#10;&bull;    30 Swarmer miniatures&#10;&bull;    20 Jaeger miniatures&#10;&bull;    20 Icarus miniatures&#10;&bull;    1 Titan miniature&#10;&bull;    1 Titan miniature&#10;&bull;    9 game tiles&#10;&bull;    6 character dashboards&#10;&bull;    8 dice&#10;&bull;    150 cards&#10;&bull;    86 tokens&#10;&#10;",

The Alchemists are all about pushing the boundaries of science, which often results in team members getting Burned and discarded.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Converge, players are competing to build the best team that meets the current goals, though goals and teams can shift with each play. So can control of the powerful artifact which gives an advantage to those who possess it.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turns to play a single card from their hand.&#10;&#10;Every card has 2 parts: a character with a skillset, rank and special ability, and a goal, each of which has a star value for fulfilling its requirement. These goals apply to both players while the card is in the central area, with fulfilled goals remaining in play.&#10;&#10;Cards can be discarded for their special ability, played to the player&rsquo;s team to fulfill goals using its suit and value, or as a new shared goal.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, players count their current star value. The player with the most stars gains control of the artifact. If they already had control of the artifact, they win! If no player can secure victory by the time all cards have been played, then the player who holds the artifact is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Players can try to accumulate spell cards, heal, trigger events, fight monsters for treasure, or fight other players for VP's. The spell cards are musically themed with names like &quot;Nocturne&quot; or &quot;Fugue&quot;.&#10;The game uses a small deck of (very sturdy) cards, and the assortment of game elements allows for a variety of strategies. Although the game utilizes relatively few luck elements, it becomes chaotic through the many different effects of the cards and the variable dancer powers.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever can't get rid of the Hex token by using his cards &quot;blows up,&quot; thus losing points. Naturally, there are nuances to this. There are 17 different cards in the deck, some which merely pass the Hex token left, right, and across, while others split the token in two, or increase it's damage. One dismisses it entirely. One blows it up while in another player's possession. One forces the token to pass in only one direction, some cause extra effects if the token DOES blow up on you. A round ends when there are no more Hex tokens available, and there are as many rounds as there are players, plus one.&#10;&#10;There are some interesting strategies that are not immediately apparent, but which become obvious after the first couple of rounds. Controlling when the last token blows up is very important since you lose and gain points based on this, so learning to play the cards to force the location of the tokens when they blow up is of paramount importance. Sending them to a player who has no cards to play works very well for this.&#10;&#10;Scores are kept with individual cards monitoring &quot;Voice&quot;, which is just points. How many you have at the end of the x+1 rounds determines who the winner is.&#10;&#10;One last amusing thing about the game is a bit of chaos tossed in; a Hex Hex card; when it's played, all players have to drop their card hands and put their hands in the air. The slowpoke loses points. Not exactly strategy, but still entertaining.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Hex Hex Next&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Hex Hex XL&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Jenga is tower building game played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot; According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Poland and France have fallen, Greece and Norway have surrendered and Yugoslavia is no more... Now it&rsquo;s time for the Soviet Union to suffer the same grim fate. Will the vaunted German blitzkrieg prove its invincibility once again? Or will the Soviet Union endure the onslaught long enough to rebuild its might and push back the enemy? The fate of the war is in your hands!&#10;&#10;Lead the combat-hardened forces of Wehrmacht through mud and snow and unimaginably vast territories of the enemy, all the while trying to protect your overstretched supply lines. Or take control of initially outnumbered, but slowly building its might Soviet Red Army, hamper the lighting quick panzer attacks, harass the enemy&rsquo;s supply lines with your partisans and bide your time for a bloody and devastating counteroffensive. This is the war of iron, blood, snow and mud&#10;&#10;Iron, Blood, Snow &amp; Mud is both asymmetrical in its overall design and simple yet surprisingly unique in its approach to the Eastern Front. The game is played over the course of four years, each consisting of three markedly different seasons, two of which &ndash; the aptly named Mud and Snow &ndash; inhibit the use of some actions and units. The movement and its range is predicated on the current season, unit type and the ability to create and maintain a chain of units. The Germans have to either hold a set of objectives by the end of 1944... or capture the Soviet leader, Stalin himself. The Soviets too can achieve a sudden victory, but only if they manage to seize one of three initially German-held cities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of a gambit, players bet several times while making claims about how good their hands are and using abilities to influence the game. Each suit gives access to a different ability and if you don't have the one you need, just lie about it and hope you get away with it.&#10;&#10;You can play Pand&aacute;nte as a social game with a definite win condition and no player elimination, or you can play it as an ongoing gambling game in which players are eliminated when they lose their money, like in Poker.

Over the course of three rounds, each team of mouse and dragon fight over tricks, treasures, and coins to see which team ends up on top!&#10;&#10;The game isn't all about winning tricks; it's about setting goals and utilizing magical treasures. If you can make enough of your goals or sabotage enough of the other team's goals, you'll have the most coins at the end of the game and be crowned king of the caves!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Who will sink in the cruel storm of bullets and blades?&#10;&#10;In Los Tesoros del Rey Pirata (&quot;Treasures of the Pirate King&quot;) the players are pirates collecting treasure cards which will grant points. The pirate with most point wins the game and is named the new Pirate King or Queen.&#10;&#10;The board has 12 islands in a 5x7 grid. 3 map cards will show which of these islands the players can go to claim the treasures. In their turn, players can also fight each other in duels, to steal treasures, and opening fire, to steal cards from their hand. There&rsquo;s also treason cards that can be used to mess other player&rsquo;s plans but these can be countered with protection cards.&#10;&#10;The main mechanism is that most actions require a number. Dice imprinted in the cards are used to assign this number to be assign. The die used can be chosen from a card from the hand, therefor be a known number, or use the first card from the deck and be a random one. Cards used as a die are discarded and don&rsquo;t have additional effects.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Point Blank&quot; is Lock 'n Load Publishing tactical World War 2 squad card wargame for 1-2 players pitted against each other in situational combat scenarios.&#10;&#10;There is also a solo option as well as partnerships in teams of 2.&#10;&#10;Each scenario presents the players with a unique situation involving squads of men, support weapons, leaders, and individual armored fighting vehicles.&#10;&#10;This game pits the forces of the USA against Germany just after the landings in Normandy (June 1944) through October 1944. Each player has victory conditions determined by the scenario in which to defend or take objectives, seek and destroy their opponent&rsquo;s units, or one of many other different scenario objectives.&#10;&#10;The game is played on an abstract map board made up of terrain cards in the game and managed through a distance system that accounts for the range to targets, line of sight, and defensive attributes. The player has units that start out on the map and gradually work their way towards their objectives by advancing through the battlefield, all the while conducting combat actions against their opponent or defending their troops from return fire or whatever hell awaits them. Players draw cards from a common action deck where they will play actions on their units on the map board. The game is an IGOUGO impulse system, and turns are managed when the action deck is exhausted. (Some scenarios may require multiple deck exhaustion to finish the game). Actions in the game consist of Fire, Move, Assault, Rally, etc. The action cards contain dice icons on them to determine random results.&#10;&#10;One of the unique features of the game is that it contains a deck of terrain cards that are not part of the action deck. As players change terrain, they will draw a terrain card in which their moving units will occupy. Some action cards, such as Recon, help players manage what terrain they occupy, but your opponent may have other plans for your moving troops during their turn.&#10; Combat in the game is similar to how combat is conducted in Lock n Load Tactical. 2 players can play a game in about an hour (depending on the scenario size), and if you cannot find an opponent, then try the game solo system. In general, the gameplay is fast and exciting and compares to such legendary game systems as Up Front.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher.&#10;&#10;",

As the leader of a powerful political faction, you manipulate gangs and influence politicians behind the scenes to seize control. Effective use of your resources will gain influence, win elections, and let you control the destiny of New York; fail and you will be less than a footnote to history.&#10;&#10;Several tools lie at your disposal if you have the strength to acquire and use them. Your loyal rabble will execute your will. Controlling districts with your rabble could give you access to a limited number of important buildings: Tammany Hall, Board of Elections, 5th Ward Offices and many others. Your control of these buildings may provide influence and special powers. Bid for control of election-influencing manipulations that may swing the vote.&#10;&#10;In Manhattan, your burgeoning political machine may affect politics in America's great city for over 100 years. At the heart of this machine are the gangs of New York who enforce the will of the bosses and determine elections before the first vote is cast.&#10;&#10;",

Each characteristic will benefit the player in a way, such as playing more cards per round, attracting more distant elements, or better controlling the temperature of your planet.&#10;&#10;He who has advanced further in the path of life will be the winner&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Geek Out! Pop Culture Party is a party game that can determine once and for all which player is the most knowledgeable about your favorite pop culture subjects!&#10;&#10;In this game, which is aimed at a more mainstream audience than parent game Geek Out!, you draw cards asking you to list a certain number of things which fall under a certain category: television, movies, music, literature, and more. Before you begin, however, the other players may try to steal your points (and bragging rights!) by bidding to list even more than the card requires. The bidding continues until one player is ready to &quot;out-geek&quot; their friends. Collect a predetermined number of cards, and you win!&#10;&#10;",
