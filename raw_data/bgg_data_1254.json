It&rsquo;ll be your job to juggle resources, prioritize problem-solving, and wring out maximum wallop from every ounce of your available political capital as the days tick by and the crisis escalates. Get the country through this, and you WILL be rewarded--maybe even snag a lucrative book deal. Come up short, though, and you&rsquo;re bureaucratic rubbish--eagerly jettisoned and quickly forgotten.&#10;&#10;In this game, you are put in charge of implementing policy decisions for the president during a national emergency. Your goal is to successfully navigate the crisis by dismissing various problems in an escalating pressure cooker environment. During your turn, you will reveal a potential crisis situation and then use dice and your political capital to try and handle the situation. After you come up with a gameplan you still have to get the presidents' approval or it's a no go. If the problem is not solved it carries over and you will lose status. Lose too much and you'll be looking for another place of employment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, a rumor claims that the Czar&rsquo;s favorite daughter, Anastasia, survived and has been in hiding from those that are pursuing her. Her Grandmother, the Empress Dowager, heard the rumors and decided to make it her mission to find Anastasia. After years of searching, the Empress invited those who claim to be or know Anastasia to a party, where the Empress hopes to learn enough to find Anastasia.&#10;&#10;GAME OVERVIEW&#10;One player is the Empress, while the rest of the players are guests. To find Anastasia, the Empress and her guests must ask questions of each other. The responses are marked on a central board for all players to see. By listening to the answers and exchanging hidden clue cards with each other players must deduce who is and isn&rsquo;t Anastasia. As questions are answered, gems are given to players. The gems can be used on a player&rsquo;s turn to perform actions such as gaining clues, revealing roles, or asking additional questions.&#10;&#10;The game continues until Anastasia is found or a role ability causes the game to end. Will the Empress find Anastasia? Will Rasputin's Agent find Anastasia first? What other guests will show up to this party? Play Finding Anastasia to find out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But to help distinguish between the colors each color has a different touch pattern on the tile piece.  e.g. the pink tile has 2 gems which protrude like braille, and the blue tiles have 3. Each Tac-Tile is enclosed in a wooden cap, and is played on a wooden board with indents to fit each cap.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;All the pieces are placed face-down in the middle of the table. &#10;On a player's turn they draw a piece and try to match it with any they have in their hand.  &#10;If they get a match they can reveal it or wait until they get a better match.&#10;&#10;How to win&#10;Points are award to matching the same shaped tiles, or bonus points are award if the shape and colors match.&#10;If they match 3 different shapes of the same color they can earn the most points.&#10;&#10;",

But the winner chooses!&#10;&#10;1 deck of 53 cards will allow up to 5 players to play,&#10;2 decks, up to 9&#10;etc...&#10;&#10;Le Grisbi is made up of 53 game cards and 3 double-sided rule cards.&#10;The 53 cards in the game are divided into 2 categories:&#10;&#10;     40 numbered cards (4 series of cards ranging from 1 to 10)&#10;     13 special cards (with super powers)&#10;&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 3 cards face down in front of them covered with 3 cards face up and 3 cards in their hand. The rest of the cards serve as a draw pile.&#10;&#10;The first player begins by putting on the table one or more cards of the same value located in her hand. At this point she must draw the number of cards sufficient to have at least three cards in her hand. The next player must put one or more cards of equal or greater value than the previous number card and draw accordingly and so on. If he cannot play or if tactically he finds it more interesting, the player recovers the game pile and starts a new pile. As long as there is a draw pile all players must have at least 3 cards in hand. Otherwise a player can say &quot;Grisbi&quot; and designate the person who does not have 3 cards in hand and this person will have to recover the game pile. The player who said &quot;Grisbi&quot; starts playing again.&#10;&#10;Once the draw is completed, players play all the cards they have in their hand. When it is done, the player can recover his new deck by taking the cards face up located in front of him. He plays as before until he has no more cards.&#10; Then, on the third phase, the player, when it is his turn, turns over a card face down at random and places it on the pile. If the played card remains in the rule, the game continues and it is up to the next player. If the placed card does not respect the rule, the player takes the playing pile back into hand and must get rid of it before moving on to the next face down card.&#10;&#10;The first to get rid of all his cards wins and the game ends when there is only one player left.&#10;&#10;",

Taze knows what it takes to be a Champion. As one of the few Tauriak born into the warrior caste of his people, Taze was groomed to become a warrior. As battles between clans were decided by a trial of champions, Taze was tutored by the best trainers and armed with the greatest weapons, becoming a living weapon that would bring victory to his clan again and again. Adored by his friends, and feared by his enemies, Taze built his life on triumph after bloody triumph. His was an existence of strength and battle, and Taze would have it no other way.&#10;&#10;Through the countless wars that have engulfed history, Fabulosa itself has suffered the most. A world ravaged and torn, eventually nature had to fight back. A dryad of incredible power, Loralei was once the nesting spirit of a druidic grove, her life given to protect that sacred place. With its destruction, she was free to venture into Fabulosa, protecting other groves from the same fate. Appearing wherever she was needed, Loralei kept the world in balance, ensuring that no matter what atrocities the races of Fabulosa committed, life would find a way to survive.&#10;&#10;Nevamor&rsquo;s former life as a druid was cut short by the Droskarian Horde, but whilst death comes for all things, not all things accept death as easily as others. Nevamor&rsquo;s will to live extended far beyond the mortal coil, and he returned a wraith; the first undead. Although his first act was one of revenge, soon Nevamor became a protector of the lost, an avenging shade that preyed upon those who would prey on others. With his trusted companion Poe, Nevamor would hunt those who would think themselves the hunter and prove them wrong.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Bring enough cans of spray paint to tag walls all over town, and enough muscle to make sure no one else does. There's nothing quite as satisfying as watching little punks drop their spray cans and run at the very sight of you &mdash; just make sure that there isn't someone even bigger right around the corner!&#10;&#10;In Tag Team, you play as a crew of Eagles, Bulldogs, Alligators or Gorillas, defending your turf by bluffing your way through battles each day. Players simultaneously reveal their leader characters, and, if nobody backs down, their backup characters join the fight. The winner tags their opponent's territory as a reward. In the end, the crew with the most tagged territory wins.&#10;&#10;",
