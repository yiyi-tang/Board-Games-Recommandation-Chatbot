    "Description": "A long time ago in Europe, ages were pretty dark. The distribution of wealth back then left a lot to be desired. Greedy people banded together to take things from other people so that the rich could get richer and the poor could have even less. 'Twas ever thus.  Step into the middle of the normal state of human affairs as a Baron or Baroness somewhere almost in Europe a long time ago. Thanks to your birth, you have a lot of little people working to make you richer, and you, in turn, are doing your best to make your king even more prosperous. If you do things right, you might someday be king.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a Fiefdom Management card, divided into 64 squares (49 of which can have tiles played on them). Into four of these squares you deploy your Keep, in which you will put your fortification of some sort, and your soldiers. Elsewhere in your land, you deploy assorted resource gatherers and buildings in an effort to grow, prosper, and score  victory points. Along the way there may be wars, invasions, tournaments, taxes, and a lot of other nonsense.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nightfighter Ace, Air Defense Over Germany, 1943-44 is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a German Nightfighter during World War II. Each turn consists of several days, during which a combat mission will be flown from one of many bases in Europe, attempting to intercept incoming British Bombers. Nightfighter Ace is based on the popular, action-packed Hunters game system by Gregory M. Smith with a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion and receive awards.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a German Nightfighter pilot and rack up kills. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request a transfer to other nightfighter bases in an attempt to get &quot;closer to the action&quot; or request a newer type of nightfighter. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player's eventual goal &ndash; to become the top nightfighter ace of the war.&#10;&#10;The system is packed with rich technical detail but without the complexity to capture the key historical facets of the night bombing campaign over Germany. In terms of nightfighters alone, there are 32 nightfighter models available to pilot. The families of nightfighters include:&#10;&#10;        Bf110 (10 aircraft)&#10;        Ju88 (5 aircraft)&#10;        Do 215/217 (6 aircraft)&#10;        He219 (10 aircraft)&#10;        Ta154 (1 aircraft)&#10;&#10;&#10;For each nightfighter, you will be tracking the date of availability, speed, area of operations based on originating base, individual weapon systems, electronic systems, damage, and crew status.&#10;&#10;Nightfighters can be assigned to one of seven possible major geographic base &ldquo;groups&rdquo; as follows:&#10;&#10;        Dutch: Melsbroek, Schipol, Deelen, St. Trond, Twenthe, Leeuwarden, Venlo, Gilze-Rijen&#10;        Bremen: Vechta, Schleswig-Holstein, Stade, Grove&#10;        French: Florennes, Dijon, Juvincourt&#10;        Berlin: Stendal, Parchim, Werneuchen&#10;        Munich: Schleissheim, Neubiberg&#10;        M&#197;&#177;nster: M&#197;&#177;nster&#10;        Frankfurt: Mainz, Rhein-Main&#10;&#10;&#10;Besides the focus on hardware, the soft aspects of the war are also faithfully rendered for each pilot and crew. For example, air crew is characterized by various major and minor skills, including numerous Pilot skills, Funker (Radio Operator) skills, Bordmech. (Flight Engineer) skills, Bordschuetze (Rear Gunner) skills, and Prestige Level. The emphasis on various skills and benefits to gaining experience creates even a stronger narrative when compared to the Hunters game system, which helps weave a tense and dramatic narrative during play. One major change in Nightfighter Ace over Hunters is the ability to choose your crew improvements instead of randomly rolling for them. As these greatly impact on your combat capability (and survival), it is a major decision you must make.&#10;&#10;Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot and crew along with your nightfighter assignment, play proceeds by checking for incoming raid information while checking for weather prior to take off (as the sortie may be cancelled). One must also check for random electronic failure. Following successful take off, play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the British bombers. One is not immune to Spoof raids, in which case German ground control is deceived, causing you to burn precious time and fuel flying the wrong direction. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a new nightfighter, or request a change of base. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until July 1944 should you make it through unscathed.&#10;&#10;This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters or Silent Victory designed by Gregory M. Smith (published by Consim Press). The game system lends itself very well to capturing the tense air defense over Germany. While Nightfighter Ace is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions.&#10; Product Information:&#10;&#10;        Complexity: 6 out of 10&#10;        Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10&#10;        Time Scale: 3-4 days per Turn&#10;        Map Scale: Abstract&#10;        Unit Scale: individual aircraft, individual weapon systems, individual electronic systems, specific crew members, and ammo rounds&#10;        Players: one (with option for two or more)&#10;        Playing Time: two to three hours&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One Countersheet of 9/16&Prime; unit-counters&#10;        Sixteen Aircraft Display Mats 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime; (double-sided, 32 total)&#10;        Four Player Aid Cards 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;        One Combat Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;        One Bomber Target Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;        One Pilot Awards Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;        One Air Operations Display Mat 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo;&#10;        Forty Ace Pilot Cards&#10;        Sixty Combat Cards&#10;        Rules Booklet featuring extensive Historical Background&#10;        One Logsheet 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;&#10;        Two 6-sided and one 10-sided die&#10;        Box and Lid&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1992, GMT released Rise of the Luftwaffe, the first Down in Flames WWII air combat card game. That game covered the early part of the War in Europe, from 1939 to early 1942. It was followed a few years later by the Eighth Air Force expansion module, which added aircraft and campaigns for the latter part of the war.&#10;&#10;Since then there have been two more games (Corsairs and Hellcats, Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942), two packs of additional aircraft (Down in Flames Squadron Pack 1: Fighters, Down in Flames Squadron Pack 2: Bombers), and a large number of C3i modules for the series. However, the original two games have been long out of print. GMT has considered a number of options to address that, from straight reprints to a base game/campaign module arrangement. Finally, though, the company has decided to P500 an entire new game covering the war in the ETO (European Theatre of Operations) from 1940-1944.&#10;&#10;Wild Blue Yonder is a true deluxe Down in Flames product. It contains a dozen full campaigns, over 200 aircraft cards, plus all of the necessary targets, resource sheets, and play aids needed for play. All of this is packaged in a large box similar to the ones for the Combat Commander games.&#10;&#10;Many of the campaigns are on the same subjects as those in Rise of the Luftwaffe, 8th Air Force and various C3i modules. However, they are not simple reprints of those campaigns. Wild Blue Yonder contains three different types of campaigns: Land Campaigns, Progressive Campaigns, and Operations (The Schweinfurt Raids, for example). The first type is the familiar &ldquo;standard&rdquo; DiF campaign to which players of the system are accustomed. Progressive Campaigns give both players a fixed &ldquo;order of battle&rdquo; along with reinforcements and replacements they will have to use throughout the campaign. This reflects the more attritional nature of these air campaigns.  The game also includes one solitaire campaign for players who don&rsquo;t have an opponent available.&#10;&#10;",

After its Steam and Xbox One releases, SUPERHOT is taking its unique game mechanisms to the world of tabletop games.&#10;&#10;In the micro deck-building SUPERHOT Card Game, based on Agent Decker, you use abilities and items to deal with increasing threats. Threats you eliminate are added to your hand, giving you improved abilities and more options while bringing you closer to victory &mdash; but you need to be careful because the more cards you use, the faster you move through time (represented by a line of obstacles moving in your direction).&#10;&#10;In more detail, you need to interact with obstacles &mdash; whether killing them or knocking them out &mdash; to increase your future possibilities for interaction or to give you more time before bullets appear! The cards that you use are discarded to the obstacle pile while cards you pass by are placed in your personal discard pile, creating a mini-deck of cards. The game has three types of obstacle cards: enemy, scenery, and objects, with each type giving you different abilities when they're in your deck.&#10;&#10;SUPERHOT Card Game has four play modes:&#10;&#10;    Solitaire: You play against the system.&#10;    Cooperative: Two players play against the system.&#10;    Competitive: You face off against another player, with this player representing the system.&#10;    Cooperative against another: Two players team up against a system player.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

After a bloody civil war, the Emperor was banished and the empire fell into the darkness, governed under the tyranny of the Dark Shogun.&#10;Pick one hero, each of them with their background and skill tree, to embark with your gaming group on an epic adventure. Travel through Japan, where you will be able to trade, visit shrines to increase your divine connection with your associated god, learn about the story of each character and many more, in an evolving map which will react to your decisions failures or successes.&#10;Each hero shall have a customized board with many options to decide your way of playing. Will you focus on divine powers, unleashing a devastating God Mode to use as a final option sacrificing your own body on the process? Or would you prefer to unveil your own history via personal missions? Many options are laid before you and choices will have to be made along the way.&#10;The game will include many travel events where your hero could go into the magical forest of the Tengus, travel to cursed villages and battle with the help of his blade the terrifying creatures of Japanese mythology&hellip; Some of these event cards can be turned into even more dangerous events depending on your hero decisions. Will you travel following safer roads to avoid potential conflicts or will you choose to go through more dangerous sideways to gain some precious time needed to achieve your goals before the Dark Shogun keeps on spreading his influence and power all over the land?&#10;Besides this, the combat system will also allow you to choose your way of playing. You will be able to decide if you want to use heavier and more damaging blows or faster ones, giving you extra time for other purposes. Also, you will be able to choose if you want to focus during your attack, allowing you to go through the enemies&rsquo; defense or diminish it for the rest of the battle. But beware, because a failed attack could even lead to a terrible counter from one of the many japan folklore-based members of the Shogun Horde. Not only that, but also during each and every attack the energy of the kami could give even more power if you are lucky enough to get the right combination from the yin-yang symbol dices. Finally, the dice-based skill system will also allow for powerful moves during your turn, giving passive or active effect to choose from. But beware, cause the more powerful a skill is, the harder it will be to use it again, adding a tactical layer to the game. &#10;Besides all the mechanics, we think that a good story is a crucial part of immersion and fun, and for that we are honored to have one of the top fantasy Spanish writers, David Velasco, in our team. Get ready to dive into a branching and evolving story, where decisions can deeply affect the outcome of upcoming sessions.&#10;Regarding art production we count on well-known artists and illustrators who have made fantastic pieces of art to recreate the Japanese culture. Our sculptors have created incredible minis to get a deeper immersion in the extensive world of Harakiri.&#10;Hone your blade and fight for your clan like a hero and get involved in the wonderful lands of Harakiri!&#10;&#10;SYNERGIC GAMES&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To gain clout and fortune (i.e., victory points), families extend their Influence outside the city, sending representatives to foreign markets. As their authority spreads, the power of Venice increases accordingly, and distant towns and ports fall under the sway of the Serenissima. In the meantime, players compete inside the city for the coveted title of Doge, the head of the government, spending resources and Ducati (money) to gain popularity.&#10;&#10;But the hegemony of Venice over the Mediterranean is threatened by many enemies. The Republic faces the rise of competing powers, such as the rival seafaring Republic of Genoa and the Crown of Aragon to the west, or the Eastern Roman Empire and then the Turks to the east. Century after century, players will take part in the struggle that will see the rise and fall of the Republic of Venice.&#10;&#10;Venetia is played across three epochs: Rise, Apogee and Struggle. A Power track on the board is used to record the passage of time. Venice starts the game in its Rise, and the game ends when the Struggle epoch is completed. Players score VPs at the end of every epoch, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

We're Doomed! is a quick, timed, panic-inducing game of international collaboration, retaliation, diplomacy, conspiracy, and blowing each other up for fun!&#10;&#10;It is not the 11th hour. It is the final hour. Do we have time? How many seats will be available? Who will get a seat? Will the ship even get completed?

The bigger the ship, the more players can escape to victory at the end of the game. Influence tokens determine who boards the ship first at the end of the game. Each civilization is better at one of the standard actions.&#10;&#10;During the Contribution Phase, there is no turn structure. Players can negotiate as they pledge their Resources to building the escape ship by contributing Resource tokens. The player who contributes the most Resources is awarded 1 Influence and gets to draw the event card for that round. Each card is one of one hundred unique and ruthless event cards that change the game drastically &mdash; introducing new restrictions, secret missions, ethical dilemmas, physical challenges, robots, aliens, lizard-people and more. The player who drew the event card then takes an action, starting the next Action Phase. The game continues in this fashion (actions, contributions, event) until time is out!&#10;&#10;After 15 minutes, play stops. Time to board the starship. Who gets in first? The players with the most Influence board the ship first. Once full, the ship launches and the remaining players are left behind to die. Beware! Resources can also be used to nuke a player, completely eliminating them from the game, so watch the other players&rsquo; Resource token stockpiles!&#10;&#10;Witness humanity at its worst and finally come to terms with the truth you have known all along &mdash; we're doomed!&#10;&#10;",

Each card belongs to a continent, with some continents having only a single card and some having up to four cards.&#10;&#10;A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show artillery, cavalry, general, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional general line in the process. If a player owns all the cards of one continent, however, those cards are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these cards are now worth more points because you've united the continent under one ruler (you).&#10;&#10;When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring will either gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.&#10;&#10;Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As you know it&rsquo;s been over 150 years since the inventor of the Perpetual Steam Engine (or PSE), Louise Delargue, wrote her last diary entry before her disappearance. That someone could create an invention to seemingly power cities and other technologies forever, without publishing any findings, remains the biggest scientific folly in the era of PSE.&#10;&#10;We took the crystals for granted. The supply seemed endless and their energy seemed unending, but we underestimated the growth of populations and the greed for crystal power. As PSE&rsquo;s across the world try to keep up with the demand, the crystals are breaking.&#10;&#10;In Delta, players set out on an adventure through the Delta region of Kamargo, to try and gather more information about the crystals that power up the PSEs. as players observe the mechanimals such as the tortoise, flamingo, horses, and bulls. Send your crew to the different sections of the board to try and maximize your actions, and later on add new crew members to your team and even set out on special missions.&#10;&#10;Manage your hand well, gather enough knowledge, and emerge as the victor in this exciting steampunk adventure.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Establish the most powerful and prestigious family dynasty through marriage alliances, warfare and intrigue in feudal Europe.&#10;&#10;Among Nobles is a card game where players establish and expand a family dynasty in feudal Europe. Each player starts with a married couple, the ancestral lord and his lady. Throughout the game new family members are added through birth and marriage. Three generational changes occur where the oldest generation perishes due to old age.&#10;&#10;The players take turns activating one of their characters or couples. An activation lets you pick a series of actions in a horizonal row on the character. Since a wife&rsquo;s actions are added to her husband&rsquo;s, activating couples can be more efficient than activating single characters.&#10;&#10;Players advance their influence in the game by waging war, earning gold and expanding their family. As the game progresses, more powerful nobles come into play. Red nobles are commanders: strong on warfare actions. Blue nobles are devout: strong on piety actions. Yellow nobles are tradesmen: strong on commerce actions. Green nobles are negotiators with special abilities or intrigue actions.&#10;&#10;Gold is used to buy extra actions, pay for wedding feasts, muster armies and pay for the education and finer upbringing of male heirs. Armies are used to wage war, bringing riches and prestige back from distant provinces. Prestige points are a measure of your influence on society. The player with the most prestige points at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;While most daughters get married off to other families, the sons continue your family&rsquo;s bloodline. Games can be won and lost because of the right or wrong marriages.&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives a special calendar sheet and a hidden sheet, pencils and dice. Each round, the active player flips the card of the week and declares the day on which the event will occur. All players choose to join or not join the event all at once, and if they join, write them on their calendars. Of course, you cannot take part in the events of the day if you already filled that date on your calendar.&#10;&#10;The biggest feature is the special bond that grows between the characters who participated in the same event. Players plan the events in order to develop friendships and score more points. &quot;Oh, only Hana and Vivian and I are free on Tuesday, so if I suggest going to swim in the sea on Tuesdays and Wednesday, maybe only I can deepen the bonds with the two girls ...!&quot; This is how boys and girls develop serious feelings and judgments are born one after another. Furthermore, &quot;I was the only one who went to the sea when I tried to open the lid!&quot; These goofy developments, the emotions that come from them are the most enjoyable!&#10;&#10;Another feature is homework. Players must balance having fun with friends, and getting their summer homework done, too. If you do not reach a certain number of pages by the end of the holidays, you get deducted points. You will end up cramming all alone the last week, instead of deepening your new friendships. This reality is unbearable.&#10;&#10;Agony, laugh loudly, please talk about sweet and sour summer memories by all means after play. It is certain that the calendar and the secret sheet will be important memorial items after the entry!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This allows for a total of 81 unique power combinations. One of these combinations plays as the original Capital Lux, while the other 80 present the players new tactical challenges.&#10;&#10;The core of the game revolves around the following dilemma: Do you play character cards in your home base for points, or contribute them to the capital to benefit from their powers? At the end of a round, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your home base for any color than the current total value in the capital. Exceeding the limit makes you lose those cards. At the end of the third round, all cards remaining in your home base are worth points.&#10;&#10;The game therefore turns into an act of balancing on a razor's edge: Secure as many points for yourself without exceeding the capital's limit &mdash; always taking into account the current capital powers.&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;160 cards&#10;40 tiles and tokens&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lagoon is a game in which 1-4 players (4 play as opposing teams of 2) each lead a circle of druids to shape the fantastical world of Lagoon by harnessing the power of its magical lands to bend destiny. The landscape bristles with three divine energies. Every player action alters the balance of power among those energies, and thus the players collectively determine Lagoon&rsquo;s destiny. One divine energy shall inherit Lagoon, and the player who best served it wins!&#10;&#10;The world is built using hexagonal tiles, and a new tile is drawn from a bag each time a druid explores a site. Site tiles are double-sided, and each side represents a different mystical site offering a unique magical power to the druids. Each site is also enchanted with one of three divine energies: Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin. Since the two sides of a site tile are always linked to different energies, every site explored presents a choice of which energy to advance over the other two, as well as what magic will be put into the world for use by the druids. Players also strategically deploy their druids to unravel sites aligned with an energy they choose to oppose, removing such sites from the world and tipping the balance of power towards the other two energies.&#10;&#10;The energy with the most sites in play at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny, and the player who most supported that dominant energy is the winner. Support is tracked in two ways. First, whenever exploring a site and expanding an energy's reach in Lagoon, the exploring player gains a divine seed token matching the explored site's energy. These seeds can be spent in various ways over the course of the game, but any seeds of the dominant energy remaining in a player's supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it is removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Information from publishers game page&#10;&#10;Operation Chastise: the Dambuster Raid&#10;&#10;On the night of May 16, 1943, nineteen Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron took off from their base near Lincoln in Great Britain and headed for the heart of German industry in the Ruhr. The squadron&rsquo;s task was to destroy the dams that controlled the reservoirs feeding Germany&rsquo;s war engine. In the words of aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis, the mastermind behind the operation, &ldquo;power is dependant on the supply of natural stores of energy such as coal, oil and water.... If their destruction or paralysis can be accomplished THEY OFFER A MEANS OF RENDERING THE ENEMY UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF CONTINUING TO PROSECUTE THE WAR.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The Lancasters had been modified to carry a most unusual ordnance codenamed Upkeep. It looked more like a petrol barrel than an explosive device, but the painstakingly engineered and tested outer layer cushioned a volatile mine designed by Wallis to bounce over torpedo nets and kiss the lip of the dam, its backspin carefully devised to hug the dam rather than ricochet on impact. Upkeep was supposed to plunge down along the wall like a depth-charge, detonating halfway down. The concussion would crack the structure, and the water&rsquo;s mass held back by the dam would push open the crack, creating a breach in the wall. The dam would be destroyed.&#10;&#10;Eight of the Lancasters would not return that night, but the two primary targets of the M&ouml;hne and Eder dams were breached, letting loose a combined torrent that measured nearly half a million tons of water and taking the lives of over 1200 German civilians and military personnel. Measured in civilian casualties, it was the most lethal night of the bombing campaign thus far, although later missions would dwarf its casualty list. Measured in terms of industrial disruption, the raid cut the region&rsquo;s electrical power for several hours and severely reduced its water reservoir. It was not a decisive blow, but it was successful nonetheless. Had at least one other dam been breached, it could have been devastating. This is your challenge: can you match 617&rsquo;s success? Can you surpass it?&#10;&#10;The Game &#10;In Enemy Coast Ahead: The Dambuster Raid, you command a newly formed squadron assigned the task of breaching the dams in the Ruhr Valley.  Not only are you presented with a variety of decisions, you play the invisible hand of fate as your crews endure the hazards of a dangerous night raid. Play the campaign and you get to organize and train the squadron, or play the historical scenarios.&#10;&#10;Players &#10;Play solitaire and you do it all. Play with teammates and one of you is the squadron commander giving orders to subordinates. The squadron commander wins if the dams are breached, while subordinates compete to accomplish their orders with the least casualties to the men and machines assigned to them. Only one subordinate will win. Of course, if the dams are not breached, you all lose.&#10;&#10;Scale &amp; Detail &#10;Each Lancaster is represented by its own 1&rdquo; counter. Each bomber will carry two or three 5/8&rdquo; markers representing aircrew, ordnance and possibly an elite crewman. All the men awarded decorations before or during the raid are represented in this game by their own marker, each imparting a unique characteristic to its crew.  Even the squadron commander&rsquo;s dog gets his own marker!&#10;&#10;Ground crew are also featured in the campaign game, represented by markers rated for a variety of tasks. You will have to requisition and manage your Erks effectively while maintaining security. That&rsquo;s not so easy. You may find it necessary to transfer the local barmaid or take the drastic measure of transferring 54 squadron out of Scampton airbase, or even quarantining the base altogether.&#10;&#10;Reconnaissance is crucial. In the campaign game you will need to survey the defenses of the dams and the routes to them, but too much recon and you risk tipping off the enemy.  But how much is too much? You will have to target the right dams or the right combination of dams, to get the job done. M&ouml;hne and Eder are the juiciest targets, but what if they are well defended? Do you risk it, or go for the other dams hoping to breach enough of them to achieve your goal?&#10;&#10;Training is vital. In the campaign game you will requisition and then train your crew to fly at exceptionally low altitude, maintain a steady speed, locate the target in the dead of night, and release ordnance at precisely the right distance from the lip of the dam. You will only have just so much time to prepare your squadron. You might have to decide what is more important: learning to maintain the right altitude and speed while preparing to release ordnance, or the ability to find the dam? If your men don&rsquo;t master these skills quickly you may have to favor one over the other. You can always impose extra training, but push your men too hard and they become fatigued, perhaps even damaging their bomber in training or worse, crashing it. And if you don&rsquo;t push them enough you may run out of time. The moon will be right only for so long and the reservoirs are slowly rising. Once full, the Germans will open the valves and release the water, making them that much harder to breach. The clock is ticking.&#10;&#10;The game board is organized into three sections, the Mission Planning Blotter, the Flight Map (from Scampton to the Ruhr), and the Target Maps. The first scenarios use only the Target Maps, while larger scenarios will use them as well as the Flight Map. Only the campaign game takes full advantage of the Planning Mission Blotter, allowing you to organize and train your squadron, assign tasks to ground crew, and modify the Lancasters for this unique raid.  The Lancasters were modified in a number of ways for Operation Chastise:&#10;&#10;&#10;     top-turret and armor were removed to compensate for the weight of the bouncing bomb (yes, those bombers were sitting ducks for Nightfighters).&#10;     VHF radio sets were installed to allow better command and control while over the target (they were standard in fighters but this was the first time a bomber&rsquo;s cockpit was fitted with them).&#10;    Dann bombsight. pair of Aldis spotlights rigged to judge the bomber&rsquo;s altitude over the reservoir.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Target Maps are intended to portray (and analyze) four key elements in a bomber&rsquo;s attack: altitude, speed, distance from the dam, and the angle of approach to the face of the dam&rsquo;s wall. During an attack you will strive for the perfect angle, the ideal speed and altitude, adjusting one or more of these before releasing Upkeep at just the right distance from the dam (&ldquo;Upkeep&rdquo; was the codename for the bouncing bomb). You may choose to pull-up rather than release ordnance, circling around for another run, because finding that sweet spot is tricky and each Lancaster has only one bomb to drop. You&rsquo;ve got to make it count.&#10;&#10;Campaign Game&#10;The full campaign game begins with the forming of the squadron weeks before the raid. The player assumes the role of squadron leader or one of his subordinates in team play, requisitioning bombers, ground crew, and aircrew. He must train the aircrews and results are variable. Veterans tend to get more out of training than less experienced crews, but there is always the possibility of damaging and even crashing bombers, and losing or exhausting crews in training. As Air Vice Marshal Cochrane explained to 617&rsquo;s Wing Commander: &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s a lot of urgency in this, because you haven&rsquo;t got long to train. Training will be the important thing, so get going right away.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the player may order recon missions along the flight path and over the dams, garnering information that will help him devise a target list. There are 7 dams that can be attacked, but it is unlikely the player will have the resources to hit them all (there&rsquo;s nothing stopping him from trying). Before launching the attack the player would like to know which dams are defended by flak, searchlights and balloons, and how high the reservoir is (the higher the better, but too high and the Germans may soon open the valves and reduce the water-level, so timing is crucial). Too much recon can tip off the Germans, however, which means that the fog of war is a very important aspect of the design.  The player won't know if security has been compromised until the flight is already underway. As Wing Commander Gibson explained to the men of 617 squadron: &ldquo;When the other boys ask you what you&rsquo;re doing, just tell them to mind their own business, because of all things in this game, security is the greatest factor.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;All this planning and preparation ends when the player decides his squadron is ready and he launches the raid. The player then organizes his squadron into waves, assigning aircrew to Lancasters, arming them with ordnance, and assigning primary and secondary targets, and wave leaders. Once launched, bombers are likely to encounter hazards along the flight path -- flak and searchlights of course, but also utility poles and trees. Historically, 617 squadron flew low enough to hit sea waves and electrical cables (the player may choose to fly high, but that risks encountering nightfighters, an even more lethal threat). Along the route bombers might experience engine trouble or lose their way. Navigation training pays off during the flight turns (each turn represents one hour of historical time).&#10;&#10;Upon reaching and acquiring the target, the player uses target maps to play attack turns, each representing approximately 8 minutes of historical time. Here each bomber has to negotiate the dam's immediate terrain and defenses (if any -- recon missions might have revealed that some dams are undefended, making them prime targets, but if security has been compromised the player may discover that the Germans have added defenses). There is an approach sequence where the player must resolve the attack of each bomber on the target map, striving for the perfect speed and altitude, hopefully releasing the bouncing mine at precisely the right distance from the dam. There is the possibility of being jumped by nightfighters if the attack is prolonged, motivating the player to get the job done promptly.&#10;&#10;And finally, the player resolves the fate of returning bombers as well as those that lost their way, and then conducts a morning-after recon mission verifying the damage he inflicted on the dams.  A dam that was only damaged may have weakened and breached by morning, or conversely, the reports of your exuberant bomber crews may prove to have been exaggerated.&#10;&#10;The Scenarios &#10;The game is also presented in nine scenarios, each isolating a particular aspect of Operation Chastise. In fact, the rules are organized in program-fashion, the first section explains the attack rules. The first few scenarios can thus be played after just reading those rules. The first scenario, for example, treats the action over the M&ouml;hne reservoir, while subsequent scenarios incorporate more of the mission (and more rules) until the player is ready to undertake the campaign game encompassing the entire operation from training to bombing and return.&#10;&#10;",

The kingdom Frederick established in Sicily and southern Italy ran on an efficient bureaucracy similar to modern, centrally governed kingdoms.&#10;&#10;As one of Frederick II's vassals in Stupor Mundi, you will summon allies from around the Mediterranean, build structures in your castle, and promote specialists to improve your kingdom. You may improve your chances by upgrading your castles: towers house additional allies, walls store more resources, and keeps aid in managing action cards. Through a clever card-selection mechanism, you will have to choose actions carefully, some of which will trigger edicts that affect Frederick's palace, and determine the rewards players may receive from their allies. Do you stay loyal to the Emperor, or do you support independent allies? Keep a close eye on what your opponents do and form alliances at the right time &mdash; or go your own way when things get too heated...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kaivai, by the Ostertag brothers, is a board game about a dynamically-growing island region and the various uses of the islands. The title is Polynesian and means &quot;Water eaters&quot;.&#10;The game is about catching fish to trade for shells and points. The shell money is used to build up the islands, in order to gain more points. At the start of the game the players bid for turn order. The highest bidder goes first and may move his ships - but must pay dearly for new islands. Those who bid less get to pay less for the islands, but don&rsquo;t get to move as much. The players can choose from six different player actions. When a player chooses an action for the first time, it&rsquo;s free. But if it&rsquo;s chosen a second time, it must be paid for and the payment increases each subsequent time that action is chosen. At the start of the next round, the value of the shells is reduced and the fish come closer to rotting. After 8 rounds comes the final scoring, in which the portions of the islands controlled by the players are counted.&#10;(Spielbox)&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Kaivai Expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each space is a day of a player's trip. Each tile shows a country, a plane, or a ship. Tiles are drawn and placed one at a time, and cannot be moved once placed. Once all players' holders are full, a face-down draw pile is made of the remaining tiles, as well as three face-up discard piles. On his or her turn, a player either takes a face-down tile from the draw pile, or a face-up tile from the top of a discard pile. He or she then decides whether to exchange the new tile with an old one. The tile not being kept is then discarded.&#10;Players are attempting to have all 10 days of their trip connect, either by foot, by plane, or by ship. To connect by foot, countries must be adjacent or connected. To connect by plane, a plane of a certain color must be placed between two countries of the same color. To connect by ship, the ship must be placed between countries adjacent to that ocean/sea (or one ship can connect to another).

    "Description": "Guards of Atlantis: Tabletop MOBA is a competitive team-based board game inspired by computer games of the MOBA genre. In the game, each player controls a single hero and uses a hand of cards to move him around the game board, employ special abilities, and attack enemies. Defeating enemy minions earns you coins, which are used to buy levels and upgrade your hero. Your goal is to help your &quot;minions&quot; &mdash; units that are not directly controlled by the players &mdash; reach the enemy base and capture it.&#10;&#10;Even though Guards of Atlantis can be played with just two players, it's more fun when two teams of players face one another as the game encourages teamwork and tactical play.&#10;&#10;Before the game, every player chooses a hero character to play. Each hero has five cards at the start of the game, with an additional thirteen upgraded versions from which to choose when your hero gains a level. Each card is unique and can be used for a variety of different actions. The character roles are not preset and can evolve on the battlefield to better suit your strategy and counter the opponent's choices. There are no dice to roll, but playing the right card at the right moment is crucial.&#10;&#10;The game begins with players placing their heroes and minions at predefined spots of the game board. The game is split into rounds, with each round consisting of up to four turns. Every player gets to play one card and resolve one action each turn. The cards are played face down, then revealed and resolved in order of initiative values indicated on the cards.&#10;&#10;If at any point a team loses all of their minions in the area, the lane is &quot;pushed&quot;, with all minions on the board moving one area closer to the opponent's base. The game continues, with each team trying to help their minions to move to the enemy base. The first team do this wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Your day has finally come &mdash; a famous adventurer has hired YOU to be their squire! When your hero completes quests, defeats baddies, and takes all the credit, they also earn loot, which you get the great honor of carrying!&#10;&#10;Squire for Hire is an 18-card, tile-laying inventory management game for 1-2 players that takes about 15-20 min to play. Players compete to get the highest scoring bag of items for their hero by the end of the story deck.&#10;&#10;Each player takes on the role of a random squire card, taking turns completing story cards and adding loot to their bag for points. You can complete story cards one of two ways: 1) having enough item value (the combined number of spaces an item type takes up in your bag) or 2) using an item (covering up an item in your bag with a new loot card). If you can complete a story card, you get to pick one of two loot cards to add to your bag; to do so, at least one full item must be placed within empty or full squares. You can cover any number of other items in your bag as long as the entire item is covered.&#10;&#10;Once all story cards have been exhausted, players add up their scores. Add 1 point for each regular item, 1 point for each pair of identical items side-by-side, and extra points for conditions met on your squire card. Visible junk items reduce your score by 1 point each, so cover them up whenever possible!&#10;&#10;Keep vital items in your bag for when you need them, pack efficiently for extra points, and eliminate junk to be the squire with the highest scoring bag! Play solo to beat your own high score with all of the cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fight for control of the twenty-fifth century Inner Solar System as imagined in the 1950s in this strategy game which is a close relative of Axis &amp; Allies. The map board's Solar System Display keeps track of the 4 inner planets (Mercury through Mars) and the 9 larger asteroids along their orbits. The rest of the board is taken up by the various territorial displays; the larger planets are subdivided, plus there is Deimos around Mars, the Moon, L-4 and L-5 around Earth and Mercury's two artificial satellites --for a total of 42 territories.&#10;&#10;Leader Characters each have special powers. Troopers represent the grunts --infantry workhorses and cannon fodder. &quot;Gennies&quot; are Genetically Engineered fighters; they are stronger than Troopers but cannot leave the planet for which they were designed. Transport ships carry troops and factories between planets. War ships come as Fighters and Battlers (i.e., Bombers). Killer Satellites play the role of air defense. Factories make all these pieces - although you do have a Black Market option.&#10;&#10;As the planets move through their orbits you must plan your own moves well in advance to exploit planetary conjunctions. The movement rules consider not only the ship movements in the planet's orbits, but also the respective revolutions of the planets around the sun, and allow players to plan some nice surprises when two planets are near one another, which usually happens only once or twice in the game.&#10;&#10;Upgraded by:&#10;&#10;    Buck Rogers 2.0&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Can you limit yourself to the essentials in time to save the village?&#10;&#10;Seers Catalog is an almost-shedding card game in which each player tries to get rid of almost all of the cards in their hand. Each round, players have a unique set of artifacts that give them asymmetric abilities to help manage their hand of cards. When one player runs out of cards, the round is scored: Each card is worth -1, but if you have five or fewer cards in your hand, the lowest value on those cards is worth positive points! However, once you have five or fewer cards, you can no longer voluntarily pass, so holding on to a high-value card near the end of the round hoping for a big payout can result in total failure.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cosmic Eidex is an intriguing little trick-taking game for 3 players. The deck consists of 36 cards, 6 thru Ace, in four suits: Hearts (red), Lizard (green), Raven (black) and Stars (yellow). The Cosmic characters are the heart of the game, providing each player with a special Cosmic power. Each player draws one randomly at game start.&#10;&#10;In Cosmic Eidex, the idea is to take either the most points or the least points (designated by the trump and rank of the cards that you take each hand), to earn a victory point. If in a hand, one player exceeds 100 card points, then the other two players get 1 victory point each. If one player takes all of the tricks, she receives 2 victory points. Seven victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Cosmic Eidex is a mutation of the ages-old Swiss trick-taking card game Jass. Like Skat, the traditional German trick-taking card game, it is a three-player game.&#10;&#10;The Cosmic-like powers each player is given are relatively weak. Most allow the player to break one of the rules once per game (before, during or after), some can be used multiple times. You don&rsquo;t need to know every characters' powers, just the powers of the three characters used in the current game. There are as many character/power possibilities as there are cards, but wise card play usually outweighs their influence.&#10;&#10;",

Two destroyed Black Hawks, 100 American casualties, and twenty-four hours later, the &ldquo;one-hour&rdquo; mission ended.&#10;&#10;Day of Heroes lets gamers rope down from a Black Hawk with a Chalk of Rangers or step off a Little Bird with Delta Force operators onto the mean streets of Mogadishu, filled with the smell of noxious smoke rising from burning roadblocks, a signal calling Somali militiamen to arms.

    "Description": "With Japan torn by war for decades, Oda Nobunaga, the first unifier, succumbs to the blows of his own vassal, Akechi Mitsuhide, in 1582. This event is an opportunity for Hashiba Hideyoshi, who defeats Akechi at the Battle of Yamazaki.&#10;&#10;Hashiba Hideyoshi must then confront Tokugawa Ieyasu, another vassal of Oda at the Battle of Nagakute. Hideyoshi then becomes the second unifier of Japan under the name of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.&#10;&#10;Bound to the status quo, Tokugawa Ieyasu awaits Hideyoshi's death before returning to the pursuit of his ambition. His accession to power is decided in the gigantic battle of Sekigahara. He will force the heir to Hideyoshi to commit suicide at the end of the siege of Osaka. This time, the unification of the country is final, and Tokugawa's heirs will lead Japan for 250 years.&#10;&#10;Tenkatoitsu is the sequel of Kawanakajima 1561. Tenkatoitsu means &quot;Unity under the Sky&quot;. That was the name given to the era during which one Clan was victorious over the others, which in turn led to the end of the war (Sengoku Jidai).&#10;&#10;Tenkatoitsu simulates 3 battles of the end of Sengoku Jidai: Yamazaki (1582), Nagakute (1584) and Sekigahara (1600).&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes orders assigned to each army's Clans as much as the inertia of the battle. A game turn is divided in activation phases drawn from a recipient containing Clan chits and obligatory chits (for combat, movement, etc.). The game system is also remarkable for the battle plans that each players may choose before starting the engagement.&#10;&#10;Sieges played a key role in the battle of Yamazaki, and as such have their own specific set of rules.&#10;&#10;Players scores victory Points by destroying enemy units or controlling key locations.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Settlers of Zarahemla is a re-implementation of CATAN themed around The Book of Mormon. Players try to contribute the most to the land of Zarahemla by building settlements, cities, roads, and helping construct the temple. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards) - wood, grain, brick, water, or stone - to build up their civilizations to get to 12 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Game play is similar to Settlers of Catan, but players can add a stone to the temple by paying one brick and one stone.  The player who contributes the most stones gains 2 extra victory points.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone collecting any resource cards based on the roll and position of settlements (or upgraded cities) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), from having made the biggest contribution to building the Zarahemla temple, and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 12 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Rather than having individual hexes like CATAN the game has five separate strips of hexes. These are double sided so it is still possible to construct different board configurations.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;The Settlers of Zarahemla Mini-Expansion (2003)&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "An Age Contrived is a fantasy euro game of engine building and resource programming. You play as a god in the Eldranic pantheon, where you are only as powerful as the mortals of this unstable world believe you are. Your goal is to establish yourself as the pantheon's prevailing god by securing mortal belief, as you advance the mortal realm from its age of darkness into civilization.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a character board and a transmutation device, which they use to channel their energy into the mortal realm. Energy is how a god exerts its will, and is used to construct monuments, claim new tiles, and accomplish lasting achievements. Bind your energy for end-game scoring, and unlock new energy to replenish your reserves. The game ends when the last monument is complete, at which point the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;There are two types of turns, with no rounds or phases. On a player's turn, they must either charge their transmutation device and program it openly, or use its energy to take as many actions as they have already programmed. Information is open, and the only luck is in the shuffling of tiles to set up the game. Player choices determine how the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;The game features unlockable unique player powers, a board that players construct differently each game, and 5 ways to build your engine. You will be encouraged to plan ahead, but required to adapt your strategy in order to come away victorious.&#10;&#10;",

Increase your profits by buying shares of the shops that use the goods in which you trade. Gain gold and prestige by fulfilling the orders of the Guild Hall craftsmen.&#10;&#10;But Venice is a city of fickle demands and mercurial politics. Spend your ducats wisely and look for help from powerful people such as the Guildmaster, the Harbormaster, the Tax Collector... or perhaps a Thief. Even the humble Gondolieri have powerful connections in Venice. In the end, the most important thing to remember is the simple rule of commerce... buy low and sell high!

The most notable changes are that the Quick Start Rules omit heat generation and management, critical hits, and the &quot;Inner Structure&quot; of the mech. The intended follow-on box from this is the &quot;A Game of Armored Combat&quot; (2019) box. In 2022 the Beginner box was updated and reprinted.

Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands.

All other players score nothing. (If the winner is in the negative portion of the racing track, he loses points instead.) After five races, sum all of the points scored; the player with the second highest total who has won at least one race wins.&#10;&#10;This revised version of Why First? has new rules, including simultaneous actions by players that cuts down the playing time from the original release.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Great Plains in the latter half of the 19th century was a cultural battleground. The Native way of life was under siege by an avalanche of invaders seeking land and progress. Plains Indian Wars reduces this monumental and catastrophic series of conflicts to its basic elements: A settler surge via long snaking wagon trains, the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, east and west, and the cavalry sent to protect them all. At the same time, Plains Indian Wars seeks to offer the Native-American player the opportunity to unite earlier, hold their own and perhaps even prevent European-American success.&#10;&#10;Plains Indian Wars can be played by 1-4 players. It is a card-driven, cube game that uses area movement and control. Game play averages 60-90 minutes. The Plains Indian Wars Map board centers on the Great American Plains between the Mississippi River in the east and the Rockies in the west, the Canadian border in the north and Mexican border in the south. The Northern Plains Tribes (NPT) and the Southern Plains Tribes(SPT)each defend 12 regions while the Northern (Crow)and Southern (Mexican) &quot;Enemies&quot; each defend 5 regions of their own.&#10;&#10;Separating the NPT and SPT is the planned route for the Transcontinental Railroad. US Completion (linking the two lines) ends the game and earns the US player a bonus. The Indian player earns a bonus if this is prevented. Through the course of the game Wagon trains attempt to travel historical trails to the Rockies. If they make it they earn victory points for the US player if they don't the Indian player gets the VPs.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each card causes your builder to move through the city and perform an action - either basic or an advanced one which requires a correct die. You then gain benefits from the city tile your builder ends up on. Be careful as each tile action uses one of your investment tokens and blocks that tile until the investment token is removed.

    "Description": "From the Manufacturer&#10;Discover the secrets of Hogwarts in this version of the classic Mystery game. Enjoy new game play features and a moving Hogwarts game board. Dark magic has been performed at Hogwarts. A fellow student has vanished from the famous School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--and it is up to you to solve the mysterious disappearance.&#10;Play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna or Neville and try to discover who did it, what spell or item they used, and where the student was attacked. Was it Draco Malfoy with a Sleeping Draught in the Owlery?&#10;Move around Hogwarts making suggestions--but watch out. Wheels on the board actually move to reveal secret passages, hidden staircases, and even the Dark Mark. Think you've gathered all the facts you need? Go to Dumbledore's office to make your final accusation to win the game.&#10;&#10;This version of the classic Clue game combines the standard clue idea of going from room to room making suggestions of who, what, and where. However, this version adds a few new ideas.  The first is the ever changing board.  On a players turn s/he roles three dice, two regular and a special die.  The special die has the four houses of Hogwarts on it.  This allows a player to change the layout of the board, by opening/closing doors, changing the secret passage way, reveling the dark mark (causing lose of house points), or getting help cards.&#10;&#10;The house points are a second change.  In this version either a player can win, or all players can lose and the dark side wins, by getting all the players house points.  House points are lost when the dark mark appears and a card is reveled from the dark deck.  The players affected must either show a help card that protects them from the dark deck card, or lose the set number of house points.  Dropping to zero house points causes a player to lose and out of the game.&#10;&#10;The other two card types are the third change in the game.  There are help cards that consist of items, allies, and spells.  These are used to combat the second deck, the Dark Deck.  The dark deck cards are revealed when a dark mark appears either on the dice roll, or by moving the house wheels changing the door layouts.  The dark mark card affect players in specific locations and those players must be able to show the indicated help cards or lose house points.&#10;&#10;All-in-all the idea is the same as traditional clue, but the extra things makes the game just different enough.  People that like Clue and/or Harry Potter would enjoy this version.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts the game with money cards valued 0-8, and at the start of the game, everyone chooses money cards that sum to 14 (with the 0 being included) and lays those cards face up on the table. Province cards equal to the number of players are revealed, and players take turns bidding on provinces by placing exactly one money card next to one province, outbidding an opponent if someone else has already bid there; if you're outbid, you take back your money card, then bid again on your next turn. Eventually everyone will have bid on separate provinces, after which you discard the non-0 bids, then lay out new province cards and run through two more rounds of bidding.&#10;&#10;Province cards show different numbers of pyramids, ankhs, and fields, with a caravan possibly being visible as well. Whoever has the most ankhs visible is Pharaoh, going first in each action with ties broken from the Pharaoh going clockwise.&#10;&#10;After three rounds of auctions, players will have some amount of money (possibly only the 0) still in hand. Everyone simultaneously makes an offering of gold, and the sum of the offerings determines how much the Nile floods, which determines how much money players will earn from fields. If the sum is 10 or less, players with caravans receive 10 gold per caravan. Whoever offers the most gold receives three pyramids to place on their province cards, with others receiving two and one pyramids.&#10;&#10;In player order, players determine their income level, then spend gold to build pyramids on their cards (distributing them as equally as possible), then they take money cards into their hand to account for any income not spent. They then score points for sets of pyramids, for having nine or more fields, and for having the most ankhs.&#10;&#10;The second and third rounds of the game play out similarly, except that when you claim cards following the auction, you place these province cards on top of your previous province cards so that only the imprinted and acquired pyramids are visible. Everything else is buried in the sands. You score again at the end of each of these rounds, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Trekking the World 2nd Edition is a light, gateway strategy game where you race to the world&rsquo;s most fascinating places, draft itineraries, collect souvenirs, and gain powers that combo.&#10;&#10;The 2nd edition is a complete mechanical overhaul based on analysis of thousands of online comments about 1st Edition, and our evolving design principles.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve tried to create a game hobbyists AND their families will like. A tough design challenge.&#10;&#10;Who It&rsquo;s For:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Hobbyists who want to entice non-gamer friends and family into playing&#10;     Hobbyists who like rules-light games with some hidden strategy&#10;     Folks getting into the hobby for the first time&#10;     Folks looking for a gift (it feels premium)&#10;     Folks who want to turn their 10-and-up kids onto strategy games&#10;     Folks who want to learn about cool places in the world, or want their kids to&#10;&#10;&#10;Who It&rsquo;s Not For:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Folks who adore 1st Edition (why risk regression to the mean?)&#10;     Folks for whom the blocking in 1st Edition is essential - we replaced it with other interactions (but it's easy to house-rule it back in).&#10;     Hobbyists who dislike rules-simple games regardless of strategic qualities&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The king of Utopia has invited princes of the greatest civilizations of antiquity to come and live within the walls of his city, welcoming in doing so, the architectural wealth of their far-away cities. As the King&rsquo;s Minister, your Sovereign has given you the mission to welcome and accompany these princes and princesses who will present themselves at the gates of the city. Every development added to the city made by your guests increases your prestige.&#10;&#10;Online play&#10;&#10;&#10;    Jeux sur un Plateau (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;40 Monument Figures: 8 for each of the 5 civilizations (Mayan, Persian, Egyptian, Greek and Chinese)&#10;4 Wonder Figures&#10;5 Minister Figures: 1 of each color (used for Score Track)&#10;200 Prince Tokens: 40 of each color&#10;40 Bases: 8 of each color&#10;10 Privilege tokens: 2 of each color&#10;40 Guest tokens: 2 per civilization for each of the four islands on the board&#10;50 Action Cards: 10 for each civilization&#10;5 Rule Summary Cards: 1 per player&#10;1 Bag&#10;&#10;Basic Game play:&#10;&#10;Turn order (after the first player) is derived from who has the highest score on the perimtere score track yet has not had a turn. Each game turn is broken down into three phases:&#10;Phase 1: Welcoming the Princes&#10;Phase 2: Development of the City&#10;Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Welcoming the Princes&#10;&#10;In the first phase, Guest tokens are placed on the board near ship icons but corresponding to the symbol on each token. These guest tokens are then replaced with Prince tokens that is their own color, or of the same civilization as the chosen Guest or in any District of the island indicated by the Guest or any combination of these. This is repeated three times until all Guest tokens have been removed from the board. While this is happening, players may Build a Wonder or Take Control of a District.&#10;&#10;At any point during their turn, if a player has one prince of each of the 5 civilizations on one island (regardless of which Districts they are in), he may immediately construct a Wonder and receives 6 Prestige Points. There may only be one Wonder per island and a player does not have to construct Wonders.&#10;&#10;At any point during their turn, if a player possesses 3 princes of the same civilization in the same District, and that District is not already controlled by another player, he may decide to take control of the District by placing a Monument on that District. There can only be one Monument per District, and this space, once acquired, cannot be retaken. For taking control of a District the player gains Prestige Points during Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points. Also, if the District belongs to an island where a Wonder has been constructed, the owner of the Wonder immediately scores the number of Prestige Points indicated on the District.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Development of the City&#10;&#10;Each player receives 5 Action cards and discards based on their score in the score track. The person in the lead discards two cards, the last player doesn't discard any and all other players discard one. Four types of actions are possible and occur multiple times in a player's turn:&#10;&#10;1) Move one or two princes:&#10;&#10;If a player decides to move two princes with a single action card, these two princes must be within the same District and make the same movement.&#10;&#10;LAND MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization to an adjacent District (Districts are separated by alleys or bridges).&#10;&#10;SEA MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization from one maritime District (showing a ship) to another maritime District. These two Districts must be in the same maritime sector or in two adjacent maritime sectors. (The division of the maritime sectors is indicated by the dotted lines originating from the 3 lighthouses of the city).&#10;&#10;2) Add a prince:&#10;&#10;By discarding an Action Card, a player may place a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization.&#10;&#10;3) Remove a Prince:&#10;&#10;If the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. Th e player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.&#10;&#10;or 4) Influence the King (altering the Prestige Scale):&#10;&#10;If the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. The player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.&#10;&#10;The value of each civilization, indicated on the Prestige Scale, determines the point value of the districts controlled by each player at the end of the turn. By discarding an Action Card, a player may increase the value of a civilization by 1. The Value figure of the civilization changes places with the figure directly above it. With two Action cards, a player may reduce the value of a civilization to 1. All the other figures are moved up accordingly. At the end of their turn a player can only have a maximum of 5 Action Cards.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points&#10;&#10;Once all the players have carried out their actions, the points for the round are calculated. Each player, in turn order, gains points for each District that they control. The value of each civilization is indicated on the Prestige Scale. The players&rsquo; Minister figures are moved up the Score Track.&#10;&#10;If one or more players have reached at least 50 Prestige Points at the end of this phase, the game ends. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",
