There, he created his own society, based on a  caste system ruled by the bravest and brightest warriors of the Star Federation's  military. Organized into clans, taught to place honor before and above all else, the  General's followers drilled and trained for generations, knowing one day they would  return to human colonized space, unifying all the squabbling warlords in a single,  bloody Jihad. That day has arrived!&#10;&#10;Note: these rules are a supplement for the one-page micro-game War of the Mecha.  You will need War of the Mecha to use these rules.

Everyone now puts 5 counters into the 'Pool' and receives cards, leaving half the pack as a 'reserve'.&#10;The player sitting left of the dealer starts and must play the first card of any set, if he has one. The next player plays a second card to the set started by the player to his right, if he has such a card. And so on, until a full set of three cards is revealed. The player playing the third part of the set (actually, called a trick in the rules), and must now start a new set if he can. There are penalties for a player not playing a card when he should or if the wrong picture is completed and so on. If you genuinely cannot play a card, you draw a card from the reserve.&#10;Interestingly, for a game of this age, you can score bonus points for certain tricks or negative bonuses for some tricks.&#10;For example, completing the Baby set takes 5 counters from the pool and one counter from every other player, or completing the Horse Omnibus set pays three counters into the pool, and so on.&#10;The player taking the most tricks when all 24 sets have been completed takes the remaining counters in the pool and the player now with the most counters, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

First you take the cubes out of the box, then, in turn order, each player selects a cube and places it back into the box. Once all 9 cubes are back in the box, the second phase begins. The starting player takes any cube from the four corners and starts to form a 3 x 3 wall of 'bricks'. The next selected cube must be taken from the space adjacent to the first cube, in clockwise order. Remember, when you choose a cube and place it, the opposite side of the cube will be facing your opponent, so you need to help yourself whilst also giving non-attractive 'cards' to your opponent.&#10;The main game is one where you try to get the best Brag (a form of Poker but only three cards count) hand facing you. There are other games suggested, with a form of Patience being the best.&#10;&#10;",

There are numerous cards such as, Press Report, Disciplinary Hearing, Result, that sort of thing.&#10;The idea is to buy players who are good in the Division you are currently in, and improve the team's performance. The track on board is octagonal and six sides relate to week-days and two sides relate to Saturday morning and afternoon. On that afternoon you collect gate receipts when you pass the square designated for that purpose. This improves as you rise up the divisions. Also in this section, you can choose to earn 1 point for your match (the game was a draw) or you can purchase a Result card and take your chances.&#10;The designers were two British footballers, quite well-known.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Skirmish Wars: Blitz is the first expansion for the lightweight, tactical wargame based on the wildly popular turn-based strategy game series Advance Wars, originally released on the Game Boy Advance by Nintendo.  Skirmish Wars is a print-and-play game that uses a modular, customizable map system for endless replayability, and simple mechanics to streamline gameplay.&#10;&#10;While the objectives of a given game of Skirmish Wars will vary from scenario to scenario, The classic objective is to win by capturing your enemy's HQ or failing that, by eliminating all of his units.  To do so, a player must manage and secure new sources of limited funds, think quickly to out-maneuver, out-produce, or out-gun his opponent, and be ready to counter enemy strategies and units with their own.&#10;&#10;Skirmish Wars: Blitz introduces several new units including aircraft (all based on their counterparts from the original Video Game series) and eight new COs.  It also introduces new rules for repairing units, rules for units with limited fuel (like air units), and finally a fifth side that may be played.&#10;&#10;",

The player then mimics the pictures on the tile to suggest an elephant's trunk motion or a wolf howl or a monkey's down-turned mouth, all within this zoo theme. Since the tiles use picture cues, reading is not necessary and components are not language specific.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Congo is a game created by the Frenchman Charles Watilliaux between 1874 and 1907. This game would have fallen into oblivion were it not for another Frenchman named Michel Boutin after a public inquiry into this game in his book: &quot;Jeux de pions pour aujourd 'hui&quot; in 2001 and reintroduced by Oriol Comas in his book &quot;The World Games &quot;&#10;Congo is a very simple abstract strategy game with a board and a easy game mechanics.&#10;This game tries to emulate a site on the banks of the river Congo.&#10;4 people play and have 12 pieces each and take turns placing them anywhere on a 5x5x5 hexagonal board. The only requirement for placement is that it is not adjacent to a piece of another color, although you can play adjacent to your own color. After placing a piece, it can not be moved in any way. When a player is blocked and can not place any more pieces, they are out. The game continues until no more pieces can be played by ANY player. &#10;When a game is complete, points are then awarded. Each player gets one point for each piece not played by a player who went out before them. Thus, 3rd place gets the points for all pieces left by 4th place, while 2nd place gets points for both 3rd and 4th place's pieces. The winner gains points from all 3 who fell by the wayside.&#10;(Adjustment: If you allow ties in how many pieces are left over instead of &quot;first unable not play is first out&quot;, then both people who tie gain the points of the other person they tied with.)&#10;The best thing is to play four games, so that each player has the chance to play first. &#10;The winner is the one with the highest cumulative score after four games. &#10;When only two people play, it requires each player to use two colors, and each player must take into account that the two colors belonging to a player can not touch each other.&#10;&#10;&#10;El Congo es un juego creado por el frances Charles Watilliaux entre 1874 y 1907, este juego hubiese caido en el olvido a no ser por otro frances llamado Michel Boutin que luego de una investigacion publico este juego en su libro: &quot;Jeux de pions pour aujourd&acute;hui&quot; en 2001 y retomado por Oriol Comas en su libro &quot;El Mundo en juegos&quot;&#10;El Congo es un juego de estrategia abstracta muy simple pero con un tablero y una mecanica muy bella. Este juego trata de emular un sitio en la orilla del rio Congo.&#10;Jugando de a 4 personas cada jugador posee 12 fichas y las van poniendo una a una en el tablero hexagonal. La unica condicion para la colocacion es que no este adyacente a una ficha de otro color, aunque si puede estar tocando las fichas de su mismo color. Una vez colocada una ficha no se puede mover mas y no hay capturas de ningun tipo.&#10;Cuando un jugador esta bloqueado y no puede colocar mas fichas deja de jugar, cuando el tres jugadores ya no tienen colocaciones de piezas posibles se termina la partida. En ese momento se otorgan los puntos. El primer jugador que quedo bloqueado le otorga tantos puntos como el numero de fichas que no logro colocar en el tablero a los otros 3 jugadores que continuaron jugando; el segundo bloqueado hace lo mismo con los otros dos jugadores que quedaron en carrera y por ultimo el tercer bloqueado entrega puntos al ganador del partido, es decir que el ganador recibe puntos de los otros tres jugadores que han quedado por el camino.&#10;Lo mejor es jugar cuatro partidas, para que cada jugador tenga la posibilidad de jugar primero.&#10;Y ganara el que tenga el mayor puntaje total de las cuatro partidas.&#10;Para jugar de a dos personas solo se requiere que cada jugador utilice dos colores y hay que tener en cuenta por mas que los dos colores pertenezcan a un jugador igualmente no pueden tocarse entre si.",

The winner is the team who builds the greater number of bigger squares, given that the score is the sum of the value of the built cubes.&#10;&#10;SETUP THE GAME:&#10;The players meet around the game board (ex. 4 players: Blue player, Yellow player, Blue player, Yellow player), so that they represent each player&rsquo;s turn. It is a custom that the game should start with a move from the Blue team and to proceed among the players of the teams in clockwise fashion. At the beginning of the match the board has no pieces and the two teams have all their pieces yet to be played respectively.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Each player on his turn can make only one of these operations:&#10;&bull;    Place of a piece;&#10;&bull;    Move of a piece;&#10;&bull;    Pass the turn.&#10;&#10;CONCLUSION:&#10;The match ends when all pieces have been placed and, therefore, the teams cannot make further moves. Interestingly, one of the teams will finish it&rsquo;s pieces before the other team and so can only make the movement (or pass) waiting for the opponent team to finish its remaining pieces. This phase is called the closure of the game. During the closure the team with pieces cannot move or pass.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Even to the Russians, a hardy race with much experience at living in a cold land, swept by bitter winters, the Kola Peninsular and the Murman coast represented the very extreme of a distant, harsh and God forsaken place. Hence, they named their first colony there Murmansk. The end of the Earth.&#10;&#10;To the Allied sailors of many nations who sailed there during WW2 it certainly seemed to live up to its name. Getting there was bad enough with all the hardships of freezing cold conditions, massive storms, and seas that could swallow up a ship leaving little trace. If forced to abandon ship in such waters they were under no illusions that they chances of survival were slim. There were some remarkable stories of survival but the privations endured by those who made it back alive were just as remarkable in that there were so few who lived to tell the tale of being sunk on the Murmansk run.&#10;&#10;Of course, although the port facilities available were Spartan and poorly equipped to handle the huge amount of stores delivered, then there was the problem of getting such cargoes there in the first place.&#10;&#10;Having arrived, there were almost no amenities for the crews of ships to use in order to rest up after fighting there way to Murmansk. Indeed the Soviets were reluctant to give the crews much freedom to go ashore at all. Food was scarce. That supplied was grudgingly given, boring and lacking nutrition. So for those who had arrived, the long wait until they could join a convoy back to the UK was like a prison sentence. Perhaps the only thing the Russians seemed to have plenty of was Vodka and with that they could be extremely generous.&#10;&#10;Join the thriving community around this intensely popular war game.&#10;&#10;Game sclae is of 20cm or 8 inches per nautical mile, so  1cm equals 1 knot. If a ship is moving 14 knots, will plot a 14 cm movement in the game, for example. Players are encouraged to play with any sclae, although the desinger suggest 1:3000 as the best one.&#10;Players take the role of and allied convoy from or towards Murmansk or Anchangelsk during the IIWW and try to protect the ships from the German player, who will try to shunk them with either vessels, submarines or the Luftwaffe.&#10;Game comes with a comprehensive way to generate merchants convoys and its adecuate escort of warships, meanwhile the German player will have his own forces. All this will change according to the year and nationality played, so for 1942 the forces will be different from those of 1945 and also those avaliable to the Royal Navy or the Soviets.&#10;The game has also an event generator to add some flavor, and full tables to calculate combat and the damage and critical hits taken by the diverse forces.&#10;&#10;(From the web publisher Nimble Books LLC)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This may be the first British game linked to a TV character. A card game about set collecting but with a difference. As well as the cards and rules in the box, there is a clock with movable hands.&#10;A set is at least two cards, a Portrait card (of a character from the show) and an Audition card (with a time on it). Thus you can only claim a trick if the Time element is the same as the clock currently shows.&#10;The clock starts at 9.00 a.m.. The first player may lay down a set if he also has the correct time. Then the second player has the same opportunity, and so on round the table. However, if a player does not have a set to display, he draws a card from the deck and the clock is moved on one hour. Now the next player has to have a set that includes the new time, and so on.&#10;&#10;",

A number of counters are given to each player before the game begins.&#10;Each player, in their turn, must offer a card for sale to the highest bidder. If a set of two correct halves is owned, the player may claim the trick and lay it on the table.&#10;Household Treasure cards are special. When offered for sale, each player must write down their bid and the seller must write down what he would like to receive. When the bids are revealed, the card goes to the player nearest to the sum demanded by the seller. If the seller demanded less, then he gets what he asked for, not the amount bid by the buyer. If the seller demanded more than ten higher than the highest bid, the high bidder gets the card for just 5 counters.&#10;The six jokers can be matched with another joker even though they are not identical.&#10;The game ends when all the halves have been matched and the one who has the most wins. If tied, it goes to the player who has the most counters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "INVINCIBLE is a game of battle between endurance and courage. It takes you into an arena, where champions from faraway lands come to compete and remain the last man standing. By mastering the balance between courage and endurance, you may reap the glory of the INVINCIBLE.&#10;&#10;Players chose their champion from among 3 different tribes, each fielding a variety of 6 *(7) different classes. 18 *(21) unique characters with 2 special abilities each, 3 playing modes for 2-6 *(7) players promises great replay-ability. When designing the rules, our goal was to make them as easy to pick up as checkers, and as tactically deep as chess. From our experience, it is best learned &quot;on the go&quot;, and even first-timers DO win!&#10;&#10;Players have 3 types of card at their disposal. &quot;Action&quot; card with reddish background, &quot;Equipment&quot; cards with yellow background, and &quot;Special&quot; cards with green background. The action cards work on a bit more complex &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; mechanics, and players need to decide which attacks to commence, in order to get their opponent in the spot they want them. Players pick 3 cards from the deck every time it's their turn in the round, or when they are challenged to a duel. At the end of their turn in the round, they may chose to discard one card for their convenience, yet this could also work against them, since the less cards you have on your hand, the more mouth-watering victim you make yourself. Duel is a battle mechanism, where two players engage into an exchange of action cards, where both of them are allowed to use two action cards for an attack, single special card of every kind, use as many equipment cards as they posses, and utilize their special abilities based on the amount of courage they gained in the season. (One whole game of INVINCIBLE represents a season in the arena). Each player's champion has different starting endurance, courage and  card stock based on their tribe of origin. Endurance and courage are two main resources used in the game. Endurance determines how much damage can the player take, and if it drops to zero, the player is eliminated from the competition. However, they are not eliminated from the game. Players who's endurance drops to zero, come back to game in the next turn as &quot;ghost&quot; players. Losing all their equipment and courage, starting with a single point of endurance. Players who are still competing for the title of INVINCIBLE, can no longer duel the ghost players, but this does not work the other way around, and so they may take revenge on their executioners or simply have fun playing with other player's chances in the game. Courage is gained with every successful hit. This means every time you play an attack card, and you duelist does not play a valid defense card against it, that player loses a point of endurance, and you gain a point of courage. Each character has two special abilities, which spent the courage when used. First ability costs 4 courage points, and the other spends 6 points being twice as powerful. Players need to chose whether they spend their courage early, or save up for more powerful abilities and risk that they get eliminated in the process, or somebody uses a card or ability that would steal their courage. The closer to the epic final duel the game gets, the more courage players gain, as every time you eliminate a player, you gain 6 points of courage, and also, there are more equipment cards available for less competing players. Equipment cards improve endurance and courage capacities, and special cads have many uses to disabling your opponents and &quot;resource redistribution&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;    (x) marked values refer to Collector's and Signature editions.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player shares responsibility for ensuring that the ship makes it safely back to Earth, but at the same time should try to collect as much information about the solar system to win the game when the ship makes it back to Earth.&#10;The game has two separate game boards. The first board represents the solar system, on which the players' spaceship pawn is moved. If the ship flies off the grid, hits a planet or the sun, the ship is destroyed and all players lose the game. The board also includes Event-markers, which are turned over when the ship flies on them, and have a surprising impact on game play.&#10;The other board represents the inside of the spaceship, where players move their astronaut pawns. Each turn, a player must move from one module of the spaceship to another and carry out an action. The actions that can be carried out in the different modules are:&#10;-Bridge: turn the ship's inclination (to determine which direction the ship moves in)&#10;-Observatory: draw two Data cards (giving points at the end of the game)&#10;-Storage: draw two Equipment cards (useful items to be used during the game to save the ship from destruction or help the player's own game&#10;-Engine room: move the ship pawn forward one step.&#10;&#10;The game has three levels of game play with increasing complexity. On level two, Captain's Orders cards are added to the game, which are played whenever a player moves to the Bridge, giving that player an additional action. Also, the scoring system for Data cards becomes based on set collection. On level three, Escape pods are included, which allow a player to win the game even if the ship is destroyed.&#10;&#10;This game was custom designed to order, and is intended mainly for a specific target market, i.e. children aged 8-14. It is an educational game at heart, in which the players learn about the solar system, and the importance of working together for a common goal, while having lots of fun. But naturally anybody can play it, and it works specially well as a game that the whole family can enjoy together&#10;&#10;",

Their aim in the short-run is to fulfill advertising contracts to get money and in the long-run to gain viewers from those groups which eventually will give them victory.&#10;&#10;The action phase is played by using employees cards in order to perform common or special (more efficient) actions. Each employee card represents either a unique special action or a boost of a common action. Each employee, after he/she has been played is discarded. So players must constantly plan their hand keeping in mind the hand limit and the emploeyees available in market.&#10;&#10;Players must manage their daily schedule by purchasing Films and placing them face down next to current day's viewers. Each film has a quality and a duration which constraints the available slots (for example, movies take 3 zones, so a player cannot place a movie in zone 1 and then place another film in zone 2). Also, some employees can boost this quality during the broadcasting phase, producing unexpected results! Films can also be used as advertisments of the channel. They can be discarded in order to grant 1 quality in a matching viewer of the next day's program. Finally, films, according to their type, may give players important end game bonuses (for example, fulfilling an action series 3 times, thus completing a season, will grant 10 working class viewers at the end of the game).&#10;&#10;At the beginning players do not have any money. They will go in red as they will buy films and workers but soon they will need to fulfill advertising contracts in order to get money (or play some shows) and become profitable. At the end money will be added (or subtracted) to the final score. Advertising contracts can give a lot of money if they are fulfilled before expiration (some employees can extend those contracts).&#10;&#10;Finally, players have the ability to create their own custom films and then use them for their program or sell them for good money. Also, designing internal productions is the only way to get Managers who give strong and long-term abilities.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to manage a TV Channel efficiently? Getting most viewers is a must but at the same time you have to do it in the most profitable way!&#10;&#10;",

Players can raise the bid until 7 NT is bid or until one player passes.&#10;&#10;There is a simplified scoring system for the beginners' game. One point is given for each trick won. Both the Declarer and the Defender can win these points. If the Declarer wins at least the number of tricks called for, they win a bonus of 10 points. If he doesn't, the Defender wins a bonus of 5 points and the Declarer deducts 1 point for each Undertrick. The first player to score 30 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The person holding the Whip card cries &quot;Tally Ho!&quot; and asks the player of his choice if he has the Fox card. Various penalties occur if he is right or wrong. Then the Whip is placed into the pool cards, which are now shuffled.&#10;Now each player asks a player for a card, and if he makes a trick, he can claim it in front of him. Then he takes a number of counters from the pool and adds them to his other counters. If a pair of Hounds is played, he collects 3 counters, a pair of Lady Riders, 6 counters; a pair of huntsmen, 9 counters; a special pair of the Whip and the Fox, 12 counters and that trick counts as two tricks at the end of the game. All cards in the pair must match numbers as well as images.&#10;When all the cards are collected as pairs, the player with the most tricks takes the remaining counters in the pool, and the one with the most counters, wins.&#10;&#10;",

I use different colors of felt to denote hills, forest, water, and roads. Units may be hidden and put on opportunity fire, or be activated to move and fire. There are rules for artillery and infantry as well. Infantry may be used as artillery spotters, or to attack other infantry or armor. There is also Infantry support which includes heavier weapons such as bazookas.&#10;&#10;",
