We tried for the emphasis on playability while giving the player a healthy does of realism.  If you are reading this sentence right now, you are probably reading it on paper or in electronic form, rather than written on stone. So read these rules, take the miniatures for a spin, and adjust the battle table to your liking. Season to taste, as the cookbooks say. And enjoy!&#10;&#10;Our system allows for a complete interplay between air, naval and submarine combat without bogging down and killing the fun factor. The movement and combat rules are simple but they do add a level of complexity that will require some critical decision making throughout the game. Our goal was to have you focus on the critical decision tree the rules will present you with - and not fight the rules!&#10;&#10;A scenario book covering 17 WWII naval battles is available for pdf download.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Insatiably curious since an early age, Koba demonstrated an obsession for anything and everything related to adventure. Swords, spells, sneaking&hellip; you name it, she wanted to master it. When adventurers would stay at her grandparents' tavern, she'd virtually appear next to them wherever they went, and hound them for tales of adventure and monster-slaying techniques. Some indulged her precociousness. Others did not, and she has an intense dislike for anyone that she suspects is hiding something from her. When she was of age, she shouldered her swords, staffs, and daggers (quite a trick) and marched off for a life of adventure and excitement in the distant land called Arcadia.&#10;&#10;Promotional character for Arcadia Quest.&#10;&#10;",

Which was, in fact, incredible considering his burgeoning affinity with fire magic, and his rather excitable pyromaniacal nature. In fact, if his parents hadn&rsquo;t been wealthy enough for a cinder-stone house, they likely would&rsquo;ve all perished within the year. While it seemed Pluck was on the fast-track to a University scholarship, he never exhibited much desire to learn more magic than it took to create a small open flame. He greatly preferred watching things burn, and experimented at length, noting particularly the flammability of certain mixtures and chemicals. Now he works as a loyal and happy Guildsman, so long as he&rsquo;s allowed some leeway with regard to collateral damage.&#10;&#10;Promotional character for Arcadia Quest.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For sure the most famous battle on the Italian Front during the Great War, and a pivotal event of the war on this front. &quot;Caporetto 1917&quot; is a confrontation between two different ways to make war: infiltration tactics against static defense.&#10;&#10;Caporetto 1917 is the third wargame on a battle on the Italian Front, after Strafexpedition, 1916 and Gorizia 1916, using the same system and scale. &#10;It will have a series rule book, with the 2nd edition rules, usable for both Strafexpedition 1916 and Gorizia 1916, with consolidated errata and a more detailed artillery use. The Specific Rules will cover the game scenario itself, with rules dedicated to this battle and where game turns will be 12 hours long (instead of one day per GT). In the historical campaign game there is no way for the Italians to win; the two players, or teams, will play the Austro-German and Italian right wing, against the Austro-German and Italian left wing. In detail, Krauss and Stein Groups attacking the Italian IV Corps, and Berrer and Scotti Groups attacking the Italian VII Corps and part of the XXVII.&#10;&#10;The map will run from Mount Canin and Rombon on the West to Tolmino bridgehead on the East, and from Plezzo and Monte Nero on the North to Cividale and the Friuli plains on the South. It will be divided in sectors where each player, or team, will have to achieve its objectives faster than the opponent.&#10;&#10;The campaign game will be big, with 2 maps, and over 1000 units and markers, but short, from October 24th to October 27th, when general Cadorna gave the order of general withdrawal in front of an unrecoverable situation. By that time, after 8 Game Turns, the Austro-German troops should have run across the whole map. Caporetto campaign game is a rush, but also a study of two different approaches to warfare in World War One. In Caporetto 1917 you will find units and specializations from the former two games, beside Stosstruppen, Arditi, gas and mine attacks, and more. Small scenarios will cover specific episodes of this epic confrontation, and an alternative campaign game, with Austro-German and Italian counterparts, where the Italian player can freely deploy its reserves (only), and can test if the battle could have gone better for the Italian colors.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the mobile warfare in the Great War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Time is short, resources are scarce and heroes are desperately needed.&#10;&#10;Perpetuity: Grave Descent is a science fiction worker placement game for 1-5 players and plays Cooperatively, Competitively and Solo. Each round players place workers on work tiles to collect resources, repair damaged tiles, upgrade tiles, build ships and eventually fly missions to evacuate alien villages on the dying planets.  Players must navigate a quickly changing game where lower level workers become less effective.  Players must balance choices between keeping systems operational and spending limited resources on ships and rescue missions.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perpetuity&quot; itself (the artificial star) can be played by one of the players or a set of A.I. cards.  Perpetuity in both cases works against the other players and attempts to hinder their evacuation efforts by unlocking abilities in Gravity, Space, Time and Matter.&#10;&#10;In Cooperative play, players race to save all the alien villages and workers.  If any are lost when a planet is destroyed, the game ends in failure.&#10;&#10;In Competitive play, players vie for the most victory points by maximizing opportunities for points with repairs, exploration, evacuations and collecting resources.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of Sirocco is to move the 6 pawns to the diagonally opposite field which is marked by a bar in your own color. On the way, you must try to take as many pawns from your opponents as you can. Since captured pawns from opponents have more value than your own pawns which have been brought into the opposite goal, the pursuit of the opponent is the hallmark of sirocco.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 6 pawns in one color, which he places on the starting space of the same color. &#10;One throws in turn (clockwise) and advances one of his pawns the number of points thrown.&#10;One's own pawns and those of opposing players may be jumped over. The grey dots form the neutral starting space. pawns of the opponent may not be knocked over in this space.&#10;&#10;Important: You must first move all 6 pawns from the grey neutral space into the green playing field (= onto the green lines) before you can make a move or capture with a pawn that is already in the green space.&#10;&#10;Once all pawns have been moved into play (i.e., no pawn may be on the starting spot, base, or on the gray dots), one may move into the playing field. On the playing fields, players move from point to point, provided they are connected by lines. It is not possible to move an opponent's pawn on red-bordered spots, because these spots are protected. One may move one's own pawn back, but one may not return to one's own neutral square.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has lost all his pawns or has moved them into the base (= the large colored circle). Each player then counts the points he has scored. &#10;The following points are scored: - captured pawn of an opponent &#10;&#10;     Captured pawn of an opponent: 3 points.&#10;     own pawn in the opposite corner: 2 points&#10;     A pawn of your own that is already in the neutral opposite field but not yet in the base: 1 point&#10;&#10;&#10;Pawns which are still in the playing field at the end of the game have no value. The player who scores the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to The Road Chosen, a solitaire wargame where your choices impact every aspect of your command. Player decision making is at the heart of this print and play game. You command platoons of soldiers and armour across the Western Front landscape. You will encounter enemies, obstacles, good fortune and crippling bad luck at every turn as you try to reach your objective.&#10;&#10;During a game you will command both infantry, tanks, support weapons and with the aid of artillery and air strikes progress across one (or more) of the maps on a chosen scenario. You will face stiff, defiant opposition in the enemy forces who are not going to give ground easily. You will need to make hard, tough choices weighing up options with the information you have and attempting to account for the unknown.&#10;&#10;There are random event / enemy forces activity tables that you consult, after your roll your dice (2d6). You also roll 2d6 to receive Command Points each turn, that you can use to move, attack enemy forces in your areas, attempt reconnoiter into new areas, call for air &amp; artillery support to help your units, and rally your units that have been suppressed in combat.&#10;&#10;The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a shorter game, to less than a couple of hours for a larger game and requires very little space.&#10;&#10;You will be commanding either Allied or Axis forces of infantry and tanks against their enemies in a series of  narrative driven scenarios and campaign linking the scenarios together.&#10;&#10;This is a solitaire game, and the 2d6 dice rolls and respective event and action tables will drive the direction and flow of the game.&#10;&#10;Which road will _you_ chose?&#10;&#10;",

Each player places two service cards in his or her playing area. Shuffle the rest of the cards and place each deck face down. Both players draw five cards from their decks into their hands.&#10;&#10;Use rock, paper, scissors to determine the starting player. The starting player chooses one Service card to play and initiate the rally.&#10;&#10;A player must chose a card from his or her hand that features a character shown on the bottom of the card played by his or her opponent.&#10;&#10;Keep on playing back and forth. Each player should draw a card from his or her deck after a successful turn in order to maintain 5 cards in his or her hand.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168; If a player does not have a matching character, their opponent wins a point. The losing player then returns all the cards in his or her hand to the deck, reshuffles, and draws 5 new cards.&#10;&#10;The serving player rotates with every point scored. Players can use any service card as they wish.&#10;&#10;The first player to score seven points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The boat parades. The Pandemic. The Cancel Culture. The Riots. Left-wing Globalists. The Laptop!!&#10;Such Fun!!&#10;&#10;And let's not forget the cheating. Mail-in ballot cheating. Poll watcher cheating. Dead guys voting in droves!&#10;&#10;Can the Incumbent president navigate public opinion, the Main-Stream-Media and win the swing votes he needs? Can he get them back after they've been stolen?&#10;&#10;Swing State Steal is a premium quality product and the perfect consolation gift for the disheartened Republican.&#10;&#10;Summary:&#10;One player is the incumbent president, the other players represent swing states controlled by the opposite party.  The president is playing against all other players in the quest to collect votes.  Each state collects votes in their own color and the president is collecting votes in each of the opponent's colors.  At the end of the game, the president compares his collected votes with each of the states and whoever has more wins that state.  President needs to win a majority of the states to win the election.&#10;&#10;The board is organized in four rounds:  The Campaign Round represents the time from the beginning of the year until election day, the Election day round, After the Polls Close and finally the Challenge Round.  First round is two laps, all other rounds are one lap.  Players roll a die to advance.&#10;&#10;First three rounds are about collecting and stealing votes from the incumbent.  Any player can land on a Fake News space that has a story from the headlines (maybe) and an opportunity to take or give votes away.  Swing states can land on a Cheat space where they draw a cheat card.   The president can land on an Evidence space where he collects evidence cards for the final round.&#10;&#10;States use Cheat cards to steal votes.  They are color coded and organized by rounds.  Green cheats (Campaign) are mail-in cheats, Blue (Election Day) are polling place cheats and Purple (After Polls Close) are big-time cheats.&#10;&#10;The final round represents the weeks between Nov 3 and Jan 6 and is a card games.  The president presents evidence cards he has collected and the State have to play cheat cards they've played that match and return some votes.&#10;&#10;On Jan 6th, the end of the game, is when all of the votes are tallied and a winner declared.&#10;&#10;",

As the battle goes on, your commander in chief will rally wavering units, redeploy and push in reserves, or even change your subordinate's orders entirely.&#10;&#10;He Did What Heroes Do has its focus on command, but the usual aspects of Napoleonic warfare will make an appearance. Skirmishers, heavy cavalry, square formations and grand batteries are all viable tactical options. &#10;All combat needs is just a few D6 to work out if your charging unit has broken through, your musket volleys are wearing the enemy down or if your artillery are hammering away effectively.&#10;&#10;This game doesn't use cards, rolling on tables, distributing points or even command radii to decide which units you can use each turn. Every unit gets to activate once every turn, but they will only follow the orders you gave to their general. &#10;Want those cavalry to charge? &#10;Change their corps' orders, or move your commander to the unit and order them forward yourself! &#10;Or do you hang on for another turn, waiting until the enemy are even weaker? &#10;Your impact can be crucial, but you can't be everywhere at once. &#10;As the army commander, your focus will be on taking the initiative, supporting your subordinates and hopefully winning the day. &#10;Good luck general.&#10;&#10;Designed to be played with 2 to 6mm, but can be adapted to other scales.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Vintage Steam, players are managing a heritage railway. They will need to try to make it as appealing as possible, with a long track, plenty of locomotives and interesting scenery. Because at some point they will have to show the railway inspector just how good their railway is.&#10;&#10;Every round players draft one card for every player. They can either play this card for it's effect or discard it for &pound;2. Played&#10;cards are either added to a players tableau or just used for some special effect like visitors to the railway.&#10;&#10;The tableau is made up of track cards and complimentary cards tucked behind those cards. Players aim to be the first to have at least 5 track cards and a tucked locomotive so that they can play an inspector card to end the game.&#10;&#10;Every body adds up the victory points on their tableau to discover who has the best heritage railway.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Theme &mdash; Avalonia is a fast paced strategic area control game. The story of Avalonia transpires in the lands of Avalon after King Arthur was betrayed and defeated by the four tribes, being left sedated on the Excalibur Tower. A plague was unleashed through the Excalibur, twisted most of the people into Variants. The four tribes &mdash; the Reapers, the Raiders, the Saviours and the Seekers, all thirst for power, endeavoured in hunting down the Untainted, using them to sustain the strength of the tribes. Now, a dreadful tribal war is embarked, never ending until someone crushes down the others and takes over the throne in Avalon.&#10;&#10;Gameplay &mdash; Each player will lead a faction, aiming to expand their army, gain resources and conquer lands on the Avalon Map in order to be strong enough to defeat other factions. There are four phases for each round, the Planning Phase, Action Phase, King Arthur Phase and the Clean Up Phase. During the Action Phase, players have to decide their own combinations of actions to be taken from the 6 types of actions available. Over the course of the game, players have to win Artifact Units before the others, gain Pure Blood resources and eliminate troops from other factions. There are two ways of ending the game, either when the Throne Area of King Arthur is full or when one of the players has reached the ultimate score.&#10;&#10;Objective &mdash; There are two ways to win the game, either be the first to reach 30 points, or fill up the research bar with blood tubes. In whichever ways that the game ends, the players count their victory points, whoever gets the highest victory points wins the game and becomes the new ruler of Avalon.&#10;&#10;",
