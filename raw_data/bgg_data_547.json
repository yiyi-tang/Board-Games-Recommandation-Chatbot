    "Description": "Sink the Bismarck! is based upon the Battle of the Denmark Straits, May 1941.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The game is designed to be played by a team or 'Flag Staff' determining the actions of each ship in their force. The Flag Staff can consist of any number of players; though recommend not more than 8 - 10 per staff. The staff must have one Admiral in charge of the staff and acting as commander of one ship, and a Flag Captain, commanding the second ship. The remainder of the staff is divided among three departments; the Navigation Department (NAV DEPT) responsible for ship movements, the Engineering Department (ENG DEPT) responsible for battle damage repairs and generating smoke screens, and the Operations Department (OPS DEPT) responsible for guns, torpedoes, and air operations. Each department executes its duties through the use of 'action cards' which they hold. These cards are described below.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;During each turn, or hand, only up to two departments may contribute to the four action cards forming the hand for each ship. These four cards are placed next to the ships face down. Each round a ship commander turns over a card from the hand and the actions resolved. The commanders may, based on the course of events, change the order of the remaining cards to the played, or declare emergency maneuvers, however they cannot consult any other member of the staff unless using the Send Signals Card.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;To simulate the pace of combat operations, admirals and their staffs have only three minutes to select and order all their cards. If any ship's commander is not ready at the end of the three minutes, play begins with the ready commanders.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The game can be played with either paper or model ships of various sizes on a large table top or floor. Scale can be set to whatever units are convenient for play; all movement and hit probability charts are based on generic 'unit distances.' One unit can equal 1 inch, 1 foot, 1 yard or any other unit of length which suits the dimensions of the playing area. For table top play, 6 inches per unit is recommended. For floor play, 1 foot per unit can be used.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;This simulation uses a combination of map movement and matrix arguments to give the students a sense of the battle that took place in the Eastern Theater in 1862. The students should be divided into seven groups and assigned one of the commanders in the order of battle.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Each team should be given a copy of the map and their commander's information. The teacher should also track the location of the armies on a map that the whole class can see, and should also keep track of the Fighting Spirit and Supply of each side. After the simulation the students should be asked to discuss their strategy. Compare and contrast their decisions to the real historical events.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;This simulation makes use of matrix arguments. Matrix games were invented by Chris Engle, and you can learn more about them on his website: Hamster Press - Engle Matrix Games. Chris helped with the design of this simulation.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

A British army of 15,000 soldiers and sailors was dispatched from Britain to Halifax, Nova Scotia to train and then launch an attack on the Fortress. The French this time were ready for an invasion and had prepared beach defenses. However, the British were still able to land and after a seven week siege, the French surrendered.

The Romans could not defeat Hannibal's Carthaginian army in the field, and Hannibal could not capture Rome.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Growing impatient, Rome raised a large army and set them under the command of Caius Varro to battle Hannibal. The result was one of the most devastating defeats ever inflicted on an army. Varro was determined that his army would not be outflanked and defeated by Hannibal, as happened at the battle of Trebbia. But Hannibal was one of the greatest generals in military history, and that's exactly what happened. The Romans were encircled and massacred.&rdquo;&#10; A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).

    "Description": "&ldquo;In the second century BC the rich trading empire of Carthage vied with the rising Roman Republic for control of the Mediterranean. In the Second Punic War Carthage's legendary general, Hannibal, surprised the Romans by crossing the Alps and invading their homeland. His army was too tough for the Romans to defeat on the field of battle, but not tough enough to capture Rome. Finally the Romans sent a young and ambitious general named Scipio to invade Carthage. The ploy worked, and Hannibal was summoned home to defend the city.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The decisive battle was fought in Zama, in Northern Africa. The battle featured contrasting armies: the citizen soldiers of the Roman Legions against the mercenary army of Carthage. The two sides were closely matched. The Carthaginian army included close to one hundred poorly trained war elephants.

Their strategy was therefore to destroy the American Navy with a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The plan almost worked. The Japanese ran wild in the Pacific and seemed invincible. The most devastating weapons in their navy were their aircraft carriers. In 1942 the Americans had been driven from the Philipines and Australia was in peril. The next step in their campaign was to seize control of the American controlled island of Midway.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The Americans had different ideas. They had cracked the Japanese code and were routinely reading their secret messages. They uncovered the Japanese plan to attack Midway and decided to gamble everything on ambushing the Japanese carriers. The Yorktown was rapidly repaired and sent to join the Enterprise and Hornet. The Japanese air strike hit Midway Island hard. But then the Americans located the enemy carriers and attacked. The shocked Japanese retaliated but lost all four of their carriers.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yamamoto had once said that he was afraid that the United States was a sleeping giant, which would awaken with a terrible resolve.

The war was fought primarily in Germany as the various German Principalities allied themselves with the Holy Roman Empire or their opponents, France, Sweden, and Denmark. A religious conflict between Protestant and Catholic forces was an important factor early in the war, but later it developed into a struggle for power among the great nations of Europe.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;During the war armies fought in massive, slow moving formations called Tercios. The Tercio consisted of a large oblong formation of pike men with smaller formations of musketeers at the corners. During battle the Tercios would trudge together and battle it out &lsquo;at push of pike&rsquo; until one side broke.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;King Gustav of Sweden changed everything, however, by introducing revolutionary tactics that relied on smaller formations and emphasized movement and firepower instead of brute strength.

    "Description": "&ldquo;The first English Civil War (1642 - 1645) was a power struggle between King Charles I and his royalist supporters on the one hand, and Parliament and its supporters on the other. At the battle of Marston Moor (1644) a Parliamentarian army reinforced by a Scots army decisively defeated the Royalists. It was a humiliating defeat for the dashing Prince Rupert (his poodle was among the many Royalist casualties). The battle left the Parliamentarians in control of the north of England.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).

Similarly the impact of landing on &quot;Loss&quot; space for an industry will be scaled according to the player&rsquo;s holdings.&#10;&#10;A mathematical operation is performed on the calculator for each player&rsquo;s turn.

Units represent infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Rules cover combat (ranged fire and close assault), line of sight, terrain, stacking, zones of control, redoubts, reinforcements, superior Prussian morale, optional Prussian Command, and Austrian &quot;Kamikaze&quot; Hussars!&#10;&#10;Sadowa is a rather simple tactical design, with amateur production values, die-cut counters, and a color 22 x 14 inch map. Published by Fusilier Games (Aberdeen, Scotland), this game game was un-boxed (zip) with a cardboard cover sheet.&#10;&#10;",

When on the way a player loses his car, he must get another one immediately either by purchasing or renting. He pays the registration fees along with the insurance premium and then resumes his way on the game board.&#10;&#10;For the most audacious players who like to take chances, the game gives opportunities to launch into business (business squares) and eventually make money. But beware, the richest player is not necessarily the one who wins; a player without money, who succeeds in keeping his car till the end, has many chances to win.&#10;&#10;",

The Jacobites were outnumbered, low on supplies, and poorly led in the battle. They were subjected to a deadly artillery barrage, and outflanked by the English. The battle was a disaster for the Jacobites, and ended the rising.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

Production number 15504.&#10;&#10;The box cover shows a drawing and signature of Ole Olsen, the Danish world champion in speedway.&#10;&#10;The game has borrowed the player pieces from the Swedish Tippa Speedway, but the actual gameplay and board is very different.&#10;&#10;The board has depicted a 4 lane track in an oval form (as is the case in speedway) which are again divided into squares. Some of the squares are coloured in one of 6 colours - and the colours determine what happens if you land on them. One game lasts for 4 rounds, as in real speedway, but there are additional/optional rules for both team and league play.&#10;&#10;The rulebook actually suggests that since the game &quot;aims at following the real speedway rules as close as possible&quot;, the ideal number of players is 16(!) which seems like a huge number for an old-fashioned roll-and-move game like this.&#10;&#10;Also, the rules in various languages are all signed by Ole Olsen, giving the impression that he actually designed the whole game(?).&#10;&#10;",

The player with the fewest face up tiles in his color goes first. Each move consists of a die roll followed by the move of either one of his face up pieces or a face down piece in a series of horizontal or vertical hops onto other pieces or stacks of pieces, which ends by flipping the moved piece, and removing the piece (if any) the moved piece was on top of when it started. Players who cannot make exactly the number of steps rolled with any legal piece must pass. Once all players have passed, the game ends and the player with the most visible pieces his color wins.&#10;&#10;",
