The occupants of 4 houses are in a constant state of nagging, annoying and badgering each other, to ultimately become the last inhabitant of the game's particular quarter of town.&#10;&#10;As a player you have to choose which other player or players (your neighbours) you are going to pester and therefore target, and which neighbour(s) you tactically choose as your very, very best 'friend'. Following the right (social) tactics and strategies are very important in this tiny world of irritation (with an actual irritation board) and friendship. In the end it's up to you to use the commotion, beleaguer, revenge, lucky and disaster cards in the right way.&#10;&#10;The game is best played with 4 players, but 2-player rules are included.&#10;&#10;",

(Old enough to remember matchboxes?) Twenty-four matchboxes were used to represent the possible moves. Essentially, there were two phases. The first phase was to &quot;teach&quot; the matchbox computer to play the game, then a second phase allowed the matchbox computer to play other opponents. The learning speed depended on the skill of the opponent in the teaching phase.&#10;&#10;There are variants in which taking the opponent's piece is mandatory (&quot;Dawson's chess&quot;) and ones that use larger boards.&#10;&#10;Martin Gardner first published this in his Mathematical Games column in March 1962, and subsequently in his book, &quot;The Unexpected Hanging&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "T&uuml;rkenkrieg: The Russo-Austro Turkish War, Balkan Theatre 1737-39&#10;Volume V in the Lace Wars series&#10;&#10;TK is a two-player game: Imperial Austria against the Ottoman Empire. The Turks have three provincial armies, composed of a mix of infantry and cavalry, and the Sultan's own army of heavy cavalry, janissaries, and artillery. They can also call upon Wallachian and Tatar allies. The Imperials have their core Habsburg-Austrian army, plus contingents from the Holy Roman Empire, and elements from the personal armies of Saxony, Bavaria, and even Modena. They also have the irregular forces of the Military Border.&#10;&#10;Both sides are evenly matched - weakened by war but still dwarfing the forces of their neighbors. The Imperials begin as the aggressors, but will have to play cannily to avoid surrendering the initiative to the Ottomans. Playing for Prestige (like the other games in the series), your goals are modest, but can add up to significant gains that may influence the outcome of the peace talks. The peace process, more or less out of your hands, is the mechanism by which the game ends.&#10;&#10;Map scale is 8.5 miles per hex. Unit scale is battalion/regimental. Units are rated for Effectiveness and Movement; raw strength is factored into Effectiveness.&#10;&#10;Turns are equivalent to three weeks - 16 turns per year. Each turn is broken down into several phases - supply, operations, admin, etc. There are scenarios for each year of active operations - three in all - and a Campaign Game.&#10;&#10;A few key concepts include Initiative and Operational Preparedness, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. This game uses the 3rd edition of the Lace Wars rules, amended to 3.1.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players move their formations, lay siege to fortresses and engage in battle. The player with the initiative can dictate the pace of the game, but since initiative is based on operational preparedness, it can pass to another side, perhaps at an inconvenient time.&#10;&#10;Auxiliary counters represent support troops and irregulars who had a major impact on operations, but cannot be adequately represented as traditional game units. Instead, a player might have a pontooneer auxiliary that he can play onto a stack to help it cross a major river, or a converged grenadier auxiliary that provides a morale bonus in combat. Because of the scale, many combat elements can be used either as units or as Auxiliaries.&#10;[Playing cards could have been used instead of counters, but there are production issues involved, and besides, some of the auxiliaries' functions are hard to indicate with cards. In essence, however, auxiliaries are that kind of game asset, not &quot;pawns&quot; like the combat units.]&#10;&#10;Leaders have an important role to play, as befitting an era where personal command was critical. They are rated for skill or effectiveness, personality, and influence (i.e. the chance they have of retaining command despite their incompetence).&#10;&#10;The supply system incorporates lines of communication, the strategic placement of depots, foraging, and attrition. River and canal movement has been taken into account and will prove as critical to success as the use of rail lines in games that cover more modern periods.&#10;&#10;The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;1) Eight 12x18 inch full colour maps representing the Danube Basin and the surrounding lands, from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, and from central Hungary to Bulgaria.&#10;&#10;2) 1080 counters representing the forces of Austria, Saxony, Bavaria, Hesse, Cologne and other Holy Roman Empire states, Modena, the Sultan's Army, the Ottoman provincial commands of Bosnia, Rumelia, and Silistria, the Wallachians, and the Crimean Tatars.&#10;&#10;3) A set of charts and tables, plus several 11x17 inch display cards.&#10;&#10;4) A series rulebook - 3rd Edition (3.1) - called the King's Regulations and Orders (KR&amp;Os), a game-exclusive rulebook, scenario &amp; OOB information, and an historical commentary.&#10;&#10;",

Luring the English across the bridge, Wallace and Moray strike hard when only half the English had crossed. Three scenarios explore the historical situation.&#10;&#10;His greatest defeat; Falkirk, 22 July 1298, once again pits Wallace, now the Guardian of Scotland, against the English, led by Edward I (Longshenks) himself. Falkirk would be a great English victory but at the cost of much blood...and would herald the age of the long bow in English history.&#10;&#10;Based on the Baron's War system, Wallace's War focuses on the command and weaponry of the medieval battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the Designer:)Wallace's War is the second game in the medieval game series (the other is Barons' War: The Battle of Lewes and Evesham) and this time focuses on William Wallace and his two major battles, Stirling Bridge and Falkirk. The system has been cleaned up considerably by Frank Hastege (who did yeoman's work on the rules). The goal of the series is to create a platform on which to re-create the medieval battlefield. The system is meant to reflect the problems that leaders of the time had. One special focus is the control one has on the battlefield. Once the battle started the leader had the problem of how to change his initial plan if things started to go poorly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game features a fly wheel and a starting grid for 6 horses. From the rules: Before running the race be certain that all horses are lined up evenly at the barrier (starting point) and that all the flags at the opposite end of the track are lowered. To operate, hook loop in string over the pin in the shaft and wind by turning the fly wheel away from you 5 or 6 times. Then hold the game down with one hand and give a vigorous pull toward you. This should keep the fly wheel spinning with enough power to carry all of the horses the complete length of the track to the point where the flags go up. As the horses finish the flags rise, for instance if the white flag goes up then the white horse has won the race and the flags go up in corresponding sequence as the horses all &quot;come in&quot;.  To line up the horses for the next race simply pass the string in front of the horses and draw them back to the start line. All horses have an equal chance of winning the race because once the race starts no one can have control of the action of the horses.&#10;&#10;The rules then go on to say that in some instances dirt or dust can retard the forward motion of a horse. To avoid this,  the grooves in the tracks should be kept clean by occasional use of a soft cloth. Also a drop of lubricating oil on the bearing at each end of the fly wheel now and then is advisable and that GEE-WHIZ should be played on an even and level surface.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is another charming key-chain game from Haba. An unusual feature of this range of games is that the name of the game that appears on the packaging (and only the back of the packaging) is different from the name of the game in the rulebook. So while this game might be labeled as Zwerge, the rules call it Schneewitten und die sieben Zwerge (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs).&#10;&#10;Described as a cheeky die game for 2 dwarfs aged 4-99, the authors are Wolfgang Dirscherl (who has designed several games in this series) and Markus Nikisch. The illustrations are by Stefan Fischer.&#10;&#10;You get 7 wooden dwarfs in 3 colours (divided 3-2-2), and a special die with spots of the 3 colours (the colour with 3 dwarfs is repeated), a side showing Snow White and a side showing the wicked witch. Players take turns rolling the die. If the die shows a coloured spot, the player takes a dwarf of that colour from the centre, or from the other player if there aren't any more of that colour in the centre. If the die shows Snow White, the player gets to take a dwarf of any colour from the centre or the other player. If the die shows the wicked witch, the player nominates a colour and both players return all dwarfs of that colour to the centre. The game ends when there are no more dwarfs in the centre and the player with the most dwarfs wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Produced in 1974 with new NFL rule changes, this is a version of the NFL Strategy game for younger children. This game is a generic simulation of American football. (No real teams or players) Each turn the offensive player chooses a run or pass play from a set of cards while the defensive player chooses from 4 run defenses and 4 pass defenses by placing pegs into a hidden matrix. The offensive play is then inserted into the defensive matrix and 5 possible results are revealed. A die is then rolled and the color of the die face indicates which play result to use. Regular football rules are used, such as 4 downs to gain 10 yards, and scoring is the same as in the real game. As in real football, the object of the game is to outscore the opponent.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rules from AGPC Archives: The game is played with a deck of Horse Cards with names of horses and numbers 1 to 3 printed on each card. 5 horses are entered in a race (hand), a horse can finish 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. During the race (hand)all players try to form a sequence of horse cards from 1 to 3 in front of them. Beginning with number 1 and then adding 2 and 3 consecutively. A player completing the sequence 1-2-3 ends the hand (race). The winning sequence does not have to be completed with the same horse in all three positions. If a  player does complete the 1-2-3 with the same horse that player becomes the next BANKER. The banker in the game sells and redeems Bank shares and Wager Tickets. All money received from the sale of bank shares and wager tickets is kept in an account. At the end of the game the amount in this account is divided among shareholders with an equal amount being given for each share held. At the beginning of the game players can purchase bank shares which are always redeemable for their face value. Anyone not redeeming purchased bank shares during the game is entitled to a split of whatever money is in the bank at the end of the game. At the beginning of the game (race) players can purchase wager tickets on their favorite horses. Bets are made across the board in all 3 positions and players collect from the bank for how a horse finished.&#10;&#10;In order to play the game the deck of cards is shuffled and then the first player draws a card, if its a number 1 card it is kept face up in front of the player, if its any other card it is discarded play continues until someone has completed the 1 2 3 sequence at which time players holding winning tickets matching names of horses somewhere in the winning sequence are paid off. In other words when the wining sequence happens if you had bet on horse 'Stewball' to finish second on one of your betting cards and the winning sequence actually has 'Stewball' in the #2 position that wage ticket wins money for you.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Edgar Bergen's and Charlie McCarthy's Game of Topper has 8 wooden Toppers, one deck of 36 special playing cards, a score pad and a playing board. The number of toppers used in the game is always one less than the number of players playing. the deck is made up of 36 cards in books of 4 cards each. A book consists of 4 cards having the same number. As many books are used as number of players in the game, so if you only have 6 players your starting deck would d have only 24 cards (6 books of 4).&#10;How to play. The dealer places the toppers on the playing board in the center of the table. He then shuffles and distributes the card face down to everyone. The object of the game is to get a complete book of cards in their hand. You do this by passing one card to the player on his left. That player decides if he wants to keep the card and give a different card or if he wants to pass the card on to the next player. This goes on until a player has 4 cards the same in his hand at which time that player then grabs a topper from the center of the board and then everyone else tries to make a mad grab for a remaining toppers. Of course since there is always one topper less than the number of players playing one will not get a topper. that player accumulates the letter T on his score card. Each additional time that the player gets no topper another letter in the word TOPPER is accumulated. The first player who has TOPPER next to his name loses the round and sits out the rest of the game which is then played with less cards and less toppers. Eventually only one player remains and he wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The only problem? You have a bunch of classmates (read: enemies) who are hell-bent on stopping you and beating you at your own game. With elements of resource-gathering, roleplaying and fast-paced screwing over of all those who oppose you, there&rsquo;s truly something for everyone. Provided, of course, that &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; enjoys backstabbing, conniving and The Wrong.&#10;&#10;There are two main phases to the game. In the resource-gathering phase, one player (the rotating TA) reveals an Opportunity that might present itself on a typical day at Supervillain University. All other players will quickly respond, in secret, with their chosen Evil Deed. The TA collects these played actions, reveals them and determines (based on whatever utterly subjective criteria he or she deems fit) which one is the winner. The player with the winning Evil Deed for the round now collects critical resources needed to complete the all-important Secret Agenda in Phase Two.&#10;&#10;After collecting sufficient resources, a player may reveal their Secret Agenda &ndash; a truly nefarious scheme guaranteed to bring the world to its knees. If the player can survive a flurry of attempts by the other players to sabotage their Secret Agenda, he or she will collect valuable &quot;points.&quot; After collecting an arbitrary number of &quot;points,&quot; the winning player may then lord his or her mastery over the other losers playing the game.&#10;&#10;",

Like Scrabble, each letter has a point score associated with it, so that each word can be scored.  The game has 4 levels of difficulty.  At higher levels, players get larger hands of cards, and their words must have more letters in order to score.&#10;&#10;The game comes with rules in English &amp; Spanish, the deck of cards, and a sand timer.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Paizo website:&#10;Divine your future! Lose your shirt! All in one box!&#10;&#10;In the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, the Harrow deck has long been a sacred tool of Varisian fortunetellers. In skilled hands, the Harrow deck can predict crop results, divine the gender of your unborn child, or give hints about your immediate future. In unskilled hands, the Harrow deck is a sacrilegious gambling game&mdash;a cutthroat diversion for ruffians in every port to lose their hard-earned fortunes.&#10;&#10;Harrow will be featured throughout the second Pathfinder Adventure Path, Curse of the Crimson Throne. At least once in each installment, players may divine their futures with the Harrow deck, and Pathfinder #7 contains an in-depth article about the history of Harrow and its in-game use.&#10;&#10;Harrow is also a standalone card game designed by Jason Bulmahn, Mike Selinker, and Teeuwynn Woodruff for use inside or outside the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting. Harrow is lavishly illustrated by Kyle Hunter, the artist behind Downer: Wandering Monster and Downer: Fool's Errand, the Paizo Comics compilations of Kyle's original Downer comics from Dungeon magazine.&#10;&#10;This item also has an entry on RPGG: Harrow Deck&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Roundtable Games consists of four different 2 - 4 player games that are designed to be played on a common game board, called the Roundtable. The four games are Roundtable Chess, Roundtable Checkers, Wordstack, and Checkers Roulette. The game includes 4 complete sets of chess men, 4 complete sets of checkers (15  per set), and four sets of letter tiles (45 per set) that are used for playing Wordstack and Checkers Roulette.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Roundtable Chess is extreme and exciting chess play for 2 or 4 players. Each player plays with a complete set of 16 chessmen. Chessmen move and make captures as done in the traditional two player chess game. Chessmen in Roundtable chess can also be move in circular directions. Each player&rsquo;s objective is to gain control of the center of the Roundtable by safely moving his/her king into that position without it being checked or captured. The first king to control the center of the Roundtable wins.&#10;     Roundtable Checkers gives traditional checkers and extreme twist of excitement and face lift. It's designed for 2 or 4 players. Each starts with 15 checkers and can choose thousands of ways to set them up.  Players can also move up to four different checkers per turn in a circular, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical direction. Like regular checkers, you make single or multiple jumps to capture the opponents' playing pieces. The player that captures the greatest number of enemy checkers wins.  &#10;     Wordstack is an exciting 3-dimensional word game that plays 2 or 4 players. Each player selects 15 lettered checkers from her set of 45 tiles ranging from A to Z. Players may move up to 10 different lettered checkers per turn in diagonal, vertical, horizontal, or circular patterns. The player's objective is to earn points by combining (joining) her checker(s) with an opponent's checker(s) in order to spell words. Words may be spelled forward or backward, and in a diagonal, vertical, horizontal, or circular direction. Players may also capture (jump) an opponent's checker(s) to form a stack of checkers. The stack of captured checkers becomes a &quot;Wordstack&quot; when it is combined (joined) with an opponent's piece(s) to form words. The player who earns the highest number of points wins.&#10;     Checkers Roulette is numbers fun for 2 or 4 players. Each player uses 15 numbered checkers that include the values 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Players may move up to 4 different checkers per turn in a circular, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical direction. You score points by capturing (jumping) an opponent's checker(s), and lose points when your checkers are captured. For example, if your checker with the value of &quot;5&quot; captures an opponent&rsquo;s checker with the value &quot;10&quot;, you earn 50 points (5 &times; 10 = 50), and the opponent loses 50 points. You also earn or lose points by setting up plays. The player that earns the greatest number of points wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;",
