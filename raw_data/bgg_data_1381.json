    "Description": "In Thiefdom players represent competing thief guilds who steal from the rich medieval town called Bacharach to declare the most skillful thieves guild. It is a strategic, interactive and thematic pickup &amp; deliver game for 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a team of three cunning thieves, each armed with their own set of equipments. But be warned, the city guards are on high alert, and it's up to all players to control their movements to avoid detection. With items like grappling hooks, climbing tools, and smoke bombs at your disposal, you'll have to use all your wits to avoid getting caught. In case of a detention, a thief loses all their loot and some victory points.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 6 nights (rounds) and the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;One night contains: &#10;&#10;     Planning Phase: All players simultaneously plan the order in which they want to move their three thieves and the neutral figurines they control that night (city guards, carriage, nobles). Then they reveal at the same time. &#10;     Action Phase (Night): The players carry out the actions in the predefined order from the planning phase. &#10;     Administration Phase (Day): Cleanup and preparation for the next night. &#10;&#10;&#10;The town setup includes 8 modular and double-printed town quarters, resulting in a unique pickup &amp; deliver puzzle in each game. There are 12 different equipments thieves can buy to gain new abilities, and 36 unique guests in the tavern to support your guild.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The forests are so dense that light rarely reaches the ground. An inextricable network of lianas and branches makes any progression hostile and laborious. In the shadows lurk the terrible saber-toothed tigers and immense carnivorous plants.Few are those who dare to penetrate this compact green danger zone  and make contact with the fierce tribes living near the ancient temples of their ancestors. But they are also the guardians of the black lotus, a flower with extraordinary properties... The Companions of the Spear know that this flower would be an unparalleled asset in the fight against the forces of Anastyr, but this quest comes at a cost. The powerful Tanit, known as the goddess of the jungle, reigns supreme over this trade and convincing her will not be easy. In addition, the goddess who claims to be the reincarnation of the All-Mother herself is waging her own war against the tribes who refuse to join her cult, and in particular against Karanja, her main rival.&#10;&#10;",

The skeletons of their ancestors can be seen above the stagnant waters and in some places they look like open graveyards. The region is inhabited by the &quot;Primitives,&quot; a fierce people who worship the All-Mother and consider themselves her children. The Primitives, also known as the Firstborn, consider the swamp to be sacred ground. They are also the guardians of the megadons, whose survival they have ensured over the centuries, despite the presence of dragons that frequently preyed on their eggs.&#10;&#10;The region is inhabited by the &quot;Primitives,&quot; a fierce people who worship the All-Mother and consider themselves her children. The Primitives, also known as the Firstborn, consider the swamp to be sacred ground. They are also the guardians of the megadons, whose survival they have ensured over the centuries, despite the presence of dragons that frequently preyed on their eggs. Each tribe was born in the wake of one of these ancestral creatures, whose name it has taken. Over the centuries, the tribe watches over the offspring of &quot;their&quot; megadon and ensures that it matures safe from predators. The primitive tribes live in lakeside villages. The matriarch's home is always found at the center of these villages, where wood is mixed with the remains of the ancestral megadon's egg. The Firstborn communication uses very specific tongue clicks, which allows them to hunt over large areas and to implement their battle plans against their enemies.&#10;&#10;When moving through the swamps, the Primitives use stilts, the length of which determines their social position within the tribe. To travel longer distances, they ride Kurdai, mounts imported from the High Plains centuries ago. Today, kurdai are found in most village enclosures but also in the wild, as they have become an endemic animal of the swamps.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, an unprecedented threat has been looming over the Bone Swamp for nearly twenty years: the Plague. This disease corrupts living creatures, both animals and humans. In its final stage, the infected become rabid and kill each other. The Firstborn fear that the megadon eggs will also fall victim to this terrifying disease, especially since some of them are regularly traded during the passage of the Great Caravan, in exchange for iron and precious stones... These extremely precious eggs are indeed sought after by all the caravan masters, to enlarge their convoy and ensure their prosperity.&#10;&#10;",

In fact, it almost exactly resembles the board layout of Parker Brothers' later games Pollyanna and The Popular Game of Broadway. The only real difference is that there are no &quot;home&quot; paths branching off of the main track. Instead, players start pieces off on their &quot;entrance&quot; space (the board corner in front of them) and make a single loop of the board, returning pieces to the entrance space and then moving them to the center of the board, called the &quot;court.&quot;&#10;&#10;THe game is first seen in the Parker Games catalog for 1889, on page 5. The ads do not indicate how the game is played, only that it includes &quot;turned maple pieces&quot; and a spinner. Identical listings are found in the 1890 and 1891 catalogs.&#10;&#10;By 1892, Rex is being packaged with The Amusing Game of Kilkenny Cats as two sides of a &quot;combination&quot; board game.

They may also move the sun token (sideways or down). When the top row is completed, each player chooses a scoring card from their hand. On these cards are descriptions such as &ldquo;grey clouds in the top row&rdquo;, &ldquo;pink cards in the sky&rdquo; or &ldquo;clouds on the top row&rdquo;. The player with the highest scoring card places it in front of them. The top row is removed and the game continues until one player has collected three scoring cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "June 1944: On the right flank of Operation EPSOM, the British set up Operation MARTLET. This operation was necessary because EPSOM was vulnerable to German counterattack from the high ground in the Rauray area. It was essential for the Allies to seize several key points prior to the launching of EPSOM. These key points were the villages of Rauray, Fontenay-le-Pesnel, Tessel, Brettevillette, and Juvigny.&#10;&#10;The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, consisting of the 70th, 146th and 147th Infantry Brigades, as well as the 8th Armoured Brigade, was assigned to carry out MARTLET. The operation&rsquo;s first objective was BARRACUDA, the road between Juvigny and Fontenay. The German forces in this sector consisted of the Panzer Lehr Division and the 12.SS-Panzer-division Hitlerjugend (Hilter Youth).&#10;&#10;Objective: BARRACUDA offers two ways of experiencing the battle. Players can sample a portion of the fighting by playing one of eight standalone scenarios. Scenarios FLP1-FLP8 also serve to familiarize players with the battlefield and the opposing forces. Players who enjoy a strategic aspect are encouraged to experience the entire battle by playing the Tactical Mission (TM). The TM is comprised of five inter-connected scenarios that begin the morning (0900 hours) of 25 June and continue over the course of four additional time periods: 1100, 1300, 1600, and 2100 hours. The TM lends itself well to team play.&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;One 35&quot; x 24&quot; map with one inch hexes&#10;One countersheet&#10;Chapter Obj:B rules&#10;Eight ASL scenarios&#10;One Campaign Games&#10;&#10;",

Its complexity is between 1867 Kriegsspiel and Free Kriegsspiel.&#10;&#10;Play takes place on a scaled map with pieces that represent the space formations would occupy on the battlefield. Typically, three maps are used, and play proceeds in double-blind fashion, facilitated by an umpire, but two-player play on a single map is also possible.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by die rolls and consulting a CRT, although results may be modified by the umpire at their reasoned discretion.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Veney is a chesslike game for two players designed to invoke the mechanics and spirit of a sword fight. The goal is to use your blade piece to checkmate your opponent either by touch (taking the Self piece) or by disarm (taking their only blade piece) while defending against checkmate in return. On your turn, you can move one of your pieces to an open square, move to take an opponent's piece or &quot;fend&quot; it (sending it to their reserve), place one of your reserved pieces on an open square, withdraw a piece, pass, or use various special moves and aspects of the pieces in play.&#10;&#10;Many of the core elements of chess are inverted, removed, or altered to more closely resemble corresponding aspects of fencing. For example, there is no check, and two-way checkmates are possible. There are multiple methods by which a player can make two moves at once, and a wide array of special moves allows for unpredictable ripostes. The 4x16 board is subdivided lengthwise into four &quot;measures&quot; which allow for unique piece movements and flexible range constraints. Positions can get exceedingly complex, and breaking the rules (knowingly or not) is incorporated into the game as a potential grounds for disarmament or sudden-death.&#10;&#10;A veney set is made up of collected rocks and trinkets which players cultivate and trade over time. &quot;Token&quot; pieces are won and lost as prizes at the conclusion of a formal game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The direction and distance of each move is set by the throw of two dice. You can obstruct your opponents by jumping over their pieces and sending them back to the start, but the evil twist is that you can choose to move another player's piece rather than your own. So for example player A might move player B's piece backwards, capturing one of player C's pieces in the process.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In other places, history should and must be rewritten. Its based on 1895-Namibia from Adam Romoth and Helmut Ohley which was 2004 published.&#10;Players invest in railway companies. The companies create a railway network with track tiles on the game board and run these routes with their trains and generate income. The player with the most shares in a railway company is its director. He decide whether these incomes will be distributed to the shareholders as a dividend or whether it will be added to the companies' treasury for future investments. The progress of time and technical development is shown with 9 train types/devices from 2 to 16.&#10;As with many games in this series, there are similarities within the rules, but many feature slight differences, and it is these that give each individual 18xx game its character.&#10;18Namibia features an interesting array of differences described above.&#10;These include obligations, mines are corporations, quick train rush, 9 H-Train types and other things.&#10;&#10;When developing 18Namibia, attention was paid to a short playing time. A game lasts about 180 minutes. A &quot;short variant&quot; (90 minutes) is already finished and only needs to be prepared!&#10;&#10;Helmut Ohley&#10;&#10;",

It was simply the largest carrier battle of all time which will never be surpassed.&#10;&#10;Clash of Carriers, by designer Mark Stille, portrays this epic battle. The historical result saw the Japanese carrier force shattered, never to recover for the rest of the war. While this showdown is almost always treated as a one-sided affair, in this game players will have every opportunity to better the historical outcome or maybe even even reverse history.&#10;&#10;The Japanese player can use the superior range of his carrier- and land-based aircraft in coordinated waves to hit the US Navy while his fleet maneuvers out of US aircraft range. Historically, despite poor aircraft coordination, many Japanese aircraft broke through the US fighter screen to attack US carriers. What could better coordination accomplish?&#10;&#10;The American player can opt for an offensive strategy with a number of task groups to try and inflict even more massive losses on the Japanese naval force instead of settling for defeating the Japanese air strikes. US submarines inflicted losses and tracked Japanese fleet movements -- can they do so again, or will Japanese counter-measures foil historical results?&#10;&#10;Against the Odds #58 (January 2023)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player gets 6 or 12 meeples (soldiers). The two neighboring player colors are allied. Movement is determined by the actual starting space of the soldier to be moved. The arrow shows the direction of movement and the numeral the number od spaces to move. The direction of movement may be changed after the first space.&#10;&#10;A soldier may shoot an enemy soldier if he get on a space exactly matching the shooters range, which is also determined by the arrow and mumeral on the space the shooter is standing on. The players may not look at the numerals of the spaces occupied by enemy soldiers. The shooter moves to the space of the shot soldier, which is removed from play. If the enemy soldier stands on a space inside the shooters shooting range, the shooter moves to the space matching his shooting range, whereas the shot soldier stays on his space und gets a ring around his neck to indicate that he is wounded. If a wounded soldier get a second wound, he dies and is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;Wounded soldiers have to move back to their starting spaces to recover from their wound. On their way back they ignore the arrows and may not shoot at enemy soldiers.&#10;&#10;The party or player to get the most soldiers to their opponents starting spaces wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever works hardest to appease a Council, receives a special ability they can use every turn.

Each game of the campaign introduces some new twist, new challenge and with that new ways of going through the game.&#10;&#10;You start your journey as a captain of a worn down ark and with each scenario you unlock upgrades and eventually new ships. A special card system determines the length of a scenario. The time it takes to complete is varied as are the tasks presented to you. Each completed task is worth experience points which allow you to perform upgrades on your ark. Each game session influences the campaign and shape of the galaxy. Your progress and game status is easily saved in a dedicated booklet which lets you come back and continue playing anytime you want.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
