    "Description": "Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humorous card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.&#10;&#10;A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).&#10;&#10;If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.&#10;&#10;The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.&#10;&#10;NOTE: The expansion Monkey Business has been included in the base game since 2007.&#10;&#10;",

By the way, scales are swelling. Who is the most daring and lucky one in the swelling? Then, the color of your eyes changed and the battle for scales began. Who can get the most scales?&#10;&#10;The simple rule is that the person who collects the scales and wins the most in all 6 rounds, but the card selection for each round is very troublesome, and the tricky moving small white dragon determines the outcome of the game. An unusual card butting game that uses square boards and pieces.&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A solitaire game of the German drive on Paris in 1914, played in six turns representing the time period August 27&ndash;28 through September 6&ndash;7. The player operates the German forces and has three possible victory conditions based on army strength and unit location on the playing area at the end of the sixth turn.&#10;&#10;German army corps move across rows of rectangles overlaid on a partial map of France (Arras to the outskirts of Paris). When German and Entente units occupy the same row of rectangles combat occurs. The player rolls 1d6 for every 2 German corps in the rectangle and adds the total result to the strength of the corps, then does the same for the Entente player. There are modifiers based on map location. Loser must retreat one row or reduce the strength of one corps. Random events may send German corps off to East Prussia or to sieges of Channel ports or Low Country towns. Other events may bring reinforcements to either side, advance the Germans&rsquo; Schlieffen Plan, result in Entente confusion or German exhaustion, etc.&#10;&#10;This game originally appeared in World War One Illustrated magazine No. 3 and does not include the six-sided dice necessary for play.

Again, players answer questions, with parts of the equation being placed after each answer. The first player to solve the equation wins the round.&#10;&#10;Scoring for each round is 10 points per correct answer, and a bonus of 100 points for making the connection, except in the final round, where it&rsquo;s 20 points per answer and 200 bonus points for making the connection.

    "Description": "A seven-turn game based on Russia&rsquo;s invasion of East Prussia from August 17&ndash;18 through August 29&ndash;30. The Russian player wins by eliminating three German corps or by having three corps in the western end of the Western box (i.e., west of the Vistula River) and at least one corps in the other four boxes of the area-movement map. The German player&rsquo;s victory requires eliminating three Russian corps and preventing any Russian units from being in the western half of the Western box.&#10;&#10;The five movement boxes are overlaid on a map of East Prussia and a portion of the Russian Empire. Each is divided into two parts, distinguished by brown in one half and yellow in the other. Opposing units may occupy the same box without being in the same area, in which case combat is not mandatory unless the German side plays the German Reckless Advance marker. When battle occurs in the Broken Terrain of the two southern boxes each side rolls a die to limit the number of enemy corps that can participate and might further mess with an opponent by playing a Confusion marker. Other Combat and Random&#10;&#10;Event markers include Air Recon, Cautious Advance/Pursuit, Cavalry Raid, etc. Restrictions and opportunities also arise based on individual game turns and what happened historically on the days those turns represent. A sidebar describes the historical events. (The game won an award in the Educational Board Game category at the 2019 Serious Play Conference.)&#10;&#10;Designed to be a solitaire game published in a magazine, the stand-alone version comes with two-player rules as well. Players have to supply their own six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Set up a normal chess game but with 8 checkers on each side where the 8 pawns normally go.&#10;&#10;The chess pieces move, attack, and capture as they normally do, including castling.  The checkers move and capture (jump) as they normally do, diagonally.  Checkers that reach the other side get kinged.  If a checker can jump another checker or chess piece (or double or triple jump etc.), it must jump those pieces.  If your checker must jump your opponent's piece(s), but you're also in check, you must get out of check instead of jumping with the checker.&#10;&#10;The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king either by an attack from a chess piece just like in chess, or threat of being jumped by a checker piece that the king can't avoid.&#10;&#10;I invented this game and the first time I tried playing it (about 15 years ago), I didn't think it would be any fun, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It broke my brain as I mixed the two games in my head.  I had to play chess while making sure my chess pieces weren't lined up in such a way that they could get double jumped!  I also liked the fact that I could force moves on my opponent by placing pieces in position to be jumped by one of their checkers.

(One face up card on top of each face down card.)&#10;&#10;The dealer then deals 3 cards in a row to the trump caller's hand, then 3 cards in a row into his own hand.&#10;&#10;The dealer then deals 2 cards in a row to the trump caller's hand, then 2 cards in a row into his own hand.&#10;&#10;There should now be:&#10;    10 cards in each player's hand that only the player holding them can see&#10;    8 cards in front of each player that are face down that neither player has seen&#10;    8 cards right on top of the face-down cards in front of each player that all players can see&#10;    That makes a total of 52 cards in play (the whole deck without jokers).&#10;&#10;The trump caller starts the game by choosing a card from either their hand or from the face up cards in front of them.&#10;&#10;The other player then plays a card and must follow suit.  Highest card number wins.  Aces are high.  If they cannot follow suit because they don't have that suit either in their hand or face up on the table, they can play anything they want.  Trump cards will take the trick in that case and other suits (non-trump and not following suit) lose - just like in Rook.&#10;&#10;Whenever a face up card is played, the face down card below it must immediately be turned over and it becomes part of the cards that can be played in subsequent tricks.&#10;&#10;Whoever takes that trick keeps those cards and puts them aside and then leads the next trick.&#10;&#10;The round ends when all cards in hands, face up, and face down have been played and all tricks taken.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player that got the most tricks (most cards).  In the case of a tie, the dealer wins since the trump caller has a slight advantage and must take more than half of the cards to win.&#10;&#10;To play another round, swap who is dealer and trump caller between each round played.  Choose a number of rounds to be won to win the overall game.&#10;&#10;Strategy ideas&#10;&#10;The game is similar to Rook, but it splits your hand into three parts:&#10;    your hand - which only you see&#10;    face down cards - which nobody sees&#10;    face up cards - which everyone sees&#10;&#10;One example of using this knowledge is that if a player doesn't follow suit and plays a face up card which then reveals a face down card that is the suit that was just led, then you know that's the only card of that suit they have and so they must play it if you lead that suit again.  There are many other strategies like this that can be used based on the global knowledge of face up cards.&#10;&#10;Four players&#10;&#10;The game could be modified for four players by using two decks and having the trump caller be the person to the left of the dealer and moving the dealer to the left each round.  Notice that there will be two of each card in such a game.&#10;&#10;Three players&#10;&#10;Just like four players but you could either use one deck and reduce the number of hand cards, face down cards, and face up cards or use two decks and increase the number of cards used for each player.&#10;    one deck&#10;        hand cards: 4 at the start, then 2 then 1 (instead of 5, 3, and 2)&#10;        face down cards: 5&#10;        face up cards: 5&#10;        You'll have 1 card leftover.&#10;    two decks (just double the numbers above - might be too much?)&#10;        hand cards: 8 at the start, then 4, then 2&#10;        face down cards: 10&#10;        face up cards: 10&#10;        You'll have 2 cards leftover.&#10;&#10;Other notes&#10;&#10;This is a combination of two games: one is a game from India who played it with his grandmother, the other is knaves.&#10;&#10;It's apparently similar to the ancient card game &quot;Whist&quot;, which is where the card game &quot;Bridge&quot; apparently came from and Rook is also similar in some ways.&#10;&#10;We've actually played a three-player variant of Rook making the fourth dummy hand split as face down and face up and the dummy's partner plays from the face up cards - kind of like bridge but with face down cards hidden.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The gameplay is driven by the railroads which formed the territory and later the state. The boom-and-bust cycle directly impacts the towns and cities of the state and therefore the revenue of the railroads. Coal and Oil Companies in this game do not necessarily represent coal or oil discoveries, but instead represent investment for development in the area &ndash; indirect drivers of revenue. The map is reflective of the immense emptiness and its widely varied and rugged terrain.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In September 1943, by virtue of the the Armistice of Cassibile, the Kingdom of Italy officially surrenders to the Allies. Nazi Germany swiftly responds by occupying the northern part of its former ally, by disarming its army (Operation Achse), and by freeing and reinstating Mussolini as the leader of the fascist Italian Social Republic puppet state. Several elements of the dissolved Regio Esercito refuse to comply, flee to the Alpine and Apennine foothills, and take up arms against the nazifascist occupation. Like in most other German-occupied European countries, they will soon be joined by anti-fascists and rebels, giving rise to the first formations of the Italian partisan resistance warfare, which will quickly reorganise themselves as &quot;brigades&quot; and oppose the fascist regime until the liberation of April 1945.&#10;&#10;In the summer of 1944, after the breaching of the Gustav Line and the liberation of Rome, a new frontline is established along the northern ranges of the Apennines, from the Adriatic to the Tyrrhenian sea. The so called &quot;Gothic Line&quot; will stand until the end of the war. During these dramatic months, the areas around  the Gothic line will witness some of the most ferocious reprisals of the European war, often involving directly the civilian population.&#10;&#10;Resistenza! is a cooperative boardgame that relates the partisan struggles in and around the small valley of Lunigiana, tucked in between the Apennines and Alpi Apuane in the western-most portion of the Gothic line, from the standpoint of the partisan brigades.&#10;&#10;The game is tactical in nature, reflecting the fluidity of guerilla warfare, although several game decisions have broader, strategic consequences. The brigades must ambush convoys along the valley's main communication lines, thwart nazifascist reprisals against civilians and participate in the final liberation battles. Attacks are resolved by committing combat cards against enemy tiles of unknown value (unless scouted by previous reconnaissance). Materiel airdrops are also represented, through the drop of a die on the game map. The design focus is on evocation over simulation, implying a certain degree of abstraction. A semi-cooperative and a simplified version of the game are also included, as well as a booklet of historical and design notes.&#10;&#10;The proceeds from the game will support the activities of Archivi della Resistenza and the running of the Audiovisual Museum of the Resistance (Fosdinovo, MS, Italy) .&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game includes a picture frame and a tripod. Cutouts of dolphins and whales are assembled on vertical stands and process around through dice rolls. Players are trying to get attractive groupings of dolphins in frame at the right time to get their photo. The best composed shots win the most points.&#10;&#10;The game has a long blue cord which is placed as a loop on the table. The frame is set up in front of this, and a blue background is put to the rear. Players then throw a number of blue dice into the loop. These determine which marine animals appear. The number and types of dolphins are limited and will not appear all the time. The cutouts are clipped at different levels to blue poles, and these are stuck to small platforms which go alongside the corresponding dice. Looking through the frame, the players can see some creatures in shot, but not all of them. In this way, players compose a shifting three dimensional diorama of sea life passing the frame of the camera.&#10;&#10;Players have to chose when to take a good photo. Should they get a quick snap, or wait a bit in case a more interesting creature swims by. Will the enormous whale shark appear at the back? If the dolphins move on, will the players regret the missed chance to get a good picture?&#10;&#10;When a player has taken their photo and scored points for it, the next player rolls the dice and continues.&#10;&#10;Whilst being a competitive game, the designer's intention is to engage the players in a contemplative experience as they consider their place in the world. The game can be played just as well by a solo player.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card game where memory, strategy, and luck are needed as you maneuver around challenges presented both by your fellow players and randomly by the game itself. Little Nutters is a turn-based game where you take on the persona of a squirrel trying to uncover their buried nuts through the various patches on the playing field. Be the first to find all of your nuts before your opponents, but beware of rapid kittens, quack attacks, and ninja beavers. The dangers are very real in Little Nutters.&#10;&#10;One by one, players take turns searching or digging through 27 randomly shuffled patches of 4 cards. The ultimate goal is to uncover a nut within these patches, but along the way players may find defense cards to bolster their hand or obstacles or animal attacks to possibly hinder their turn. Watch out for other players too as they can play trouble cards during their turn to weaken your hand or bust-a-nut cards to try and steal one of your hard earned prizes.&#10;&#10;Set in a whimsical environment with fantastic cartoon-ish artwork, Little Nutters is a perfect party game with a quick  and easy set-up and rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A knitting card game for 1-2 players in which players compete to knit the best FAIR ISLE PATTERN. Players earn points by completing rows, matching motifs and unlocking bonuses.&#10;&#10;The Fair Isle deck is made of cards that display simple two-colour knitting motifs (diamonds, crosses, etc).  Players build hands of motif cards which are then played in rows to create a knitting pattern. Each row is just 3 cards long, and a completed Fair Isle pattern is just 4 rows high (12 cards in tital).&#10;&#10;There are also 8 pattern bonus cards (yellow) that provide certain conditions to score bonuses on that row (for instance, knitting a &lsquo;green row&rsquo; at the right time can earn you an extra 20 points).&#10;&#10;Players score points for :&#10;&#10;     knitting a complete row&#10;     repeating patterns in a row&#10;     finishing 4 rows first&#10;     alternating stripes of colour&#10;     unlocking row Pattern Bonuses&#10;&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 3 cards. The remaining deck forms a Draw Pile between the players, with the top two cards placed face up by the draw pile.&#10;&#10;4 Pattern Bonus cards are also chosen and placed face up, one above the other, in a column between the players. The bottom card is &lsquo;row 1&rsquo; - the top card is &lsquo;row 4&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;PLAY&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player can take ONE of the following FOUR actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     PICK UP  -   either:  1 x face up Fair Isle card  or:  2 x face down cards (Draw Pile)&#10;     KNIT  - Place ANY NUMBER of cards from your hand into your pattern.&#10;     UNRAVEL - Take any number of &lsquo;knitted&rsquo; cards back to your hand.&#10;     DISCARD - Discard your entire hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;END OF TURN&#10;&#10;At the end of their turn, a player will either DRAW BACK UP to 3 (if less than 3 cards are in their hand) or DISCARD DOWN to 5 (if they have more than 5 cards left in hand:)&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player completes their Fair Isle pattern first, receiving a bonus 40 points. The other player can take one more turn before the final scores are then tallied up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Oh, wait &ndash; the hedgehog has forgotten to decorate his famous cake! But how can the hedgehog leave the house unattended if the fox is making its way to steal the tasty treats? Luckily, his friends are always ready to help!&#10;&#10;Bring hedgehog home faster than the fox reaches it and steals the cake! First, you need to define a friend who will help the hedgehog this round and gather goods. Throw fuzzy ball (hedgehog) into the box with velcro tokens with friends&rsquo; portraits. Got a moose? Roll the hedgehog down from the moose slide and collect goods stuck on the ball! A bear decided to help? It&rsquo;s time for a catapult! Each friend has its special ability. &#10;Next, move the hedgehog. For each collected nut/ berry/wheat, you can move your hedgehog to an adjacent spot with this goodie. &#10;Finally, it&rsquo;s time for a fox to move one step closer to the hedgehog&rsquo;s house.&#10;&#10;The hedgehog (and all the players as well) wins as soon as the hedgehog reaches the house.

Players must always keep Old Gods cards in their hand (they start with one), and if they are found without one, they draw a penalty.&#10;&#10;The main cards are anime, with letters of the alphabet, such that a player asks another for an A or a B and so on.

Each individual bird is a scientific illustration, beautifully painted -- The game sheets themselves can even double as birding checklists for the specific locations.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS&#10;Birdsong has four different play modes:&#10;Competitive &#10;Solitaire&#10;Cooperative&#10;Team v Team&#10;&#10;In competitive play, players colored draft dice one at a time to allocate to three different areas of their unique player board (bird spotting, preparation, and research). Some areas require a specific color. Others require a number, and some might just require any die of any color. In this mode it's important to see what dice are beneficial to your opponents as well as to yourself. After each player has allocated 18 dice, the game ends and points are tallied from the different sections to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;In solitaire play, the player allocates a die and then the next most valuable die disappears. Their task is to gather as many points as possible in 6 3-die rounds.&#10;&#10;In cooperative play, everybody is working together to score as many points as possible for the lowest scoring player. In this mode, players will collaborate and give up dice to other players to keep the scoring gap small.&#10;&#10;Team v Team play is a variant of cooperative with the exception the players can give/trade dice with their teammates in order to keep the gap small. Everybody on the player with the lowest score at the end of the game loses.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

If a player is the first to land on one of the numbered spaces, he draws the card from the deck of 30 cards and reads out the information on the pink side of the card. Then he turns the card over to see what instructions he has to follow. This are fairly predictable; Miss a turn perhaps, roll the die and move backwards, and so on. The player then takes the card and keeps it in front of him where all the players can see it. The card will have a value ranging from 5 to 30, with the value being commensurate with the penalty value of the instruction on it. If a subsequent player lands on a numbered field that has already been taken, then he treats the space as a normal space without number.&#10;&#10;When the numbered space 30 has been reached, that player has finished. The others play on. When all the players have reached the 30 space, the 'won' cards are added up and the winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;",
