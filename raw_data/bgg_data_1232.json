At random, give each player one Main Hero and one Sacrificial Minion. Place the Main Hero and Sacrificial Minion cards in front of you so that everyone can see them.

To finish their turn they must draw a card from the pile. If they happen to draw a disaster card, then they must play this card immediately. After the Disaster card is played, players check if they can use the Sacrificial Minion effect. If they can then the disaster moves forward to the next chosen player.  If no, then the player will check the Main Hero effect. If that effect works then the disaster moves forward to the next player if no, then the player can play any cards from their hand that work with the current open disaster. Any player can use the Main Hero effects during each disaster once. The disaster moves forward until a player cannot play anymore cards. In that case the player sacrifices one of their Minion cards. With that their turn ends and the game continues on from the point at which the player drew the disaster. If there are no Minions left to sacrifice then you will lose the Main Hero and so the game.&#10;&#10;End of the game&#10;Last one alive from the disasters wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

He wagered Poland&rsquo;s allies of France and Great Britain would once again cave-in to his demands and not oppose his invasion. Even if they did, a lightning-fast war (blitzkrieg) would make mote any of their objections once the rival to the east was subjugated. That a mutual defense treaty stipulating an invasion from the east by the Soviet Union only &ldquo;sealed the deal&rdquo; and further secured Hitler&rsquo;s risk.&#10;&#10;Lances and Steel is a war game simulation of the battle fought near the town of Mokra during the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany.  The area was held by the Polish 7th Infantry Division and the Wo&#197;&#130;y&#197;&#132;ska Cavalry Brigade supported by the Smialy armored train and the 21st Tank battalion. The German attack here sought to separate the Polish Lodz and Krakow Armies and effect a breakthrough to the Polish rear areas. The first major battle of WWII was fought here. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts? Learn and Enjoy!&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game represents one and half hours of time.

    "Description": "Malady is an unconventional stacking/sowing game designed by Alek Erickson in May 2020. It is inspired by the games of Arrausi.&#10;&#10;Setup: Players play on a hexagonal board. Three colors are involved: White, Black, and Grey (neutral). Players Black and White own stacks with their own color on top. The field is initially filled with single checkers of all 3 colors. The third color may be neutral or owned by a third player. The checkers are tiled so that they are evenly spaced. This game may also be played on a square grid tiled with evenly spaced White and Black checkers.&#10;&#10;Players take turn distributing stacks: On your turn, you pick up one stack with your color on top, and immediately place a blockade (stone of your color) on that empty point. Then, distribute the stack. This means for each checker in the stack you are holding, move exactly that many points in a straight line in any direction and drop the bottom checker on that destination. Repeat this process as long as checkers remain in the stack. Note that &quot;any direction&quot; means any of the six hexagonal directions, or, on the square version, any of the eight orthodiagonal directions.&#10;&#10;The board gets increasingly restricted: Nobody can drop checkers on points occupied by blockades of either color. While distributing, you may jump over blockades of your color, but not the opponents.&#10;&#10;Game end: A player loses when they are unable to make a legal move.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

However, the balance of competitive rulesets does not exist within SKIRMISH: 52C.&#10;&#10;Instead, players combat the harsh reflection of the potential realities of warfare. In the face of adversity, you must quite literally play the hand you are dealt and hope for better luck next game.&#10;&#10;Number of Players&#10;SKIRMISH: 52C is optimized for play by one to two players. It is possible to accommodate additional players, although it is suggested that players divide control of a team&rsquo;s models as opposed to introducing additional teams. In these situations, model counts greater than 8 per team are recommended. This document also includes a supplement to direct and improve the solo play experience.&#10;&#10;Setting&#10;SKIRMISH: 52Chas been designed to reflect abstracted modern infantry combat on Earth. The ruleset can be used to simulate the battles of the 20th century and beyond. Scope: SKIRMISH: 52C is a skirmish-sized miniature wargame. Players assume the role of a squad leader, commanding 4-12 soldiers.&#10;&#10;Dimension&#10;The game plays in 2.5 dimensions. There is a degree of abstraction regarding line of sight and terrain features. This abstraction permits--but does not require--playing SKIRMISH: 52C using a two-dimensional surface such as a dry-erase board in combination with coins or similar tokens. This abstraction also provides flexibility in the three-dimension terrain features that can be implemented. For example, the height of terrain features do not need to be appropriately scaled to the soldier proxies used.&#10;&#10;Scale &amp; Units&#10;The boundaries of combat operations are often much less than a square mile. 1 inch (25 mm) within the game world approximates 6 feet (2 meters) in the real world&rdquo;. 25-32 mm miniatures or tokens are used as proxies for human soldiers. Terrain feature size and distances described in these rules may be scaled appropriately to accommodate alternate miniatures, terrain, or units of measurement. The primary unit of measurement used in this document is inches. Metric approximations are provided but are not exact conversions.&#10;&#10;Time&#10;Each model&rsquo;s &ldquo;turn&rdquo; occupies less than a minute of game world time. A game can typically be completed within one hour of real world time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Factions: Battlegrounds, you take on the role of a general who's leading an army of troops, spellcasters, beasts, and mythological monsters into battle. You and the opposing generals determine the battleground, gather resources, and score points by eliminating enemy units. Whoever first captures 25 points of units wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, to set up choose one of the six factions in the game; each faction has twelve unique units and five &quot;home terrain&quot; cards that work well with your units. Players then take turns building the battleground by placing one terrain card at a time into the 3x3 grid, each terrain card is divided into a 2x2 grid, so the entire grid of play is 6x6. Whoever places terrain first has an advantage since they have more home terrain than other players, while players who go later during set up determine the location of resource centers on the battleground or recruit their starting units last so that they can respond to the choices of opponents. Units cost 1-5 gold, and each player can spend up to 10 gold on starting units, keeping anything unspent.&#10;&#10;During a round, all units have the chance to move, with the highest-ranked units moving first and with ties being broken in favor of whoever has the most captains, followed by whoever has the most units. Each unit has a movement, attack, and health value, along with an indication of whether it generates gold or mana and (possibly) a spell that it can cast. After moving a unit, you can attack with it, whether melee or ranged as indicated on the card. If you defeat an enemy unit, you can points equal to its cost in gold, so while expensive units tend to be the most powerful, they also provide an opponent with their biggest target for points.&#10;&#10;Prior to activating a unit on your turn, you can pay gold to recruit new units, and those units will slip into rank order for the turn, possibly allowing you to put a high-ranking unit into play directly and giving an opponent someone on the battleground that they didn't expect.&#10;&#10;Once all the units have moved, players collect resources for units that gain them automatically and for units located on resource centers. Rounds continue until someone has collected 25 points of captured units, at which point they win immediately.&#10;&#10;Factions: Battlegrounds is centered on inclusion and diversity, incorporating mythology from all over the world and representing traditionally European-based fantasy elements with underrepresented cultural elements.&#10;&#10;",

Then break your alliances when the time is right.&#10;&#10;The rider you activate may also benefit from terrain bonuses depending where they are located on the fully modular and reconfigurable race course.&#10;&#10;It's important to balance effort and control; the harder you push your riders, the more fatigue they take. But when you allow your opponents to move your riders instead, you get to tag along for free, but you have less control over their positioning.&#10;&#10;On the Rivet is not about achieving top spot on the podium (though it helps). Your goal is to manage a team of all-stars, climbers, sprinters and domestiques and finish all of them in as high a position as possible, because time is aggregate: if you sacrifice your team for one rider, it only takes an extra second or two to drag you down the leader board.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Have you been searching for a game that is filled with magic and mystery? Is your gaming group looking for something quick and fun without pages and pages of rules? Look no further!The Shivers is a truly one-of-a-kind tabletop experience that features the magic of hand-crafted pop-ups, combined with just the right amount of spooky puzzle-solving mystery and role playing.&#10;&#10;Using our patent-pending modular pop-up system, the mystery will unfold as you and your friends explore a magical mansion, as one of the members of the Shivers family. Each episode takes about an hour to play cooperatively, with one person taking the lead as the Storyteller. Once players finish one episode, a quick change of the system reveals the next story which will be completely new and unique: filled with new clues, puzzles, room layouts, and foes to vanquish.&#10;&#10;The Shivers is fun and challenging for young kids, teens, and even older experienced game players. While most games have dozens of pages of rules and take many hours to learn and play, Shivers players have just a couple simple rules, and can get up and playing in less than 5 minutes. Similar to an escape room in structure and feel (but on a much smaller scale), players can get immediately immersed in the mystery, discovering the right path forward as they progress.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Samurai are the almost mythical warrior caste of Japanese history. &#10;Their most famous exploits occurred during the Sengoku period between 1467 and 1603. &#10;With the Emperor and the Shogun unable to control the many daimyos, there was near constant fighting between the various factions. In these times the Samurai code (Bushido) became more defined and standards of fighting improved. &#10;Even the introduction of the musket in 1543 was seen as an opportunity rather than a threat.&#10;&#10;Ashigaru (literally &ldquo;light foot&rdquo;) were so named as they had lighter armour than the Samurai. They also formed the bulk of the armies of the day. Each Samurai was expected to provide two armed Ashigaru. Many of these would be armed with the yari (spear). These are not the pike blocks of contemporary Europe as the Ashigaru were trained to fight in a looser formation, travel quicker and their spear was for slicing and thrusting. Many a battle was won by the Ashigaru, especially if cavalry were foolish enough to attack them from the front.&#10;&#10;The biggest change in the Sengoku period (1467-1603) would affect the role of missile troops in battle. At the start of the period, these were all armed with the yumi (bow) and fought in coordinated units to pepper the enemy with their arrows. This bow, like the equivalent English Longbow, took many years training to perfect but was deadly when used correctly. Due to the training needed there were never as many yumi armed troops as a daimyo may have wanted!&#10;&#10;By the 16th and 17th centuries, warfare was changing and the Samurai were changing with it. They did not forget their horse-riding roots while this change happened. Even though the introduction of the long spear made cavalry charges more difficult to pull off they were still performed. A well-timed strike by a unit of Samurai horsemen could turn the tide of a battle. These cavalry attacks continued throughout the Sengoku period and many a daimyo lost his head to one.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to create a well balanced, atmospheric and realistic experience of combat. To increase the fun and replayability several game mechanics have been added and in a few cases playabilty trumped the call for realism.&#10;&#10;As a player you have to make multiple decisions in a heartbeat: Do I want to have more of a mobile or rather static force? Which weapons will my soldiers use, which further equipment do they bring to the battlefield? Shall I rely on battle hardened veterans or rookies that have not seen any action on the field yet? Do I salvage enemy weapons or solely rely on my own?&#10;&#10;This game is meant to be the start of a whole series covering all the decisive battlegrounds of WW2. It is heavily inspired by well known computer games, cosims and tabletop systems. For Tankette Publishing it is the first game released.&#10;&#10;",

The Black Pyramid is it&rsquo;s own play-style. You can go through the entire game, gathering power, facing new threats, terrifying versions of the Bosses, and perhaps most importantly, uncover epic new gear!

    "Description": "You are the captain of a hot air balloon fleet, trying to pop your opponent's Crown Balloon to emerge from battle victorious. Navigate the skies of random chance and rely on strategic trickery to pop your opponent before you yourself are popped.&#10;&#10;More simply, the goal of the game is to pop the balloon/Blink your opponent designated as the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; before they pop the balloon/Blink you designated as your &ldquo;Crown.&rdquo; Players take turns single clicking their opponent's balloons to reduce their health and eventually pop them. Watch out for any Trap balloons! These are Blinks that will cause you to lose immediately if you pop them. The catch is, the location of each player&rsquo;s respective Crown and TrapBust balloons will only be known to them. It&rsquo;s a game of hidden information and bluffing! Two players recommended, but can easily accommodate more!&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Distribute Balloons&#10;Divide the Balloons/Blinks evenly among the players. Each player clusters their balloons together, and assigns each balloon a color.&#10;&#10;Single-click a balloon to cycle between Red (high health), Blue (medium health), and Green (low health). For even fair play, make sure each player has the same number of each color. To give one player an advantage, allow them to have more high-health balloons.&#10;Create Special Balloons &#10;Decide how many Crowns and/or Traps each player will have. Again, for even play, each player should have the same amount.&#10;&#10;Long Press a balloon to designate it as a Crown. Single-click it to cycle between the Crown and Trap Balloon designation. Crown Balloons appear yellow, and Trap Balloons appear purple. Long-pressing again will reset it back to a regular Balloon.&#10;&#10;While creating these special balloons, make sure to hide your selection from your opponent - this step is where your strategic trickery begins! It might seem obvious to always select a Red Balloon as your Crown since they take the longest to pop. But your opponent knows this too, so they may start clicking the Red Balloon first. Knowing that, you could instead select a Blue Balloon as a Crown, making your opponent waste 3-6 clicks popping a non-Crown Balloon. Let the game theory begin!&#10;&#10;Triple click one balloon on each player's cluster to move to start the game. Your Crown and Trap balloons will now appear as regular balloons, and the health of all balloons will be set based on their color.&#10;Gameplay&#10;On their turn, players take on of two actions:&#10;Attack&#10;Click an opponent's Balloon to reduce its health, shown by the number of faces lit. Each click reduces health by 1. When a balloon is reduced to 0 health, it pops, revealing whether it was a Crown, a Trap, or neither.&#10;&#10;[diagram of slowly reducing health and death]&#10;Fortify&#10;You also can use your turn to fortify your own balloons. Remove a single balloon from your cluster to activate it - a single white face will appear on the Balloon. When you reconnect that Balloon to the cluster, it will transfer 1 unit of health to the Balloon it touches with the activated face.&#10;&#10;Only balloons with at least 1 health remaining can be used to Fortify, and Balloons with 6 health cannot receive fortification.&#10;&#10;Win Condition&#10;There are multiple ways to win Battle Balloons. If you pop all of your opponent&rsquo;s Crown Balloons, you are the winner!&#10;&#10;[diagram of winning]&#10;&#10;If, instead, you pop your opponent&rsquo;s Trap Balloon, they are the winner!&#10;&#10;[diagram of losing]&#10;&#10;To reset the game, double-click any Balloon in your cluster to go back into Setup.&#10;Alternate Setup&#10;If you are playing with very few Blinks, you can instead give all Blinks to a single player and let them make the setup, then pass the entire cluster to the next player. That player then plays through the game with that cluster, counting the number of rounds it takes to win or lose.&#10;&#10;In addition, you can play with more than 2 players. In a multiplayer game, you choose who to attack on your turn. If a player&rsquo;s Crown Balloons are popped, they are out of the game. If you pop a Trap Balloon, you are out. The last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is simple: be the last person to keep your Dynamo alive and operational.&#10;Setup&#10;Distribute 1 Dynamo Blink to each player.

    "Description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;IntroductionSwack is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (squares) of a square board of any size.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, all squares of the board are covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the center square is occupied by White. Additionally, each player must have access to a sufficient number of off-board pieces of their own color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.&#10;&#10;A stack is a piece lying directly on the board along with all other pieces piled onto it on the same square. The color of a stack is the color of its topmost piece, which denotes its owner. The height of a stack is the number of pieces in it.&#10;&#10;A group is a stack along with all other like-colored stacks one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent stacks of its color. The size of a group is the number of stacks in it.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pass.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move the topmost piece of a stack of your color onto an adjacent enemy stack, provided that, before the move, the heights of both stacks are the same. Then, place a piece of your opponent's color onto the stack from which you just moved your piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. On even-sized boards, if the board is empty, whoever made the last move before the game's end loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsFree Swack: The board is initially empty. On your turn, instead of making a swap, you may place a friendly stack of height two on an empty square and an enemy stack of height one on an empty square orthogonally adjacent to it. At the end of the game, if the scores are tied all the way down to the smallest group, whoever made the last move wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesSwack is based on the same designer's Escabel and Micha&#197;&#130; Zapa&#197;&#130;a's Slyde.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The major and minor ranks both follow the one 1, two 2s, three 3s... structure.  However, the combinations are structured such that the 1 occurs on 2 cards (1-10 and 10-1), while the 10 occurs on 19 cards (10-10 through 10-1, and 1-10 through 10-10).  The cards are suitless.&#10;&#10;In the game, rather than the suit of the lead player's card, it is the combination of cards played by the first and second players that determines what must be followed.  If the major ranks of the first 2 cards match, then subsequent players may only play a card with that major rank.  If the minor ranks of the first 2 cards match, then subsequent players may only play a card with that minor rank.&#10;&#10;However, if the first and second card share neither the same major or minor rank, then all subsequent cards can match no previously played cards' major or minor ranks.&#10;&#10;Players earn 1 point per trick taken, and the game lasts a number of rounds equal to the players.  The person with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Allocate your power to ensure your tiny robot has the best chance of survival; will you increase your attack, attempt to dodge incoming fire, run like the wind?&#10;&#10;Whatever you choose, don't forget about the resources scattered around the board, these could make or break your game...&#10;TiRoBEx is set in the far future, a time when mankind has begun to explore the far reaches of space. With technological advances, and the discovery of a super fuel called Tyridium, remotely controlled robots no bigger than a child (and in most cases smaller) are able to perform the tasks of armies of men.&#10;&#10;This game simulates the militaristic side of the robots use &ndash; in attempts to destroy opponents and secure resource rich environments of newly discovered worlds orbiting distant star systems.&#10;&#10;With an innovative system of 3-D Blast templates that gradually reduce in size, TiRoBEx takes wargaming to a whole new level - a really, really low down level. The complete rules and printable versions of the templates and tokens are contained within a single full-colour rulebook.&#10;&#10;Each 'Tiny Robot System' (TRS) has a unique reference card with values for various attributes that you can alter during the game. Tyridium (like an individual energy store) can be allocated to many different systems; Movement, Range of Attack, Number of Attacks, Accuracy, Shield Generation, Evasion capabilities, or to power-up the devastating Area Impact (AI) Rounds. All this in an attempt to destroy your opponent(s) and secure unrefined Tyridium around the battlefield.&#10;&#10;The main TiRoBEx rulebook contains full rules for eight different TRS, from four of the largest factions in the future of humankind as they explore the vast reaches of the cosmos, in a bid to claim the Tyridium scattered throughout the stars for themselves.&#10;&#10;They may be small, but they can have a BIG impact!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players start off with five cards and pick a card from the deck every time a hand is played starting with the winner of the last hand. The game ends after all cards within the deck have been played.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to get the highest number of points.&#10;&#10;A trump suit is randomly selected at the beginning of each game which can be used to dominate all other cards regardless of their point value.&#10;&#10;The first card played within each round determines the suit that is in play for that round. It can only be beaten if a higher value card within the same suit is played or any trump card. Players do not have to follow suit during each round.&#10;&#10;The player (or team) with the highest number of points at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The trick-taking game Partout uses a 42-card deck that consists of 36 traditional number cards (1-9 in four suits) along with six special cards: King, Queen, Harlequin, Dungeon, Mathematican, Alchemist.&#10;&#10;Players compete in two-player teams over six or eight rounds, and whoever ends up with highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of seven cards (ten cards for a three-player game), then the first and second player of the round announce the trump number and trump color. Players must state how many tricks they expect to win, then teammates add their claims together ; teams have to reach their summed number of tricks to score important bonus points, the value of which depends on the initial claim.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules, with the exception that you don't have to follow the lead suit. Instead, the highest card wins the trick, which leads to often unpredictable victories because the six special cards have different skills.&#10;&#10;To win the game, teams have to estimate the risk of stating the expected tricks, use the special cards cleverly, and harmonize as an unit without either of them knowing what the other person holds.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Evermore have they walked the world of Iwari. Evermore have they embodied its spirit and shaped its lands. They are stewards of the earth. Five Titans that make the cosmos breath. On Iwari, there are no teeming masses, no continent-wide civilizations. Humanity is in its infancy, living in scattered tribes in forest, tundra, and desert.&#10;&#10;Now we have left our ancestral homelands to explore the vast uncharted regions, encountering other fellow tribes and exchanging knowledge, culture and wisdom. In our journey, we all live in harmony with the Titans, and though distant to us, they decide our fate. And yet only we don't know if they created us, or we created them.&#10;&#10;Iwari is an abstract-like Eurogame in which players represent different tribes looking for their identity by traveling around far lands and expanding their settlements into five different regions on the board. In the game, players use cards for two different actions:&#10;&#10;1) Place tents and expand their settlements into five different regions on the board in a majority game that scores on each territory.&#10;2) Construct nature totems to bond with the Titans by placing them on regions and score points based on the totem majorities in adjacent territories.&#10;&#10;During the game, players can complete missions that grant small perks and score points by having the majority of tents in each territory after the end of the first card cycle. At game end, the majority of tents will be scored again, along with the majorities of nature totems in two adjacent regions and settlements that players have created (i.e., four or more tents in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board).&#10;&#10;Iwari reimagines the award-winning game Web of Power by Michael Schacht by adding new layers of strategy, tribe player boards, different maps with their own set of rules, modules that can be added to the game, and unique co-operative and solo modes.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additional content in Deluxe Edition:&#10;&#10;     1 Double-sided game board: &quot;The Forgotten Islands&quot; and &quot;The Void&quot;&#10;     2 New maps: &quot;The Uncharted Paths&quot; and &quot;The Long Road&quot;&#10;     8 Plastic void totems&#10;     21 Silkscreen printing wooden void ruins&#10;     12 Void cards&#10;     Solo mode rules (separate rulebook)&#10;     10 Double-sided solo mode tokens&#10;     4 Mountains&#10;     Co-op Rules&#10;     16 Expedition cards&#10;     1 Feat: Courage&#10;     The Eagle pawn to use for the Feats: &quot;Complacency&quot; and &quot;Worship&quot;&#10;     2 Icebergs&#10;&#10;&#10;",

They do this by summoning creatures and casting spells from the pages of the Necronomicon to drive their opponent to madness.&#10;&#10;How To Play:&#10;1. Each player starts with a 35 card deck that they shuffle at the beginning of the game and draw five cards&#10;2. Each player then starts their turn with the draw phase then the summoning phase then the end phase &#10;2(a). during the draw phase the player draws one card from the top of their deck &#10;2(b.) during the summoning phase players may summon up to four creatures at a time on the field and may cast two spells per turn &#10;2(c). during the end phase players may attack the opponent sanity or their creatures and the effect of spells take place&#10;3. A player may take damage to their sanity when a spell is cast on them or a creature attacks them&#10;4. The game ends when one player has run out of sanity and is now mad&#10;Special rule: in order to summon larger creatures such as great old ones or outer gods a sacrifice is needed: for a Great Old One two lesser creatures must be sacrificed and for an Outer God two Great old Ones( or equivalent ) must be sacrificed. To check the classification of creatures and what spells affect them check the keywords.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayTo start, Black places a black stone on an empty point. From then on, starting with White, the players take turns. On your turn, you must perform exactly one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Drop: Select a 2x2 area including one or more empty points, such that no other 2x2 areas include all those empty points as well as at least another empty point. Then place a stone of your color on each empty point in the selected area.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Flip: Replace the two enemy stones in a crosscut with stones of your color. A crosscut is a 2x2 area of the board containing two diagonally adjacent black stones and two diagonally adjacent white stones.&#10;&#10;&#10;You win by completing a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Variants&#10;     Pie: To start, Black places between one and four black stones on different points of a 2x2 area of the board. The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Checkered: The game starts with the board fully covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the two possible checkered setups may be used. If the pie rule is used, Black starts by replacing one or two white stones in a single crosscut with black stones. Otherwise, Black starts by replacing any white stone with a black stone.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     2x2 checkered: Same as checkered, but the initial checkered pattern is made of 2x2 blocks of same-color stones.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It details a ship that is about to set sail, the amount of cargo it carries, and the price you must pay for this information.&#10;&#10;Starting with a limited amount of cargo you must first recruit help from an untrustworthy bunch of smugglers. Each smuggler has a unique ability, some bad habits, and a limit to the amount of cargo they can carry.&#10;&#10;Together you must then attempt to lure a ship onto the treacherous rocks, known as The Devil&rsquo;s Teeth, in the hope that you can salvage more cargo. With the turn of every card however you risk encountering survivors or being discovered by the patrolling Redcoats.&#10;&#10;Over the long winter months you will receive six of these ransom notes, each varies in difficulty and makes mounting demands upon you. Only by managing your resources and salvaging the right cargo will you be able to meet all six demands.&#10;&#10;Fail to meet any ransom demand and your life will most certainly be in danger, meet all six and you might just live to see another summer!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The Founding Member then reads the name and genre of their new fake band to the group. Each player in the group, including the founding member, will create &amp; write down the song title of the Fake Band&rsquo;s first hit single. Answers are passed back to the founding member face down.&#10;&#10;All of the song titles- including the one written by the founding member- will be read out loud to the group, twice.&#10;The first player up will try and match a song title to the correct author. When a match is made, the player who wrote that song title is eliminated from the round. Play continues until the current player guesses incorrectly. With an incorrect match, the mic passes clockwise to the next player, gameplay resumes. Gameplay continues until only 1 player remains or the mic makes it back to the founding member.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;&#10;1 point for each correct match (Not including guessing their own)&#10;2 bonus points if a player completes all matches in one turn&#10;4 points for the founding member if no correct matches are made before the mic makes it back to the founding member&#10;&#10;&#10;        The player with the most points after 3 rounds wins&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

To overcome the boredom, he decided to design a board game on his own when our Prime Minister announced 21 days of lockdown. He understood the COVID-19 scenario through media and came up with a board game, which he named CORONA YUGA, meaning Corona Era. He designed the layout, drew it on a cardboard and completed using material available at home, and started playing with family.&#10;&#10;Board games are a fun and effective way of introducing new concepts to children of all ages and Corona Yuga aims to create awareness in a most interesting manner and spend time together at home during lockdown period. The board game designed like the infamous corona virus, promotes Yoga &amp; Social Distancing and also appreciates COVID Warriors for their services to mankind. This fun game played by ages 5+ will entertain everyone in future years, about the present scenario faced by each one of us.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Story:&#10;It&rsquo;s the end of the twentieth century and you are in a post-soviet country in Europe. The main way to make a living is mineral mining. The market situation is very bad in the country troubled by corruption and high criminality. Market prices are barely enough to cover costs. The only way to make a decent living is to mine minerals supported by the government. The catch is that the government places subsidies just before the minerals are sold. This means you need to corrupt government officials to place subsidies in your favor.&#10;&#10;Game basics:&#10;The game is for up to five players. Each player represents a mine owner. The goal of the game is to make enough money to leave the country in three years by corrupting government officials, stealing, snitching or by exploiting miners.&#10;&#10;Each year is divided into four quarters. One turn is one quarter. Each quarter is divided into three months (actions), which means one player gets three actions each turn.&#10; In total, each player gets three actions each turn and four turns each year.&#10;&#10;At the end of each year, the government gives subsidies and sets market prices.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the third year (the twelfth turn). Players sell their minerals as usually and then count their money. The player with the most money wins. If there is a tie, the player with higher ranking card wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Serengeti is a family game, combining strategy and a bit of luck, set in the &ldquo;endless plains&rdquo; of Africa. Each player will be tasked with managing a new national park for 4 years, while collecting victory points with the goal of developing their park into the most popular in Africa.&#10;&#10;Everyone will have their own mat where they will arrange the animals in their park as well as any workers they hire and vehicles they purchase. Each gameplay item has a unique ability, so the player must plan carefully and play the ones that will help them build the best park.&#10;&#10;Every player starts with 5 Safari Cards and each year they must decide whether or not to play one. Depending on the animals currently in their park they&rsquo;ll receive different benefits and victory points when playing one, so players must keep an eye on which Safari Cards they have and when the best time to play them would be.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of moving your token to another tile and performing a simple action shown on the tile such as: obtaining resources, drawing or playing an animal or action card, hiring workers, purchasing vehicles, or hosting a safari. After each player has had a turn, a month is considered to have passed in the game. With quick turns, gameplay moves at a brisk pace and players will be eager to have another turn.&#10;&#10;The game has limited vehicles and workers, different safaris, and a constantly changing map, making every time you play a unique and different experience. Select your strategy, plan ahead, and create the best park in all of Africa!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Episode IV, players are trying to create two poker hands, and the player with the most valuable hands will be the winner.&#10;&#10;The game uses two decks of cards.  One is referred to as the &quot;Normal&quot; cards, and consists of ranks 1 through 10 in each of 4 suits.  The other is referred to as the &quot;Randolph&quot; deck, in an allusion to the designer Alex Randolph, as they are acquired through the mechanism popularized in Hol's der Geier.  The &quot;Randolph&quot; cards may have more than one possible color and/or rank.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 4 phases, and each player will have ten cards in their hand at the beginning and end of each phase.&#10;&#10;In the first phase, the players are dealt 10 cards each from the Normal deck, and will draft cards until they have one card of each rank in their hand.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, the players will reveal a certain number of Randolph cards face up and have an auction for them using the Hol's der Geier mechanism.  For players who have their bid cancelled, they will return their Normal card to their hand at the end of the round.  Otherwise, players will enter the next round with any Normal cards they did not bid, and any Randolph cards they won.&#10;&#10;In the third phase, a trick-taking round occurs, which is must follow and does not have a trump suit.  The winner of a trick distributes the cards from the trick to the players as they choose, with each player getting 1 card.&#10;&#10;In the fourth phase, the players make two face down rows of 5 cards with the cards they obtained in the trick-taking phase.  Each row is revealed simultaneously and awarded a given number of points based upon poker hand type conditions.  There are a few exceptions in cases where only one player scores, or only one player does not score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is the year 1511 and the Portuguese Empire rules the seas.  Far in the east, the port city of Malacca makes the mistake of backstabbing them, sparking a war at their doorstep. As Admiral of the Portuguese Empire, you arrive at Malacca to punish the Sultan's foolish betrayal by laying waste to his city. Meanwhile, as Laksamana of the Sultanate, you must repel the invaders and save your home from certain doom.&#10;&#10;Malacca 1511 is a 1-2 player game of the Portuguese conquest of Malacca in 54 cards - with 2 Solo Modes: a Solo game as the Portuguese Empire, and a Solo Campaign as the Sultanate.&#10;&#10;In a two-player game, each player leads one side, fighting over the city and against each other's armies in this unique Deck Builder vs Engine Builder card game. The cards are double-sided, with one side being the Empire Attackers besieging Malacca, while the flip side is the Sultanate's Defenders trying to hold them at bay. The game also uses a creative area control mechanic that simulates the Frontline of battle. This makes vying for the right cards and spaces on the battlefield key to winning the war.&#10;&#10;The Portuguese Empire plays as a Deck Builder, building up their strength to unleash increasingly deadly attacks against the city. The Sultanate plays as a Set Collection, Tableau + Engine Builder, adding Fighters to their city to bolster up defenses and making it easier to defeat enemies on future turns.&#10;&#10;Awards:&#10;&#10;From the 2020 54-Card Game Design Contest.&#10;-Best War Themed Game: 1st Place!&#10;-Best Solo Game: 2nd Place!&#10;-Best Euro Game: 2nd Place!&#10;-Best Overall Game: 3rd Place!&#10;-Jury Prize: 3rd Place!&#10;-Best 2 Player Game: 3rd place!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On the evening of 17th June 1815, the German garrison of the large farmhouse La Haye Sainte (the sacred hedge) settled down to dry out. They were posted there by the Duke of Wellington who saw the solid building as an anchor to his left flank and vital communication line to his Prussian allies. As the rain poured down, cold and wet soldiers did what all soldiers do &ndash; they smashed down the large gates of the barn to build a fire, little thinking that in six hours they would desperately need those gates...&#10;&#10;The epic struggle at La Haye Sainte is now the stuff of legend, with its small, but regularly reinforced garrison of green-clad rifleman of the King&rsquo;s German Legion and their allies clinging on grimly against massed French infantry assaults.&#10;&#10;Finally, with the riflemens&rsquo; ammunition spent, Marshall Ney ordered one more frenzied assault and this time, with Engineers led by Lieutenant Vieux swinging axes and crowbars, the French drove through the main gate. Bayonets and swords were freely used, in savage hand-to-hand fighting. By early evening the farm was in French hands and the loss of the farm keenly felt by the Allied forces. The overwhelming arrival of Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Prussian forces won the day for Wellington&rsquo;s hard-pressed men who then reoccupied the battered remains, but the struggle for this key building will be remembered for eternity.&#10;&#10;You can now recreate this epic struggle with this superb battle-set. &#10;Will your brave German defenders be able to stave off the massed enemy assaults? &#10;Will your proud French troops be able to drive the Allies from this vital strongpoint and threaten Wellington&rsquo;s flank?&#10;Only time will tell...&#10;&#10;La Haye Sainte contains:&#10;&#10;Laser-cut wooden farmhouse, out-buildings, walls and pond including construction guides and acetate windows&#10;    Laser-cut wooden tables and chairs &ndash; use as firing steps&#10;    Two laser-cut wooden carts and plough (barricade)&#10;    Six metal branches to form an abatis&#10;    Major Von Baring, King&rsquo;s German Legion 2nd Light Battalion (exclusive metal figure)&#10;    15 metal King&rsquo;s German Legion 2nd Light Battalion with rifles and muskets&#10;    5 King&rsquo;s German Legion light infantry&#10;    36 French Light Infantry (30 plastic and 6 metal) including full-colour flag sheet and waterslide decals&#10;    Lieutenant Vieux (exclusive metal figure) and five metal French Engineers with muskets or tools&#10;    12-page scenario booklet&#10;&#10;Note: There is a collector's edition of this that also comes with:&#10;&#10;1 resin sandpit&#10;    Metal farmer's wife tending young calf&#10;    Resin pile of dead Frenchmen&#10;    6 metal French Voltigeurs skirmishing&#10;    Marshall Ney shouting at brigade commander&#10;    4 metal French casualties&#10;    Mounted French Officer&#10;    36 French Infantry (6 metal command and 30 plastic infantry)&#10;    6 Luneberg Light Infantry&#10;    6x 95th Rifles&#10;    1 British Rocketeer and a horse.&#10;    1 Nassau officer using cooking pot to extinguish the barn fire&#10;    6 metal Nassau infantry&#10;    36 Hanoverian Line Infantry (6 metal command, 30 plastic infantry)&#10;    Sprue of abatis stakes and branches (metal)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's site&#10;&#10;",
