    "Description": "A very simple game for learning letters in the Lithuanian alphabet.

To play, the tiles are scattered face up on the table; a child takes a board and looks for the letters on the board, and on finding one, takes the tile, covers the letter on their board, and says the letter and the item pictured that starts with that letter. The one who completes their board first wins.&#10;&#10;It also says words and sentences can be made with the tiles, and indeed the frequency of the letters looks like it correlates with the frequency of use in everyday language use; but there are no rules for games or activities for spelling words.&#10;&#10;",

But be wary, the landscape is treacherous, and you will have to be prepared to encounter flash floods, lightning, crows, worms, earthquakes, high winds and even bears! This is a turn-based, resource-managing, survival, racing game. This is Rough baby!&#10; Traversing forests, and lakes, mountains and open fields, would be a challenge, but with the aid of a few scattered trading posts, caves and tents, you'll be able to equip and assist yourself along the way.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player will be able to roll a custom dice 3 times to hike their pawn across the open grid-like board, gathering resources onto their player mat freely as they go. With every roll of the dice you can get a hike(Move 1 space), a hungry(discard 1 Berry or Fish and Move 1 space), or a disaster(end your turn and draw a Disaster Card). Throughout gameplay you will acquire cards that give you special abilities during future turns, make trades at Trading Posts located on the board for helpful tools and even have the chance to make a friend with a bear. &#10; Player's have a limited amount of space in their backpack, so they have to be strategic with what and how much of each resource to carry along with them.&#10; The most unique mechanic of the game is the Disaster Deck. The backs of the cards are disasters that will happen to the board or all players(everyone at the table sees this side), but the fronts are helpful abilities that only you can see and use. So as long as you are holding on to the cards in your hand, the disasters on those cards will always be a threat to the progress of all players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

(The first letters of the state and city names's are large, used in games 3 and 5.)&#10;     A silhouette of the state, showing its capital, with abbreviations of neighboring states and water bodies around its perimeter. &#10;     Three numbers in the range 1-50, showing the state's:&#10;         order in joining the US (blue ink)&#10;         rank in size, 1 being largest (black ink)&#10;         rank in population (as of 1975) (red ink)&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;There are also 6 wild cards, show different American icons (Old Glory, Statue of Liberty, US Capitol, the Constitution, Liberty Bell, and 1st moon landing), each worth 25 points.&#10;&#10;There are rules for five games:&#10;&#10;1. State Capitals. Match the listed capital city on the top card on the table with its state card in your hand, or vice versa; otherwise play a card onto the top of the table pile. If you make a match you get all the cards on the table and score their blue numbers.&#10;&#10;2. Build the Country. Play any cards from your hand next to table cards they are neighbors to, as shown on their maps, or play any card to the table if you cannot. A successful neighboring play earns you the maximum of the 3 numbers on the card.&#10;&#10;3. Match-Em. Play a card so one of the first letters or its state or capital name matches one of the first letters of the top table card; or just play a card onto the top of the table pile. If you match you keep all the current table cards, scoring the numbers next to the words whose initials you matched, and the same spot in all cards under the top card.&#10;&#10;4. Hi-Number. Play a card whose blue number is higher than the last card played, or pass. If you play the last card in the current trick you keep the played cards and score the blue number of each of them.&#10;&#10;5. Americana. Play one or more cards so that one large initial of each of them adds to a growing word on the table, or just play one card to start a new word. If you complete a valid word you keep its cards and score their blue numbers. Valid words are those about anything about America: a state or city name, famous person, work of art, invention, etc.&#10;&#10;For each of these games, you refill your hand after play, and the target score for a win is 1776.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Uncover lost knowledge, guide your people to a new home, or forge a galactic confederation!&#10;&#10;As you complete objectives and make critical decisions, the campaign grows and changes. If you destroy a world, its refugees might flood the galaxy in your next game. If you find your society driven to a state of collapse, you can even abandon your homeworld and play the next game operating out of a lone flagship.&#10;&#10;Each game in the campaign takes less than two hours to play. You can sit down for a single skirmish and then pack up for another day, or settle in for an epic three-act saga! Just make sure to stretch and drink some water between games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are five factions vying for power of these locations and each faction consists of six cards ranging in value from 1-6. Player will not know what factions their opponents are making secret alliances with until the big reveal at the end of the game. Each player will end the game with 3 cards remaining in their hand and these will indicate which factions they have made alliances with. All locations are then scored and given to each faction. The player with the most valuable cards for each faction will gain all the victory points for the corresponding locations!&#10;&#10;Players will also be attempting to place cards in clever ways as to grab shiny bronze coins, which are also worth victory points. Placing a Hag card allows the player to move the Hag from location to location and then move previously placed cards to a new position on the table, potentially messing up an opponent's plan or bolstering their own. Lastly, the sneaky Troll card can be played to steal a coin from any location and then allow that player to immediately take another turn.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Like all tarock, Esculenta is distinguished by a super-long trump suit with the other cards being where one score most of the points: in this case half the deck, 20 cards, are trump! Players bid to win the most card points but often gain even more points from declaring to achieve certain bonus feats in tricks, such as taking the last trick with the lowest trump. &#10;In addition to the fact it&rsquo;s played with a regular deck, distinctions include declarer going against a defender who plays two cards to the three card trick with the help of a mini-dummy, and an idiosyncratic trick-playing order. The dummy is played by defender (so it's 2:1) but this is offset by the fact the declarer can often maintain the lead by forcing dummy to win.&#10;&#10;Esculenta is part of the &quot;Twisted Dummy&quot; series: 2 player adaptations of traditional games using dummy third hand used in innovative ways.&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players decide which dice edition to use before the game. &#10;Game goal : Be the first player to move your three pieces from your side to the opposite side.&#10;Decide first player and then alternate turns.  Players cast two dice then move their piece(s) by the moving rule below at their turn.&#10;&#10;A: Move one piece with sum of dice pip(s).&#10;B : Move two pieces according to each die pip(s). Players can decide their first move pip(s).&#10;Pieces must land on open spaces jumping other pieces on the board and must reach the opposite side exactly. If player has no legal place to move at his turn,  then he loses the game. If players have only one piece, moving a piece by either one of dice pips is considered a legal move.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

But he wasn&rsquo;t alone; he was accompanied by a huge robot affectionately named &laquo; Rookie &raquo;.&#10;&#10;Surgical muscle implantation and intense training augmented his fighting ability and agility, allowing him to face his fears and push beyond his prior limits. And his detective skills, honed over the years as Police Commissioner, were as sharp as ever.&#10;&#10;His moral compass, unchanged, still guided him towards the pursuit of justice. The government tech allowed Rookie to be at his side, under his guidance, providing mission support.&#10;&#10;In gameplay terms, Gordon controls Rookie using his Command skill, but instead of GCPD officers it&rsquo;s a super heavy Bat-suit Bot striking fear into Gotham&rsquo;s&rsquo; criminal underworld.&#10;&#10;Batman (New 52) and Rookie are both playable in Versus mode.

    "Description": "Warren White was a notorious trader on the Gotham Stock Exchange. His ruthless methods garnered him the nickname &quot;The Great White Shark&quot;. When his embezzlements landed him in court, White pleaded insanity and was sent to Arkham Asylum. There, he was tortured and abused by fellow inmates, and by the time he was released he bore severe physical and psychological scars. With stark white skin and a pair of &quot;gills&quot; (thanks to Killer Croc), his physical appearance now befit his nickname. As just another freak in the criminal underworld, he chose to carve a niche for himself by ousting the Penguin and working with Black Mask.&#10;&#10;Warren White doesn&rsquo;t regret his mishap in Mr Freeze&rsquo;s cell; his physical and mental transformation elevated him to criminal Kingpin status.&#10;&#10;His strategic and tactical leadership lets him position his men exactly where they are needed.&#10;&#10;His direct support is more often than not required in order to achieve his goals.&#10;&#10;Physical strength not being his key strength, he prefers to lurk in the background until the moment presents itself to deliver that fatal blow.&#10;&#10;The Great White Shark is recruitable in Versus mode and can be substituted in the following core box Adventure Mode Mission: &quot;Good Cops/Bad Cops&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They then proceed to move one of their pieces according to the chess moving scheme represented on the card (if you play a bishop you can move any of your pieces as if it was a bishop).&#10;&#10;Pieces are captured the same way you do in chess, but following the roshambo logic (eg: a scissor piece can only capture a paper piece).&#10;After a player has moved he draws another card and the turn passes to his opponent.&#10;&#10;Pieces  captured can be respawned in game using special cards and every capture is a point.&#10;&#10;After 15 turns the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. If a player is able to capture all 3 pieces of his opponent before he is able to respawn any of them the game ends immediately by knockout.&#10;&#10;Full rules and manual can be found on the official Scamorra site.&#10;&#10;",

Everyone collects a player mat, coloured dice and drinking cup. Each turn, the leading player turns over a card, showing an arrangement of dice then the players race to stack their own dice (plus extra from a shared pile) to match the pattern on the card.  They then grab their cups, raise them into air and call out, &ldquo;SK&Aring;L!&rdquo; (Cheers in Norwegian).  Whoever does this first wins the card, which is worth 1 or 2 points, depending upon difficulty.  The first player to 9 points wins!&#10;&#10;There are extra cards, rules, special powers and added challenges to keep the game interesting.  It can be played as a fun family game or as a rowdy adults-only drinking game if you choose.

    "Description": "DISCLAIMER&#10;One of our authors is Moldavian and she loves her culture and her language so much she wanted to put some of that love in our game. We can assure you that everything you see in Ahotnik is related to the fictional world we created for our game. The only place we can accept fighting and war is in a boardgame, other than that, as authors, players and human beings, we strongly reject war and violence and we firmly stand for peace and inclusivity.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Ahotnik, the players form pairs and act as the pilots of giant robots called &ldquo;Ahotniks&rdquo;&mdash;each of which has its own unique designation of &ldquo;OXO-##&rdquo;, for this reason, they are also known as &ldquo;OXOs&rdquo;. Their goal is to be the first team to eliminate a rival Ahotnik. But, during their battles, otherworldly creatures referred to as &ldquo;Demons&rdquo; emerge from mysterious Portals and try to wreak havoc on Earth by destroying the Ahotniks. The teams must fight on both fronts if they are going to be the one to bring glory to their nation! But beware: Your thirst for power must not come at the cost of total global annihilation&hellip;&#10;&#10;A game of Ahotnik is played over a series of rounds which are divided into 4 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pilot Phase:&#10; Pilot pairs try to coordinate by using their Action tiles, which represent the cerebral commands they send to the Ahotnik. The success of their strategy depends on their level of synchrony. &#10;     Ahotnik Phase:&#10; The Ahotniks operate in this phase depending on the actions thought up by the pilots in the Pilot Phase. In order, the OXOs will carry out:&#10;         Tactical Actions: A set of actions that can have offensive, defensive, or strategic effects.&#10;         Movement Actions: Move the OXO on the game board.&#10;         Attack Actions: The main (though not the only) method to damage your enemies.&#10;    &#10;     Demon Phase:&#10;Beware of incoming threats! This is the turn of any Demons in play. The Radar will also indicate if any new Portals open and increase the Global Threat Level this turn.&#10;     Recovery Phase:&#10;Certain game elements are restored so a new round may begin. &#10;&#10;&#10;Rounds are repeated until an Ahotnik falls victim to another OXO or a Demon. Who will achieve total dominion of the planet?&#10;&#10;",

Including two never before seen miniatures, Akhelian Thrallmaster and The Auric Flamekeeper. These models will lead the two armies into battle, but who will come out on top is down to you.&#10;&#10;Fyreslayers are born from the furnaces deep within mountain vaults, bellowing mighty war cries as they charge into the fray swinging their deadly battle axes. They carry little in the way of armour to protect themselves, instead blessed with the power of their God magical ur-gold runes that are seared into their flesh, allowing their God's power to flow through their veins and provide them with abilities of more resilient skin and increased strength to cleave their enemies in two and shrug off wounds that would slay a normal warrior. What drives the Duardin Fyreslayers ever on is the promise of gold to be won, to fulfil their oaths by vanquishing their enemies and the chance to honour the spirit of Grimnir.&#10;&#10;The Idoneth Deepkin are a cursed people. When Teclis took his due of Aelven souls from the captive Slaanesh he crafted a new race that he hoped would embody the virtues of the Aelves from the world that was. He failed. The creatures he created were not untainted by their time within the God of Excess, holding within themselves a deep well of darkness. Horrified at his failure, Teclis attempted to eradicate his newly created children but could not act before they fled, far into the deepest oceans of the Ethersea. There they multiplied only to discover to their horror that the majority of their children possessed withered souls. Few survived beyond birth and fewer still to adulthood so a decision was made. In order to safeguard the lives of those few children that survived the Idoneth would need to graft healthy souls to theirs thus do the Idoneth venture into the mortal realms on raids to enslave living captives to be donors and ensure the future of their race.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

From this shimmering tide of magic, cold-hearted aelven warriors and ferocious beasts of the abyss surge forth to overwhelm their disoriented prey.

Players have seven tries to break the code. The code master selects the code and provides clues as players try to deduce the secret code.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE &ndash; Players have seven tries to break a code that is selected by the code master.&#10;THEME &ndash; The theme of the game is cryptanalysis by head-to-head code-breaking.&#10;GAME PLAY &ndash; The game can be played in cooperative or head-to-head mode. In cooperative mode, there is one codemaster and all the other players are trying to guess the code. In head-to-head mode, two players or two teams are simultaneously trying to break the code of the other player/team. Each player/team has a Tech Deck. Each player/team serves as the codemaster for the other player/team. Players make an educated guess using their Tech Deck cards. Cards placed as a guess are called guess cards. After making a guess, the codemaster rotates the guess cards to provide information about the secret code for each of the guess cards in their positions of the code. A guess card can be an exact match, value match, displaced, or absent. &#10;WINNING &ndash; In cooperative mode, the players win by guessing the values of each of the positions of the secret code. In head-to-head mode, a player/team wins if they guess the exact cards (value and domain/suit) of the secret code. If after 7 turns, neither player/team has guessed the code they are awarded points based on how close to the secret code they are.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You will encounter quicksand, scorpions, and mirages that will fool and stymie you. Can you be the hero of the group by being the first one to expose the maze path and find the exit?&#10;&#10;Your goal is to create a complete, unbroken maze path between the Maze Entrance and the Maze Exit and be the first Explorer to exit the maze. However, be careful not to run out of water, get caught in quicksand or encounter a scorpion!&#10;&#10;Your maze exploration starts by shuffling all the maze tiles facedown and placing them on the table in front of you, being sure to connect at least one edge of each tile to another. You will then roll one or two dice to move over the tiles, turn them faceup, rotate them, and uncover the maze before you run out of your limited supply of water.&#10;&#10;Along the way you will search for the hidden exit while also encountering various artifacts. Some artifacts, like the well, will help you to continue your explorations, others, like the scorpion or quicksand will not!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
