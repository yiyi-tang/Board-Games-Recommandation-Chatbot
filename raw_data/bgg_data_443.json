The two games resemble each other, but Shatranj is different enough that they can be considered two distinct games, even though it is Shatranj that Europeans first called &quot;chess&quot;.&#10;&#10;The main differences between shatranj and modern chess are that the earlier game had a vizier instead of a queen, and an elephant instead of a bishop, and these pieces had much more limited movement than their modern counterparts.  The pawn also lacked the double-step introductory move it has today, and furthermore, there was no castling.&#10;&#10;While all this sounds very limiting, it can make a refreshing change from modern chess.  Modern openings must be left behind, and the pace of the game is a little slower, the limited movement of the pieces allowing defenses to be set up before the opponent approaches to destroy them.&#10;&#10;Shatranj Kamil was an early and largely unsuccessful attempt to expand the game of Shatranj.&#10;&#10;",

First, there is a plastic bar with 23 holes. &#10;Rolling a glass marble in that bar replaces the roll of a die. Second, a 1.5 x 3 inch model car serves as challenge trophy.

    "Description": "ACTION FRONT! Watchtower is the first in a projected series of  DTP microgames covering tactical combat in WWII.  The game's expandable system is reminiscent of the venerable Panzerblitz/Panzer Leader games, with a feeling of the Five-Star series thrown in.  Each game is played on 4 x 8 inch  semi-geomorphic maps, with a fast, furious sequence of play that minimizes bookkeeping and maximizes the action.  Players may play the included scenarios or create their own using the provided rules.&#10;&#10;Watchtower comes with 20 US and 20 Japanese units, allowing players to recreate the epic struggle of the 1st US Marine Division on Guadalcanal in September and October of 1942.  USMC Raiders and Paramarines square off against Chi-Ha tanks and leg mortars.  Special rules are included for Henderson Field and banzai attacks.&#10;&#10;In a small series with the Action Front! Hakko Ichiu.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Le Combat de l&rsquo;Aigle (The Eagle's fight) is a tactical game system meant to simulate Napoleonic battles at the battalion scale. Large size battles are playable in one day. The game mechanism is close to miniatures, but the armies are included in the box as are several scenarios on the beginning of the 1809 campaign. Other volumes will follow.&#10;&#10;Several rules are very innovative; a focus on unit cohesion (visualized by file closers set behind the unit), the chain of command, a cavalry combat using waves of squadrons close to reality. Other elements, (e.g. the brigade move) can accelerate the game. The combat system is based on drawing cards and comparing them (a simpler system based on a single die roll is also included).&#10;&#10;Le Combat de l&rsquo;Aigle can be played three different ways :&#10;&#10;* As a tactical system to simulate real or imaginary battles..&#10;    * As a miniature game system (Kip Trexel is the author of the campaign rules for Empire III). Basing and the use of miniatures, with single miniatures as file closers, are easy to adapt to any scale. Designed at first to be played with 6mm miniatures and doubling all distances included here, it can be converted to any scale with great ease..&#10;    * As a tactical extension of the Vol de l&#226;&#128;&#153;Aigle campaign system, to solve every important battle. The players can decide to switch to a more tactical system when a large battle occurs.&#10;&#10;The game includes 5 scenarios on the opening moves of the 1809 campaign.&#10;Content (under ziplock):&#10;&#10;* 1 rule book (32 pages).&#10;    * 18 hard paper counter sheets including the French and Austrian armies at the beginning of the 1809 campaign in Bavaria.&#10;    * 4 sheets of colorful player aid.&#10;&#10;The players must provide numerical markers from 1 to 6 (we use 5mm dice).&#10;&#10;",

Cyclists can also encounter a flat tire (caused by rolling two 1's with the dice), if this happens to the team leader, he can be helped by a teammate if necessary. Winner is the player who scores best in the overall classification. There is also a mountain prize for the player who has the best climber in his team.&#10;&#10;",

Players race through space using one of five metal spaceship playing pieces collecting treasure on the planets and space stations located on the board.  Players have the option of selecting one of two numbers after spinning for their turn.&#10;&#10;An Australian version was produced by John Sands (Sydney) under licence from Parker Brothers. The concept of the game is the same but considerable differences in graphics can be seen on the board, spinner and box. The US version shows the Americas visible from earth while the Australian version shows Australia and south-east Asia. The spaceship playing pieces are the same as the US game although the instructions suggest only 4 players instead of 5 in the US version. As players advance around the board they collect (or lose) gold nuggets which are simply small stones painted gold. This also seems to differ from the collecting pieces in the US version.&#10;&#10;",

As with most of these games directed at players around the age of 5, decisions do not change the outcome of the game too much, it comes down to the luck of the dice.&#10;Depending on the colours you roll on the 2 dice, you either add waves, parts of the sandcastle or help other players out.

Resi and Rudi want to know which of them is faster! Ready, set, go: The race over stick and stone is on. On a player's turn, he rolls the die. The end of the caterpillar is always placed ahead of the head, so long as the color collar is ahead as well. Then, the caterpillar's head is moved to that color. If a player rolls a color that the head is already on, then he may put a barrier up in front of the other caterpillar. That player must now navigate past the barrier. As soon as a caterpillar touches the goal flag, the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

Here, the players start with their rockets in Earth and have to reach Mars by earning votes for their definitions of weird words and points for guessing what the true definition of those words is.&#10;&#10;In each turn a referee player, who changes after the end of the turn, draws a card in which different eccentric words are specified. The rest of the players write down a definition for the word secretly on a piece of paper. Then, the referee reads aloud all definitions and players have to vote which one they think is true (they cannot vote their own definition). According to the number of votes received for their definition or if they where able to find the true definition, the players can move their rockets towards Mars. Also, the dice can determine if the players ought to write a funnier definition instead of trying to find the true one, or if instead of a word it's a famous star that they have to define, or if the definition is given to them instead of the word and they have to find this last one.&#10;The first player in Mars wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

It was here, a Bolivian Army led by German General Kundt, armed with new weapons (tanks, flame-throwers, fighter-bombers) assaulted the Paraguayan defenses not from Paraguay's capitol. Kundt had been led to believe the defenses were weak, that the tanks would break through and that once Nanawa fell, the road would be open to Paraguay&rsquo;s capital. This was in fact true, however, that was the only thing which was true. The Paraguayan forces had been issued special antitank ammo and built well defended trenches with mines. Their lines were not weak and numerically almost as strong as the Bolivian! The Paraguayans had proved themselves many times during this war as a very dangerous foe even when outnumbered. After three days of fighting and a combined body count of over 4000 men with little real gain, the Bolivians halted.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;1 11x17 inch map&#10;280 counters, &#10;Player aids&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;Company-level&#10;1 hex=250 yards&#10;1 turn=8 hours&#10;&#10;",

The battle itself uses some very interesting, colorful terrain, along with the usual units with the evocative names: 2nd Zouaves, the Fijo de Morelio Battalion, Chasseurs d&rsquo;Affrique, the Oaxaca Lancers, etc. Special rules cover cavalry lancer charges, square formation, a rather early use of trenches, and artillery ammo.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules and mechanics will be quite familiar to anyone who has played BSO games, but all with a nice period flavor.&#10;&#10;Playing time for CINCO has averaged 2-3 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 9 pages.&#10;&#10;CAVEAT: This battle will also be featured in an upcoming GMT module (for their GRINGO game) that will be published late 2007, early 2008.

All buildings will contain proof, but only one will contain the relevant ones with the required features.&#10; During the game the detectives will have to search the different buildings on the board gathering clues in every one of them and making notes of them in their &quot;Detective Notes&quot; sheets, followed by Alan Baddy who'll do everything in his/her power to frustrate their quest.&#10; The winner is that player who discovers in which building the crime was committed, contributing the proof which corroborates his/her hypothesis.&#10;&#10;",
