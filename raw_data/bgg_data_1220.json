From there, the 5 dragonslayers began their journey into the core of the moon.&#10;&#10;Buried in the bodies of their fallen foes in their pierced battlesuits, the knights of the KG 01 were imbued with Tsukuyumi's power and became Oni. But due to their training and their faith they were able to resist the transformation and keep their own will. With their new powers they patched their battlesuits with organic mass and ascended from the inner core of the moon. Half Oni and half knight. Ready to rain havoc on whoever steps in the way of their crusade. Their DARK CRUSADE.&#10;&#10;Playstyle&#10;&#10;The Dark Crusade are immensely powerful. But like the KG 03 they only have few units. In fact they have even less units then their righteous brothers, namely three.&#10;&#10;As the Dark Crusade are kind of Oni themselves they can to certain amount interact and even control the Oni.&#10;All Oni adjacent to Grendel count as units of the Dark Crusade and can be moved by the player and can even perform attacks.&#10;&#10;As long as Lilith is in play, areas with Oni in them can not be conquered and finally every area Samael enters gains the Tsukuyumi area property.&#10;&#10;Oh, and I almost forgot Baal. But he just sits in his drop pod (The KG 01 homezone) and shoots everybody who comes near him.&#10;Like the KG 03 the Dark Crusade wants to dictate the pace of the game right from the start and center the attention on the moon and areas that a worth more VP.&#10;&#10;The Dark Crusade really are the new powerhouse in town.&#10;&#10;Did I mention that Grendel has an atomic bomb for a heart?&#10;&#10;No? And guess what, he can blow it up, inflicting tons of damage! Literally TOOOONS of damage.&#10;&#10;So are you ready to expose yourselves to Tsukuyumi's pheromones and step inside a tainted battlesuit to bring wrath upon your opponents?&#10;&#10;",

They plan to coordinate an enormous underground dance party to return the message of nonviolent resistance back to the people.&#10;&#10;Reggae Revolution is a cooperative card game for 1 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Players work together to bring the message of peace and love back to the world.  In the game are four suits: peace, love, unity, and respect.  Players try to use these cards to collect sets in the score area to win the game.  But, at the beginning of each player's turn, a villain card pops out and makes the player discards all cards of a suit that the villain supresses.  Instead of fighting the villains, the players must sway them by giving them cards from their deck.  If the player does not have enough, the villain stays in play.  As the villains stack up, the players must discard more and more cards from their hand.  If the villains ever supress all four suits, peace, love, unity, and respect, then no one has any cards and the villains win the game!&#10;&#10;Fight the power!  Join the resistance!

    "Description": "Set on a golden island you must try to outsmart your opponent in a strategic battle that starts right from the very beginning&#10;&#10;The island is set on a 12 x 12 playing field. Each player starts the game with one carrier pad and ten tiles which consist of three different characters. The tiles are also reversible, on one side you have your combat unit and the other side is a number that represents that characters firing range. You can choose either side of the tile to play your battle. Plus there&rsquo;s ten communal obstacle block tiles.&#10;&#10;Game play &#10;All characters move around the island in the same manner by the roll of a dice which is numbered 0-5. The number rolled on the dice will determine the amount of moves a character can advance to. You will have the option to move your character forward in a straight line, and the option to change direction to the left or right on each move. To remove your opponents characters from the island, your character has to be facing forward towards your intended target in a direct line, and the shot has to be an exact hit matching your characters fire range. An exciting part of the game is the fact that your carrier pad, not only carries your reinforcements but it can also, move along the edge of the island. Now your characters will be able to be launched onto the island from a different position.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;The action starts as soon as you start setting up for the battle ahead.&#10;First take turns in placing one obstacle block at a time onto the island until all ten tiles are on the island, during the battle these can be used for defence or can be activated for attack. Carry on taking turns until you have placed any five of your ten characters onto the island, at this stage you will be keeping a close eye on what your opponent is up to. Your remaining five characters will be placed onto your carrier pad of which is located just off the edge of the island, this is where your reinforcements are located during the battle.&#10;&#10;PLAY YOUR TURN&#10;After the setup play will now continue by the roll of the dice. &#10;This is where the action gets real on your turn you will have the option to remove any intended target, providing a direct hit has been established. This action can be done before you move your character and after and as many times as you wish. All movement is determined by the roll of the dice, after which many options will be available to you; move to attack, elude attack, blocking your enemy from movement, activating obstacle blocks, risk taking, launching reinforcements and moving your carrier pad. On your turn you must all ways make your play using the entire number shown on the dice. Failure to do this will result in you losing a character so play well and try not to get yourself trapped. When your happy with all your actions played, you will now pass play over to your opponent who in turn will play their turn.&#10;&#10;Carry on taking turns until a player wins by removing all ten of his opponent's characters to become the new ruler.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

While traveling through empty space in Cryonic Torpor, the PIN Drive responsible for Quantum Pinning your vessel to a point in time, allowing near instantaneous travel across light years, has failed. As a failsafe the ship has deactivated your Torpor, meaning you are slowly waking up with only moments to fix the drive and renew your Torpor before the low levels of life support on the ship  can no longer keep you conscious. You must Repair the Drive while manufacturing enough Refrigerant to renew Torpor, all while providing yourself with enough Oxygen and Nutrient to keep moving until you succeed.&#10;&#10;Torpor is a single-player roll-and-write in which a player will assign up to five dice to various tasks on their board. Dice must be assigned to both Survival categories (Oxygen and Nutrient) every turn, and may also be assigned to buy Upgrades (such as an additional health or dice) and Repairs, which are needed to win the game. If you can repair both Refrigerant and Drive before running out of Health, you have won the game!&#10;&#10;While rolling the dice you may reroll any dice in matching pairs, triples, etc. This provides strategy as you attempt to obtain the dice you will need each turn, and an element of risk as you may decide to reroll &quot;good&quot; dice in order to obtain the pairs you need to reroll &quot;bad&quot; dice. There is also strategy in deciding where to assign your dice, and when to intentionally take damage and work on repairs instead.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Instead, Inventures relies on a powerful and novel game mechanic involving symbol interpretation.&#10;&#10;When your character faces a challenge, you choose between options, each composed of a randomly drawn ACTION and OBJECT card.&#10;&#10;You secretly pick which option best represents how your character would solve the problem. If the other players successfully guess which option you chose, your action succeeds and the story progresses.&#10;&#10;Because of its modular symbol interpretation system, you can use Inventures to play stories in any setting imaginable: Westerns, SciFi, Fantasy, or a game set in the world of your favorite books or movies!&#10;&#10;Games can be as short as 45 minutes and as long as weeklong campaigns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Alphabet Dungeon is a two to four player game where a group of stalwart adventurers go on a quest for treasure tiles.  You will be exploring a mysterious dungeon, fighting monsters and searching for treasure tiles.  In this dungeon the treasures are letters and your goal is to solve all the words on your quest.  As you explore the dungeon and defeat monsters you gain more letters to help solve more words.  The player that completes his/her entire quest of words wins the game.  During your exploration you can visit the bazaar and purchase vowels to help you complete your quest.&#10;&#10;VICTORY CONDITIONS:&#10;When a player completes all the quest words on his/her quest card, they win the game.  The Bonus word is used in case of a tie where both players complete their quest card on the same turn, the player that has also completed the bonus word would end up being the winner.  If both players complete all words and the bonus word on the same turn, then both players share the win.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players use the cards to build their character based on their vision of that character and strategy for the game.  A character can be customized to various power levels in the areas of Attack, Defense, Damage Bonus, Resistance, Health, Power, and Ability Cards.&#10;&#10;There are over 50 unique Ability cards.  Players secretly choose a set number of Ability cards before the game. These are kept in a player's hand and only shown when used.  Most Ability cards require a specific amount of Power cards.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they can choose to Activate a Character, Rest a Character, or Use a Card. Most cards result in a battle with another character. Some cards have other effects.&#10;&#10;A player must protect their Health cards and manage their Power cards while attacking and defending against an enemy.  Many attacks are resolved by opposing dice rolls. However, other attacks/defenses are countered by your opponent's cards.&#10;&#10;There is no board. The coin is placed on its display stand in front of the player.  The cards are placed next to the coin.&#10;&#10;There is no limit to the number of players.  You can play in teams, a handicapped game, or other game modes.&#10;&#10;Game balance is maintained since each deck has cards with the same abilities.  However, they are themed to fit the character.  An evasion defense may be called Flight for a Dragon but Teleportation for a Lich.&#10;&#10;Every card has a counter.  More powerful cards cost more to use.  You can only use an Ability card once.  These things prevent one or two cards from dominating the game.&#10;&#10;When not playing, coins can be used as display pieces since they come with a stand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

With motives by the renowned children's book illustrator Antje Damm, MeterMorphosen is finally introducing a memo game for children that is more challenging than the usual memo games as its pairs consist of two different motives. When you find everyday items like carrots, a clothespin or soap on the sturdy memo cards, the question is: What is this? With the matching second card, these every-day objects are transformed into animals: a sausage becomes a dachshund, and a popsicle unexpectedly turns into a penguin. The 24 pairs of What is this? promote associative thinking and thus support intelligence development through effortless play. This memo game is not only an assembly of marvellous ideas, but also an encouragement to examine the world more closely, to get creative and to use one's imagination.&#10;&#10;",

It is absolutely entertaining to spot the caricatures of prominent persons in the game and to discover their independent categorization. The players get to keep both cards if they find corresponding pairs, but if they find all four cards of a kind, they get additional points via an extra joker card that raises the pile of gained cards and helps them win the game in the end.

In the basic game, the Vortex icon is not used, and represents a brief respite for the players.&#10;&#10;Each page of the book of the dead is represented by a double sided poker-sized card (with rounded corners) that feature 1-6 arcane icons.  To bring two pages together, the icons must match.  On your turn, after you have rolled the dice, you have one action, such as taking a card from the Vortex (the central pool of cards in the table), adding your 'stack' of cards to the book and finally, if able, to close the book and win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

What most people don't know is that, in order to realize a particular wish, you need cunning and strategy. You will have to capture the right comets to make your dreams come true. But be careful: if you chase love you will hardly realize the desire for richness, the same its true for those who chase fame, at the expense of virtue... Plan your moves carefully, and avoid the traps of your opponent: who first realizes two wishes... wins the game!&#10;&#10;Comete is a language-independent, highly thematic strategy game, which hides a fascinating and delicate depth of play.&#10;&#10;Comete is a &quot;perfect strategy&quot; game, where all the information is known to all players and the resources available for each player are identical: your choices will make the difference. But it's not an abstract game, shooting stars are elusive and unpredictable, and so they are in the game. No one can know what will be the next fallen star to appear in the sky, even less when the comet you need will appear. Moreover, they exist as in the past comets harbingers of feast or famine and often it will be up to the player to decide how to unravel the celestial message.&#10;&#10;To capture a comet you will have to &laquo;attract&raquo; it to you by matching its colours. You have several &laquo;wish fragments&raquo; (acrylic gems) to play each turn, which you must tactically place by line of the celestial horizon: if a comet passing next to them has the same colours, you have captured it!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This can be done by playing the categories in order, or by rolling a die or otherwise randomly selecting one if just one round is to be played. &#10;Second, each player is dealt 6 word cards, which have 3x3 grids of letters on them. A timer is set for three minutes. The players will use their own hand of cards to spell words in the selected category until the time runs out. &#10;The players can rearrange the cards as much as they would like; the cards can be rotated or overlapped. Players write down each word once they find it, then they can rearrange the cards (they don't have to preserve the configuration that allowed them to spell the word). &#10;When spelling words, any adjacent letters may be used, including diagonally-connected letters (similar to the mechanics of the game Boggle). Letters may only be used once in any given word. &#10;At the end of the round, points are counted. 3- and 4-letter words are worth one point, 5-letter words are worth 2 points, 6-letter words are worth 3 points, 7-letter words are worth 4 points, etc. &#10;Plural words do not count unless the word is naturally plural (eg. pants). Spelling the word 'mountains', for example, would count only as the 8-letter word 'mountain'.&#10;Proper nouns DO count if it makes sense in the category. (For example, if the category is 'science terms' then the word 'Einstein' would be allowed).&#10;&#10;Players can challenge the spelling of another player's word. If the spelling is incorrect, the word does not count. &#10;Players can play as many or as few rounds as they want.&#10;&#10;Alternative scoring:&#10;Instead of totaling the score of all words at the end of the round, the player who spelled the longest word in the three-minute time period is the winner.&#10;&#10;Alternative gameplay:&#10;Players can adjust the number of cards dealt to each player or the amount of time in a round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bad Guy Nonsense is a unique strategic family card game where you compete to capture fantastical BAD GUYS. It features wild pop culture-rich artwork on large OVERSIZED glossy linen cards making it unlike anything else that has come before.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll need all your wits and gaming skills to employ BOUNTY HUNTERS, BANDITS, BURGLARS, HEROES, MONSTERS, and a WITCH to capture high-value BAD GUY targets. Battle your opponent to steal their captures while defending your own.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to score points by capturing the most Bad Guy Cards before the deck runs out. You'll need to get the right card combos to make a capture and score points. The higher the value target, the harder the combo is to acquire. You make captures and score points while the SPECIAL CARDS (HEROES, BURGLAR, BANDIT, WITCH, MONSTER) all cause massive havoc between you and your opponent(s). The game gets intense as each turn passes because once the deck runs out, the game is over. When this happens, uncaptured BAD GUYS count as negative points. So you'll want to start discarding them when the deck runs low! However, your opponent(s) may be able to pick them up and use it against you... It's impossible to tell how many turns are left as you don't know how many cards the next player will play!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Once a dice shrine chamber is discovered, two of the set-aside dice are rolled and placed on the shrines in the chamber. Adventurers in the chamber can use the indicated number of dice that match the face shown on the die in the shrine to activate the shrine, gaining the bonus shown on the shrine, then the die is removed. The bonuses are: a gem, movement to an adjacent room without requiring the matching dice symbols, a treasure, rerolling all players' cursed dice, or keeping the die from the shrine as an extra die.&#10;&#10;The dice shrine chambers can be used with any combination of expansions or Queenies.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a pyramid (king), a cube (rook), a cylinder (bishop), a double-pawn (knight) and 44 pawns, and the winner is the player whose pyramid ascends to the fourth (1x1) board.&#10;&#10;The game starts with each player's pyramid, cube, cylinder and 12 pawns arranged on the first (12x12) board; the remaining 32 pawns and the double-pawn start off the board and can be introduced on the owning player's back rank in lieu of a move. A player's piece can ascend to a higher board only when two pawns or one major piece belonging to that player have been captured. Otherwise pieces move approximately as their chess equivalents, although pawns gain the ability to move in more directions when they ascend to smaller boards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tiny Epic Pirates is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of high-seas adventure, utilizing a variable rondel action system and action combo-ing!  In Tiny Epic Pirates you take control of a Pirate ship with the goal of burying vast amounts of wealth on secret island hideaways.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you move your Captain Token around your ship&rsquo;s action wheel (rondel), selecting which action to perform... Plunder, Trade, Crew Up, Attack, or Search. Each player has a randomized and unique arrangement of these actions on their rondel. Sailing your Pirate Ship is something every player can do every time they take an action.&#10;&#10;Plundering allows you to acquire booty from settlements at a very reasonable rate. It&rsquo;s amazing how negotiating changes when your blunderbuss is at the ready. A crate of gunpowder for a promise of no harm? Fair exchange. Trading allows you to sell your ill-gotten goods to the Black Market for gold. Each Market is only interested in a specific good, so make sure you are sailing in the right direction. Timing is everything, sell your good at the wrong time and it&rsquo;s worth a pittance. Crew Up adds a new crew member to your growing Pirate Ship. Crew increases your ship&rsquo;s combat advantage and unlocks new abilities for each spoke of your ship&rsquo;s action wheel, making that action more powerful every time you take it! Attacking Merchant Ships and other Pirates will grow your reputation. It also happens to be a great way to score some gold and more booty to sell. Be enough of a menace and you may just become a Legend of the Sea!&#10;&#10;Search the high-seas for treasures left behind by the unfortunate souls that preceded you. Salvage old ship parts for temporary aid or get lucky and find something worth selling.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered once a player has buried three treasures. To do this, a player must first acquire the amount of gold required to bury at the various bury spots on the map. After all players have had an equal number of turns. The player who has buried three treasures wins the game. Ties are decided by the player who has the highest legendary status, followed by which player has the most gold.&#10;&#10;Includes the Crimson Silver Mini-Expansion.&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
