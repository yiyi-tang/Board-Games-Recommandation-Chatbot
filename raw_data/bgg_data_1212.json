The game is best played with three to five players and is quite a brutal deception game. &#10;The Bad Samaritans are a bunch of outlaws, each of them recruited by The Chimp to join the team and battle each other in a twisted attempt to save the world.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two dice and three decks of cards; characters, spells&amp;powers, and scenarios. The goal of the game is to defeat the scenarios which can be anything ranging from an alien invasion to helping a sexy lady with car trouble or just dealing with overflowing toilets&mdash;beating these, scores you victory points. If you gain enough victory points, you win!&#10;&#10;But be careful, because the other Bad Samaritans won't let you win without a fight. With special powers and spells, they will do anything to thwart your victory. &#10;The cards perform unique actions which can create roulette like situations and death. Yes, in this game, you can actually die! Dying is a big part of the game. When someone dies, they start again with a new character, and they remove their powers&amp;spells.&#10;&#10;The dice in the game get rolled for random occurrences and checks. Sometimes you'll need to throw a dice to survive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "What once was rain has turned to icy sleet, running down your cheeks, the back of your neck. Your hair is wet and sticks to your skin, chilling you further against the late October night. Your feet feel frozen standing in the cold mud of the woods. You know you need to find shelter quickly or you&rsquo;ll certainly die of exposure. Unfortunately, your old clunker of a car broke down miles from the nearest town. Your only hope is to find an isolated farmhouse, barn, or some other building to spend the night and wait out the unexpected storm.&#10;Marching through the woods, you make your way forward, the isolated road vanishing behind you through the thick trees. It feels as if you walk for hours. Your fingers go numb. Your feet burn. Your stomach grumbles for something to eat. Then you see it. Stepping out of the trees into a clearing, you are dwarfed by an enormous building. It looks like it was once a hospital of sorts . . . but now it is abandoned.&#10;Gritting your teeth, you head for the door.&#10;&#10;Welcome to One Page Asylum, a stand-alone &ldquo;one-shot&rdquo; entry in the One Page series of solitaire role-playing games. Perfect for a plane ride, hotel room, or anywhere else. Based on the same system as One Page Dungeon and One Page Cthulhu, this game uses a randomly generated grid map, creating a creepy labyrinth for your lost and intrepid hero to survive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Light artillery can either be foot or horse, while all other weights are foot.&#10;Infantry has line (standard), skirmish, and irregular troop types.&#10;Cavalry has heavy, medium, light, lancer, and irregular troop types. Heavy cavalry can be further designated as being Armored or not.&#10;For each of those troop types you can further classify them by morale: green or untrained, trained, veteran, and elite or guard.&#10;&#10;Commanders are rated only by type and not by morale. &#10;They are the CIC, Generals (commanders of corps, wings, or divisions), Officers (commanders of brigades or regiments), and Staff Officers (aides and staff of CICs and Generals).&#10;&#10;The book gives you rules for all of the major powers, including the Ottomans. &#10;Each nationality has special rules, including formations that their infantry can use. &#10;Russian line fires with one less dice, British with one more, but only at point-blank range; that sort of thing. &#10;There is a point system to cost out the troops in all of their variations. &#10;There is no army lists, per se, and you are expected to research out who had what troop types and so on.&#10;&#10;About Bonaparte covers more than just the Napoleonics period. &#10;There are period rules for the Age of Marlborough, the Seven Years War, the French and Indian War, the American War of Independence, the American Civil War, and the colonial wars.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game simulates Operation Lam Son 719, the ARVN incursion into Laos in 1971. An armored brigade drove up Route 9 from near Khe Sanh and was supported by troops airlifted to six landing zones.&#10;&#10;The map (assembled from four sections) covers the region along Route 9 from the Ho Chi Minh trail in the northwest to some way east of Aloui in the southeast. The scale is approximately 800 yards per hex. There are 369 uncut counters.&#10;&#10;There are 16 three-day turns. The main ARVN objectives are Aloui and Tchepone.&#10;&#10;One feature of the game is the initiative roll beginning each turn, which is weighed by modifiers such as the ARVN body count. Only the side winning the roll gets a combat phase. In addition, if the ARVN wins the roll they get to conduct air strikes, and if the NVA wins they get to conduct an artillery barrage. The air strikes need to be planned and then are affected by weather.&#10;&#10;A wrinkle in the combat system is the use of attack points; the NVA starts the game with 70 and the ARVN with only 40, though the NVA needs to spend theirs for artillery barrages and the air strikes are free.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;A leader is a dealer in hope.&quot;&#10;   &mdash; Napoleon Bonaparte&#10;&#10;Sea levels have risen, causing severe land and resource shortages. Europe has erupted in war, and it's up to you to salvage what is left for your people.&#10;&#10;Dealers in Hope is a deck-building game of conflict. As faction leaders, players vie for control of a future Europe that is a shell of its former glory. Build a deck that matches your faction's play style and take back the continent!&#10;&#10;Each player controls a different faction leader with unique abilities and a unique starting deck. The leader you choose determines how you score victory points to win the game. Regardless, all leaders score a bulk of their points through conquest. On your turn, select an action by placing one of your tokens on the action board. Actions fall into one of three categories: Train (add cards to your deck), Reorganize (manipulate your deck), and Assault (attack territories). Action slots are limited, so it is essential to plan ahead and guess your opponents' moves.&#10;&#10;Dealers in Hope uses several types of cards, with some types, i.e., professional cards, being selected randomly and others coming from the game's preset deck suggestions. Each set of professional cards has three levels &mdash; level 1, level 2, and master &mdash; and you must Train these increasingly powerful cards in order. Battles are fought via back-and-forth card play. Cards contain attack, defense, support, and (often) effects. The attacker plays as many cards as desired from their hand, then the defender gets a single chance to play cards in defense. Finally, the attacker gets one more chance to beat the defender. The winner gains/holds the territory, along with bonuses associated with that territory.&#10;&#10;Unlike many games of this type, Dealers in Hope focuses not only on the military side of warfare, but also on the people behind the scenes: the civilians, masses, etc. who affect and are affected by the campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each figure is given a random number of actions that they can perform in their turn while dealing with the fundamentals of warfare such as command, movement, effects of small arms fire and artillery and the role that morale plays when the stresses of battle commence.&#10;&#10;Numerous examples are included throughout the rule set and several advanced rule sections are also included allowing players to tailor games to their own preferences when using the various scenarios included or when designing their own game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Red Coats and War Hawks rule set also includes the following items to make this rule set a complete package as well as providing the reader with two excellent sources (Knuckleduster Miniatures and Galloping Major Wargames) for gathering their forces:&#10;&#10;     1 Complete Rule Set&#10;     1 Scenario Supplement with 15 War of 1812 Scenarios&#10;         Scenario 1:   The Battle of Brownstown (August 5th, 1812)&#10;         Scenario 2:   Skirmish at the Oakwoods (August 9th, 1812)&#10;         Scenario 3:   The Ogdensburg Skirmish (October 3rd, 1812)&#10;         Scenario 4:   The Convoy Raid (October 27th, 1812)&#10;         Scenario 5:   Gun Emplacement at Red House (November 28th, 1812)&#10;         Scenario 6:   The Bridge at Frenchman&rsquo;s Creek (November 28th, 1812)&#10;         Scenario 7:   First Battle of the River Raisin (January 18th, 1813)&#10;         Scenario 8:   The Battle of Ogdensburg (February 22nd, 1813)&#10;         Scenario 9:   Britain&rsquo;s Allies (Spring 1813)&#10;         Scenario 10: Raid on Frenchtown (April 29th, 1813)&#10;         Scenario 11: Amphibious Assault (May 25th, 1813)&#10;         Scenario 12: Battle of Beaver Dams (June 24th, 1813)&#10;         Scenario 13: Battle of the Thames (October 5th, 1813)&#10;         Scenario 14: Battle of Longwoods (March 5th, 1814)&#10;         Scenario 15: Skirmish at Nanticoke Creek (November 13th, 1814)&#10;    &#10;     1 Reproducible Detailed Game Summary Chart&#10;     2 Clear Artillery Templates (Reproducible)&#10;     6 Reproducible Figure Information Sheets&#10;     400 Figure Cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players who have the most of a given category get to score those cards and all players with identical pair of cards get to score those.&#10;&#10;And that's it!

The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Movement is determined by a number die (1-3) and a color die with the following meanings:&#10;&#10;     white (2x) - forward movement according to the number die,&#10;     black - backward movement at will 1, 2 or 3 spaces,&#10;     blue - sideward movement left or right and another turn,&#10;     red (2x) - Joker (white, black or blue at will)&#10;&#10;&#10;If a pawn gets on the red center space, a command card is drawn. A pawn is captured and transferred to the prisoner camp if an enemy pawn reaches it's exact position.&#10;&#10;Pawns that land on water spaces drown and are removed from the game. But water spaces may be passed. If an enemy pawn land on a hidden mine, it's removed fron the game too. Bunkers are obstacles that can't be landed on or be leaped over.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Esprit de Corps &ndash; Power and Glory is designed to meet the challenge of bringing to life this exiting period of history in the form of fast-moving, exhilarating and true to life games of skill on the table-top, redolent with all the atmosphere, colour and heroism of the battlefields of the times.&#10;&#10;Users of Esprit de Corps and Esprit de Corps A House Divided will be familiar with the general format and content of this rule book and with the rule mechanisms employed. Indeed there is some overlap in the period covered with that covered by Esprit de Corps, and complete overlap with A House Divided which is specifically honed to bring out the historical nuances and characteristics of the American Civil War. That is deliberate and in the latter case unavoidable given the broader canvas which Power and Glory seeks to address. For battles in the Crimea or the Indian Mutiny, for example, you have the choice to use either Esprit de Corps or Power and Glory for your wargames, the outcome will be more or less the same. Later in our period casualty rates increased with the widespread introduction of efficient breech-loading firearms and artillery and more effective machine-guns, and there was a resulting tendency to employ a somewhat more dispersed deployment of troops in the line of battle, all of which are accurately taken into account in these rules. Of course the development of Power and Glory' has benefited enormously from the experience of the authors with the two previous publications in the Esprit de Corps series and with rule books in the parallel Warlord series covering warfare in earlier periods of history.&#10;&#10;Command and control and rapid manoeuvre are at the heart of these rules, just as they are in others in the Esprit de Corps and Warlord series. Though the effect of firepower is awesome, you cannot merely rely on defensive tactics alone for success. So be bold, exploit your chain of command to best advantage, concentrate your troops where it matters most, be aggressive where you can but defend resolutely where you must, and make best use of ground at all times. You can have great fun with these rules and your games will be fast and furious.&#10;&#10;Authentic historical accuracy brings to life the character and atmosphere of combat in the wars of the second half of the 19th Century.&#10;Fast action games at every level in all theatres of war.&#10;Detailed and carefully calibrated troop classification accurately reproducing the characteristics of the units and&#10;soldiers in each and every war world-wide.&#10;Comprehensive coverage of combat formations and weaponry.&#10;Figures based in standard multiples as elements - no need to re-base your troops.&#10;Summary Starter Rules to get you into action fast.&#10;Fully detailed and comprehensive explanation in the Main Rules.&#10;Many worked examples of how the rules operate plus numerous explanatory diagrams.&#10;Complete example battle account - 'Action at El Teb'.&#10;Carefully crafted and entirely internally consistent for speedy action and exciting games.&#10;Essentially simple D6 based rules systems common with others in the Esprit de Corps Series - play one play them all!&#10;Alternate movement facilitates fast play.&#10;Command &amp; control - recreating the difficulties and frustrations of command on the battlefield with a fully functioning chain of command from the C-in-C to the unit CO.&#10;Example army lists and guidelines on how to put together your miniature armies.&#10;Bolt on, fully compatible additional rules in a separate Appendix taking you on into the early 20th Century.&#10;Fast and easy access to all aspects of the rules - cross referenced and indexed throughout.&#10;Playsheets included for hassle-free, rapid manoeuvre and swift combat resolution on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Command and control and rapid manoeuvre are right at the centre of things. As a result there's quite a lot to get to grips with in this rulebook, but don't worry, the rule systems and mechanisms are basically simple and quick to use.&#10;&#10;The rules are all about command and control, the absolute core of the Esprit de Corps system. You have to prompt your troops into action and at times restrain them from recklessly forgetting their orders. It enables the opposing sides to move alternately while retaining the potential for each to outmanoeuvre the other and for tactical surprise on the battlefield. As the action develops you will find more and more demands falling on your generals, drawing on their reserves of command and control. If the latter run out, your army will rapidly disintegrate and suffer defeat. Movement is rapid, each move representing from 10 to 15 minutes of action on the battlefield, and though ranges are significant, there is still plenty of scope for the use of manoeuvre to outplay your opponent, especially if your terrain is thoughtfully designed to accurately recreate that in the real theatre of operations you are depicting.&#10;&#10;The systems for shooting, monitoring morale and determining the outcomes of attacks, melees and pursuits are simple, internally consistent and robust, so that they quick to resolve yet give an outcome which is appropriate and sensitive to the tactical situation, and, importantly, historically authentic. Normal (D6) dice are used for all transactions involving a random element (a die roll) throughout the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This book of scenarios for 1918 has been chiefly designed with the Bloody Picnic rules in mind, although the games could be played with other rules. These battles provide variety.&#10;&#10;While they all involve an attacker and defender, there is plenty of variation on the theme, ranging from a two battalion trench raid up to a divisional attack supported by tanks as well as terrain which includes mountains and river crossings.&#10;&#10;Stormtrooper involves the players all taking the part of the attackers, while The Taking of Montdidier is a mini-campaign which can be played as a board game /scenario generator or just as a board game.&#10;&#10;All the games can be played with variations in the nationalities being used. For example, The Green Fields is described using Germans attacking the British. Actually, during 1918 nearly all the nationalities had opportunities to be both attackers and defenders in the green fields. To this end, army lists for multiple nationalities are provided.&#10;&#10;Some of these scenarios are suitable to be played solo. Included are a few tips for playing the games solo at the end of each scenario.&#10;&#10;Some rules clarification to Bloody Picnic and some specific weapon types have also been addressed in a final chapter.&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;&#10;     Monte Valbella, Battaglia Tre Monti, Italy 28th January 1918 &#10;     Stormtrooper, France 21st March 1918 &#10;     Manchester Hill, France 21st March 1918&#10;     The Green Fields, France March 1918&#10;     The Taking of Montdidier, France 27th March 1918 &#10;     Beaumont Hamel, France 8th June 1918&#10;     Battle of the Piave,Mini Montello, Italy 15th June 1918&#10;     Hamel, The Perfect Battle, France 4th July 1918&#10;     The Rock of the Marne (1), France 15th July 1918&#10;     The Rock of the Marne (2), France 15th July 1918&#10;&#10;&#10;Army Lists:&#10;&#10;     Austro-Hungarian Cavalry Division&#10;     Austro-Hungarian Infantry Division&#10;     British Cavalry Division&#10;     British Infantry Division&#10;     British Tank Units&#10;     French Cavalry Division&#10;     French Infantry Division&#10;     French Tank Units&#10;     German Cavalry Division&#10;     German Cavalry Sch&uuml;tzen Division&#10;     German Infantry Division&#10;     German Tank Units&#10;     Italian Cavalry Division&#10;     Italian Infantry Division&#10;     United States Infantry Division&#10;     United States Tank Units&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash; extracted description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Extremely cumbersome to move, and poorly armored, the Stone Thrower more than makes up for it in offensive power. The Thrower has no upper limit to its range, lobbing boulders over troops and terrain to land where needed.&#10;&#10;The Builders are one of the traditional institutions of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Due to the nature of their institution, these Brothers are adept at repairing buildings as well as constructing siege engines. The Builder Stone Thrower is one of these contraptions, used to guard the Wall from Wildlings and other threats. This expensive piece of equipment is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield and opponents will be foolish if they don&rsquo;t react to their presence on the table.&#10;&#10;Tactical Points&#10;This is a very rules-intensive Unit, take some time to read through it carefully. Some exceptional rules they have are:&#10;They never roll Panic Tests. -They never gain Condition Tokens.&#10;They may only attack once per round, so taking the Combat Zone on the Tactics Board is rarely useful.&#10;Use the Stone Thrower&rsquo;s range to your advantage and force your enemy to take an offensive position.&#10;&#10;Be careful! If an enemy unit is within Long Range of your Stone Thrower Unit, they are not eligible to being hit by your boulders.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;2 Builder Stone Thrower Miniatures on Large Solo Tray&#10;2 Unit Cards&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Also important to the German side is communications; units that are not in communication with their HQ cannot move.&#10;&#10;",

Most units are companies, however generally a battalion moves as a single stack, with the companies basically used for step reduction.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence is somewhat unusual in that after the Germans move and attack, there is a second German move, a Soviet move, and a Soviet attack, but the order these occur in is determined by a die roll.&#10;&#10;Supply is important and the Germans have to move supply units to the front to engage in combat in addition to generally keeping units in supply. They can use pioneers to build minor roads to extend their supply capabilities.&#10;&#10;German reinforcements are subject to some die-rolling to determine where the corps commanders are and what they do.&#10;&#10;There is an eight-turn scenario and a 27-turn campaign game.&#10;&#10;",

There are 355 uncut counters.&#10;&#10;One unusual feature of the system is the turn sequence. The Soviets move, attack, and then move reserve units, after which the Germans move reserve units, the Soviets attack again, and then the Germans move non-reserve units and attack. Units are designated reserve or not at the start of each player's normal movement phase.&#10;&#10;Another unusual feature is the movement system; German units have normal movement allowances but Soviet units do not. On the first turn of the game the Soviet player has movement points to distribute, but after that each unit's movement allowance is determined by the combination of a die roll and its distance from its HQ.&#10;&#10;",

Competition is encouraged through the game&rsquo;s mechanics, allowing players to Sabotage one another in hopes of forcing their opponents to return a portion of their candy to the bowl.  With the game&rsquo;s short duration it is common to play multiple rounds one after another, each time adding a different rule to the game.&#10;&#10;",

There are 244 uncut counters. Units are mostly battalions. Turns are twelve hours.&#10;&#10;Turns follow a sequence of twelve phases including American air attacks, German artillery barrages, standard movement and combat, exploitation, and camouflage. In the latter phase German stacks can attempt to camouflage themselves under certain conditions, which helps protect them from air attacks. Camouflaged units move more slowly and cannot attack.&#10;&#10;The combat system is quite complex with many different types of modifiers and column shifts (terrain, combined arms, different armor types, etc.) and a wide range of possible effects.&#10;&#10;There is a nine-turn campaign game and several shorter scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

The stunning euphoric victory quickly turned into a desperate battle of survival for the Germans as they try to hold their positions that cut-off the Russian 62nd Army. Within days, the Germans were in dire situations by Aug.28th. The Russians quickly massed three tank corps opposite their flank that stretched for 25 miles or more and moved newly formed armies also.

The book also contains specific tables for the weapons used by each army but, thanks to the Summary Tables that are also included, they are easy and fast to use.&#10;&#10;The game also uses a unique and innovative system based on Order Cards to represent simultaneous actions and which will allow you to interrupt or anticipate the enemy&rsquo;s moves. You can recreate battles with an historical background or play through the sort of missions that were common in the Second World War; occupying a town, breaking through enemy lines, taking a bridge, capturing a fuel dump &ndash; these will be your main objectives...&#10;&#10;This game has been translated into four languages and developed after six years of playtests all over the world, and Operation World War Two now represents the new dimension of three-dimensional wargaming, where realism and simplicity have finally found the right balance. A unique experience based on a surprisingly immediate game system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

By taking ourselves through the decision making process we may learn something about those who fight, and perhaps learn to respect those who risk their lives in defence of our own and other cultures.&#10;&#10;Contact! is designed to simulate combat between anything from a couple of people to groups of 100 or more, with armoured vehicles, artillery and the full panoply of war.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. &#10;You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.&#10;K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A market card for each of the six types of artifacts is laid out, with the order of these cards determining their value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you refill your hand and refill your window, then you pick a product that someone has displayed in their window.

Once all players have completed their collections, you reveal fate cards to see which items are worthless, then sum the value of your collection based on the antiques' value on the market.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slam Wars is a card battle game that celebrates the various wrestling territories that existed from the 1940's until the 1990's. It captures the unique flavor of the territory by using historical wrestlers, tag teams, managers, promoters, announcers and referees. Each Slam Wars set is a standalone game, but can be seamlessly integrated with any other Slam Wars set to form a larger playing pool.&#10;&#10;Slam Wars: Wrestling Legends of Florida comes in a 2-piece full-color dual deck poker box and includes a 20-page full-color instruction guide. There are a total of 90 playing cards:&#10;&#10;     44 solo wrestlers&#10;     16 tag teams&#10;     13 stat boosters&#10;     10 common match stipulations &#10;     6 special grudge match stipulations&#10;     1 championship &#10;&#10;&#10;A round of play is called an &quot;event&quot; and consists of 7 matches (4 solo and 3 tag team). Seven match stipulation cards will be exposed, one for each match of the event. Each wrestler and tag team card is rated in 5 different categories (represented by symbols that match the stipulation cards). The objective is to strategically place the cards you were dealt in matches where they can perform the best (i.e. have high ratings). Like a good wrestling booker, you are trying to maximize your wrestler's strengths and minimize their weaknesses. After comparing the stats in that particular category, the card with the higher rating wins the match-up.  Whichever player wins a majority of the 7 matches wins the event and is awarded the championship card. The holder of the championship card has an advantage heading into the next round of play. Much like poker, the rounds can continue until the participants decide to end it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

By tossing casting sticks or coins, a player's pawn must be moved to the opposite end of the track and back home to win. Hindering this effort is the center space, which can only be occupied by one pawn at a time. There is also a push-your-luck aspect to the game, offering players some strategic choices.&#10;&#10;NewVenture Games includes this game in a series of ancient games called &quot;Peg Pastimes.&quot; These games are reproduced with wooden boards and pegs, and include a brief history of each game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slam Wars is a card battle game that celebrates the various wrestling territories that existed from the 1940's until the 1990's. It captures the unique flavor of the territory by using historical wrestlers, tag teams, managers, promoters, announcers and referees. Each Slam Wars set is a standalone game, but can be seamlessly integrated with any other Slam Wars set to form a larger playing pool.&#10;&#10;Slam Wars: Wrestling Legends of Georgia comes in a 2-piece full-color dual deck poker box and includes a 20-page full-color instruction guide. There are a total of 90 playing cards:&#10;&#10;     44 solo wrestlers&#10;     16 tag teams&#10;     13 stat boosters&#10;     10 common match stipulations &#10;     6 special grudge match stipulations&#10;     1 championship &#10;&#10;&#10;A round of play is called an &quot;event&quot; and consists of 7 matches (4 solo and 3 tag team). Seven match stipulation cards will be exposed, one for each match of the event. Each wrestler and tag team card is rated in 5 different categories (represented by symbols that match the stipulation cards). The objective is to strategically place the cards you were dealt in matches where they can perform the best (i.e. have high ratings). Like a good wrestling booker, you are trying to maximize your wrestler's strengths and minimize their weaknesses. After comparing the stats in that particular category, the card with the higher rating wins the match-up.  Whichever player wins a majority of the 7 matches wins the event and is awarded the championship card. The holder of the championship card has an advantage heading into the next round of play. Much like poker, the rounds can continue until the participants decide to end it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to strategically place the cards you were dealt in matches where they can perform the best (i.e. have high ratings). Like a good wrestling booker, you are trying to maximize your wrestler's strengths and minimize their weaknesses. After comparing the stats in that particular category, the card with the higher rating wins the match-up.  Whichever player wins a majority of the 7 matches wins the event and is awarded the championship card. The holder of the championship card has an advantage heading into the next round of play.

The game is named for its use of text-based visuals inspired by the 1967 ASCII character encoding standard.&#10;&#10;The gameplay can be described as &ldquo;roll-and-write&rdquo;. Each civilization's progress in various fields and their production and use of resources are marked on a piece of paper, the Empire sheet. Each turn begins with rolling of five dice. During a brief round of diplomacy, some dice may be rerolled; the players then proceed to use the results to mark their sheets. When any of several possible game end conditions is triggered, points are calculated and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slam Wars is a card battle game that celebrates the various wrestling territories that existed from the 1940's until the 1990's. It captures the unique flavor of the territory by using historical wrestlers, tag teams, managers, promoters, announcers and referees. Each Slam Wars set is a standalone game, but can be seamlessly integrated with any other Slam Wars set to form a larger playing pool.&#10;&#10;Slam Wars: Wrestling Legends of the Northeast comes in a 2-piece full-color dual deck poker box and includes a 20-page full-color instruction guide. There are a total of 90 playing cards:&#10;&#10;     44 solo wrestlers&#10;     16 tag teams&#10;     13 stat boosters&#10;     10 common match stipulations &#10;     6 special grudge match stipulations&#10;     1 championship &#10;&#10;&#10;A round of play is called an &quot;event&quot; and consists of 7 matches (4 solo and 3 tag team). Seven match stipulation cards will be exposed, one for each match of the event. Each wrestler and tag team card is rated in 5 different categories (represented by symbols that match the stipulation cards). The objective is to strategically place the cards you were dealt in matches where they can perform the best (i.e. have high ratings). Like a good wrestling booker, you are trying to maximize your wrestler's strengths and minimize their weaknesses. After comparing the stats in that particular category, the card with the higher rating wins the match-up.  Whichever player wins a majority of the 7 matches wins the event and is awarded the championship card. The holder of the championship card has an advantage heading into the next round of play. Much like poker, the rounds can continue until the participants decide to end it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players try to have the most money at the end of the game. The board has two tracks'. One is a circle track around a spinner which is used to determine how many spaces the player can move. This circular track is used to collect funds.  Once a player has accumulated $300,000, the player can move to a track along all 4 sides of the board.&#10;&#10;This outer track has spaces corresponding to various cities. Players bid in auctions to own a city and be able to build a building in it. Players can also add stories to an existing building. If a player lands on a city space that is owned by another player, the owner must be paid.&#10;&#10;There are also 3 stock market spaces on the outer track. Landing on these spaces enables a player to buy a stock certificates which have a monetary value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
