If they have stars in multiple locations on the card, they add a counter to each of those locations on their playmat, whether or not they have a counter there already from a previous turn, and regardless of whether or not there is a nought or a cross in that location on another card.&#10;&#10;Once every player has a hand of seven cards, the game ends and the players add up their points.

An evil spirit has woken and is threatening to the whole world with an act of revenge. &#10;  You as a player need to save the world. The world counts on you! You must put bricks back on a tomb. Do it first, and you are the winner!!! &#10;  Game is played by 2 &ndash; 6 people, ages 7+. At the start, each player is given 5 playing cards, for which can be acquired bricks from the Brickbank. The bricks have different shapes and correspond to the color of the card. Amount paid for each brick can be the same as the price or higher. If brick is bought for its stated nominal value, a player can make an additional move. If paid by the nominal, it can be bought as many bricks as laying on the Brickbank (not from the treasury storage). After the player&rsquo;s turn is over, every time empty brick spots on the Brickbank must be covered by new bricks.&#10;  First move on the game is given to the player with highest value card. If several players have similar highest cards, they are comparing their next highest cards until someone has an upper hand.  &#10;  On players turn, can be made one of the following:&#10;-    Card drawn from the stock&#10;-    Brick bought from the Brickbank&#10;-    Brick removed /replaced. * if a row is completed, no brick can be removed or replaced.  &#10;  Seems too easy? Not so fast, my friend. Competition is quite hard, and players need to come up with some strategy in order to succeed. Here are some hurdles: &#10;-    Although some bricks stretch up to the next rows, which is acceptable, player cannot build next row without completely bricklaying preceding one.&#10;-    You have laid almost all bricks and now have stuck for some particular piece: don&rsquo;t have necessary currency to buy this exact brick? Think strategy again: maybe you don&rsquo;t need to cover up row too fast before you acquire necessary resources from the Brickbank. You need to be good at reading patterns. &#10;-    First move always starts from the left bottom corner marked with red. Next moves can be done freely, but within the same row until it is filled and ready to move to the upper one.  &#10; Good luck!!!&#10;  Notice: Game is claimed strategic, and it truly is. In order to win, players must plan their movements in advance. The higher up the pyramid player climbs, the fewer choices one has and has to be very careful. Game is well suitable for school children to develop strategic thinking, to learn better geometrical shapes, and learn to count. Game is fun for adults also and is not burdening with the time required- just about 30 minutes to play one round. Quite addictive: lost players want a replay to get the satisfaction.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&ldquo;My God! What will the Country say?&quot;&#10;&#10;-- President A. Lincoln&#10;&#10;The Chancellorsville campaign, which took place in and around Virginia&rsquo;s Wilderness in May 1863, is considered by many to be Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s masterpiece, a true triumph &ldquo;against the odds.&rdquo; Opposing Lee was Union commander Joseph &ldquo;Fighting Joe&rdquo; Hooker, who had devised a plan that seemed assured of success. His cavalry would raid deep behind Confederate lines, cutting Lee&rsquo;s supplies, while Hooker and four of his seven infantry corps would march west, then south, and appear behind the Confederate defenses opposite the city of Fredericksburg.&#10;&#10;Lee would be compelled to withdraw south, in which case he would be pursued, or he would be compelled to attack with his numerically inferior army to avoid being crushed between the hammer and anvil of Hooker&rsquo;s forces. &ldquo;May God have mercy on General Lee, for I will have none,&rdquo; Hooker declared.&#10;&#10;No plan, however, survives first contact with enemy. With the advantage of interior lines and a great deal of audacity Lee would confound his opponent by continually bringing more rifles to the critical place at the critical time. And it didn&rsquo;t&rsquo; hurt that Lee&rsquo;s largest corps was commanded by one &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson. . . .&#10;&#10;Lee&rsquo;s Greatest Victory is an area-impulse game but one unlike anything seen before. Since the appearance of the &ldquo;sunset die roll&rdquo; nearly three decades ago players have alternated activating a single area, with variation coming in the form of an uncertain turn length. Play has a chess-like feel, with players able to act and react with a great deal of prior calculation. Short turns could be frustrating for one or both players. In this revolutionary development of the genre players no longer know how many impulses they, or their opponent, will have, creating both opportunities and crises that cannot be anticipated in advance&mdash;just like real combat. The &ldquo;momentum&rdquo; swings back and forth but rarely the same way twice. At the same time, each turn lasts as long as the players wish it to last, ensuring something will happen every turn.&#10;&#10;Units of maneuver are Union divisions and Confederate brigades for the most part, with historical leaders present to provide a combat boost though at the risk of being wounded or KIA. Pontoon bridges and entrenchments are part of the basic rules while optional rules incorporate weather and optional units for both sides. Best of all, it's just six turns long and very playable in one sitting.&#10;&#10;Content:&#10;&#10;    Map - One full color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet&#10;    Counters - 176 full color 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces&#10;    Rules length - 12 pages&#10;    Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;    Complexity - Medium&#10;    Playing time - Up to 3 hours&#10;    How challenging is it solitaire? - Poor&#10;&#10;&#10;Design - Michael Rinella&#10;Development - Paul Rohrbaugh&#10;Graphics - Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website)&#10;&#10;",

Each shape you match with the dice causes the dice to be removed from the board and the other dice to fall down into their place.&#10;&#10;You start the 1 minute timer. You can use six actions to manipulate the dice to help you line them up and create stacks to generate the shapes. If you run out of time, the dice fall as they are.&#10;&#10;Try to create as many shapes as possible to collect the highest score.  Be careful with your actions because if you leave too many dice on the board, they may start to stack too high and cause you to lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

They must keep socially distanced from one another (two spaces) while moving around the house, avoiding the virus tokens which replicate as the game progresses, and collecting the item tokens needed to make a cure. Each player can carry 10 food tokens (25 for Granny) and these are exchanged for movement and can be restocked from the kitchen but the supply is limited so be careful, if the food supply runs out or someone catches the virus the game is over.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of movement and/or an action (restock food, disinfect spaces, mix cure items or knock down walls to escape the virus). Movement is dictated by the number of food a player wishes and each player has a number of spaces that their character is permitted to move per food.&#10;&#10;After each turn players draw a card from the research deck, this identifies either a new item or new virus in the house or gives the player a powerup to use later (extra moves, search the deck, haz-mat suit for temporary virus immunity). Following a round (one go for each player) all the viruses on the board are moved one space closer to the nearest player. Most viruses appear outside the house and need to break in, giving players time to prepare, but occasionally new viruses appear inside the house and urgent disinfection is required.&#10;&#10;The mechanic for placing viruses involves a D12, with two faces for internal placement and 10 for external. New items from the research deck are placed with a D20 (room selection) and a D6 (space selection). Dice are not involved in player movement or decision outcomes.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either a player runs out of food, a player succumbs to the virus or the parts of the cure are mixed and the cure is completed.&#10;&#10;",

Projects are expensive, so players are encouraged to cooperate to complete them; yet the assymetric player powers mean some projects are more beneficial for some players than others. Therefore players must consider carefully whether to cooperate or not. In addition, each turn players may blind bid for intrigue cards, which provide opportunities to attack other players, disrupt projects they have completed, steal resources or even provide alternative victory conditions. However, players who focus too much on attacking others will not only fail to complete projects that would benefit them, but also risk triggering the shared loss condition. Failing to complete projects comes with a price - increasing the threat of the shared loss condition (known as instability), as the people of Florence become angry that their demands to complete projects are disregarded. If instability rises too far, the players all lose, forcing players to cooperatively complete at least some projects every turn to avoid defeat.&#10;&#10;Player resources and intrigue cards are hidden behind player shields, allowing players to bluff, extort and hide their true strategies. The game rewards careful planning, timing and ruthlessness &ndash; all qualities critical to political success in the cutthroat World of Renaissance Italy&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
