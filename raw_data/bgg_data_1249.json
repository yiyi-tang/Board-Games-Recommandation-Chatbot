    "Description": "Greetings, noble Castellan Ruler to Dicetroy the Castle. As a Castellan, you have many obligations to your family&rsquo;s name - build castles, protect them, earn treasure, and deliver prosperity to your people. You do this by wisely utilizing the resources your subjects provide as well as waging war on your rivals and attacking their castle and accumulating the most treasure to be the mightiest Castlan Ruler of them all!&#10;&#10;Dicetroy the Castle is a dice rolling, matching, stacking, and smashing resource management and dexterity battle game for 2 players.&#10;&#10;BASICS OF PLAY&#10;&#10;Each player selects 1 Castelan Ruler player screen/backsplash and 20 dice of one color. To prepare for the CULTIVATE phase of each round players will set their screen in front of their battle zone.&#10;&#10;CULTIVATE&#10;Flip the 90-second timer (you may choose to play &ldquo;Peasant mode&rdquo; and exclude the timer and have the Cultivate Phase be untimed).&#10;&#10;From behind their Castellan screen, each player rolls all 20 of their six-sided dice at the same time then sorts, allocates, and places dice from dice that have at least one or more matching values. Unmatched dice and dice that you had no use for or dice that did not get placed before time runs out are returned to your dice pool or &quot;Banished&quot;. these are failed farmers and craftsmen who didn't deliver on their promised goods.&#10;&#10;PROSPER&#10;Unveil your kingdom! Lift your Castellan screen and place it behind your castle.&#10;&#10;DECREE!&#10;Certain Castellan abilities trigger and resolve. State these abilities to your Rival.&#10;&#10;PROFIT! &#10;Claim your treasure! Calculate how much treasure you earned and increase your Treasure die accordingly.&#10;&#10;WAGE WAR!&#10;Determine which player will attack first by comparing the combined outcome of your Knight dice then alternate attacking each other until a player runs out of boulders or a player is raided making sure to clear all castle rubble in between attacks. After attacking has ended Fortify by either repositioning or clearing dice inside the Castle Zone, adding them back to your dice pool.&#10;&#10;When Fortifying all layers must be completed before continuing to build on a castle. All Dice but those remaining in the Castle zone and the Treasure die are returned to that player&rsquo;s dice pool.&#10;&#10;For each completed layer of your Castle still standing after the war has ended, earn 1 Treasure. The first player to end a round with 20 Treasure is the lord of the land and the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;THAT IS THE END OF THE AGE! (one round)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You decide to compete in building the chambers of their Majesty&rsquo;s perfect castle. You are driven by one goal: To become the most famous master-builder of all time.&#10;&#10;Everyone is always active. This game has literally no downtime for players. In your turn, you set out to build the castle and increase your fame. You either do this certified using your limited resources or chaotically in an unplanned matter. When not on your turn, you endeavor to bring your adversaries down when they attempt the latter. Use the unique skills of your guild that have been mastered over generations. At any time, everyone is able to force a turn of events to a certain degree with the help of allies who are sprawling in the vicinity of the epic construction site.&#10;&#10;A good memory and reading opponents are as helpful as a good poker face. In this socially interactive bluffing game, you will win if you if you are clever and the wittiest of all - constantly adapted to counter other players' evolving strategies.&#10;&#10;Solo variant: Castleshire's AI is able to bluff and memorize, and also adjusts to how well you catch the AI's bluffs. Additionally, it captures your bluffing behavior and responds to it. Once you start winning against the AI, you can increase the difficulty level, so you will have to think further ahead and anticipate the AI's next moves more accurately.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If your greatest passion is soccer and you don't miss a game of the Royal Blues, then we have just the right thing for 2 players or teams from 6 years of age.

Read the first question out to you one at a time. If only one of you has the correct answer, he receives the card. If both are correct, it continues until one answers the question incorrectly. If both players or teams do not know the answer to the first question or answer all five questions correctly, the cards land in the middle. Now you continue with the next card and if you can answer the question correctly while your opponent is wrong, you will receive the stack of cards from the middle. Whoever has collected three cards wins the first round. In the second round you shuffle the ten cards you have already played, distribute them again among you and play the cards again. If your little head is not only an absolute ace in the header, but was also able to remember most of the first round and collect three cards again, you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Use a six(6)-side die in combination with cards and maps to explore the world and recover artifacts, while gaining experience with their character and increasing various stats. Characters must observe the passage of time for practicing skills and abilities, 1 game hour is equal to 1 real-world minute.&#10;&#10;1 or more players move 1 Hex plot at a time around the World map. If multiple players are working together in a party, 1 member is designated as the dice roller and the person to draw the cards. If entering a dungeon, the designated person draws cards to determine the enemies and rewards within. If entering a town, cards are drawn to determine which quests are available. During gameplay, each player's character can increase the values of certain skills and abilities on their character sheet and they may add or remove party members.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the player(s) decide the game should end.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

During each round of the game, one player challenges the other players with a hypothetical scenario by playing a card from their hand. If the other players would never do it, then whoever played the card gets the point. If somebody (or multiple people) would do it, then they need to explain to the group how on Earth they could justify doing something that ridiculous. Whoever&rsquo;s answer is deemed the best wins the point in that instance.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player scores 10 points...or after everyone erupts into everlasting laughter and judgement of their friends.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is an opportunity to harness the cosmic energy and win the prolonged war between 2 powerful forces: The Virtues and The Sinners.From around the world come the most powerful heroes from both spectrums. They travel to the dangerous shadow realm to claim the power and to keep it from falling into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. Whoever shall claim the millennium gate shall win the war, the Millennium War.&#10;&#10;In the Millennium War, there are two game modes: competitive mode and cooperative mode. In competitive mode, players go head to head while building their strategy by selecting teams of legendary heroes, buying items, preparing passive spells to counterattack, and most importantly planning their actions by managing mana resources and movement across the Millennium Arena. &#10;There are 3 ways to win in competitive mode: eliminate all your opponents' teams of heroes, destroy all your opponents' ancient structures or claim the Millennium Gate by hunting powerful mythical beasts. &#10;Millennium War's competitive mode is inspired by the popular MOBA games but adjusted to be one of a kind as a board game.  You don&rsquo;t win by speed and accuracy, or control of your keyboard, but by how you think and plan your strategy with a combination of choices. Similar to Chess but way more fun. Whether crushing your enemies with extreme power, trapping them with self destruct explosives and sacrificing one of your hero's for a few of theirs, brain controlling enemy hero's or even switching positions, there are endless ways to gain a strategic advantage. Build combos with 35 special Millennium Hero's and their endless combinations of weapons and spells.&#10;In contrast to the swift pace of Competitive mode is the journey to the Millennium world in Cooperative mode, where players must work together to defeat Millennium Bosses. Each Boss presents a unique way of attack and has its own topography that&rsquo;ll require the entire team to solve the puzzle to defeat the powerful Boss.&#10;The game offers countless excitement, it&rsquo;s fun and full of surprises, easy to play and tracks game play because of uniquely designed and patented smart dials, dealer shoes, hero cards and icons. Offering a supporting website featuring hero skills diagrams for easy learning, along with in depth character design inspired by world cultures and game mechanics. The game miniatures are lovingly made with highly detailed craftsmanship by talented artists from around the world. They also magnetically attach to the smart dial.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A common defense strategy in Checkers is to keep a piece on the edge of the board so it can not be jumped. This game is played on an edgeless board - a torus. That means all pieces are equally exposed to capture. The top and the bottom of the game board are considered to be connected, as well as the two sides with each other, forming a donut - or bagel - shaped playing field.&#10;&#10;A secondary effect of playing on a torus is there is no need for Kings. A piece leaving one edge of the board will simply be re-entered at the appropriate space on the other edge.&#10;&#10;Object: Capture all your opponent's Bagels by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves.&#10;&#10;The two sides are known as Plain and Pumpernickel.&#10;&#10;Bagels move one square diagonally forward, but may capture in any of the five non-retreating directions - vertically, diagonally forward, or sideways. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible, taking the maximum number of pieces.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each card features a king, queen or queen consort of Sweden, most of them grouped into royal houses. Sets are collected as singles where applicable, complete houses, or &quot;families&quot; (partial houses). If a family has been collected, remaining cards from that house can be freely collected as &quot;bonus cards&quot; for lesser points, but whichever other conditions apply, a king must be collected along with their consort or consorts. Play continues as in regular Go Fish until the draw deck is empty and all cards have been claimed, at which time points are counted up from singles, houses, families and bonus cards to find the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rock Band Fights Evil is the next game project from Pocket Option Games. In this game, players control a rock band attempting to escape demons from Hell, or the demons tracking down the cheapskates trying to skip out on their deal with the devil. It is a diceless 2-player game played on a hex map, involving movement and strategic placement of playing pieces.&#10;&#10;Rock Band Fights Evil is a simple diceless game, with no luck or chance elements.&#10;&#10;Setup - The Hell player places one demon in each hex that is not a corner (three hexes per map edge). The Rock Band player places the relic in the center of the map. He then places one member of the rock band in each hex adjacent to the relic, so that the band surrounds the relic.&#10;&#10;Goal - The Rock Band player's goal is to move the relic off any map edge. The Hell player's goal is to get past the rock band and destroy the relic.&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence - The Rock Band player chooses one token and moves that rocker any number of hexes in a straight line up to its Move trait. Under most circumstances, rockers cannot enter occupied hexes. After that rocker moves, he may attack. Each token has a unique method of attacking and defeating opponents, e.g. &quot;kill each adjacent demon that has no Hell tokens next to it.&quot; When that rocker's move and attack have been resolved, play proceeds to the Hell player. The Hell player's turn sequence is identical to the Rock Band player's.&#10;&#10;Move: Different pieces have different Move values, so the humans have to stay on their toes. Some people are a little quicker than others. We all had that one kid in school who always ended up on our team, but never could pull his own weight. For most of my childhood, I was that kid. Also, demons tend to be a lot quicker than humans. Life's like that.&#10;&#10;Attack: After a unit moves, it can then Attack. This is a diceless act that depends entirely on the positioning of your unit.&#10;&#10;Win Condition: The rockers are trying to retrieve a relic that they intend to use to free themselves from their contract. I won't ruin the surprise; read the books! Anyway, if the rockers can move the relic off the map, they win! If the demons ever are able to maneuver into a position to destroy the relic, they win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The higher valued card is doubled.&#10;&#10;The highest total takes the trick; the player who takes the trick retrieves an opponent's card played to the trick and leads the next trick.&#10;&#10;After a number of tricks (4 in a 3 or 4 player game; 6 in a 2 player game) players total the cards remaining in their hands. This is their score for the round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round in which any player has scored at least 50 points, the highest score wins. If tied, the tied player with the highest score in the last round wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Dyad plays with a number of variants:&#10;&#10;Cipher - (Usually with 3 or 4 players) A player may choose to cipher prior to the start of a phase. If that player takes 0 points, the player scores 20 points.&#10;&#10;2's - If a player ends the round with a 2 and any other card, the 2 is subtracted from the score, but having a sole 2 at the end of the round scores 20 points.&#10;&#10;Teams - (4 players) Players on a team sit across from one another. Teamed players pass 2 cards to each other prior to the start of the phase. Teams play to score 100 points.&#10;&#10;The game generally includes themed decks where themes include new variants.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "U.S. defense strategists and policymakers have the perennial challenge of developing capstone documents that can coherently articulate and guide how the U.S. Department of Defense will deliver and maintain combat-credible military forces to deter war and provide national security in alignment with national strategy. These forces must be ready to fight and prevail should deterrence fail against a variety of threats in an evolving and uncertain global security environment, and they must be able to do this with acceptable risks &mdash; both in the present against today's threats and in the future against threats that might emerge. Key audiences for these capstone documents include defense planners, programmers, budgeters, managers, analysts, and policymakers who support the development and management of forces that can be postured and employed in alignment with a given defense strategy to accomplish objectives.&#10;&#10;Against this backdrop, RAND researchers developed Hedgemony, a wargame designed to teach U.S. defense professionals how different strategies could affect key planning factors in the trade space at the intersection of force development, force management, force posture, and force employment. The game presents players, representing the United States and its key strategic partners and competitors, with a global situation, competing national incentives, constraints, and objectives; a set of military forces with defined capacities and capabilities; and a pool of periodically renewable resources. The players are asked to outline their strategies and are then challenged to make difficult choices by managing the allocation of resources and forces in alignment with their strategies to accomplish their objectives within resource and time constraints.&#10;&#10;Hedgemony can be played in a modestly sized conference room equipped with a projection screen and a table big enough for the game board and ten to 12 people. Assuming trained players and facilitators are available, a game session of the length necessary to complete a useful number of turns for the session&rsquo;s learning objectives will typically require a half-day or full-day commitment. Detailed lists of required game components and full descriptions of the facilities and setup procedures necessary.&#10;&#10;This is game is considered a governmental roleplaying game to simulate real world dynamics.&#10;&#10;",

Your objective is to defend your fortress at the bottom of the board just long enough for you to put an end to the raids.&#10;&#10;Using 4 colored die each round, the riders path down the mountain and through your village is randomized each turn.  The rider will follow the colored pattern of the die rolled through colored arrows on each of the board spaces.  The result is a snake like path causing destruction as he moves.&#10;&#10;In between Raids, you will have the opportunity to place Viking soldiers and build defensive buildings to stop the Rider before he reaches the bottom.  However, you must also decide how many Vikings to keep in the village to defend it vs how many you want to send searching for the rider's home base to defeat them once and for all.&#10;&#10;The PnP version was originally designed for the 2020 Solitaire PnP Contest by Joe Fontana&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Arctic Race is a family game of tactical racing in polar surroundings. In the game all players sponsor two dog sled teams, and the player whose both teams have reached the North Pole first, wins.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a card showing the two teams that the player sponsors. The players keep their cards hidden, so the players' teams are unknown. Several players can share a single team, but only one player can have a specific combination of two teams. The board is built differently for every game out of big ice floats. Several weather hazards surround the ice track at the beginning of the game, and are moved onto the track during the game. The players are granted godlike abilities in the game, as they are allowed to move the hazards on their turn, as well as any dog sled they wish. If a hazard is ever moved into the same space as a dog sled, the dog sled cannot move before the hazard has been moved away.&#10;&#10;The game is played by rolling two dice: a movement die and a hazard die. The movement die lets the player move a dog sled 1-4 spaces on the board, and sometimes ALSO lets the player place a crack in the ice on the board. Cracks can only be crossed by using ladder cards that the players have three of when the game starts. Without ladders cracks cannot be crossed and players have to go around them. The hazard die usually lets the player move one of three types of hazards, sometimes it allows a free choice of hazards, and sometimes the player can move no hazard at all. All this makes for a very exciting race, and an entertaining 30+ minutes.&#10;&#10;",

Good knowledge of the continent will come in handy, however, there are enough hints that you shouldn't get completely lost even without previous experience.&#10;If you want to learn more about the theme read the Clue card on the first page of the PNP to discover more.&#10;&#10;The expansion contains 2 modules:&#10;&#10;     You can play with the new curse &quot;The Lost Artefact&quot;, alone or alongside any other curses. It is a medium length curse (~10 hours), with multiple parallel objectives.&#10;     You can add the &quot;Book of Idols&quot; card to your game, even when not playing with the new curse, in the same way, you would add the &quot;Pocket Watch&quot; from the &quot;Path Of Repentance&quot; expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;General features:&#10;&#10;     Compatible with all editions of the base game and all the official expansions.&#10;     No cards from this expansion are ever shuffled with the original cards (so you don't have to worry about matching backs etc.). There is no new Curse card included, for this very reason.&#10;     The Blue Adventure cards form their own deck with green and golden numbered cards the only difference is that their &quot;numbox&quot; is blue.&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     1 Rules card&#10;     1 Clue card for the new curse of &quot;The Lost Artefact&quot;&#10;     1 &quot;Book of Idols&quot; card&#10;     90 Blue Adventure Cards, forming the separate Blue Adventure Deck&#10;     You can also print your own 000 and 100 blue dividers&#10;&#10;&#10;",

To do so, you need to place fireworks cards on your side of the river to complete your program cards while attempting to earn the applause of each &quot;yakatabune&quot; &mdash; that is, &quot;houseboat&quot; &mdash; card by having a majority in that column.&#10;&#10;In more detail, to set up lay out the seven yakatabune cards in a row; place three starter fireworks (value 1) on the starting player's side of the board and four starters on the other side in alternating columns. You start with two cards in hand from your deck of 13 cards, and you choose two program cards from the three you're dealt.&#10;&#10;On a turn, play a fireworks card on your side of the board in the closest empty space next to a yakatabune on your choice. Your opponent may then use the effect of that fireworks card &mdash; swapping two cards, shifting a card to an adjacent space, or flipping a card &mdash; on either their cards, your cards, or the yakatabune, depending on the icons depicted on the associated yakatabune. Alternatively, your opponent may decline to use the effect and instead draw a program card.&#10;&#10;After you play a card, if you have a program card in hand that matches the pattern of fireworks on your side of the board, you can play that card, take the bonus actions on it to shift one or more of your cards, then play another program card if you now have that pattern.&#10;&#10;Next, if the number of cards surrounding a yakatabune equals or exceeds that boat's limit, you sum the fireworks on each side to see who has captured the awe of the viewers on that boat. Mark this boat with an applause token, then turn all of the winning player's fireworks face down. (Face-down cards can still be used to complete many pattern cards.) End your turn by drawing a fireworks card from your deck.&#10;&#10;When the game ends after five applause tokens have been placed or the fireworks or program cards run out, players tally their collected awe to see who wins.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;YAKATABUNE&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;2&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#184;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#179;&#168;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#132;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#184;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#143;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#10;&#229;&#177;&#139;&#229;&#189;&#162;&#232;&#136;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bob&rsquo;s Your Uncle is an Australian themed version of the popular game Time&rsquo;s Up! It is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds.&#10;&#10;In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;",
