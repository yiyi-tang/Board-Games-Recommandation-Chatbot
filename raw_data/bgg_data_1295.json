    "Description": "Have you ever asked yourself why the washed clothes in the washing machine still have stains?&#10;Maybe the detergent is not good enough, or the washing machine doesn't work perfectly.&#10; However, in this game, you would face a completely different story!&#10; You would encounter the stains which are alive and try to live. The stains are trying to increase by moving from one cloth to another. They have to compete with each other while trying to fight the washing machine and its washing order. In this story, each time the washing machine starts to rotate, the stains also create a competition to make a higher impact on the clothes. However, sometimes the washing machine and its detergent succeeds and can stop the stains.&#10;you play as a stain and your aim is to try to occupy more space in the washing machine and heavily penetrate into the clothes.&#10;In this game there are a series of rounds that is played in two phases:&#10;&#10;     Players phase (Stains Phase)# Washing machine phase&#10;&#10;&#10;in phase one players can do one of these actions: &#10;&#10;     importing a stain on clothes&#10;     moving existing stains on  clothes&#10;     play an Enzyme card&#10;&#10;&#10;and in phase two, one of the players roll the dice as the washing machine.&#10;&#10;Besides competing with each other, each player should resist the washing machine and its tendency to clean the clothes. At the end of the game, each player who has more stains on clothes will win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There were to have been four ships of the Richelieu-class, with the first two laid down in 1935 and the second pair following in 1935. &#10;Gascogne was cancelled and Clemenceau never completed. The last ship followed a modified design which placed one of the turrets aft of the superstructure &ndash; the original design had both main armament turrets forward, much like the Dunkerque-class. &#10;Designed as a counter to the powerful Italian battleships being built, the Richelieu was protected against 15-inch shells and mounted eight 15-inch guns of its own, on what started as a 35,000-ton hull. Neither ship of the class was quite finished at the time of the French surrender.&#10;&#10;Richelieu, which was almost complete, escaped to Dakar in order to keep here under French control. She came under repeated British attacks that were intended to compel the battleship to join the Free French Naval forces or sink her, thus denying the Axis opportunity to deploy the Richelieu for their own means. &#10;In 1942 she eventually, joined the Allied cause and, after a refit in the USA, was deployed to the Far East to serve with the British fleet for operations against the Japanese - although present at the Battle of the Malacca Strait, she was too far away to directly engage the enemy vessels.&#10;&#10;She was part of the force that liberated Singapore in the aftermath of the Japanese surrender in 1945 and later operated in French Indochina before being recalled to France in December 1945. &#10;She saw training duty on and off active-service for the remainder of her existence, eventually being sold for scrap in 1968.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

She had a range of 10,000 miles, could sail for 90 days and was equipped with a Besson MN-411 floatplane in a hanger aft of the tower to scout for victims and spot for her main battery.&#10;&#10;Her torpedo outfit included four forward internal tubes, a quad trainable mount aft and a second quad trainable mount aft equipped with lightweight torpedoes. She even had a prison hold for up to 40 captives. However, the most striking aspect of her design was the inclusion of a special, watertight turret forward of the tower which carried two eight-inch naval guns.&#10;&#10;Surcouf was a very complex design, plagued with mechanical troubles. She was difficult, slow to dive and rolled badly on the surface in rough seas. She was also so low to the horizon that the effective range of her 8-inch guns was greatly reduced. When war broke out, Surcouf was in the French Antilles and by the time she returned to Brest was in need of repairs. When France fell, Surcouf escaped to England, where she was seized by British sailors. She was subsequently turned over to the Free French who regarded her with pride while the British Admiralty considered her, perhaps unfairly, something of a joke.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with nine hexagon tiles that are half light and half dark, and one tile starts in the center of the playing area.

If all the tiles have been placed without someone winning instantly, whoever has the largest block of color wins, with ties being broken in favor of the starting player.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;2&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#133;&#173;&#232;&#167;&#146;&#229;&#189;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#155;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#133;&#173;&#232;&#167;&#146;&#229;&#189;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#169;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#230;&#179;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#176;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#189;&#177;&#233;&#159;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#163;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#228;&#189;&#149;&#229;&#186;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#165;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary (Japanese)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After defeating the Austrians at Ulm and occupying Vienna, Napoleon&rsquo;s first campaign as Emperor should have been over. The Russians then declared war, joining the remaining Austrian forces. As winter approached, the long, tenuous French supply lines through enemy territory began to crumble. Worse yet, the Prussians were forming on the border, threatening to join the coalition. Napoleon needed a victory now!&#10;&#10;A master of deception, he lured the Allies into attacking by thinking he was much weaker than he really was. As the Allies attacked his right, their center became dangerously weak. As Napoleon ordered his decisive counter attack on the Pratzen Heights he stated, &ldquo;One sharp blow and the war is over.&rdquo; It was. Austerlitz became Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory.&#10;The true French Order of Battle is unknown. The Allies must attack forcefully to capitalize on French weakness. If they run into strength, they must be able to quickly transition to a secure defense. &#10; Beautiful large map. More blocks than Marengo but less than Waterloo. This hits the sweet spot.&#10;Tons of replayability. Yes, you can do what Napoleon did. This game opens things up to the many other possibilities. Craft your own brilliant plan of deception to defeat the Allies. There are many ways to approach this battle from both sides.&#10;&#10;It is always fun to be Napoleon in a game but this game also presents a very interesting problem to the Allied player. There are many ways for the Allies to approach this battle. This game lets you explore and try them out.   &#10;The unknown OB also works great for solitaire play!&#10;&#10;",

The person to the left of the dealer leads out by playing one card of any color and play goes clockwise with each player playing one card per turn.  Players must &ldquo;follow suit&rdquo; by playing a card of the same color that was led out.  If they are out of the color that was led, they can play any color including the trump color.  The player that wins the trick takes the cards played (they are set aside to indicate a trick won) and then leads out for the next round of play.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to score the highest number of points. If a player's bid is made exactly (not under or over) add amount bid plus 5 points. If bid is not made, subtract amount bid or the number of tricks taken &ndash; whichever is the greater number. This game is easy to play, but becomes very difficult to accurately predict the number of tricks that will actually be taken.  The game ends with a special round where each player is dealt one card and each player shows every other player their card by putting it on their forehead (without looking at it).  Bids are made and the cards are laid on the table to see who takes the trick.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

God is with Israel in the pillars of cloud and fire. God helps his people to reach the destination by giving manna from Heaven and water from the rock. Sometimes stubborn people stir up the wrath of God and they have to sacrifice sin offerings in order to reconcile their deeds and get blessings. God rewards the obedience of people by letting them carry the Ark of the Covenant. The winner is the one who reaches the goal and offers first a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving.&#10;&#10;The players will advance in pre-determined path in the game by throwing a dice and will have to keep their moral points above 2 by getting maximum of one for free or paying three/five silver coins. The players can also bog each other down by bribing the enemy causing the other to pay to progress or get slowed down. Leading the race after Mount of Sinai is also important, the leader will have the Ark of the Covenant giving him the choice to make additional step.&#10;&#10;",

Adding colors to each card allows for more interesting combinations (like having all eight gems in hand).  Another difference is that (2) 6-sided dice are used at the beginning of each hand to establish the &quot;Knock number&quot;, and also the &quot;Diamond number&quot; for a special meld called &quot;Queen's Diamonds&quot;.&#10;&#10;The object is to get your hand down to a few points of Deadwood by getting Melds.&#10;&#10;There are 3 phases to each hand: 1) DEAL &amp; ROLL; 2) CARD PLAY; 3) SHOWDOWN &amp; SCORING. &#10; Cards in Melds and Lay-offs will not score for your opponent, but have no inherent point values themselves.  Cards not in Melds or Lay-offs are called Deadwood and might add points to your opponent&rsquo;s score.&#10;&#10;There are 4 different Melds available: Sets, Runs, Stashes, and Queen&rsquo;s Diamonds (the latter two are new). &#10;&#10;     SET: At least 3 cards of the same rank (i.e., 5, 5, 5).&#10;     RUN: At least 3 consecutive cards in the same suit (i.e., 6, 7, 8, all clubs).&#10;     STASH: At least 4 cards of the same gem color (i.e., 4 Emeralds). &#10;     QUEEN&rsquo;S DIAMONDS:  Any Queen + one designated Diamond card that is determined by the initial roll number on the dice.  Both dice are rolled to find one number (i.e., 3 and 4 = 7, indicating 7 of Diamonds is the card). An &ldquo;11&rdquo; or &ldquo;12&rdquo; indicates JACK of DIAMONDS. &#10;&#10;&#10;Also, &quot;Gem Parts&quot; is a bonus players can earn by having all 8 gems at the end of a hand.&#10;&#10;A new minimum score rule keeps the game moving along nicely.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Battle of the Hexes, players will take part in a war of spell cards. They play as mages with a set of spells they choose from, who do battle to the death. There are different types of magic as well as different types of spells; and the player must carefully select their strategy and spells to defeat their opponent.&#10;&#10;Players must each build a hand of 15 cards, by drawing by turn from a draft of cards. These cards can then be played on different lanes, damaging only what is in their path unless stated otherwise on the card. If no other card is in their respective lane, damage from the cards goes directly to the opposing player&rsquo;s health. Once a player loses all their health, they lose the game.&#10;&#10;General Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Gameplay occurs over several stages. Players keep track of whose turn it is through the turn indicator card. They must simply flip it when their turn ends.&#10;&#10;Draw Stage:&#10;&#10;During the draw stage: All cards sets should be shuffled first. Determine a starting player, that player is dealt the &ldquo;Destruction Spells&rdquo; set of cards. Then they will choose one to keep for their hand, and pass the rest of the cards to the opposing player, who will then choose one of their own, and return it to the starting player again. That process should repeat itself until each player has a maximum of 5 cards of that particular set. Any remaining cards should be placed aside for later use in the game. Afterwards, that same process is repeated with the &ldquo;Summoning Spells&rdquo; set of cards, followed by the &ldquo;Alteration Spells&rdquo; set of cards.&#10;&#10;Play Stage:&#10;&#10;This stage is where players play the cards they have chosen during the Draw Stage. The starting player from the previous stage starts here. During this stage, players get to use their 6 stamina points to play cards they have in their hand. Each card requires a certain amount of stamina points to be played. Any unused stamina points at the end of this stage cannot be used as extra in the next round. For the first round only: once the player has played all the cards they want, it is then the opposing player&rsquo;s turn to play their cards in the same manner. Each card type must be placed in the correct area of the battlefield sheet according to their respective type symbols. &ldquo;Destruction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alteration&rdquo; cards must remain face down until the Battle Stage starts. Players may stack up as many of these cards in one lane as they want, but only one &ldquo;Summoning&rdquo; card is allowed in one lane at a time. Players may draw cards from any of the draw decks at any time during this stage, but it will cost them 1 stamina point.&#10;&#10;Battle Stage:&#10;&#10;During this stage, the player who played their cards last gets to attack first. The players&rsquo; cards will deal damage to the opposing player&rsquo;s cards only on their respective lanes unless stated - otherwise on the card - and according to their damage points on the card. Damage is done to both sides simultaneously. Cards that belong to the same spell class deal only half damage to each other. Any card that loses all its HP points must be discarded. All discarded cards are returned to their respective draw deck, placed at the bottom of each. If the opposing player&rsquo;s lane is empty, then damage would go directly to that player&rsquo;s own HP. Players keep track of how much damage each card is dealt through the red health pieces. One red health piece means the card lost one HP, and so on. Players keep track of their own health through the counters.&#10;&#10;Following this stage it is back to the play stage for the opposing player. Whenever players run out of cards, each draw deck is taken and reshuffled, and the players draft cards between each other in another Draw Stage.&#10;&#10;",

We hope this game can bring some mystery and excitement to your game nights, and maybe even create some believers.&#10;&#10;What makes Finding Sasquatch unique?&#10;&#10;Gameplay depth: There are unique strategy elements around determining how and where to find Sasquatch and players must be strategic about how they influence Sasquatch's location, what information they share with other players, and what information they keep for themselves.&#10;&#10;Caters to broad audience: The game has multiple layers of strategy and complexity, making it great for everyone from newbies to hardcore gamers. Play it for family game night, with your gaming group, or just 1 on 1 with your bestie.&#10;&#10;Beautiful artwork and high quality cards: To fully capture the Sasquatch theme we focused on getting the artwork, graphic design, and physical features just right.

Each card is given a number of cubes that are placed on said card, these cubes serve as health, for example, kings have 6 health cubes, Queens have 5, Jacks have 4, and all other cards have 3. Each round, players have to place 1 or 2 cards of their choosing in their &ldquo;card placing section&rdquo;. Each time a player does this, they lose a piece of &ldquo;health&rdquo; on each of their placed cards (marked by moving the cube to resemble that its value has decreased by 1, ex: moving 6 to 5). After every turn, each player has to give one of their cards to the player in the clockwise direction. Once a card&rsquo;s health reaches 0, the card is flipped over to show that it can&rsquo;t be used anymore, it is then placed in the middle along with its health cube. Once a player&rsquo;s entire deck is obsolete/can&rsquo;t be used anymore, they&rsquo;re out, and the last card standing wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fyra is a card game about matching and stacking meant for 1-4 players who have, at a minimum, the ability to differentiate colors or printed patterns. You take turns matching up your cards with the ones already on the play field. The cards overlap but you must match the colors of at least one of the corners. If you can't find a spot for your cards, you get to place one next to the other cards, but have to take two replacements. Alternately, if you find a spot where you can match all four corners you don't have to take any replacement cards and get one step closer to going out.&#10;&#10;The real fun comes in when you choose a team color and try to make sure as few of those squares are showing by the time you go out. Make alliances to spread one player's color all over the field and make their score worse while setting up spots where you can match up all your own corners the next time your turn comes around. There are 2 goals: be the first to get rid of all your cards and second, have the fewest squares of your color on the play field when you do.&#10;&#10;You can also play a solo game trying to make the smallest pile of cards based on randomly selected hands of cards. A game with 4 players should last around 5 to 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Archmage Teclis leads his Lumineth hosts against the Great Necromancer in a battle to save the realms. Nagash has brought a ghastly era of hauntings upon the Mortal Realms, for the power of death is on the ascendant. Only now, when the hour is darkest, does the light of the Lumineth shine forth. Teclis, aelven god of magic, leaves his beloved dominion of Hysh to make war upon the Ossiarch Empire &ndash; but in doing so triggers a counter-attack that may see his sovereign lands destroyed. Who will win this ultimate duel of arcane might?&#10;&#10;The next engrossing instalment in the Broken Realms saga moves from Morathi to Archmage Teclis and his Lumineth Realm-lords as they launch a risky venture against the Great Necromancer. The unravelling story will have massive consequences for several factions including the Lumineth Realm-lords, Maggotkin of Nurgle, and forces of Death &ndash; once again shifting the balance of power in the Mortal Realms. You&rsquo;ll find fresh ways to play your games of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, alongside rules for new units, warscroll battalions, and more.&#10;&#10;Inside this 152-page hardback book, you&rsquo;ll find:&#10;-The thrilling tale of the Lumineth Realm-lords&rsquo; perilous campaign against the entrenched legions of Death &ndash; illustrated with stunning new art.&#10;- New rules for the Lumineth Realm-lords, including a bevy of units from the Hurakan Temple. This book includes the full set of rules and background for every newly-released unit, so can be used alongside the first edition of Battletome: Lumineth Realm-lords.&#10;- Allegiance abilities for the Cities of Sigmar and Lumineth Realm-lords, representing Xintil, a Free City in Hysh, as well as the Great Nations of Alumnia and Helon.&#10;- Rules for Streets of Death &ndash; battles in the tight confines of cities across the Mortal Realms.&#10;- Six battleplans and Realms of Battle rules to help you recreate the events and locations from the story.&#10;- A suite of warscroll battalions and rules to enhance your Cities of Sigmar, Maggotkin of Nurgle, Lumineth Realm-lords, Flesh-eater Courts, and Ossiarch Bonereapers.&#10;&#10;Important Note:&#10;If you already own a copy of the original Lumineth Realm-lords battletome, Broken Realms: Teclis gives you everything you need to fully update your Lumineth Realm-lords army, in addition to the groundbreaking new lore and artwork. The updated Battletome: Lumineth Realm-lords simply includes the Lumineth content from this book, which makes it a handy compilation if you prefer to keep it all together.&#10;&#10;",
