Togan on the other hand revels in the chaos inherent in the energy that binds the universe together. Cursed with insatiable curiosity and gifted with his races&rsquo; naturally long life span, there are few Codifiers in existence who can match his mastery of the Doctrines. Unfortunately, Togan&rsquo;s curiosity also leads him to become the source of an uncommon amount of mischief. He is banned from as many planets, stations, and ships as any corsair. Many husbands and fathers would like nothing more than to see Togan clasped in irons (or worse) due to his scandalous behavior. Cecilia, his personal Doctrine scribe, follows in his wake desperately trying to make amends and keep the catastrophes contained to disasters.&#10;&#10;Codifier Togan and Cecilia are two multi-part pewter miniatures provided with a single 50mm premium base. Models are unpainted and require assembly.&#10;&#10;",

The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...&#10;&#10;As stretch goals to the Kickstarter campaign, four Leader Boxes were available as expansions to the base game.  Each Leader box contained everything from the Follower box, plus the Pioneers of New Earth module, the Exosuit miniatures -- all in an exclusive box sleeve based on a chosen Path affiliation.  The four Path affiliations were:  Path of Dominance, Path of Progress, Path of Salvation, and Path of Harmony.&#10;&#10;",

Inmates are moved by rolling 6 dice, and spending each die to move an Inmate to an adjacent square with a matching number.&#10;&#10;During the Guards Move, 1 die is rolled for each guard and the guard moves along their marked patrol path to the next square with the same number. If a Guard crosses or enters a square that an Inmate has previously passed through, they leave their patrol path and begin following the path left by the Inmate. If the Guard catches up to the Inmate before they are able to escape, they are captured.&#10;&#10;The game ends when: 1) 4 inmates successfully escape; 2) 3 inmates get captured; or 3) you run out of time at the end of the 15th round.&#10;&#10;",

While the game has some similarities to his MORE AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDES, important differences in scale and emphasis result in a unique experience that's specific to the factors that doomed the Union's 1864 Red River Campaign.&#10;&#10;Each side has three Leaders whose presence is generally required to launch an attack, but there the similarities end. The Union army is larger but also more cumbersome, being dependent on slow-moving and vulnerable supply trains. A rigid leadership structure makes coordination difficult, and one of those leaders is going to sit on his hands in Alexandria for the first third of the game instead of advancing toward the Union objective: Shreveport.&#10;&#10;The Confederates have less strength points to throw around, but they have a much more flexible command structure, and don't have to worry about their own supply. Slowing the Union advance (not that they need much help) and launching well-chosen attacks, supported by well-timed Special Events cards, is key for the beleaguered butternuts.&#10;&#10;Within these parameters, there's ample room for players to experiment, with multiple ways to approach your objectives (and to frustrate your opponent's). There's only a handful of units on each side, but plenty of hexes to maneuver in. It's a challenging game, while remaining short enough to play in a single evening, and simple enough to serve as an excellent introduction to operational scale gaming.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card bidding and building game for 2-4+ players themed around the Belize Mayan ruins of Altun Ha, occupied and built up between 200 BC and 900 AD before it was abandoned, probably due to a combination of overpopulation, drought, famine, social unrest, and civil war.&#10;&#10;The players share a common deck comprising three types of cards: Bid Cards (also used for building), Trade Cards and Maya God Cards (wild cards).  Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards.&#10;&#10;The calendar token is used to keep track of turn order within a round. It is assigned randomly at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Each Round is divided into 8 Phases: &#10;1.   Calendar Phase - the player with the calendar token passes it to the player to his right. &#10;2.   Population Phase - the population level increases by 1 (it starts at level 2).  &#10;3.   Draw Phase - each player is dealt 2 cards from the deck. &#10;4.   Trade Phase - staring with the player with the calendar token, each player may play one trade card from his hand. Trade cards allow players to draw extra cards, look at opponent&rsquo;s hands, cause opponents to lose scoring points etc.&#10;5.   Bid Phase - all players must bid zero to two bid cards from their hands. Bidding is simultaneous with players revealing their bid cards at the same time. The player with the highest value bid wins the bid and becomes the Priest King. &#10;6.   Farm Phase - the Priest King must discard 1 or 2 Bid cards with a combined value equalling or exceeding the current population level. If unable to do so, the game ends immediately and the current Priest King loses 13 scoring points. &#10;7.   Build Phase - The Priest King may play up to 2 bid cards as build cards.  A card of value 1 is placed by itself face-up in the middle of the table and is considered the first stage of a new temple. Higher level bid cards can be added onto already existing temples.  They are placed staggered on the top of a temple with a level 1 less than the card being placed. (i.e. a level 2 card is placed on top of a level 1 card; or a level 6 card is placed on top of a level 5 card). The Priest King gains scoring points equal to the value of the cards he places. If unable to build, he loses 7 scoring points. &#10;8.   Cycle Phase &ndash; maximum hand is 5 cards - players discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately in any turn in which the Priest King is unable to feed his people in Farm Phase. The player with the most scoring points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Within each region are 3-5 cities which are connected to each other.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck comprising 5 types of cards: Destination Cards, Room Cards, Mess Cards, Crew Member Cards and Souvenir Cards. The Room cards are further divided into 3 types: Food Cards, Sleep Cards and Play Cards.  Players start with a hand of 7 cards.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 7 Phases:&#10;&#10;Itinerary Phase&#10;-   Draw 1 card from the deck and put it in your hand.&#10;&#10;Investment Phase&#10;-   You may reduce your Cruise Point score by 1 to draw an extra card. &#10;-   You may then reduce your Cruise Point score by another 2 to draw a second extra card. (total 3 points)&#10;-   You may then reduce your Cruise Point score by another 3 to draw a third extra card. (total 6 points)&#10;&#10;Business Phase&#10;-   Players may trade cards and Cruise Points with each other.&#10;&#10;Launch Phase&#10;-   You may launch a new cruise ship. To do this you must play 7 cards from your hands. 6 cards must be Room cards (2 Sleep cards, 2 Play cards, 2 Food cards)&#10;The seventh card is a city card; the location where the ship will start from. &#10;-   Start a Ship Log for the new ship and select a ship token.  On the log record the identity number of the ship token and, ownership of the ship, its home port (starting location) and its value (based on the total value of the room cards played (each room has a value of 1 or 2)&#10;-   Discard all 7 cards at the end of the phase a ship is launched.&#10;&#10;Sail Phase&#10;-   You may move each of your ships on the map. Each of your ships may move once on your turn in this phase. Ships move 4 ways: &#10;&bull;   Region to adjacent Region (as allowed on the Region connectivity list) &#10;&bull;   Region to City within that Region. &#10;&bull;   City to Region that city is in. &#10;&bull;   City to city within a Region (all cities within a region are connected)&#10;&#10;Destination Phase&#10;-   If you have one of your ships at a city, you may play a matching Destination card. &#10;For example: Your ship is at Cuba on the Map and you play the Cuba card.  You score Cruise Points for arriving at a destination - gain 2D6 Cruise Points and add the value of your ship to get the base number of cruise points earned. &#10;-   Next, each other player may play one or more Mess cards from their hands against you. You may play crew member cards from your hand to negate Mess cards on a one to one basis. For each Mess card not negated, you earn 1 less Cruise Point. &#10;-   You may play 1 or more Souvenir cards. Gain 1 Cruise Point for each such card played.  &#10;-   Record on the Ships Log the destination (City) you arrived at and the number of Cruise points you scored. &#10;-   Discard all cards played.&#10;&#10;Port Phase&#10;-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when players have gone through the deck 3 times and a turn starts and there are no cards left to draw. Scoring is then conducted.&#10;&#10;The Ship that visits the most Cities gets 25 Cruise Points.&#10;The Ship that visits the most Regions gets 25 Cruise Points.&#10;A Ship that visits a city no other ship has visited gets 10 Cruise Points for each such city. &#10;When a ship visits all the cities in a single region, this is called a Hat Trick. A Ship gets 10 Cruise Points for every Hat Trick it Makes.&#10;&#10;The player with the most Cruise Points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Even though the game has the same number of pieces that there is in Chess (32), there is a slightly greater variety of them in BrazChess (8 against 6 in Chess). Some of the &quot;parachuting&quot; that occurs in Shogi is present (regarding the movement of Grand Dukes - a promoted Pawn); you'll also find different forms of capturing (suicidal attacks and the Grand Duke's Zone of Control). Also present is the concept of passing your turn.&#10;&#10;What you need to play it:&#10;In order to play BrazChess, you will need:&#10;A) The rules (see Files);&#10;B) A Modern Chess board (8x8) and Pieces (you'll need to either paint the heads or bases of two Pawns from each side, or use some other Pieces to represent the 2 Lords from each side). Note that the starting position of some pieces (like the Rooks) is different than in regular Chess;&#10;C) 6 different pieces, coins, tokens or even checkers pieces (for the promoted Pawns aka Grand Dukes);&#10;D) 1 tokens to represent Passing; &#10;E) An auxiliary board (the Duchy) or a designated space on the table.&#10;&#10;The creation of this game was inspired by Chatranj, Modern Chatranj, Makruk, Shogi, Chess/Orthochess (FIDE Chess) and the book &quot;Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot; - by D. B. Pritchard. While it is true that there are several Chess-like games like this in the World, Chess is, itself, a variant of an older game, that was already a variant of an even older game. BrazChess, while definitely a member of the Chess family of games, has many unique features that will certainly deliver a different experience than the other games of its kind.&#10;&#10;",

Each rebel deals 1 to 3 damage when a specific number (1 through 6) is rolled. To defeat the monster, they must deal damage greater than or equal to the monster's health. If successful, the guild gains reputation and victory points.&#10;&#10;The game board displays the monsters and contains 5 face up cards that the players may acquire. Cards come in two categories - rebels and artifacts. Each turn the players can use their reputation to buy one of these cards, and then replace the empty card slot with the top card of the deck.&#10;&#10;Their are two ways for the game to end, so players must strategize toward one (or both) of the goals. First, a guild can select to attack the mighty overlord (who has 12 health) on their turn. If they defeat him, they win the game. Alternatively if the victory point pool is depleted before the overlord is defeated, the player with the most points is the winner. The game is setup with an amount of victory points equal to 10x the amount of players in the game. Points are obtained by defeating monsters, by acquiring cards, and through various card abilities. This two-goal setup creates tension between the players, with some building heavy damage in an attempt to take down The Overlord before the others take the final victory point.&#10;&#10;",

The Cult Cards are meant to be supplemental powers for your Cults during the game.&#10;&#10;During set-up, all players must agree to use the Cult Cards.

This ability does not have to be activated by The Ceremony like an Elder God&rsquo;s Dark Gift.&#10;&#10;[...] We also recommend that you do not include Cult Cards or the Beasts From Beyond expansion in your first games of Fate of the Elder Gods.

The first player to empty his or her hand without being eliminated is the winner.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he can either pass or play some cards. If he passes, he does nothing: it is simply the next player's turn. If he chooses to play, he lays down one or more cards and announces a number, which is seven or lower. For example, if he announces &quot;six&quot; and plays 3 cards face down, he is claiming that those 3 cards are all number &quot;six&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;If no one challenges, it is the next player's turn. The next player has to either pass or play some cards, just like the previous player, but he must announce a lower number than what the previous player claimed.&#10;&#10;If someone decides to challenge (&quot;Peep&quot;), she opens the cards played by the current player. If the challenge fails (i.e., the challenged player was honest), the challenger should take all the cards played so far. If the challenge succeeds, the challenged player should take all the cards played so far (or will be eliminated from the game immediately if there is any Lady Godiva card among the played cards).&#10;&#10;Play continues in this manner until there is a single winner.&#10;&#10;",

The great doors open reluctantly then slam shut with a boom once the group is inside. A lock clicks into place locking the group in the darkness. The Torch Carriers light up their torches and shoulder their packs. The heroes quickly scan the entry and seeing nothing threatening sheath their weapons and stride toward the single arched doorway on the opposite side of the room. At the midpoint of the room the floor begins to glow as inscribed runes and markings fade into view. With a soundless flash the heroes are vaporized leaving behind a small cloud of cinders drifting through the air like dying fireflies.&#10;&#10;Once the Torch Carriers get past the stunned silence of their hero's&rsquo; demise, they decide to complete the task set before the heroes, find the dungeon exit and return home!&#10;&#10;You play the part of the Torch Carriers. Unlike most dungeon crawlers, your character is not an epic hero trained in unique skills, covered in protective armor and armed to the teeth with custom weapons. The Torch Carriers have a pack of basic supplies and a torch. In order to survive the dungeon, complete the task, and escape you will have to use what you can find as you go.&#10;&#10;Torch Carriers is a &ldquo;diceless&rdquo; dungeon-crawling party-based adventure game for 1-6 players. The Chapter-based story system ensures that no two games will ever be alike.&#10;&#10;Built on Wrectangle Games &ldquo;Card Chaos&rdquo; Gameplay Engine, Torch Carriers allows you to play world-class RPG adventures dictated by the cards you draw rather than the dice you roll.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Players are English merchants circa 1590 - 1600&rsquo;s financing marine voyages to seek treasure in India and SE Asia.&#10;&#10;Each player may have a max of 4 expeditions in play at one time. Each expedition must have one or more (to a maximum of 4) ships.   Expeditions can also have trade goods or silver to trade for cargo. They can also have gifts to give to foreign rulers, and great Captains to improve their chance of success. Expeditions are created using cards drawn from an &ldquo;expedition&rdquo; deck of 60 cards.&#10;&#10;Each player has an expedition mat divided into 4 sections numbered 1 to 4. These correspond to each of the 4 possible expeditions the player may have going at the same time.  The expedition and treasure cards of a particular expedition are placed in its own section.&#10;&#10;Play is conducted on an expedition track that is 40 spaces long. There is a start space (England) and an end space (Pacific Ocean).  The spaces in between represent locations or event that may a have a positive, negative or no effect on the expedition. When starting out, an expedition moves towards the end space.  When reaching the End space or any point before then, the expedition may turn back. When an expedition finally returns, its treasures go into the expedition&rsquo;s profit pile, and all its expedition cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&#10;&#10;Expedition Phase&#10;&#10;     Draw 2 cards from the expedition deck and discard 1 of them.  Add the card to your expedition pile. &#10;&#10;&#10;Launch Phase&#10;&#10;     If your expedition pile contains at least 1 ship, you may launch an expedition. &#10;     If your expedition pile has 8 cards you must launch, unless you don&rsquo;t have a ship, in which case you must discard your entire expedition pile, and gain 1 treasure. &#10;     Place an expedition counter onto the start space of the expedition track and place all the expedition cards from the pile into the corresponding section of your expedition mat. &#10;&#10;&#10;Action Phase&#10;&#10;     In order of expedition number, move your expeditions along the track by rolling 1D6 and moving the expedition that number of spaces. Each space offers one possibility, helpful, or hurtful: trade, resupply, hardship, storm, capture ship, gift, cotton or naught. Spaces are resolved accordingly.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends after 2 hours, or when the treasure deck runs out. The player with the most Treasure Points (TP) in their profit pile at that time wins.&#10;&#10;",

It is set in the Waste, a post nuclear land steeped in radiation and full of danger, adventure and treasures to be found.  The Great War happened long enough ago that no one alive remembers what life used to be like.  Those that cling to life work hard to simply survive, overcoming challenges within the Waste every single day.  This is where you intend to make a name for yourself.  Your goal is to explore and survive the Waste, while becoming the most famous adventurer in the process!&#10;&#10;Neon Dawn is an adventure game at its core, including 400 mini stories that can be experienced by adventurers of the Waste.  Players initially build out their character through a draft, then continue to develop their character through Items, Consumables and Traits obtained during game play, as well as the Companion you choose to adventure with.  Players can explore the world, salvage materials, build reputation with settlements, trade, craft Items, build buildings (for Fame and reputation) and complete Missions.&#10;&#10;Neon Dawn was designed to be easy to learn, yet still provide deep game play and a thematic story experience.  Due to the variance in the cards, map tiles and dice rolls, each play through of Neon Dawn will provide a unique story experience specifically for the players at the table.  No two stories will be alike! (statistically, it's nearly impossible)&#10;&#10;",

You've got seven time jumps to complete as many missions as possible, but watch out for paradoxes; if two or more Sarahs meet in the same time zone, everything about them will change in an instant and all your plans could go up in smoke.&#10;&#10;In Sarah's Singularity, players select an assortment of time periods from prehistoric Pangea to ComicCon 2012 and establish a set of missions for each period. Stranded companions from far-ranging times are scattered among the chosen periods and each player gets a &quot;Sarah Card&quot; with special powers. Finally, players choose two secret objective cards for hidden endgame scoring and a Chronologist is selected from the gathered players.&#10;&#10;Each round, Future Sarah visits a time period to strand another companion and the players simultaneously and secretly select a time period to jump to where they hope to solve a mission by matching icons on the mission card with icons on the stranded companion cards and the icons on their own hand of helpful companions.

Those player immediately turn in their Sarah Cards and get a new one at random, losing the special powers they may have planned to use to help solve the mission. The Chronologist then decides the order in which the paradoxing players gets to take their turns. The paradoxing player who goes last gets to be the new Chronologist.&#10;&#10;Players claim solved missions as victory points. They also gain bonus points and a wild icon token for rescuing a stranded companion and hidden endgame points through their secret objective cards.

It plays like a miniatures game, but it needs only a minimum of table space and can fit perfectly in your pocket. You assume the role of a Guild Master, scrambling to stake your claim on the valuable ore deposits of Agawan Island. You must build up your base, recruit your troops, and smash down your opponent's base before he does the same to you. This fast-paced strategy game distills concepts from miniatures games, collectible card games, and real-time strategy games into a quick and portable card game.&#10;&#10;Battle for Agawan's streamlined game system is a card game that has no shuffling and a tactical combat game that has no board, no rulers, and no dice rolling. Instead, players can freely select cards from their own customized army pool of twenty Base and Character cards. Base cards build up your rate of production while Character cards are used for engaging in combat. Special Character abilities and stats, combined with a deterministic support-based combat system, encourage mixed forces and dynamic counterplay. Battle for Agawan uses neither grid-based maps nor measurement-based movement, instead abstracting the field of battle into four simple rows. This minimalism allows for extremely quick setup and portability while preserving the core tactical elements of movement, range, and positioning.&#10;&#10;",

The originally designed game set in compact packaging with bright an unusual animal drawings is a great solution for this fun game and complementary for acquiring the basics of mathematics. Play and get smarter. This game is played in background mode, so you won&rsquo;t have to convince your child to sit down at the table. Not only will children learn how to count, but they will instantly learn to define the number of objects on a card as well, which definitely separates this method of learning from cramming in a positive light. Adding within ten can easily become second nature to your child. HurriCount is a great supplement for developing your child&rsquo;s attentiveness, logic, thinking speed, and reaction time. HurriCount has an application called HurriCount Mathitude where you will get to solve problems that are even more challenging. The cards from this game can be gradually added into HurriCount, making it more difficult, and you can also use it as a standalone playing set. When buying the two games at the same time, you will be able to receive a cut little bag that you can carry the games in.&#10;&#10;",

Its fussy clients love to order pizza by slices. By playing this game you'll become such an expert in fractions that you'll be second to none.&#10;&#10;The game set is designed in a charming Italian style. It includes both rectangular cards with orders and fascinating round cards. The latter are trays with different numbers of pizza slices. Apart from cheese and olives, pizzas include tomatoes, mushrooms, and peppers in various combinations; each one can have two additional ingredients.&#10;&#10;Splittissimo offers the fastest delivery!&#10;&#10;There are several versions of the game.&#10;&#10;Let&rsquo;s start with the easiest one. If you&rsquo;re playing with children of five and older, use only round cards. Beginner level cards are marked with one dot (to make it more challenging, you can add cards with two or three dots later). Each player takes three cards and puts them face-up in front of him; the same number of cards is placed face-up on the table (playing by the rules of a more challenging version, the players draw 4 cards and 4 cards are placed on the table) The task is to use several playing field cards to assemble a pizza , so that the number of its slices would be equal to the number of slices in one of your pizzas. Or, conversely, you can choose one of the playing field pizzas and assemble it using several of your own cards.&#10;&#10;Playing with older kids, add the rectangular order cards. The task is to assemble the ordered pizzas using the cards on the playing field, taking into account both their size and the ingredients. To add excitement to the game, use a number of special cards, which allow you to slow down your opponents&rsquo; work and accelerate your own pace using &ldquo;last minute&rdquo; orders.&#10;&#10;All versions of the game end with counting the whole pizzas that players managed to put together. In other words, the players should make whole pizzas from the slices they have, which helps them to reinforce addition of fractions once again.&#10;&#10;",

Many pieces are similar to classic chess pieces in which they capture others by moving onto the same square.  Some capture by jumping, and others capture via rolling a certain result on a die.&#10;&#10;As in chess, the ultimate goal of the game is for each player to capture their opponent's King.  Similar to the classic game, there are opportunities for stale-mates that result in draws.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Theme/backstory: In 587BC the Babylonian armies of Nebuchadnezzar broke through the walls of Jerusalem, burned the city and pillaged the Temple of Yahweh. Those in the city who survived the siege were deported 1500km to Babylon.&#10;&#10;The people of Israel are bleeding. Their capital is destroyed, they are exiled from their land and Yahweh has abandoned them, or so it seems.&#10;&#10;Nursing broken hearts, the pious of Israel gather on the banks of the Euphrates River. They comfort each other, and turn to the writings of the prophet Jeremiah. Perhaps they will gain understanding before all their hope drains away ...&#10;&#10;Game mechanics: Co-operative card game with a CCG/LCG feel. The box comes with all the cards you need for four starter decks (and a few other cards too). The starter decks are reasonable, but as you improve you will want to craft your own. Unlike other co-op CCG/LCGs there is no 'monster deck' or 'encounter deck' instead there is some very careful shared resource management required.&#10;&#10;",

In order to deliver the packages, the piglets decided to form their own delivery companies.&#10;&#10;When delivering a package for receipt confirmation they received a hoof print rather than a signature. Each of the piglets' companies compete to see who makes the speediest deliveries.&#10;&#10;In this game, the goal is to move the three pig pieces to the four home bases (other than your own) and collect four hoof print chips before anyone else.&#10;&#10;Each player controls three piglets, starting with all three piglet pieces placed on their home base. There are a total of 5 home bases, one for each player from the center.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players also draw animal tiles and add them to their hand. After drawing a tile, the player carries out all of the following actions, in any order, during their turn: moving a piglet, placing an animal tile, and returning a piglet. Throw away tiles to ensure a player&rsquo;s hand does not exceed three tiles. The game ends when a player successfully moves their piglets to the other four home bases and collects all the hoof prints to win the game.&#10;&#10;Moving a piglet - This action, in combination with the below action (placing an animal tile), can only be carried out a maximum of three times during a single turn (e.g., place one animal tile + move 2 spaces).  A player may move their piglet one space in any direction. The player can also use the secret passage spaces to travel even further. However, except for the home base spaces, a piglet cannot move to a space that is already occupied by another piglet. In addition, if a piglet moves onto a space with an animal tile placed on it, they must obey the law of that tile. If a piglet successfully moves to a home base, they can receive the hoof print from that base.&#10;&#10;Placing an animal tile - This action, in combination with the above action (moving a piglet), can only be carried out a maximum of three times (e.g., place two animal tiles + move 1 spaces). A player places an animal tile from their hand onto an open space. An open space is a space where no animal tiles or piglets are currently placed. However, some tiles can take the place of other tiles and some tiles cannot be placed on some spaces.&#10;&#10;Returning a piglet - This action can be used an unlimited number of times per turn. Move one piglet that is not currently placed on your home base back to your home base. At the same time, you can add a tile (without a piglet piece placed on top) into your hand.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#175;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#187;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#233;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#231;&#164;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#184;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#232;&#183;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#178;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;3&#229;&#140;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;4&#227;&#129;&#139;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#139;&#160;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;4&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#232;&#183;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

There are loads of dirty party games out there, but not many that also have a &quot;getting to know you&quot; element. And that's where we come in.&#10;&#10;QWDG is pretty simple. It's a deck of personal questions that range from thought-provoking to ridiculous, awkward to obscene. When a card is drawn, everyone writes their own answer to the question. Then one person tries to correctly identify who wrote each answer.&#10;&#10;To sum up: QWDG is a dirty party game for people who want to show off their disgusting sense of humor and prove how well they know their friends.&#10;&#10;",

Players will be racing against each other to be the first player to earn 500 credits to win this NEW scenario.  During the game, players will take on a NEW and &quot;Special&quot; Mission called &quot;Smuggler's Run&quot; and in doing so may exchange cards for various tracks to UNLOCK a given dice.  With a maximum of five (5) dice which can be UNLOCKED, plus a BONUS 1D20 when you unlock two (2) or more dice results in the possibility of Scoring 60 Credits.  But as this is a Trade Mission ... You must be wary that your Tradeship does NOT get destroyed as you collect more valuable illegal Cargo during this mission while avoiding &quot;losing it all&quot; in the event that your Tradeship gets destroyed.&#10;&#10;Remember this Expansion is build upon the framework of the &quot;Planetary Expansion&quot; and not only the &quot;core&quot; game.  However at this present time we feel that it may be incompatible with the Tactical Core (Future Expansion currently not available). Both expansions add a certain depth to the game which alter the way the game is played.  Because of the contrasting winning conditions, these two expansions cannot be played simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Additionally this Expansion offers update Player Game Pads (Horizontal) which are more compatible with the NEW &quot;Smuggler's Cache&quot; Game Pads which are exclusive and personalized for each Faction in the game.  This also adds a bit of variability in Game Play allowing players to TRY the various Factions and their Resources for a different experience (in terms of resources).&#10;&#10;",

Kobito-san means 'small beings', akin to Halfling or dwarvish people in a fairy tale. Yasai Batake would be a vegetable farm or field. In this context 'Little People's Vegetable Patch' is probably a close match.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to plant, grow, and harvest the vegetables. Successfully harvested vegetables grant you points. The game itself has a simultaneous action choice with butting mechanics. Butting is the Japanese gaming term for matching values cancelling out, as in games like Hols der Geier.&#10;&#10;There are 3 types of cards: Plant card (green border) / Supply card (yellow border) / Buy-in card (white border). Each turn, every player chooses a card from their hand, and reveals it simultaneously. If any players have played the same kind of Plants, those Plants are cancelled, dumped to the discard pile, and their turn is skipped.&#10;&#10;Any remaining vegetables are played on the field, &quot;slow growing&quot; ones first. You place your chips around your planted vegetable, the same number as the &quot;required turns to harvest&quot; value.&#10;&#10;Then the supply cards come in to action. Shovel icon cards have an one-time instant effect, resolve it and discard. Trap icon cards may be placed on the field with your chip as an identifier.&#10;&#10;Finally, resolve the Buy-in cards. You may draw cards from the deck, but the more players that played Buy-in the same time, the fewer card you may draw. If you are the only one playing, you draw 3 cards. If 2 players are playing, you both draw 2. Otherwise, each player may draw 1 card. The played Buy-in card is returned to your hand.&#10;&#10;After that come the Planting phase, the Saboteur phase and Grow/Harvest phase.&#10;&#10;At the Saboteur phase, the Saboteur (some destructive animals) moves in the field. If the Saboteur runs over any of the vegetables, or chips that belong to a vegetable, that vegetable is wasted, and removed from the field.&#10;&#10;Then the Grow/Harvest phase. For each vegetable, pick a chip that belongs to that vegetable, and stack it on the vegetable card. If there are no chips left on the field for that card, it is considered grown and may be harvested to score you points.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Place your hobbits in the vegetable patch and grow, harvest your vegetables!&#10;&#10;Kobito-san no Yasai Batake is a game where you place your hobbits in the game field and harvest the vegetables. The first player to harvest the predetermined amount of vegetables is the winner.&#10;&#10;The field is small. You may need to race to get a better area. Should you work steadily on a small, quick and easy-to-grow vegetable? Or a slow but huge one? It's up to you. But beware, Saboteur animals maybe lurking nearby. They maybe after your hard-grown vegetables, so watch out!&#10;&#10;&#231;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#142;&#231;&#169;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#231;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#142;&#231;&#169;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#166;&#143;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#233;&#135;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#142;&#231;&#169;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#156;&#159;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#139;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#233;&#128;&#134;&#232;&#187;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#139;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#231;&#172;&#172;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#233;&#130;&#170;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the publisher's webpage:&#10;&#10;Combat Leader: Poland 1939 is the newest release in the Combat Leader game series, covering the Polish campaign on September, 1939, with German and Polish troops.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two maps (#9 and #10, rural and suburban terrain), two counter sheets (J &amp; K, which must be cut apart), two identical Reference Cards, and a 24-page rules booklet.  The rules contain all the standard, advanced, and optional rules for the system, along with five scenarios.  This game sees the entry of the Poles into the system, and special rules cover the use of the 18-man Polish squad, with their characteristic weaponry (Kb wz.98a rifles, Browning wz. 1928 BAR LMG, etc.) and organization. The German SS also are introduced into the system (a full SS squad is included), with special rules governing their use on the battlefield. Overall, three German squads, two Polish squads--plus plenty of extra men to create different formations--are included.&#10;&#10;The core rules have been expanded to include several options originally appearing in the Combat Leader: Expansion Module.  These rules are now  considered standard, and there is no need to buy that module.&#10;&#10;Combat Leader: Poland is a complete, stand alone game. The core rules of the game system remain the same, plus additional optional rules have been included. So, Combat Leader: Poland 1939 provides you with not only a new nationality and the SS, but the most up-to-date edition of the series.  It is compatible with all other Combat Leader games.&#10;&#10;",

The setting is Italian City States at war circa 1490 - the Fivizzano are invading the Piombino.&#10;&#10;Play is conducted on a 16 x 16 square grid map. Each 8 x 8 section is referred to as a quadrant &ndash; the 2 eastern quadrants are land, the 2 western quadrants are water. The 6 squares of the NE corner of the SW quadrant contain city squares -  the Port City commune of Piombino. The remainder of the map layout is determined at discretion of the players though most of the land spaces should be flat land with a few clumps of forests and mountains and a few solitary hills, villages, and swamps. &#10;One road connects the city to a village or two and then goes off the map. A few Islands dot the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Terrain types will affect the movement of the different unit types.&#10;&#10;There are 11 different unit types: Infantry, Engineers, Cavalry, Artillery, War Machine, Flying Machine, Fortification, Small Warship, Large Warship, Transport and Mine Field.  Each unit type has a move rating, hits score and range, and may have a special capability.&#10;&#10;The players start with a pre-defined army comprising a mix of the various units.  The attacker (the Fivizzano) starts with his units in the bottom half of the Southern quadrants. In addition the Fivizzano gets one roll against the leader table and 4 rolls against the invention table &ndash; these give advantages / enhancements that last for the duration of the battle. The defender (the Piombino) starts with units scattered in the Northern quadrants, one roll against the leader table and 6 against the invention table.&#10;&#10;Players share a Tactics deck comprising cards that mostly give short duration benefits.  These cards can be used, when appropriate, to enhance your own actions or negate those of your opponent&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:&#10;&#10;Draw Phase&#10;&#10;     Draw 2 Tactics cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;Move Phase&#10;&#10;     Each of your Units may be moved once up to a number of spaces equal to its move rating. &#10;&#10;&#10;Attack Phase&#10;&#10;      Each of your units may make 1 attack vs. a target within its range. When attacking roll 1D10. On a roll of 7 or higher the attack is successful and the target loses 1 hit. A unit with zero hits is destroyed. &#10;&#10;&#10;End Phase &#10;&#10;     Max Hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The Fivizzano win if they occupy 4 of the spaces of the city. &#10;The Piombinos win if they destroy 20 or more units.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A card and dice game for 1-5 players based on the Spore series of videogames. Each player is control of his own race as it evolves and develops from a single cell to spacefaring.&#10;&#10;The game plays in 5 stages (Cell stage, Creature stage, Tribal stage, Civilization stage, Space stage) with each stage having a separate deck of trait cards, and event, challenge type and challenge result tables.  Players move from one stage to the next at different speeds and do not directly interact until the last stage, the Space stage. At the beginning of each stage, each player chooses 1 characteristic for his race &ndash; these characteristics improve a particular attribute for the race.&#10;&#10;Players share a common set of Victory Point Tokens (VT), Food (Resource) Tokens (FT), Hunger Tokens (HT) and Death Tokens (DT). Each player starts with 1 VT and 3 FT.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 5 Phases:&#10;&#10;Mutation Phase&#10;&#10;     Draw 1 (or, possibly, more) card from the deck (of the stage you are in). &#10;&#10;&#10;Event Phase&#10;&#10;     Roll once on the event table (of the stage you are in) and resolve the event. &#10;&#10;&#10;Selection Phase&#10;&#10;     Most events are challenges between your species and another species that is either weaker, equal, or stronger than you. &#10;     To resolve a challenge first roll on the challenge type table to determine what attribute will affect the challenge.  Next Roll 1D6 (Attribution Roll) and add your level in the indicated Attribute. This is your Attribution Total. &#10;     Next roll 1D6, 2D6, or 3D6 depending on the Strength of the Challenger. &#10;&#10;&#10;This is the Challenge Roll. &#10;&#10;     If the Attribution Total is greater than the Challenge Roll, you win the Challenge. &#10;&#10;&#10;If it is equal or less, you lose the challenge. &#10;&#10;     Refer to that stage&rsquo;s Challenge Result list to determine the benefits or consequences of winning or losing the challenge.&#10;     You may attempt to evade a challenge. If you do so, add +4 to your attribution roll. &#10;&#10;&#10;However if you win, you get no reward.&#10;&#10;Evolution Phase&#10;&#10;     You may gain 1 Trait by playing 1 Trait card from your hand and paying its cost in food or resource tokens. The Trait card stays in play in front of you.  &#10;&#10;&#10;Metabolic Phase&#10;&#10;     Discard 1 Food Token. If you have no food tokens gain 1 hunger token. If you have 2 hunger tokens, discard them and gain 1 death token. &#10;     Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;     Determine whether your race moves to the next stage:&#10;         If you have 6 Trait cards in Cell stage in play go on Creature stage. &#10;         If you have 8 Trait cards in Creature stage in play go on Tribal stage. &#10;         If you have won against 5 villages in Tribal stage go onto Civilization stage. &#10;         If you have won against 7 nations in Civilization stage go onto Space Stage. &#10;    &#10;     If going on to the next stage set your old Trait cards aside in your Progress Pile. Except for and VT they might score, these do not apply to later stages. Select a new characteristic for the new stage and discard down to 2 FT or RT. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends after any player has completed his 15th turn in the Space stage at which point scoring is undertaken:&#10;&#10;         Gain 5 VT for completing the Civilization stage and entering the Space stage. &#10;         Add up the VT bonuses from all the Trait cards in your Progress Pile. &#10;         Each Death Token counts as a -2 VT penalty. &#10;         Add or lose VT arising from Events and Challenges. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the most Victory Point Tokens wins.&#10;&#10;",
