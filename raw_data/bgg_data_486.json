The phases are entered via &quot;doors&quot; on the board and the cards are turned in for money, which is tracked on a small board for each player. In true Hughes style, players may purchase injunctions to prevent movement through certain areas of the board. The object is to amass $2.5 billion dollars, the publisher's estimate of Hughes' fortune at the time.&#10;&#10;In addition to the rules, the &quot;Study Guide&quot; booklet contains 21 pages of material on the life and investments of Howard Hughes and an extensive bibliography.&#10;&#10;Although the name &quot;Urban Systems&quot; does not appear on the game, this is presumably the game in the case Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v.

If you wish to play a longer game you can start with more pawns. Players take turns rolling and moving their pawns around the board. The game includes a Bumpback die that can be rolled when you land on a space that is occupied by another player. The Bumpback die sends pawns back to their start position. Each space has six dots on it and the number rolled on the Bumpback die applies to any pawn resting on that numbered dot. The game can get very exciting with 4 players and 32 pawns on the board.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to get the highest score after six rounds.  Each of the two dice has number on five of the six sides, and a skull on the sixth side.&#10;&#10;Determine which player goes first by any convenient method.  First player rolls both dice.  If no skulls are showing, the player adds the numbers showing to his score for the round.  He he has the option of rolling again, or passing the dice to the next player.  If he passes the dice, his turn is over, and the score he has rolled so far is &quot;protected.&quot;  If he rolls again, he may get more points, but he may also lose all the points he has received so far that round.  A player may continue to roll the dice until he decides to pass them, or until he rolls one or more skulls.  If a player rolls one skull, he loses all the points he has gained that round, and gets a score of zero for the round.  He must then pass the dice to the next player.  If a player rolls two skulls, he loses all the points he as gained that round, and in all previous rounds.  He is completely wiped out, and must start again the next round.  He must pass the dice to the next player.&#10;&#10;After all the players have had a chance to roll the dice, draw a line under the scores to signify that the scores above the line are &quot;protected&quot; (i.e., cannot by wiped out the the roll of a single skull).  Note that each player must roll the dice at least once each round.&#10;&#10;Subsequent rounds:  In the following rounds, players roll the dice in the order of their score so far.  The player with the highest score at they end of the first round will roll first for the second round.  The player with the second highest score will roll second, and so on.  There is an advantage to rolling last, so we give that position to the player who is losing the worst.  If two players are tied for score, they may roll a dice or flip a coin to determine which must roll first.&#10;&#10;At the end of six rounds the player with the highest score wins.  If two players are tied for the highest score, then all players must roll another round.&#10;&#10;Hint:  although the odds of rolling a skull on any one roll are always exactly the same as any other roll, the more times you roll in one round, the more points you are rising on any one roll.&#10;&#10;Flying Buffalo Inc.

    "Description": "Our Great Game is a board game which simulates the game of Australian Rules Football.&#10;&#10;The game was probably first published in the 1920s by the National Game Company. Several versions exist. Two versions are produced on a thick backing either 36cm x 36cm or 48 x 31cm. Common to all versions is the wording 'Our Great Game' on the inside board.  The box or board covers have various titles, including 'The National Football game', 'Our Great Game' or 'The Game of Football'. All but one version has the playing field angled across the board. Later copies were printed on thin card, boxed with the logo (but not on the board), including those published by Westley games.&#10;&#10;As with the real form of the sport scores are kept for two teams (Yellow and Red team in the game) and 4 quarters are played with the duration decided by the players. The scores are 6 points for a goal (through the tall posts) and 1 point for a behind (number 31 in the game). Play starts by the sum of two dice. A disc (ball) is placed at that players feet that corresponds to the number. (i.e If 6 and 2 are rolled, player 8 Red team has the ball) If the player is in the defensive zone (closer half of their opponents goal) the next roll of the dice must be subtracted (i.e If player 8 (Red Team) rolls a 1 the next player to receive the ball is 8 - 1 = 7. If the red team is still in possession they keep rolling the dice but if the number turns it over to the yellow team then its their roll of the dice. When the player is forward of their center line, then they are deemed to be in attack. In this case instead of subtracting the dice roll they must add. (i.e Player 7 (Red Team) is forward of center so they roll say a 3 - the next player to receive the ball is 10 (7 + 3). Movement and scoring is done in this way. If a behind is scored the ball is placed on player 29 of the opposing team to kick out. The highest score after 4 quarters is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Light, quick skirmish game of warfare during the 19th Century.&#10;&#10;From the Introduction&#10;&#10;The late nineteenth-century has always been a popular subject for wargaming, and there are already plenty of rule sets around.  But when HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) was planning their Victorian British in Home Service uniforms figure range they decided to publish their own rules to go with them.  Why?&#10;&#10;Firstly, because the emphasis in Ever-Victorious Armies is rather different from that of most rule sets.  The authors were especially interested in the role which the British army might have played in a European War of the period, and so they wanted to cater for this sort of hypothetical scenario. They also wanted to be able to fight &quot;alternative history&quot; campaigns, involving fictional armies based fairly loosely on real-life prototypes.  This required a &quot;broad brush&quot; approach, catching the essence of the period, but without concentrating too intently on the tactical and organizational minutiae of a particular conflict.&#10;&#10;The other factor which HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) sought to emphasize in this war-game is the &quot;game&quot; part.  Some of the best known rules for the period -- as for many other periods -- are a bit too much like work to play.  Authenticity is all very nice but real warfare has been aptly described as a combination of ninety percent boredom and ten percent confusion.  HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) have tried not to reproduce this aspect too faithfully in Ever-Victorious Armies.&#10;&#10;Ever-Victorious Armies is based on individual figures, which are removed to simulate casualties, thus minimizing record-keeping.  It requires little if any paperwork, no little boxes to tick off, and only one kind of dice.  The command and control rules require each on-table unit to be given orders at the start of the game, to which they must try to adhere as long as morale test results permit. The orders should specify the objective and route if the units are to move, or the position to be defended if not. An army's Commander-in-Cheif may attempt to modify the orders of one unit, per turn, by utilizing a messenger figure to convey a new set of written orders.&#10;&#10;The rules ideally require figures to be based so that they are individually removable, but multi-figure &quot;blocks&quot; -- like those produced in 2mm and 6mm bi Irregular Miniatures -- can be used instead, if you prefer to use the smaller scales.  In this case, simply treat each block as if it was a figure.&#10;&#10;A game involving several hundred figures a side can easily be completed in an evening. After a few attempts players will be able to remember most of the rules which are needed, and so will be able to keep the game moving without constantly referring to the rulebook.  This leaves the players free to enjoy the games and admire their carefully painted figures -- which is what it is all about, after all.&#10;&#10;",

However, once you have reached the inner rings, it is possible to help those who are stuck.  You may give up your turn, in order to give one of your key cards to someone in need.  For this kind deed, you receive a crown card.  There are also a number of obstacles, including pride, doubt, deception, and the sins of flesh.  Along the way, one may also need to draw a Scripture card.  These include a Bible verse that you need to memorize before its your turn again in order to proceed.  The game ends once a player reaches the center or when a timer goes off (the rapture option).  The winner is the player with the most crown cards.  Thus, victory goes to the player who helped the most other players.&#10;&#10;",

Players move their pawns around a map depicting the 2006 member states of the European Union. After each move the players answer questions arranged in five broad topics: A) The EU; B) sport; C) history &amp; geography; D) art, science and technology; and E) society, nature &amp; culture. For a correct answer the player receives an EU-flag within that topic. After collecting ten flags (two flags of each topic A-E) the player heads for goal and wins the game.&#10;&#10;This seems a very simple game that has its primary purpose in teaching matters concerning the EU with European history and culture. The components of the game are nice and look professional enough, but there is very little to call a design here.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Oil Field, players act as rivaling energy companies. They try to reach the newly built oil field first and thus get the lucrative deal with the oil company and win the game.&#10;&#10;First players shuffle their land card decks and build a map for the game. Each player has identical 31 land cards and together they form a 21x3 (for two players) or 14x9 (for four players) map. In the middle of the playing area is the oil field that players try to reach. The land cards have two playable sides and they have different rocks/obstacles in them so basically each player faces equally difficult landscape which to overcome.&#10;&#10;Now players start to build their oil pipes. On their way to the oil field they need to turn the land cards to make the route possible, flip land cards around to hopefully reveal more suitable obstacles or switch land cards with adjacent ones.&#10;&#10;Many land cards have some specialties. Yellow-edged has to be turned around once player builds a pipe next to it, some give extra action and some force player to flip surrounding cards around.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online Play&#10;    http://www.tuonelaproductions.com/index.php?page_id=13&#10;&#10;&#10;",
