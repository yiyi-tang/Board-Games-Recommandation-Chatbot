It plays rapidly, but offers enough detail and action to give you the story of the match.&#10;&#10;In Player of the Game Tennis, each player is individually rated for their service game both first serves and second serves; their complete ability when receiving (again how they handle the opponent's first serve or second serve); ability to hit game winners or game losers in some cases. Other factors, like a player's fitness, whether he is a favorite, ability to handle adversity, major and minor injuries are all included. Did we mention that all of the factors above are broken down by playing surface? All aspects of a tennis match are covered.&#10;&#10;Player of the Game is easy to learn and easy to understand. You'll be playing in no time. Each match will unfold in front of your eyes at a brisk pace. A full match in Player of the Game tennis take no longer than 10 minutes. Most matches will be completed in 5 minutes!&#10;&#10;The base game includes a fictional Men's Tour and a fictional Women's Tour with complete schedules, prize money, a points system, and even tournament brackets. Everything needed to play is included in the base game.&#10;&#10;If you want to add real players, you can purchase any of our season year books.&#10;&#10;If your favorite player isn't rated (which isn't likely), we give you a method to put them in the game!&#10;&#10;The Printed game features all players on die-cut cards printed in vivid color.&#10;&#10;Step on the court today, it is all Aces with Player of the Game Tennis!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Kickstarter editions comes packaged with 3 expansions not contained in the retail edition - The Fire Temple Monsters, The Kaharian Monsters, and The Shade Events.&#10;&#10;The goal of Valeria: Card Kingdoms &ndash; Darksworn is to introduce co-operative play into the Valeria world through groups of related books called Sagas. These books will lead the players through a story that unfolds during the game and offers greater immersion into the Valeria setting. New rules and cards will be introduced in each book, some lasting only through the current book and some persisting through the unfolding Saga, somewhat like a &quot;legacy game&quot;.&#10;&#10;Darksworn uses six book-decks to tell a story of wonder, sacrifice, and adventure as you explore the territory west of Valeria and encounter a darkness that cannot go unchecked. Each book presents you with a set of new rules and several tasks that must be completed by your gaming group in order to advance to the next book in the saga. Within each book you'll find special boons to assist you and powerful monsters to challenge you. Your team will have to strike a balance between building effective tableaus of citizens that will allow you to complete the tasks and defending the decreasing center stacks of citizens that are the health of your kingdom.&#10;&#10;The play area for Darksworn is much the same as an ordinary game of Valeria: Card Kingdoms, but there are some notable changes. The story board sits above the monster row. This is where each book's story and challenges are presented, where new rules are displayed, and where citizens captured by monster attacks languish in a dark oubliette. Walls provide additional protection from the attacking monsters, but if they make it past the walls, your citizen stacks are going to suffer. At the bottom of the play area is the Blessings Board where your devotion to the radiance of Aquila can grant you special powers, free captured citizens, and even rebuild fallen walls. If any of the monsters make it through to the Blessings Board, however, all is lost.&#10;&#10;",

Armed with deadly electrostaffs and precision blaster pistols, the menacing MagnaGuards will continue to fight after losing limbs&ndash; or even their head!&#10;&#10;This expansion puts a troop of six highly detailed, unpainted hard plastic IG-100 MagnaGuard miniatures at your command, enough for two special forces units. In addition to their standard electrostaffs, these miniatures can be assembled with a variety of alternate weaponry, including an RPS-6 rocket launcher, an electro-whip, and a unit leader that can appear with a precision laser dart. Additionally, eight upgrade cards give you even more options for your MagnaGuards, including two heavy weapons.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Depression and anxiety rose.&#10;&#10;One day, explorers ventured into the last remaining jungle, searching for the mythical Mushroom Shamans. They came eager to find meaning, solutions, and happiness.&#10;&#10;You are one of these legendary Mushroom Shamans. Spurred by the enthusiasm of your new followers, you embark on a mission to grow your cult and save the planet.&#10;&#10;You will race against your fellow competitors by sending your followers out to forage, grow, and consume mushrooms to heal the earth and fight inner demons.&#10;&#10;You must hurry because increasing pollution and destruction will damage your foraging grounds. However, you must be cautious. Inexperienced mushroom consumers may face severe consequences.&#10;&#10;Mushroom Shaman is a worker placement and engine building game for 1-6 players where players forage, grow and comsume mushrooms to heal the earth and fight inner demons.&#10;&#10;Players allocate followers to complete various tasks to achieve victory points. Tasks consist of foraging and visiting 6 locations on the shared game board: cave, forest, market, plains, river, and village. Additional tasks are located on individual grow chamber boards. Here, followers can grow mushrooms, create medicinal tinctures, and colonize grain.&#10;&#10;The goal is to reach 8 victory points, with victory points representing the success of your cult. The game immediately ends when a player reaches 8 victory points. That player wins the game and crowned the greatest Mushroom Shaman.&#10;&#10;",

Play your bears to steal your opponent's salmons and make sure that your salmons do not get caught by the other bears.&#10;&#10;In the new game, the players no longer have just bears on their hands but predators (a mixture of bears and a wild animal). Each predator has a unique value ranging from 1 to 60. The player playing the predator with the lowest value gets to pick a salmon first. This way, it is less likely to have ties.&#10;Besides, the ties are now sorted with a new mechanism, the waterfall. In case of a tie with two predators of the same value, the player whose token is closer to the bottom of the waterfall gets to pick first. Then, the token gets moved to the highest spot on the waterfall.&#10;&#10;Finally, the new game introduces a handicap card. Each player gets a +15 card that, which when played, adds 15 to the value of another predator, having an impact on the order of the players getting salmon.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Dragon God of the Eclipse, Raju, has cultivated and collected Arkonite gems for billions of years, giving it its ancient energy and power. Anyone who dares to challenge him to remove the gems ends up wishing they hadn't tried.&#10;&#10;But, now, a group of Heroes are ready to enter and appropriate his priceless treasure. So much so that, blinded by greed, all champions will do whatever it takes to get the best cut. Get the highest number of victory points with the Arkonites collected and stored in the coffers of your kingdom. Each color of Arkonite has a different value. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;During each round of Raju, two Arkonites are drawn from Raju's cave (from his cloth bag) and the die is rolled to see if the night and day champion cards are empowered or if, on the contrary, there is an eclipse and all champions develop your skills during this round.&#10;&#10;Each opponent plays a Master card (secretly or not, depending on the previous roll of the die) in their own play area. Whoever has the highest card number wins the round and takes the Raju treasure drawn at the beginning of the round.&#10;&#10;This mechanic is repeated over 9 rounds where, depending on how you have played your cards taking into account what you think others are going to play, you will or will not be the winner.&#10;&#10;Depending on the game mode, up to 3 games can be chained together without revealing the loot achieved. Which makes it very interesting due to the great variety of Arkonites included in the game and of different value.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players hold their own rondel and use it and their cards to battle with magic. The game has 10 magical characters; each is unique and fun with different attributes and activation abilities. Even if a character dies, they can still win the game through Resurrection.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;Hold the hexagram tiles directly in your hands and chant spells! A magical battle for your heart!&#10;Which of the six different spellbook cards will you use? You make an agonizing choice and raise your hexagram. You chant your spell in high spirits...!&#10;&#10;The game has an unusual butting system: if your moves are read by other players, your attacks will be less effective and your opponent will gain Magic Points. It's not enough to be good at the game to win, you have to be able to play the tense game.&#10;&#10;The magic battles are fast and thrilling, and can be settled in 20-30 minutes. But it's not the end of the world if you die - there is a resurrection element. You never know who will emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;With multiple tactical cards, 10 different characters, 6 different attributes, 3 types of abnormalities, and the rare &quot;Divine Awakening&quot; ability, there's plenty to do! Let's go back to your childhood and enjoy the battle!&#10;&#10;&#229;&#133;&#173;&#232;&#138;&#146;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#230;&#142;&#165;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#229;&#145;&#170;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#169;&#160;&#229;&#148;&#177;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#229;&#142;&#168;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#230;&#138;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#133;&#173;&#232;&#138;&#146;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#145;&#170;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#169;&#160;&#229;&#148;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&hellip;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#170;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;MP&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#229;&#137;&#135;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#191;&#156;&#233;&#133;&#172;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;20&#239;&#189;&#158;30&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#231;&#157;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#170;&rdquo;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&rdquo;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#190;&#169;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#232;&#164;&#135;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#1

    "Description": "In the days of ancient Felstad, vampires kept to the shadows, their small numbers no match for the power of the city's wizards. But when the cataclysm struck, the wizards were destroyed, while the deathless vampires went into a frozen hibernation. Now, as the city thaws, so to do its undead inhabitants. The masters of the night are rising again: reoccupying their hidden strongholds, reforming their old cabals, and finding new victims to serve as their thralls. The destruction of the old city has brought one other boon to the vampires - giant's blood. While giants used to live out of reach to the far north, in the intervening millennium, they have descended on the city in large numbers. Their blood is like an elixir to the vampires, filling them with strength and magical power. A new war is forming between these two ancient races, and once again, the wizards of Frostgrave are caught in the middle.&#10;&#10;This supplement for Frostgrave: Fantasy Wargames in the Frozen City presents greatly expanded information about the vampires and the giants that occupy the frozen ruins, including rules for vampiric magic and a breakdown of the different tribes of giants. Also included are rules for a new type of soldier, the giant-blooded. These huge men and women have the blood of giants running through their veins, granting them great strength unseen in normal men. Finally, the book contains a section on playing Frostgrave with high-level wizards and includes two mini-campaigns to challenge these experienced spellcasters.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A Clue reimplementation based on spies.&#10;&#10;Players move from room to room to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Darkest Doom is a competitive strategy game with RPG elements for 1-4 players. Set in a dark fantasy world inspired by XVII century Europe and inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.&#10;&#10;Will you survive for the 8 days of the Eclipse as the Darkness tries to annihilate the region of Betel all the while competing with the other Guardians to complete one of the four paths to victory?&#10;&#10;The Darkest Doom boardgame puts you in charge of one of four formidable Guardians, each with unique abilities and traits. As you explore the areas of the region of Betel you'll be able to take advantage of each different terrain and use its unique characteristics. You'll increase your Guardian's statistics by completing quests assigned to you by Vicar Percival, adjusting your strategy and attitude towards the game based on the stats you choose to upgrade. During your exploration, you'll also stumble onto ancient relics which will help you satisfy one of four victory conditions. You'll be able to declare Alliances with Citadels in order to gain advantages over other Guardians and battle the Darkness which is slowly bringing the whole region to collapse. Each new round is a new Dawn, and thanks to the Citadel restock you'll always have some help as you replenish the cards in your hand, choosing them from different decks: Equipment, Spells and Traps. The same card has different effects depending on the player using it and the stats they've chosen to increase. Whenever you're required to roll dice, High Priestess Elaine grants you and all other players the power of the Crimsonfate - the Amulet of the Elders - which will let you modify the result of the dice with a result of your choice from the Citadels Supplies cards in your hand. Play by yourself with the Bot Guardians mode, allowing you to play with up to three automated Guardians, or prove yourself by challenging three other players in this Dark Fantasy adventure combining elements of roleplay, exploration, handicap management and traditional boardgames.&#10;&#10;",

If you are also using the Volcano Expansion, then place the Hydra to the side of it. Shuffle the Hydra Cards and place them in a pile, face down, next to the Hydra.&#10;&#10;Taming the Hydra: During your turn, as a free action you may decide to try and Tame the Hydra! To do so, shuffle the Hydra cards, reveal the top one and resolve it as per its rules.&#10;&#10;BEWARE: Taming the Hydra is a risky task. You might end up getting a chance to deal extra damage to your opponent, but there is always the chance that the Hydra will retaliate and scare away your troops! It is possible to lose the game if the Hydra scares away your last troop! Every time you try to Tame the Hydra, one of its heads will respond to you. Depending on the head, there is a different outcome.&#10;&#10;Right Head: The Hydra is extremely angry and retaliates! It scares your troops away and some of them desert you! Remove one of your troops from the game. If this was the last troop, you lose the game!&#10;&#10;Left Head: You barely managed to control the Hydra to do your bidding. You may use it to launch one Ball of Fire to your opponent.&#10;&#10;Center Head: You did an exceptional job taming this beast! You may use it to throw 2 Balls of Fire to your opponent!&#10;&#10;Warning! This is a game of construction/destruction of plastic bricks and figures... NOT your opponent, pets, or people who may foolishly pass through the field of battle! Please play fair and be careful not to hurt each other or damage anything... other than your opponent's attempt at an impenetrable fortress!&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;- 1 Hydra&#10;- 4 x Fireballs&#10;- 6 x Hydra Cards&#10;- 1 Instruction Sheet&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
