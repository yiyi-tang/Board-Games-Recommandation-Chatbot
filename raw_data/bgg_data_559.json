As evening approached and it was time to bring the sheep and lambs into a pen for the night, Paul busied himself with putting the logs together for the pen while the dogs rounded up the sheep and lambs. It was a game they all enjoyed. The dogs hurried about trying to get the sheep and lambs into the pen before Paul could lay all the logs together to close the two entrances. See if you can help so the dogs can win again.&quot;&#10;&#10;The players try to drive home the sheep by using their dogs. They have to achieve this before the shepherd completes a pen in the middle of the game area (which is variably set up from tiles, some of which are the sheep). The building speed is determined by the same die that also moves the dogs which can proceed to the next tile of the color that was rolled. As so often with Herder games, players can pass their die results to other players. All players win or lose together (if the pen is completed before the sheep are in).&#10;&#10;Game play is varied by the fact that the meadow is completed by the forming of paths using 28 interlocking tiles that feature the sheep, poppies, etc. The number of tiles can be reduced to make the game easier for younger children.&#10;&#10;",

France, eager to continue flexing its military muscle, sent troops to colonize and control the Ukraine region while disarming the German troops there. The local population welcomed them to some degree thinking the French and Greek troops were sent to liberate them from the Red menace. Armed with tanks, aircraft and armor cars, the French sent the Greeks out to remote areas to secure it. However, the Red followers had secured vast amounts of weapons from the Germans, much to the dislike of the French, and were more than eager to fight. By March 1919, the Ukraine was on fire. The French and Greek troops were greatly disliked by all Russians after their true intentions had been revealed to the general public. This further emboldened the Red forces who were outnumbering the Allies. In the coming weeks, numerous battles were fought until the last bastion at Odessa.&#10;&#10;Game using the 'Russian Civil War Series' system.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;&bull;One 11&quot; x 17&quot; map sheet depicting the terrain the battle was fought over.&#10;&bull;One sheet of 260 counters.&#10;&bull;One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet.&#10;&bull;The series core rulebook that include the game rules used.&#10;&bull;A rulebook specific to The Ukraine on Fire.&#10;&#10;",

The board is a large hexagon, with its six sections colored to match the pyramids that will go on it - consistent with Chinese Checkers.  The line of hexes that forms the border between &quot;home&quot; territories is multi-colored, matching the adjacent home territories.  What makes E special is that it uses the natural size stackability of the Icehouse pieces to enhance Chinese Checkers significantly.  For one thing, pieces must move precisely as many steps and/or jumps as they have pips (i.e. Smalls go 1; mediums, 2; larges, 3).&#10;&#10;The major effect on play comes from the stackability.&#10;&#10;     A piece may never - not even for a step of a move - stack directly on its own color.  (except as the result of a guard exchange)&#10;     If you can physically touch your piece (without shifting things about), you may move it, even if that means pieces atop it will take a free ride.&#10;     If you can't physically touch your piece, it is trapped.&#10;     You may never trap a piece in its home territory.  The multicolor hexes come into play here, creating a somewhat safe zone for pieces.  The center space is safe for everyone.&#10;     You may liberate a trapped piece of yours, teleport a guard (a trapping piece of yours), and violate the &quot;never stack directly on yourself&quot; rule by performing a guard exchange.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is otherwise exactly like Chinese Checkers.&#10;&#10;Game System&#10;&#10;    Icehouse Pieces&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Unlike many wine games, this is not a trivia game where you are asked questions; You only need to place your marker on the game board to indicate the following questions: Where is it from? What's the grape? How old is it? How high is the alcohol? Naturally, you have to guess. Whoever guesses best gets the most points for the bottle, and you play as many bottles as there are teams.&#10;&#10;This game is a blast and wines is always great!&#10;&#10;",

As in standard &quot;lane bowling&quot;, the dice game is played by rolling dice twice for each frame and uses a similar scoring sheet to regulation bowling.

Your score consists of two types of points: honest points and points you have from cheater&rsquo;s alliances. Honest points are completely risk-free, but they&rsquo;re harder to accumulate. Cheater&rsquo;s alliance points are easy to accumulate, and accumulate faster when you have many players in your alliance. However, any member of an alliance can turn the other members of the alliance in and take the alliance's points, adding them to their honest score. So the question is, &ldquo;How far you trust a group of self-admitted cheaters?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Cheater&rsquo;s Game uses about five standard six-sided dice, two point trackers, a turn tracker, player score pawns, and several sets of cheater&rsquo;s alliance pawns.  The trackers and pawns you need to play are all available as a 284 KB PDF.&#10;&#10;Cheater&rsquo;s Game has fairly simple rules, but complex psychosocial dynamics. You could play it with children as young as 6 or 7, and use it as a tool for teaching ethical and social lessons. Cheater&rsquo;s Game is appropriate for Ages 12 and up without adult supervision. A 4-player game takes about 45 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;",

Realms of War plays like a real, epic battle with units, flanks and tactics.  There are no cards to collect as Realms of War is NOT a CCG; each set contains everything you need to immediately begin fighting fantasy battles.&#10;&#10;One of the big attractions of this game is the free, downloadable armies from several popular fantasy genres such as D&amp;D, Warhammer, Dragonlance and coming soon - Middle Earth!&#10;&#10;Available at http://biagamesonline.tripod.com&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Frome the website:&#10;&#10;Rugged Adventures is a unique approach to table top miniatures gaming. It is a mixture of skirmish wargaming and roleplaying. While must you command bodies of figures as in any miniature wargame you also play at least one character represented by a miniature on the playing surface (or set to use an appropriate movie term). This Player Represented Personality or PRP is required to act in accordance with a pre-determined character design, complete with special abilities, specific quirks, personal goals and a requirement for the gamer to take on all the characteristics they find attached to their particular miniature.&#10;&#10;It is a light hearted approach to tabletop games with a strong emphasis on fun and story-telling. The Rugged Adventures player is encouraged not to win the game but play the story. Often players are required by the GM to act up their actions or give an 'in character' verbal account of themselves. We want our players to laugh, shout, speak in silly accents and generally come away from a game having enjoyed themselves whether they won or lost.&#10;&#10;If I had to boil the design philosophy down to the essentials: Rugged Adventures is a game for those of us who love to build models, terrain and paint lots of figures-and still want to have a fast paced and fun game that doesn&rsquo;t bog down with complex detail. Think of the Pulp Genre itself, action oriented story telling where glaring holes in the plot are often an advantage, and then apply this same spirit to the table-top.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "DOGFIGHT @ ALAM HALFA&#10;Rommel's Strike for Cairo, Sept. 1942&#10;&#10;Rommel's last offensive in the desert was a compelling one. He knew his past successes were waning for a variety of reasons and that unless&#10;something changed, he would be at the end of his logistical tether. By August, 1942, he was fast approaching a turning point and he feared&#10;his luck might run out. Thus, once he secured promises of adequate fuel supplies that would be delivered by the Italian Navy and Luftwaffe,&#10;this Fox planned for a knock-out blow that some call Gazala II in strategy. A wide sweeping ride though sands of the desert during the&#10;night, a ride some 40 miles in the moonlight to rear of the British forces at Alam Halfa. Rommel chose the night to hide his movements, his&#10;intelligence indicated the mines were nil and no British forces were so far south. The Italian armor divisions, the Littorio and Ariete,&#10;with over 150 M13 tanks (its 47mm gun could knock out most of the British tanks) would help seal the flanks of the 15th and 21st Panzer&#10;Divisions (with over 100 tanks) along with the 90th Division. Rommel was banking on the British performance at Gazala, which showed when&#10;cut off, the British acted in a confused state. Once the pocket was dealt with, each panzer would strike for the Nile, Cairo and&#10;Alexandria. Besides, Hitler insisted Rommel attack.&#10;&#10;Each hex is one mile.&#10;AFV units equal 8 AFV&#10;Each turn is 4 hrs.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "DVD Spel van het Jaar (translation: DVD Game of the year) is a Dutch quizz boardgame. The game is published by Nova Carta BV in cooperation with the Dutch state television (NOS) ad a Dutch newspaper (De Telegraaf).&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect five different &lsquo;DVD-chips&rsquo; (blue, green, purple, red and yellow), winner is the player who is the first to do so. The chips can be earned by correctly answering questions from different categories such as sports, politics and showbizz.&#10;&#10;A die is used to move the players pawns around the board. If a pawn ends up on a small space, the player is asked a question from one of the cards. When the corect answer is given, the player can roll the die once more and move on. Whenever a pawn ends up on a &lsquo;DVD-space&rsquo;, the DVD is started and a randomly selected question is played on the TV screen. If the question is answerd correctly, the player recieves a DVD-chip.&#10;&#10;A yearly published DVD (starting whith 2007) can be used as an expansion to the base game, but can also be played as a seperate DVD-game.&#10;&#10;",
