The red crates are placed on the Subsidy card and the white ones on the Quarantine card. The time tokens are separated into three piles of three and put on the Zone Pass card.&#10;&#10;The green dice have different effects on the regions. For example, the actions fly, sail or collect sample can be blocked, a biohazard is ignored or a treat action is done in that region.&#10;&#10;At the begin of each turn, the current player rolls their blue die. That die allows to do a special move to a region where the green die has the same symbol in that turn once.&#10;&#10;The four action cards have special effects which cost a number of dice from the CDC.&#10;&#10;Zone Pass lets a player bypass the blocks from the green dice, Incubator allows to put removed infection dice back into the bag, Subsidy enables additional treat actions and Quarantine makes it possible to ignore biohazard symbols.&#10;&#10;After each epidemic, the green dice are rerolled.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Over a hundred years have passed since the humans have disappeared from the face of planet earth. Until now, robots have coexisted peacefully. But news that the earth's fuel has been running low, and greed for the fuel paired with fear of ending up in a junkyard has thrown the robots into a frenzy.&#10;&#10;To survive, you spend your time foraging for parts with which to build weapons and force fields for protection.&#10;&#10;Robot Ridge is a fast-paced, take that card game with several unique mechanics including custom designed robots, machine building to improve abilities, and scheming against enemy robots (see below).&#10;&#10;Set-up:&#10;Players choose  three cards to build their unique robot- head, body, and feet (or foot).&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;On your turn, draft two cards from the junkyard and then play your cards in order to build shields, steal cards from other robots, or blow them to bits.&#10;&#10;As your robot gets damaged, you will lose abilities to play certain cards. Damaged feet mean you can't explore to find robot parts to repair your robot. A damaged body means you can't shoot at opponent robots.&#10;&#10;Scheming. As fewer and fewer cards in your hand can be played due to your damaged robot, you can still use them to &quot;scheme&quot; against other robots. To scheme, place a card face down in front of them. Once three cards (from you or other robots) have been schemed against them, they must immediately take damage to part of their robot. Of course, if they happen to think, they get to remove the cards schemed against them and put them into their hand to use later... possibly against you!&#10;&#10;The last robot standing wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The two operations were both planned and executed quickly, and with almost disastrous results. The fighting on Crete was vicious, and the casualties among the German forces so great that it caused the cancellation of the last of the above operations -&ldquo; the invasion of Malta. Unlike the invasion of Crete, which was rushed and undertaken against numerically superior Allied forces, the invasion of Malta was very well planned, and would have been done with overwhelming numbers. It is indeed fortunate for the Allied war effort that the operation was cancelled.&#10;&#10;",

F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms roar off the carrier decks looking for Soviet Backfire and Badger bombers while underwater Victor and Sturgeon submarines duel. In the merchant lanes, loaded tankers make their way from the US to Japan, stalked by submarines and the Soviet fleet. Somewhere in Hawaii, a Soviet spy transmits the location of a carrier group to the Soviets, and a RORSAT satellite whizzes overhead looking for its target.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Pacific &ndash; the US problem is the great distance involved fighting thousands of miles from home, whilst the Soviets fight on their doorstep, though with the chance of their airfields and ports being destroyed &ndash; even then, the main Soviet Pacific ocean &lsquo;warm water&rsquo; port of Petropavlovsk, being remote, has no rail or road access and must be supplied by sea &ndash; the Soviet fleet will have to take up this challenge. Vietnam also &ndash; a 5 day cruise from Vladivostok &ndash; must be supplied by sea.&#10;&#10;The US will hope that Japan will make their forces available &ndash; but what if the Soviets have arranged for neutrality? If neutrality cannot be arranged will the Soviets take the initiative and destroy the Japanese air on the ground?&#10;&#10;China states its neutrality, but could join either side &ndash; perhaps choosing this moment to make their move for Taiwan, or to stay neutral &ndash; if they do will the Soviets invade and solve the Chinese communist problem once and for all?&#10;&#10;And what of North Korea &ndash; eager to profit from a fight but answering to both China and the Soviets; a South Korean victory could be disastrous here &ndash; if war is declared, US marines and convoys must not get through!&#10;&#10;Blue Water Navy: The Pacific covers the action from the West coast of the USA over to Vietnam and is the sister game of Blue Water Navy, which covers Europe.

    "Description": "The Stormy Seas expansion for Tranquility consists of three mini-expansions that significantly change the level of difficulty as well as introducing a nice variety of rule changes that make the game even more replayable.&#10;&#10;1. Jagged Rocks: The game begins with the Jagged Rocks card placed randomly on one of the six border cards on the left-hand side of the grid; this row is considered as temporarily impenetrable so no cards may be placed into it.&#10;&#10;2. Sea Monsters: The game begins with three, four or five Sea Monster cards shuffled into the deck before it is dealt out to players (depending on the level of difficulty the players wish to add). On their turn the player may play their Sea Monster card into the grid by placing it on top of any previously played card. The Sea Monster destroys the card and then both cards are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;3. Storm &amp; Compass: The game begins with six Storm cards shuffled into the deck. The six Compass cards are placed to the side of the playing area. A player resolves a Storm card as soon as it is drawn.&#10;&#10;Yellow Storm: The player places the Yellow Storm card face up in front of them and immediately discards down to three cards which is their new hand limit until the Storm card is removed.&#10;&#10;Purple Storm: The player places the Purple Storm on one of the six border cards on the left-hand side of the grid on a row with at least one empty space. This marks the entire row as temporarily impenetrable so no cards may be placed into it.&#10;&#10;Orange Storm: The player places the Orange Storm card face up in front of them. For all future turns the player may now only 1. Play next to an existing card, discarding the appropriate number of cards as per the usual rules or 2. Discard two cards.&#10;&#10;Compass: Compass cards may be played to help the players navigate the Storms and remove playing restrictions. Compass cards may be acquired in three different ways: 1. When the start card is played, the players earn one Compass card to use. 2. By filling an entire row with consecutive cards (e.g. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) and 3. If a player chooses to discard their whole hand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game plays very well alone, but you can also play it with several other players.&#10;&#10;If you play in pairs, one can be the fox and the other the hare. Which of the two will find the most suitable surfaces in his environment? You always alternate between the two and try to find as many surfaces as possible in each picture. Each surface is a point. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;If there are several players, the cards are placed in the middle as a stack. Each player may draw one card per turn and must then find a suitable surface for both fox and hare. If he succeeds, he may keep the card. If not, he must place the card on a new pile next to the card pile. If the pile is used up, the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook (translated)&#10;&#10;",

It includes two new 8&quot; x 22&quot; geomorphic mapboards (k and l) and eight new scenarios set in locales such as China, Burma, Java, and New Guinea.&#10;&#10;Expansion Pack #2 continues the introduction of the Japanese begun in ASL Starter Kit #4, this time with new opponents. Expansion Pack #2 also adds new rules to introduce players to the Chinese and to overlays. Ordnance and Vehicle Notes for the weapons used in the scenarios are also included.&#10;&#10;However, unlike previous installments of ASL Starter Kit, Expansion Pack #2 does not come with everything you need to play!!!&#10;&#10;Expansion Pack #2 assumes ownership of the core ASLSK modules Starter Kit #1, Starter Kit #2, Starter Kit #3, and Starter Kit #4. While Expansion Pack #2 includes counters for Chinese, Japanese, British, Filipino, and Dutch units, it relies upon these core Starter Kit modules to provide additional unit and information counters, thus giving players a low-cost method for introducing the Chinese and for expanding the range of combat in the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The figure can subsequently recover his kpinga if the launch was successful. Removing the weapon takes 1 Action. The figure killed by this weapon should not be removed unless it is exchanged for a marker so players know where the kpinga is when they come to recover it. Kpinga is a melee weapon if in melee.&#10;&#10;Witchdoctor - A Witchdoctor works like a standard bearer and a musician at the same time. His MV is 5.&#10;&#10;Marksmen.

But without formal discipline Maori were more dependent on their leaders. With the loss of a chief a war party would likely flee even on the brink of victory. To reflect this Maori Leaders count 4 (instead of 3) as per Breakpoiny.&#10;&#10;Tupara (double barrel shotguns). These weapons can fire twice before reloading. If the second shot is fired in the same activation it can only be fired at the same target that get a -1 on Firing Damage test. This reflects that the British usually went flat after the first shot because they expected the second shot.&#10;&#10;Hand weapons - They are melee weapons and allow a re-roll in melee.&#10;&#10;Bayonets - Re-loading a Muzzle loading musket takes longer if bayonet is fixed. Add 1 to re-loading time when bayonet is fixed. Miniatures are supposed to start the game with unfixed bayonets. Bayonets can be fixed with one action, it can be also a Group Action.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Most youngsters play at 'dogfights' with model aircraft clenched in their hands, but this form of play does not even attempt to simulate reality. The adult wargamer requires something rather more sophisticated but, until now, the major problem has been recreating the third dimension. Happily, thanks to Mike Spick's unique system, the problem is now resolved for all time.&#10;&#10;In these pages you will find data and proven playing rules enabling you to fight an individual combat between, say, a Spitfire and a Bf 109; a multi-fighter melee;the interception of a wave of bombers; a dive-bomber attack with a Stuka; a valiant 'Stringbag' attack on a battleship; a bombing raid; or even a kamikaze attack if you feel so inclined!&#10;&#10;The book includes playing suggestions, in fact, for all forms of aerial combat during World War 2, including night fighting with radar; scenario suggestions for aerial campaigns using a miniature 'ops room'; and ideas for solo games.&#10;&#10;Included in the text are extensive data tables giving necessary facts on dozens of representative aircraft types of all main nationalities, and you can control your own aircraft from take-off to touch-down, climbing, diving, looping, firing your machine-guns or cannon and, hopefully, sending your opponent down in flames.&#10;&#10;Although aerial wargaming must, of necessity, be more complex in some ways than straightforward land battles, the author's lively style makes this book a pleasure to read.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The only thing exactly like fighting against a Messerschmitt 109 with a Spitfire I in 1940 is fighting against a Messerschmitt 109 with a Spitfire I in 1940 . . . Nevertheless, [this] air combat simulation probably comes as close as any game can to giving the 'feel' of what air combat is really like.&#10;&#10;&mdash;quote from the foreword&#10;&#10;160-page illustrated hardback book with color dust jacket. The major chapters include principles of Flight; Combat flying, aerobatics, and tactics; Compromise and the needs of wargaming; Observation; Aerial gunnery; Air-to-ground and ground-to-air; The table-top game; Large-scale air warfare; Campaign details; and Simulating night fighting. Statistics are provided for various World War II fighter and bomber aircraft fielded by Britain, America, France, Russia, Germany, Italy, and Japan.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Die Zombie-J&auml;gers is another gaming supplement for the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombie rules - the post post-apocalyptic Renaissance zombie survival game.&#10;&#10;The setting is a quiet rural area as yet untouched by the undead plague. &#10;Here life can still be hard - but in the good years an adequate living can be made. If the crops are blighted however, or the livestock fall ill, shortages are keenly felt - and cattle are beginning to die, disfigured by signs of putrefaction - even before death. &#10;None in the village can remember seeing anything working with such ghastly haste on these precious animals. &#10;Now fear begins its work. &#10;Not just fear of another winter without food but fear that perhaps the first signs of the pestilence is beginning to show. First it is the animals that suffer - what next? The people? As piles of infected carcasses burn and stinking black smoke rises into the air, many begin to wonder - what has brought on this misfortune? Who is responsible for this outbreak of corruption - and who is going to stop it?&#10;&#10;Included in this booklet are three new scenarios, two new characters, lots of new events and new zombies to try (well they're actually pretty old and mouldy now!). First of these characters is the Verdorben - corrupted individuals, obsessed by the undead menace and convinced that they can draw power from the same well-spring of evil that maintains the undead. Although these individuals may look like any other survivor, they can bring the taint of the undead and the risk of infection into any community. This insidious threat means that none can truly be trusted.&#10;&#10;Second of these new characters are the hunters of evil and corruption - the J&auml;gers. So fanatical are these finders of evil that the Verdorben truly fear them. Unfortunately the fanaticism of these hunters also leads to the persecution of the innocent and many have perished at the hands of the over-zealous. Exemplary behaviour and outward displays of faith are not always sufficient to withstand the questioning gaze of the J&auml;ger. The finger of suspicion pointed by a jealous neighbour can quickly lead to denouncement, imprisonment and the terrible process of &quot;investigation&quot;.&#10;&#10;So these new threats are lethal indeed, be it from the hidden menace of the Verdorben or the ruthless and deadly accusations of the J&auml;gers. Survivors may long for the days when the threat was more obvious. All that a survivor used to need was a stout leather jacket, a trusty halberd and a dozen zombies would fall decapitated before their slicing blade. Now the threat is more sinister, a whispered accusation in the wrong ear, some malicious gossip or perhaps a settling of old scores - one wrong word and the once heroic survivor can be brought low. So don your armour, buckle up your sword, shove a big heavy pistol in your belt and get ready for battle. Trust no one, especially your friends and if any Zombie -J&auml;gers ask for help with their inquiries - think very, very carefully before answering.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Lost Valley Survivors is the second gaming supplement for the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombie rules and contains six new linked missions, new event cards, new armour and weapons - and lots of new zombie types to try them out on! The Lost Valley is set in a post-apocalyptic Renaissance world where rational thought and burgeoning scientific practice is being dragged back to a darker world of fear and suspicion and of course the terrifying undead plague.&#10;&#10;Since the coming of the plague, the survivors yearn for peace and time spent away from the constant threat of der Auferstandene. The greatest menace comes from the &quot;plague city&quot;, that deadweight of evil that burdens the living struggling to survive. Many believe that if they could only escape this land and its malevolent influence they could find peace. Constant patrols are sent out into the wider countryside, always in the hope of finding a land untainted. Dangerous and gruelling though this work is, it must be continued. A recent patrol has returned with news of a secluded valley. Quiet, unoccupied and ready for settlement, this could provide a new home for those wishing to escape. Within a few short weeks, a powerful expeditionary force has been mobilised and sets out to find this land, a land that promises peace and freedom and hope. Could this hidden valley provide shelter and a measure of protection from the harsh realities of the outside world. If this place has managed so far to escape this deadly plague, could it not hold out still further if properly organised and defended?&#10;&#10;Only brave and dedicated survivors need apply for this mission, the risks are sure to be great but surely the rewards will be even greater!&#10;&#10;",

This great city succumbed to its final assault. Armies it could humiliate, besiegers it could resist, but against the cold fury of the dead it could not hold out. Thirty thousand inhabitants stared into the faces of the dead and knew that the end had come. Few escaped the slaughter...&#10;&#10;Now the living, the survivors, shun this place. Death awaits those that return to the city, death or worse! Smoke and the stench of decay arise from this accursed place. Grey and ragged figures make their shambling progression through ruined streets in an endless quest for living flesh, their blood-caked mouths, dry, shuddering, craving. And yet some survivors look on this forbidding city as a potential source of great wealth. What use to the dead have for the riches of the church, the fine merchant houses and sumptuous palaces? Surely an expedition into this damned city would be worth it. Risky, yes - but rewarding - surely! And for players valiant enough to risk the Plague City, a host of new &quot;event-cards&quot; await to trip-up and challenge these survivors brave enough to enter.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rotting Renaissance Regiments is the third gaming supplement for the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombies rules and it contains new scenarios, new event cards and a whole bunch of new zombie types to try out. There is also a section on converting your Renaissance figures into menacing, mouldy musketeers as seen on the front cover!&#10;&#10;Now please don't be alarmed by the sight of gun-totting zombies on the front of this supplement. We are not suggesting that these undead beasts have the wit to use these weapons properly. We are not messing with the time-honoured notion of mindless flesh-eating zombies. So rest assured, these zombies are still mindless and still flesh eating. Its just that some of them are still clinging to the weapons that they once used in life. If these guns are fired, they are most likely to miss, or hit another zombie and in any case the gun is probably being held the wrong way round! And as for the chances of reloading - you can forget it!!&#10;&#10;Rotting Regiments describes the final descent of once proud and powerful regiments as the terrible undead plague finally takes hold. As the last shreds of humanity ebb away a residue of former prowess remains. Will these accursed warriors manage one final flourish of military excellence before the all consuming hunger for human flesh takes hold? All that the survivors can bank on is that the battle for survival remains desperate and unremitting - and is not made any easier by the arrival of Rotting Renaissance Regiments.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Something Zombie This Way Comes is another gaming supplement designed for the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombie rules.&#10;&#10;Inside this booklet players will find four new scenarios linked by a continuous storyline and populated by a host of new characters and new threats.&#10;&#10;For years, troupes of travelling entertainers have moved from village to town to isolated hamlet - bringing a taste of exotic excitement to otherwise dreary lives. Always eagerly anticipated by the populace, these travelling shows were less enthusiastically received by the authorities who considered them to be nothing more than an excuse for sin and debauchery. In the village of Osthof one such troupe would arrive every year, emerging in the autumn gloom, at first a twinkling of lights far along the east road, then the faint sounds of pipe and drum. By the time the caravan rolled into the village, an excited crowd of children would already have assembled to welcome these new arrivals. But since the coming of the terrible undead plague - such visits have stopped. Now such distractions have ended and the survivors must focus on the grim business of their daily lives. Or at least, that is what they thought. After some years of absence, once again the gloom of a quiet autumn evening is pierced by twinkling lights on the road. Surely this cannot signal the arrival of another travelling troupe? How would they have survived on the road? What news will they bring from the outside? What sort of trouble will they stir-up in the village? Again, the villagers await the arrival of these exotic strangers with a mixture of apprehension and excitement. Do the survivors have an innate sense about these things, a feeling of foreboding and hidden menace? Well, you can bet that the more cynical and hard-bitten survivors will view these strangers with considerable caution - alert to the threat of infection from the deadly plague that these travellers might bring. If there is the slightest risk to the community, the survivors will have to fight this new threat or face losing everything.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "These rules are generic, in that they will be useable for any era wargame.&#10;&#10;The rules are in pdf format and you can find them in the files section of this page.&#10;&#10;Like me, you are likely a war gamer who owns dozens of board games spanning from the 'Age of Sail' era to modern times. You have tactical games, operational ones, and a few grand strategic monsters. Yet each play is isolated with no meaning beyond the satisfaction of winning. Each victory is unconnected to others. Not any more.&#10;&#10;Winning any one of your tabletop games earns you or your opponent one Command Point. (Command &amp; Control) The Points are also earned during game-play when certain events happen.  For instance, the capture of a city/town earns a Point. The sinking of a major warship wins a point or successful bombing mission by heavy bombers against an enemy target wins one.&#10;&#10;The 'Master Game' depicted by my rules can include all of your tabletop games, miniatures play, and even video games. The idea is that each play represents a battle for a specific locale in the 'outer game'. Winning any of your games, and the points that success wins, drives your forces forward. It doesn't matter what era your tabletop game is, victory earns a Command &amp; Control Point.&#10;&#10;For example, if the 'Master Game' is to be WW2, you will track success of each of the War Powers of that era. War Power nations would be Germany, Great Britain, USA, Commonwealth, Italy, Russia, and Japan. Even playing solitaire works, since my rules don't require an opponent for use.&#10;&#10;If you choose to personally lead Great Britain, all the other nations would be lead by NPC characters.   These are Non-Player Characters. The points they win are kept note of in your records of the 'Umbrella War'. Those Points will come back in later tabletop games to give one side or the other the benefit of a die roll modifier, or die re-rolls.&#10;&#10;In your play you would have a Strategic Leader for each major power nation in the war. If you wish, the 'Umbrella Game' can be set in any era. Age of Sail enthusiasts will have Kings and Emperors. Civil War players could have President Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson opposing him. You could play out WW1 or WW2 history.  Modern war play is also easily incorporated in my concept.&#10;&#10;You can use NPC Officers as Operational Level commanders for army, navy, and air forces. Optionally, these officers can collect Points when they succeed in their missions. Each play of one of your games represents an engagement between two of the War Powers. That game can be a Strategic, Operational, or Tactical game - with the same effect at the end. a Command Point for the winner. If you want to track individual Operational commanders, you would assign NPC officers for both sides in each game played. Before starting a new tabletop game, you consult your notes and compare the Points for each officer.&#10;&#10;The side or Operational officer with the higher Points wins a die roll modifier for combat in the tabletop game about to start. Command Points won are accumulated in your 'Master Game' records. Individual game-play is meaningless any more. The concept is ideal for group or club play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "More historical zombie mayhem with Patriots &amp; Loyalists &amp; Zombies - the zombie survival game set during the American Revolution:&#10;&#10;The Zombie Apocalypse has moved from the Old World to the New. As a new country struggles to emerge from revolution and civil war, it's very independence is now threatened  by a force savage and deadly. In deep forests and lonely outposts, amongst the piles of fallen heroes a new danger twitches into life. This terrible threat possesses a hunger that cannot be satisfied - a craving for living human flesh that knows no bounds. The dead are beginning to walk again and no one is safe. Will the old divisions of loyalty and patriotism still persist? Or will humankind bury it's differences and join forces against the undead plague? Only you can decide!&#10;&#10;This game is based on the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombies rules (the Renaissance post-apocalyptic survival game) but is set during the time of the American War of Independence. The rules have the same basic mechanics as the previous set but obviously have a very different historical &quot;feel&quot;. There are of course new weapons and new characters (and unfortunately for these survivors - far less armour!) There are also new scientific ideas which may hold an explanation or a way of countering the vile undead.&#10;&#10;But some say that the deadliest threat still comes from mankind's inexhaustible capacity to destroy itself. Will the warring parties fighting for king or independence continue their struggle or stand together against this new danger? The Zombie History of the world continues with Patriots &amp; Loyalists &amp; Zombies...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sulphur can be used to fight enjoyable one-off SF games using easy to organise forces of varying points cost. Alternately, players can opt for a longer series of joined-up battles against an opponent where success or failure will not be determined by one encounter but by a series of battles.&#10;&#10;This is where the Sulphur Campaign rules come in. Here players can fight a series of interlinked battles that require strategic as well as tactical thinking. Problems of supply, resources and territory will have to be dealt with as well as the more usual concerns - such as smashing-up your enemy! In a campaign game, players must build up as many resources as possible, to increase the size and strength of their faction. As the opposing group will be trying to do the same thing, players will have to deploy their forces in the most effective way to counter this threat.&#10;&#10;Sulphur Campaign has added a lot more background detail to the Sulphur World. A lively, unusual and often grim post-apocalyptic world that covers such elements as -&#10;Trading, Scavenging, Spoils of War, Repairs, Ammo and Food supply, Tithes and Protection Money (from bigger meaner factions), the influence of the Church (only if you have paid your tithe), Shaman, Random Events, the Calendar (seasons of the Sulphur year) and the Weather (its usually not very nice!).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The goal of the Action Game is to get rid of all cards as quickly as possible. Deal 5 cards to each player, and put the rest in a face-down stack. A starting card from the top of the face-down stack is turned face-up on the table. Each player takes turns playing a card on top of the face-up stack, which must match either the symbol, color, or number of the current top card in that stack. If you don't have a matching card, you have to draw from the face-down stack. There are action cards which trigger changes in the game when played. Minimum number of players is 2.&#10;&#10;It also comes with a second set of rules for the same 32 cards, called Happy Families or Quartets. The goal of this game is to collect as many families as possible (groups of 4 cards that belong together). With 2 players, deal 10 cards to each player, and place the remaining 12 cards in a face-down stack. One player begins by asking for a certain card; they must already have at least one card from that family. If the opponent does not have that card, then the player picks up the top card from the stack, and then it is the other player's turn. Or with 3 or more players, deal out all the cards equally among the players; and a player can continue asking for cards from selected opponents until they make a mistake (asking for a card that the person asked doesn't have). Whoever collects the most sets of 4 wins.&#10;&#10;--user summary&#10;&#10;",
