    "Description": "Introduction:&#10;The compassionate bodhisattva has made a decree, seeing who can blast across the universe and reach enlightenment the fastest! Sugoroku is a classic game of moving pieces according to the roll of the dice, but dice won&rsquo;t be needed in this cosmic high-speed sugoroku race game!&#10;&#10;Gameplay summary:&#10;Players try to be the first to move from the start space to the finish space. In each round, players simultaneously show one card from their hand indicating the number of spaces they wish to move. If their played card is unique, then they move; otherwise, they do not. All played cards are passed clockwise, and players in last will then sacrifice a card from their hand to make a small movement.&#10;&#10;JP Introduction:&#10;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#143;&#169;&#232;&#150;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#133;&#136;&#230;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#183;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#128;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#134;&#182;&#229;&#141;&#131;&#228;&#184;&#135;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#166;&#130;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#129; &#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#233;&#159;&#179;&#233;&#128;&#159;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#174;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

Typically, a separate player acts as a Reader by reading out loud from a separate deck. Players then deduce from what is read which card on display is the target, and move swiftly.&#10;&#10;In this game of Shingon Karuta, the designer aimed to improve the education of Buddhist iconography. There is a deck of Bodhisattva cards and a deck of Shingon cards.  A Bodhiattva is a person on the path to Buddhahood, and such people are widely depicted in temple artwork, in sculpture and painting. Shingon Buddhism is one of the main schools in Japan, and the Shingon deck has sections of mantras that relate to specific Bodhisattva images.&#10;&#10;As the Shingon card is read out, each player tries to identify the matching Bodhisattva card and snatch it or keep it.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 2017, but revised in 2019 to unify the artwork to one style. The designer realised that players could simply learn the deck by the different style of artworks, and not by learning the actual Bodhisattvas. By making all the art unified, the game becomes much harder.&#10;&#10;In 2018, the designer published an explansion set of 10 more Bodhisattva cards and 10 matching Shingon cards. Players could just play with this expansion set alone. This deck was integrated into the 2019 edition too.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Event cards are the 5th type and are randomly chosen and scattered throughout the main deck.

    "Description": "Storm and Steel Second Wave&nbsp;is a fast-paced action-packed expansion featuring West German forces defending their country against Czech and Soviet invaders. Basing these expansions on the action and forces from the novel, Storm and Steel Second Wave &ndash; the Final Line adds TWO NEW COUNTER SHEETS and THREE NEW MAPS to your World At War 85 forces.&#10;&#10;Now you can fight using the platoons and batteries of the Czech Army as they charge into Southwest Germany heading for the Rhine and the French border. You will also find additional West German forces to try and slow or stop them! And you get TWO COMPLETE NATIONAL UNIT TABLES to go with these additional fighting forces, so you can design your own scenarios with them, or add them to units from the main game, Storming the Gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The three new maps will give you the experience of fighting your WaW85 forces in the close-in terrain of southwestern Germany, south, and east of Regensburg: an entirely different battlefield &ldquo;feel.&rdquo; You will fight at knife-fight ranges on maps of a real section of the hilly and heavily forested areas there, and adapted specifically for World At War 85 play. The three SUMMER MAPS of the six maps herein, when configured in a specific pattern, display the actual fighting area surrounding Grafling, West Germany. The other six are WINTER VERSIONS, where any line of sight benefits of obscuring crops of cultivated terrain are gone and wilted, and so presents a whole different battle arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;The maps have ever so slight adjustments that also make them GEOMORPHIC, and so fully compatible with any other map in the World At War 85 series of games. Just line up the short edge or long edge of any of these maps to any other map in the series to create your own Forward Edge of the Battle Area.&#10;&#10;SIX SCENARIOS ARE INCLUDED, depicting actions described in or implied by the narrative in the Novel Storm and Steel. You can fight West German Captain Mohr&rsquo;s 1st company of the 244th Mountain Tank Battalion yourself and see if you can do better than in the novel!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Nefarious Neighbor expansion opens the Runes &amp; Regulations game up to 5-8 players, and it completely changes the dynamics. In this expansion, a dark sorcerer with horrifying powers (and intentions) moves into the neighborhood, forcing other players to decide whether to team up or continue to quibble. The Nefarious Neighbor steals Creatures from other players and performs dark rituals to mutate them into frightening beasts. That neighbor plays with their own standalone deck (included in the expansion pack) which includes Corrupted Creatures, Curses, and Dark Runes.&#10;&#10;The Nefarious Neighbor&rsquo;s powers are so immense that their Corrupted Creatures cannot be destroyed, hexed, or stolen; however, the expansion also includes cards to shuffle into the Main Deck to help other players fight back and thwart that neighbor&rsquo;s villainous plans.&#10;&#10;One of the most interesting parts of the Nefarious Neighbor expansion is the introduction of player role cards. In addition to the Nefarious Neighbor, other players will have the opportunity to take on a new role (in secret). These roles provide you with a second win condition that nobody else knows about, giving you the opportunity to surprise your neighbors with an unexpected victory. Since only the Nefarious Neighbor&rsquo;s role is known, each other player around the table is left to wonder what role their opponents might secretly be playing. These roles include things like Mr. Griffin (who wins if they successfully summons 3 Griffins), the Henchman (who wins if the Nefarious Neighbor wins and Henchman has no creatures on their Lawn), and the Humane Sorcerer (who wins by successfully saving a Stray Dog or Alley Cat).&#10;&#10;Runes &amp; Regulations by itself is a super fun and interactive game, and we designed it to stand entirely alone. I say this because the game really works without the expansion, and we didn&rsquo;t even start working on the expansion until we had the original game completely finished and play tested. Getting to add on this expansion was a dream, though, and getting the opportunity to actually make it a reality because of the support so far on this project is incredibly exciting. The introduction of this expansion just makes the game so much more dynamic (and really creates two different games).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Frank Buck was a well-known big game trapper who wrote a 1930 book, Bring 'Em Back Alive. In this game there are twelve books of three cards. Each book represents an animal that Fran Buck has brought back alive from the jungles or a scene illustrating adventures on his expeditions. The books are made by fitting the three cards together in the proper way to form a complete picture. The  center card of each book has the name of the book at the top and a red number. The other two cards of each book have some descriptive or leading phrase that gives a clue to its proper book without revealing the name.&#10;&#10;Players draw a card to determine the dealer. The higher number deals. Players are dealt three cards face up. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center. The dealer plays first. He looks over all the cards to determine whether or not a book may be made up from the cards showing. If  the dealed can make up a book, he selects the proper cards and places them in front of him. His turn is complete and play passes to the player on his left. If the dealer can not make up a book, he draws one card from the top of the center pile and tries to make up a book. If successful, he places the book in front of him. If unsuccessful in making up a book, the card drawn is discarded face up.  In either case his turn ends and play passes to the left. The player to the left then has the same option as the dealer plus he may use the card which has been discarded. The following general rules apply. A player may get only one book in a turn. After the three original cards a player does not replace any cards which may be drawn from his hand. If a player discards the third card of any book (not realizing that it made a book), any other player may call the name of the animal and pick up the book with out interfering with his turn. When the cards in the pack have all been drawn the discard pile is turned over and used again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The game includes a game board like a checker board with a red borderline around one-half and a blue borderline around the other half. There are 24 special chips resembling poker chips that are red on one side and blue on the other. Each player places 12 chips in two rows of six on the first and second row of his side of the board leaving a vacant square to the left and to the right. The player on the red side places chips red side up. The player on the blue side places chips blue side up.&#10;&#10;The players' objective is to move their chips across the board to occupy the same positions as the opponent's starting chips. Each turn a player may move one chip one space to an empty square in any direction. A player may also jump an opponent's chip that is adjacent provided there is an empty square behind the chip. Similar to a king in checkers, multiple jumps may be made in a single turn in any direction including diagonally. A player may never jump his own chip. Whenever a diagonal jump is made, the player flips the opponent's chip over to his color and this becomes his chip. Reducing the opponent's number of chips to less than 12 prevents the opponent from winning until he acquires 12 chips again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each player rolls the pair of dice. High number starts and play continues clockwise.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into matches. A match is won by the first player to fill a GREEN square. The chips are moved from START to the GREEN area in their lane according to the roll of the dice. One chip can be moved the total of the dice or each die can be used separately to move two chips. A seven must be split except when chips are in the PURPLE area (see next paragraph). On a roll of doubles the player may move or take the POT if there are any chips in the POT (See RED in next paragraph). To &quot;Ricochet&quot; means to reverse direction while moving one chip. In order to land in the GREEN the count must be exact. If the roll would take the chip beyond the double line, the chip can be reversed at the double line. The winner of a match takes all the chips in play from all players except those chips on START or GREEN. The game is over when one player has filled all five of his GREEN squares. The game winner takes all the chips in play except those on START. The ultimate winner is the player with the most chips.&#10;&#10;Each section contains areas of colored squares. A chip cannot remain in the RED area. It must be put in the POT. The WHITE area is safe. Chips may remain in WHITE and be moved when the player wishes. A chip in the BLUE area is safe until another player places a chip in the BLUE. The first player must then surrender his chip to that player. A chip in the PURPLE area must move before a chip in the WHITE, BLUE or START. If there is more than one chip in the PURPLE, the one nearest the GREEN must move first. Chips in PURPLE must use the total on the dice to move one chip. A chip in the ORANGE area is lost and remains frozen until the match is over.&#10;&#10;",

First, a players can win by landing on the space that says &quot;Your Turnkey Got Your Product Out. You're a Winner&quot;. If players overshoot the space, they continue around the board again. Second, players can agree to a time limit and the player that has traveled around the board the most times wins. There are scores sheet to keep track of progress.

    "Description": "SLAMORAMA! is a crazy and I mean crazy wrestling card game that will engage your full mental capacity as much as it will tickle your funny bone. Two to four players can brawl in this mental slap-stick game as they pit their moves against each other. You start out by picking one of four wacky wrestlers; &quot;Glittersaurus Wrecks&quot;, &quot;Mountain Man Rick&quot;, &quot;El Alacran&quot;, or &quot;The She-E-O&quot; with their arsenal of insane moves to take out their opponents. Whoever wins the most cards wins the game and you do that by collecting the most tricks. (Publisher Description)&#10;&#10;Slamorama is a 2-4 player wrestling card game from Binary Cocoa! Players all play their best moves against each other to win rounds, and whoever wins the most rounds by the time the cards are gone wins the game!&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;1. Each player is given a deck of 13 cards that consists of wrestling moves like punches or slaps or suplexes. 1 is the strongest &quot;move&quot; card, while 7 is the weakest.&#10;&#10;2. Players then count to three and throw down what they think will be the strongest move, and whoever that is wins the round! On a tie players throw down an additional card until someone finally wins. No one wins the round if the tie occurs on the last round.&#10;&#10;3. Rounds go until all players decks are empty, and whoever wins the most rounds wins!&#10;&#10;Special Features:&#10;1. Each wrestler has a signature move that fits their persona. For example. Mountain Man Rick's Special move is the Salmon Slam. He literally picks people up and swings them around like a bear on the Snake River. Glittersaurus Wrecks special move is the rise and shine. She will lift you up just to bring you down. Very down.&#10;&#10;2. The game allows for future expansions that will provide more wrestlers! We are planning on calling this first edition the &quot;Red Deck&quot;, and (pending successful funding) we will be coming out with a &quot;Green Deck&quot;. The Green Deck will have all new wrestlers so that you can combine decks and have up to 8 players in a game.&#10;&#10;Alternate Game Modes:&#10;In a standard game of Slamorama each player gets a deck of 13 cards and can have 4 in their hand that they can look at. Each full deck of Slamorama comes with two additional gameplay modes that include the following:&#10;&#10;Full Deck Mode - Where you have all 13 cards in your hand and can look at them. Saves time from having to draw cards. Gives more &quot;tactical advantage&quot;.&#10;&#10;Tag Team Mode - Players choose a partner and play their cards together against opponents to win rounds! They cannot look at or tell each other what they are going to throw down however. Fun with bigger groups!&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;52 cards (13 for each wrestler)&#10;&#10;3 rule cards (each with a unique way of playing the game)&#10;&#10;1 tuck box to hold the cards.&#10;&#10;",

Shodo art learners must have discipline and observe the techniques in each lesson taught by their master. Therefore, in this game, each player is an apprentice of this art, and therefore must execute the lessons passed by his master, joining the pieces that contain traces of traces, forming the calligraphic drawings required by one of the lessons.&#10;&#10;Each player, on his turn, must manage his amount of paint, produced in his Suzuri, which will serve to acquire new pieces of strokes that complete his calligraphic designs or start new ones. The available pieces are renewed on the table as the players use them. Calligraphic drawing lesson cards are arranged randomly with each game, and players must observe the strategy of the other players to try to complete the lessons before the others, which will give them more points.&#10;&#10;Completing a calligraphic drawing may not be as simple as doing so requires completing all the strokes already started. Once a drawing is completed and is also compatible with one of the available lessons (requirements may consist of the number of strokes, the shape of the drawing, or even the level of detail), the player may place one of his markers in that lesson. The first to place, in addition to receiving more points, make it impossible for the latter to place markers in the lessons.&#10;&#10;Once all the lessons have been completed by at least one person, the game will be over, and it will be the winner who made the most points, obtained through the complexity of their calligraphic designs and the accomplishment of the lessons.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player in turn selects an apartment or house and places the Home Marker with the long piece atop on it and pays the bank the rent or lease. each player in turn takes the long piece from atop the Home Marker and places it in the yellow circle marked &quot; Downtown and rolls the die. If a 5 or 6 is rolled the player draws a Direction card and follows the instructions which may mean moving the piece to a specific place and paying an amount to the bank. If a 1, 2 or 4 is rolled, the player moves his playing piece in any direction along the marked street one red dot for each count. The objective is to get the playing piece back to the Home Marker to increase salary.

Players dig fossils from the central deck and exhibit their finds in different sections as per their type, time period or region. A section with at least 2 dinosaurs is considered complete. While digging 1 card is free, players can pay and dig more in the same turn. For this, they may gather money by selling fossils that they may not use to the market. Other players may also find what they need in the market and can buy from there as well. If a player completes 3 different sections or exhibits 5 dinosaurs within 1 section, the game ends. To determine the winner, all players calculate the total value of their exhibited fossils plus any remaining cash plus bonus points for the diversity of their collections.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The games' cards represent inmates, guards, warnings resulting from audits of the experiment, and the guards' &quot;curriculum&quot;.&#10;&#10;Cards played to the trick may affect an inmates ego or body.  At the end of a round it is possible for an inmates' ego to reach 0, meaning their &quot;education&quot; is complete.  If an inmates body reaches 0, they are considered to have died and an audit is initiated.  Warnings will be issued for various curriculum cards which were played.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the winner will be the player who scored the most points by completing the &quot;education&quot; of inmates.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a score sheet and pencil. The decks of alphabet cards and category cards are shuffled. One player selects five alphabet cards at random and players copy these letters on their score sheets. One player draws a category card at random and players enter this on their score sheets. The timer is set and play begins.&#10;&#10;Players write down words that apply to the category and whose last or major name begins with each of the selected letters. When time runs out each discloses the name he has written under each of the five letters. If only one player used a particular name, he scores 3 points. If two players use the same name, they score 2 points. If three or more players use the same name, they score 1 point. If a player did not write down a name for a letter, they do not score a point. After the first category is completed, the procedure is repeated until five different categories have been played. The player with the highest total points over all five categories is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "NIWI is similar in scoring to the game &quot;The First 5,000&quot; but it involves movement on a game board where a player may land their piece on a space occupied by an opponent's piece sending the opponent's piece backward on the board and reducing the opponent's score.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to achieve the highest score over 5,000 by throwing scoring combinations of six dice. Players move playing pieces counter-clockwise around the numbered board to record their score. The scoring dice are: a 5 equals 50 points, a 1 equals 100 points, any 3 of a kind equals 100 times the 3-of-a-kind number. A roll of six consecutively numbered dice (a straight) on one roll equals 1500 points. A minimum of 500 points in a turn is required to get on the board. A minimum of 300 points in a turn is required to advance on the board. As long as a player rolls at least one scoring die, the player may choose to roll again to try to increase their score for that turn. The scoring dice are set aside and the non-scoring dice are picked up and rolled again. Any roll with no scoring dice ends the player's turn and no points are scored. A player may end their turn after any scoring roll and keep the points accumulated for that turn with one exception. If all six dice are scoring dice either in one roll or in a combination of rolls, the player must roll again. After the first player has scored 5000 points the other players have one last chance to outscore that player. The highest score over 5000 wins.&#10;&#10;A player may NIWI an opponent by rolling a score which lands them on the same space as an opponent in front of them. That opponent must then retreat their piece to the previous NIWI corner of the board and their point count is reduced to that of the first scoring space preceding that NIWI corner. Also, the opponent must roll a minimum of 500 points to proceed on the board their next turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Rach player starts with $5,000. Turn on the game by pressing START and a random dollar value will appear on the LED display for the mystery song chosen from computer memory. Each player deposits that amount into the JACKPOT. Players then bid the number of notes they need to name the tune until all agree that the lowest bidder may proceed. The low bidder then presses the corresponding BID-A-NOTE BUTTON for his bid. The game will play that many notes of the song and the bidder has five seconds to name that tune and press the PLAY BUTTON.(If no guess is made, the &quot;YOU LOSE&quot; tune plays, the player loses his money and is out of the round.) The game then plays then song from beginning to end. If the player is correct, he collects the money from the JACKPOT and a new round begins. If another player believes the guess was incorrect, he may press the CHALLENGE BUTTON during the playback of the song. The playback of the song will stop and the challenger has five seconds to guess the name of the song and press the play button. Other players may challenge the subsequent guess and so on. If the players cannot agree on the name of the song, the money remains in the JACKPOT for the next round of play. The winner is the player with the most money when the when it it is agreed to end the game.&#10;&#10;The game includes a variation called &quot;Stop the Music&quot; and a bonus game called &quot;Follow Me&quot;.

These dice will give you different opportunities like gathering shields and swords, and you will need those if you want to face the dangers between you and the beautiful treasures these islands have to offer! The dice will also let you know the minimum number of dangers you will have to fight to reach the treasures. Each card from the Island deck of cards is either a danger, or an item that you won't be able to get in any other way. If you succeed in beating these dangers, you will get all the treasures! But beware, going by yourself might be very dangerous. Should you invite someone else to go along with you? If so, you have to keep in mind that you won't be able to keep all the treasures for yourself... yes, you will have to share with your lucky partner! Oh, and remember, failing while going through these adventures that await you also means that all your competitors will be able to steal the treasures you put to safety during your run!&#10;&#10;",

There are also blue squares, where you collect positive points, and red squares where you would collect negative points. All points are noted on pads that each player has.&#10;&#10;Every player has to reach the volcanic cave where Morg Spear'Nd is hiding. The player who holds the wand Elvina, then issues the destruction spell and Morg Spear'Nd is destroyed, and the invasion of the peaceful Elvish dimension of Laniakeea (Game board side 1) by Morg Spear'Nd is stopped. All points are added up, and only then is the overall winner of both games declared.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each turn more enemies will spawn, but that's ok because in between waves you can go salvaging to upgrade your turrets to make defending easier. At some point The Maker will send one elite monster, or maybe he will even show up to try to finish the job. If you can stop them then you win and have successfully driven him from his castle!&#10;&#10;A turn is comprised of multiple phases. The first phase will have all players adding weapons or support cards to their own personal pillbox. The second phase will have monsters advance, followed by having new monsters arrive. The third phase is fending off all monsters visible. Players, in no particular order, will take turns targeting a monster they wish to shoot. If their roll is successful, they damage the monster according to their weapon. If they miss, nothing happens and another player may shoot. Instead of shooting, a player may support a teammate with one of their shots adding extra accuracy. These steps repeat until the elite monster is defeated causing the players to win, or until a single monster has re-entered the citadel causing the players to lose and have to try again another day.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hexerei is a 1 vs All game of combat and cooperative maneuvering, set in a broody, war-torn 17th century Germany. Up to four players will play as Hunters tasked with finding and slaying the Three Witches of W&uuml;rzburg before the opposing player-led Coven completes the Ritual.&#10;&#10;Hunters will interrogate Prisoners from the Tribunal Deck to reveal unknown tiles on the gaming board in order to find Arcana Tiles. These allow to draw &ldquo;leads&rdquo; from the Arcana Deck and ultimately force the Witches to reveal themselves and fight. Hunters need to act fast, because the Coven will complete the Ritual in 8 turns.&#10;&#10;The Coven&rsquo;s powers are great, but its fight against time is no less dire. The Coven&rsquo;s player controls each turn&rsquo;s conditions by drawing from the Orbis Deck and can deal gruesome spells from his Maleficia Deck. He gains power from the Ritual and can summon Creatures. Each of these is based on the darkest German myths and can go toe-to-toe with any Hunter, but at the same time is specialized in a tactical role and could easily be wasted.&#10;&#10;The Hunters and the Coven fight for board control: each struggles to mix favorable cards into the decks controlled by the opponent. A streamlined dice combat system favors decisive action, hard choices and risk-taking. Cooperation and resource-pooling is needed between Hunters to secure equipment and plan actions against the Coven. Rash decisions can spell ruin for both sides, since the number of Hunter &ldquo;lives&rdquo; are limited, and each Creature can only be summoned once. Each game set will contain original art and (unpainted) miniatures for Witches, Creatures and the Hunters.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

All the artworks involved did truly belong to the main characters at some point of their lives.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The gameplay is about creating your own strategy on the way to reassemble one of the greatest art collections of the past and preventing others from being the first to achieve that.&#10;&#10;It simulates the turbulent art market with auction bidding, dealer and gallery sales, organising exhibitions and even bluffing when the stakes are high. Various historic and art market events - from maniacs to revolutions - can dramatically change the flow of the game.&#10;&#10;To acquire new pieces for the collection you would obviously need some cash. And there are numerous ways to earn some by setting up thematic shows and selling artworks strategically. However, money only won't get you to the top. You have to level up your collector's skills to become the next Great Collector. This will widen your choices and give you a fair advantage on the market.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A two-player abstract strategy game, reputedly originating from Chiangmai, Thailand, where it is said to be called Mhark Nheeb.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to move one of their 8 marbles, which initially start on the back row of an 8&times;8 grid, any number of spaces in a horizontal or vertical direction.&#10;&#10;Opposing marbles can be captures in one of two ways - enclosing or balancing.&#10;&#10;Enclosing captures are made by moving a marble so as to trap one or more opposing marbles between the marble just moved and a pre-existing friendly marble, in an unbroken straight line, horizontally or vertically.  The trapped marbles are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Balancing captures occur when a player moves a marble directly in between two opponents, one on either side in a vertical or horizontal direction, upon which the two opposing marbles are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;(The rules in my possession do not state that captures are compulsory, nor do they suggest that any number other than 2 opposing marbles can be captured by balancing.  Examples of enclosing captures of 1 or 2 opposing marbles are shown, from which I infer that any number (up to 6) opposing marbles may be captured in this way).&#10;&#10;When a player is reduced to a single marble, he or she loses the game, unless he/she can WIN it with the very next move.&#10;&#10;(The rules in my possession do not state what happens if a player is reduced from 2 or more down to zero moves in a single capture, but the implication is that this player immediately loses the game).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The people of Earth were shocked to find out climate change was not a hoax. If one disaster hit them they may have been prepared, but what happens when all the disasters hit at the same time?&#10;&#10;This Game Is A Disaster is a very uncooperative card game where each of the 2-6 players take an equal part of the deck with each card representing one of their disaster survivors. The players take turns playing cards that recreate familiar scenes from disaster movies - giant tsunamis, impromptu volcanoes, and sometimes sharks! The goal is destroy all opponents' cards and to be the last player with cards left.&#10;&#10;A central part of &quot;Disaster&quot; is the shared discard pile, known as the Destroyed Pile. Players lose cards to this central pile but can play cards to retrieve as well, representing the reunions and other bright spots that appear in disaster movies.&#10;&#10;This Game Is A Disaster is a fast and fun game that is as ridiculous as it is severe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The year is 1565 and on a tiny island in the Mediterranean, a small garrison of Knights of St John and Maltese within Fort St Elmo face off against a massive invading force of Ottomans under their supreme naval commander, Piyale Pasha. With control of the Mediterranean as the ultimate prize, will the Knights hold out long enough for relief to arrive from Sicily or will the Pasha succeed in a stunning show of military strength?&#10;The stage is set for the greatest siege in European history.&#10;&#10;The Great Siege of Malta is a wargame in two parts. Part 1: the Battle for St Elmo -  where players can re-explore the strategies and events of the famous battle; and Part 2: the Siege of Senglea (scheduled for a 2021 release) which can uniquely be combined with part 1 (the boards will fit together) for a tabletop siege of truly epic proportions.&#10;&#10;Both games use tokens and/or miniatures to represent the different military units available, on a gameboard presenting a detailed tactical map of the famous locations. The game offers tactical versatility within a simple ruleset that guarantees quick play. A combination of dice and card driven gameplay with a special Command Dice mechanism forces the players to think carefully which military units they will trigger for the round based on the limited available commanders. Combat dice then resolve the outcome of each attack while giving players opportunities to influence the outcomes through card play.&#10;&#10;Game rounds represent single days of the siege with the two commanders having opportunities to manipulate their troops and play additional thematically rich special cards. The game can be played as a 'recreation of history' with known events occurring in certain rounds or as a more freeform 'what if' style of game that allows players on both sides to experiment with different strategies. Winning the game is not about destroying the enemy but instead focuses more on the balance of morale between the two  opposing forces. Use superior tactics and brave challenges to improve your own morale or undermine the enemy and grab the victory!&#10;&#10;The game is as historically accurate as we can make it. BadCatGames has worked closely with academic experts to ensure the game gives players an exciting opportunity to relive this most famous moment in european history in all its detail. Siege of Malta also presents the facts of history as they stand. The game does not take sides in any way and does not glorify either of the forces involved to the detriment of the other. The wargame is simply a gripping and thematic educational opportunity to experience this greatest of sieges.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bonsai is a horticultural tradition that combines human hands and trees to shrinks and reproduces natural scenes in pots. Many well-maintained bonsai trees are more than 100 years old and have a legacy that far exceeds human life.&#10;&#10;Bonsai Uchu is a two-player game in which players create their own bonsai by carefully combining branches and leaves tiles. The game is a two-round system, exchanging bonsais made by each other when switching rounds. The bonsai family's branches are tested to find out what form to make the bonsai that has been handed over from the predecessor. Use cultivation and pruning to create an infinite bonsai universe in a bowl.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher

    "Description": "From Wikipedia: In 1845 a lavishly equipped two-ship expedition led by Sir John Franklin sailed to the Canadian Arctic to chart the last unknown swaths of the Northwest Passage. Confidence was high, as they estimated there was less than 500 km (310 mi) remaining of unexplored Arctic mainland coast. When the ships failed to return, relief expeditions and search parties explored the Canadian Arctic, which resulted in a thorough charting of the region, along with a possible passage. Many artifacts from the expedition were found over the next century and a half, including notes that the ships were ice-locked in 1846 near King William Island, about halfway through the passage, and unable to break free. You need to do better!&#10;&#10;In The Search for the Northwest Passage you'll try to find a sea route from mid-19th century Britain to the Pacific Ocean via the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, make discoveries along the way, and return home to tell the story.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he/she has a choice of two actions. He announces whether he wants to navigate or explore. Then he draws the top card of the deck. Players alternate turns until one of the end game conditions occurs. The player with the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A modern, compact, territory-control strategy game with no elements of chance.  &quot;Minutes to learn, a lifetime to master&quot;&#10;&#10;The game is played on a standard 9x9 sudoku board, using integers 0 through 8.&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing integer under the standard sudoku rules of placement; each number can occur only once in each row, column, and 3x3 region.  The game ends when no more tiles can be placed, or both players agree to resolve the gameboard.&#10;&#10;Placing tiles give the player &quot;power&quot; in the regions containing the tile.  This power is equivalent to the integer value.&#10;&#10;Additionally, if the tiles are in a cell that touches an external region, either diagonally or orthogonally (rows/columns), the player receives &quot;influence&quot; equal to 1/2 tile value in each connected external region.&#10;&#10;The general goal is to control a majority of regions at the end of play.&#10;&#10;In simplified versions, the points are totaled for each region, both power and influence, and the player with the most points in a given region is said to have control.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, a cascade known as Resolution occurs.  (For more info on the advanced game, see http://mbranegame.com/rules-of-m/)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is available on the App Store and Google Play&mdash;apps are free, ad-free, purchase free and collect no user data:&#10;&#10;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mbrane/id1232076299&#10;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mclass.com.mabstract&#10;&#10;The game can also be played on Steven Taverner's AI AI:&#10;&#10;http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/&#10;&#10;",

But there's some possibility of Tatar invasion each round. You will suffer severe component loss if you are attacked while having many components. Each turn, you will have to consider if it's time to construct or time to collect.&#10;&#10;The game uses a combination of building blocks and card display, with a good deal of text on the cards, which will make it more language dependent.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;13&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#180;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#171;&#184;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#172;(&#227;&#130;&#175; &#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;)&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#163;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#134;&#141;&#229;&#187;&#186;(&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#171;)&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#230;&#157;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#156;&#168;&#232;&#163;&#189;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#230;&#157;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#230;&#156;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#148;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#230;&#149;&#153;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#168;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#190;&#181;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#153;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#230;&#186;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#166;&#130;&#228;&#189;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#229;&#165;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#152;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#230;&#186;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#186;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#148;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#232;&#133;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#149;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

But if you flip over a human then you have to discard all the cards in front of you, as the monsters are scared off.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#229;&#130;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#144;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;5&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#229;&#130;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#141;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

As the Pharaoh falls ill, the possible heirs to the throne each builds a pyramid for the Pharaoh. The player who builds the biggest and tallest pyramid shall be the next Pharaoh.&#10;&#10;In the game of Colorful Pyramid, you build a four-tier pyramid with stone cards.&#10;&#10;There are 64 stone cards in the game, each of which has a color and a number. At the beginning of the game, each player has four stone cards in front of them as bottom tier of their pyramid.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you may take one stone card from the six revealed cards. To do so, you must use the power of your stones. Rotate or discard at least two of your cards so that the bottom digit of the total of these cards is equal to the number of the card to be taken.&#10;&#10;When you add a stone at second tier or above, look at the two stones immediately below it. Both must share its color or number with the stone to be added.&#10;&#10;Instead of taking a stone card, you may rest and return all your rotated stones to upright position.&#10;&#10;You win the game when you have made a perfect four-tier pyramid. When the stone deck runs out, the player whose pyramid is closest to perfect is the winner.&#10;&#10;Your goal is simple: complete a four-tier pyramid, but to do so, you have many aspects to consider. You must plan ahead, or other players will go ahead of you. Watching your stones built into a colorful pyramid will satisfy your eyes.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#230;&#174;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#231;&#180;&#148;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#229;&#191;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#184;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#231;&#148;&#187;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#179;&#188;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#133;&#132;&#229;&#188;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#182;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#166;&#150;&#232;&#166;&#154;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#133;&#133;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#189;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The name of this Swedish film trivia game translates as &quot;Let's go to the videos&quot;. Released by a Swedish video distribution company in collaboration with Target Games, it may have been used in some promotional context, but the game itself doesn't contain any specific promotional material.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists mostly of answering trivia questions about films or TV shows, or related topics such as actors or source material. Each question card has questions at three nominal difficulty levels, and answering a question correctly allows a player to move along a track towards the goal by rolling a 4-, 6- or 8-sided die. Some spaces mean a player instead has to mime a movie title for the other players to guess.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Castle Panic is a cooperative, light strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up. Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win.&#10;&#10;To celebrate the ten-year anniversary, Fireside Games is releasing the Castle Panic Big Box. This extra-large box will contain the original Castle Panic game as well as all three expansions; The Wizard&rsquo;s Tower, The Dark Titan, and Engines of War. For the first time ever, fans both new and old will be able to get the core game and all the expansions together in one box.&#10;&#10;Castle Panic Big Box will also include seven promotional game cards and five promotional Tower tokens, one of which has never been available before 2019. Players will also find an updated, comprehensive rulebook that covers the rules for the base game and all three expansions. The insert for the box has a space for all the game pieces and provides a handy way to organize everything players need.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
