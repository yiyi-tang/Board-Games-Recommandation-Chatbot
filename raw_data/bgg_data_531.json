    "Description": "Few shipping routes connected the Soviet Union to its western allies. One ran through Murmansk in the far north, kept ice-free by the Gulf Stream and built during the First World War for the express purpose of receiving military supplies from Britain and the United States. In June 1941, two German mountain divisions crossed the border from Finland, intent on capturing the port and sealing off this vital access. After fierce fighting along the Litsa River, the offensive finally failed in the face of fierce resistance by the Red Army and Navy and workers&rsquo; militia units.&#10;&#10;In 1944, the Red Army returned the favor, with a lightning offensive spearheaded by elite light infantry and aimed at capturing Finland&rsquo;s ice-free port of Petsamo and occupying northern Norway. The Soviets rolled back the Germans into Norway, crushing the Army of Lappland and closing the war's Arctic front.&#10;&#10;Army of Lappland covers both of these campaigns, both the 1941 and 1942 battles in front of Murmansk and the 1944 counter-offensive. The game system is the same as that used in Tiger of Malaya, and in our long out-of-print Blood on the Snow. Units are mostly battalions, with the maps covering the area along the coast of the Arctic Ocean from Kirkenes in Norway to Murmansk at a scale of two kilometers per hex.&#10;&#10;Components:  &#10;&#10;     1,120 1/2-inch playing pieces&#10;     Two maps&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Avalanche Press website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Each player has an individual pad of paper with a 6x6 grid, with help areas around. This grid will be filled with letters, and all players will use the same set of letters. The aim is to create as many and as long words as possible, with big increases in points for longer words (number of points equals squared word length).&#10;&#10;On your turn you roll 4 x d20 dice (custom ones, with letters + wildcard). You can pick three to roll again, then two out of those three to roll again, and finally a single one out of the last two for a final roll. Each die has a different distribution of letters on the sides (overview included), so if you need an &quot;F&quot; to complete a word, you need to roll the dice that have at least one side with &quot;F&quot;, but might keep a die with a letter you have use for in another spot. After rolling you choose one die, the letter on its top side must immediately be written by each player in their respective grid.&#10;&#10;When the grid is full (36 turns, all become full at the same time), calculate points. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Some advanced rules with a timer are also included. The intention is to limit thinking time = waiting time to 30 seconds, and while doing so it adds an extra edge of stress to game. It can be used as much as the players like, from very aggressively for a speedy game to not at all.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.korso.se/&#10;&#10;",

Players are European Nations employing Privateers to attack each other&rsquo;s shipping.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In this era, only about 20% of a Nations Fleet would be Crown property, the remainder were privately owned ships, that when they were not augmenting the Battle Line, were permitted to do Commerce raiding on their own.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player chooses to play one of four nations: Spain, England, France, or Holland. The custom card deck includes nine types of cards: Ships, Captains, Crews, Bases, Escorts, Merchants, Treasures, Defenses, and Events.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to amass 100 gold.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Morituri Te Salutant is a miniatures rule set for gladiatorial combat. It was initially published by Gladiator Miniatures but the current (3rd) edition came out from Black Hat Miniatures in 2008. According to the preface for the latest edition there are no significant differences between the 2nd and the 3rd edition of the game.&#10;&#10;MTS consists of rulebook (either a pdf or a hard copy); miniatures, dice, markers (beads, etc) and the playing surface have to be provided by the players. The game uses six and twenty-sided dice. Miniatures of any scale may be used.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hex grid using pre-selected moves for each gladiator. The moves can be written down on a piece of paper but another popular alternative is to create separate cards for each move. The selected moves are compared on a matrix that gives the difficulty for a strike to hit the opponent. As the game goes on the gladiators gain wounds of varying severity and eventually the loser is either killed or begs for mercy from the crowds.&#10;&#10;The game includes a system for playing campaigns where each player represents a gladiator school. Initially the schools own half a dozen or so gladiators of varying types (myrmidon, hoplomachon, thracian, etc). Over a campaign year the schools participate in festivals where they compete for the prize money but also can bet between each other. As the campaign progresses individual gladiators gain experience, die, get wounded, and may even earn their freedom. The schools use the money they earn to buy new gladiators but the unfortunate may be driven to bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;There are 12 different gladiator types each of which has a different selection of moves. For example, a spear-armed hoplomachus has different moves than a retiarius who wields a trident and a net.&#10;&#10;In addition to regular gladiatorial combat, the game includes rules for mounted combat, archery and beast fights. Multi-gladiator and multi-player combats are possible allowing team fights, last-man-standing games etc.&#10;&#10;Some play aids can be downloaded from the publisher's Yahoo group. They include a pdf of a hex grid and labels for creating your own move cards.&#10;&#10;",

It is based in an extra &quot;dirty tricks&quot; card called &quot;Send to the sharks / Exchange&quot;.&#10;&#10;Every player gets one at the beginning of the game. He can use it one time during the game like every other &quot;dirty tricks&quot; card.&#10;&#10;Using it he can choose between two actions:&#10;&#10;- &ldquo;Send to the sharks&rdquo;: The player flips the card of the tavern onto which he has added a die in the same&#10;turn onto its back side. When the cards are distributed, cards of the tavern which are flipped over are&#10;removed from the game regardless of dice added onto them. Nevertheless dice added to a flipped card still&#10;count as tie-breakers for adjacent cards which are not turned over. The &ldquo;dirty tricks&rdquo;-card is removed from&#10;the game after usage.&#10;&#10;- &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;: The player takes one of his own dice he has added to a card of the tavern in a previous turn&#10;back to his supply. Then he adds both dice he has rolled in that turn onto the corresponding cards of&#10;the tavern. This action can only be performed if the player has added at least one die to the tavern in a&#10;previous turn. The &ldquo;dirty tricks&rdquo;-card is removed from the game after usage.&#10;&#10;You can download the cards here:&#10;&#10;http://www.michaelschacht.net/p/shangXPUS2.pdf (english, letter)&#10;http://www.michaelschacht.net/p/shangXP2.pdf (german, DINA4)&#10;http://www.michaelschacht.net/p/shangXPE2.pdf (spanish)&#10;&#10;",

On seven occasions the Grumm have encountered those that are not Grumm, and three times they have parted in peace. Four times Grumm have died, and those who mourned have called for the Assemblage, claws unsheathed. Before, the enemy was excised, without pity or hate. The Grumm are the children of war, but they take no joy from killing. It is a tool, applied as all others are applied, to secure tomorrow. Those who threatened the future died, whether in their ships or on the ground, until they posed no threat. They were reduced so that, as under the Law, the Grumm need not fear them for the span of ten thousand litters. Hammer &amp; Claw: The Grumm Wars Source book is a supplement for the Starmada game, detailing a universe in which Mankind&rsquo;s first contact did not go well...&#10;&#10;The Wars are an ongoing conflict between Earth's space faring nations and the Grumm, bent on exterminating what they perceive as a threat to their very existence. Hostilities are driven, as with most wars, by greed, misunderstanding, and fear, in equal measure. Can Earth's superpowers, wary and distrustful of each other for more than 300 years, unite in the face of a common enemy? Or has humanity already doomed itself to annihilation?&#10;In addition to extensive background material describing the Grumm Wars universe, this book contains thirty-five new starship designs representing the alien Grumm, the nomadic Boers, and Terra&rsquo;s three space faring powers: the Union of European States, Daitoua Kyoueiken, and Pan-Atlantic Commonwealth. Also included are several scenarios, plus all of the supplemental rules necessary to fight out the Grumm Wars, including brand-new options such as shipboard combat and dual-mode weapons.&#10;&#10;Hammer &amp; Claw is not a stand-alone product; ownership of the Starmada: The Admiralty Edition Core Rulebook is required.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Starmada: The Admiralty Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The sailing boat of the king rides on the water, loaded with jewels. The players slip into the role of wild river dragons who want to steal the jewels. The only player who can do that, however, is one who has his breath well under control. Players move the ship by blowing through a straw to propel it along the river... but other players can end the trip by rolling the dice. In order to win, one needs a good portion of skill and dice luck beside sufficient breath.

The United States and Great Britain gave great thought to how they would protect their own trade and interrupt that of the other nation, in case the two English-speaking powers ever came to war.&#10;&#10;South China Sea is a Great War at Sea supplement based on these plans, which were taken much more seriously by the Americans than by the British. Just like similar supplements for the Panzer Grenadier series, each scenario has its own card in a spiral-bound booklet. Unlike other Great War at Sea games, each scenario also has its own unique set of ship data, gathering all the &quot;hit records&quot; necessary to play on one sheet.&#10;&#10;Designer Kevin Canada has crafted ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that could have taken place between American and British forces in the Far East during a potential naval war in the early 1920s &mdash; the same conflict we studied in Great War at Sea: Sea of Troubles. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Sea of Troubles as well as our Jutland and Plan Gold games to enjoy all of the scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This racing game involves the use of yachts that move at a set movement rate (no dice) according to the wind direction. Wind direction is determined by a stack of cards that can be drawn before moving.&#10;The course is a game board which has a grid on it with a start position and three buoys making an oval shape course.&#10;Yachts move in a straight or diagonal direction and can change course at the end of their movement. &#10;This game is made realistic by the strength of the wind, being able to raise or lower the spinnaker to increase movement and seeing who can get to the finish line first.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Mow 'Em Down, players represent different landscape company owners who bid to win landscaping contracts throughout an ever-growing city.  Players can bid only if they have enough lawn mowers available in their company.  As players win contracts, they earn money to purchase more lawn mowers, which allows them to bid on future contracts.  Contracts can expire, so players must be savvy with their bids to maintain a profitable business.&#10;&#10;During one's turn, a player receives earnings from previously won contracts and purchases new equipment if desired.  Then the player roles the die to determine which of three sizes of land tiles to act upon for the duration of the turn.  Once the size of land tile has been determined by the die, the player chooses from one of three actions to take:  BUILD, BID, or BOOT.&#10;&#10;If the player chooses BUILD, the player expands the city by drawing and placing a new land tile of the determined size to the existing city.&#10;&#10;If the player chooses BID, the player opens an auction on one or two land tiles of the determined size for eligible players to bid on contracts.  (In most cases, the lowest bidders win the contracts.) The winning players will receive these earnings on future turns.&#10;&#10;If the player chooses BOOT, the player cancels and removes a contract of the determined size and the affected player will not continue to receive these earnings on future turns.&#10;&#10;Various bonuses and event cards can be earned or played throughout the game that add some random elements.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last land tile is placed onto the city and all other players take one additional turn.  The player with the highest total value, including cash, earnings and equipment is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.mowemdown.com&#10;&#10;",

Each of two to five players represents one of the Germanic invaders who, pushed by the Asiatic Huns, settled in and eventually destroyed Rome.

The game combines &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; elements with a light historical wargame.  The game uses no dice; players use cards to influence combat, and also use event cards to control non-Germanic invaders and influence other players.  Scoring occurs each century, with the last century counting much more than others.&#10;&#10;In some ways this is a game of survival, of maintaining a civilization.  It is possible to win without directly attacking other players, though successful players usually directly attack another player at some point in the game.&#10;&#10;Players take turns executing a variety of Actions up to a limit of six Action Points.  Some of the Actions are creating new settlers, moving pieces, and playing Event Cards.  Three or (in Standard and Advanced games) four rounds of turns are a century.  Invasions occur at the end of each Century, or they may occur because of an Event Card played by a player.  One player or another temporarily controls Invaders as they invade.  Players attempt to increase the number of settled areas, improve those areas, and, in Standard and Advanced games, build cities.  They will probably fight Invaders, and may fight one another, using Battle Cards to help resolve these fights.&#10;&#10;",

Behind each dollar amount is a statement of trivia having to do with the category. When a player thinks he or she knows the correect response to a statement, that person signals and responds in the form of a question. A player is rewarded with the amount associated with the statement if correct, and penalized the corresponding amount if incorrect.&#10;&#10;When the board is cleared, the process is repeated for &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; with five new categories and double the stakes.&#10;&#10;One statement in the first round and two statements in the second round are designated as &quot;Daily Double.&quot; Only the person who chose the statement may bet any or all of his or her winnings on giving the correct response. Unlike most other editions, the Daily Doubles have been chosen by the publisher.&#10;&#10;One of the highest valued statements in a category has been saved for the last round, &quot;Final Jeopardy.&quot; In this phase, the players secretly bet any or all of their winnings and record their responses.&#10;&#10;The player with the most amount of money at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Black &amp; Tan War is an historical simulation of the Irish War of Independence, 1919-1921. Each player has a unique deck of cards that &ldquo;drives&rdquo; nearly all game procedures. One player controls the forces of the British Crown &ndash; regular battalions of the Royal Army, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), its elite Auxiliary Division, and the English &ldquo;Black &amp; Tans&rdquo; who filled the RIC&rsquo;s vacant ranks as native Irish policemen resigned from the force.&#10;&#10;MAP: Map depicts all of Ireland divided into 16 different regions (plus Dublin)&#10;SCALE: Operational. Turns are bi-monthly. Irish units represent 12-100 men. British units are army battalions, auxiliary police companies, and local constabulary.&#10;COMPONENTS: Two decks of 55 cards each, 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map, 280 &frac12;&rdquo; counters, 77 5/8&rdquo; counters, 24 page rulebook, and 3 player aid cards.&#10;COMPLEXITY: Medium. Somewhere between We the People and Wilderness War.&#10;&#10;Each card in the Crown Player&rsquo;s deck may be played for 5 different purposes:&#10;&#10;1) To conduct Operations with a number of units determined by the card&rsquo;s value. These can be Patrols that aim to &ldquo;show the flag&rdquo; and catch the foe unawares; small-scale Raids to capture known or suspected Republican activists; and large-scale military Roundups intended to encircle and trap guerrilla units.&#10;&#10;2) To cause an Event, of which there are many different types, including: Army Reinforcements, Blockade, Spies, Black &amp; Tans, Motorization, Armored Cars, Mass Arrests, the RAF, and various new laws &ndash; just to name a few.&#10;&#10;3) To recruit an Informer in one of the three regions listed on the card. These greatly boost the effectiveness of local Crown operations &ndash; and impede the activities of Republican guerrillas.&#10;&#10;Crown forces other than the Irish-born RIC may take revenge for guerrilla attacks and the generally hostile attitude of the natives by destroying civilian property. Such &lsquo;reprisals&rsquo; can play a significant role in eroding both the British and Irish peoples&rsquo; will to continue the struggle.&#10;&#10;",

The game is a unique cross between checkers and billiards.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to advance your row of checkers to the opposite side of the board by winning rounds.  Rounds are won by knocking all your opponent's checkers off the board.  Within a round, players alternate turns flicking checkers.  If you succeed at removing a checker from the opposing team and keep your pieces on the board, you may flick again.  When all the opponent's checkers are removed, you win the round and advance your line one row.  If you win the round without losing any of your checkers, advance two rows.  The army to reach the opposite side of the checkerboard wins!&#10;&#10;See also: Chaos Tactics&#10;&#10;",
