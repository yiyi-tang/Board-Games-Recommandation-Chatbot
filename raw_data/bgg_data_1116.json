    "Description": "1066 is a three player game covering the various claimants to the crown of England following the death of Edward the Confessor in January 1066.&#10;&#10;The players fulfill the roles of Harald Hardrada, Harold Godwinson and William of Normandy. The game is split into 4 phases each of which is designed to illustrate a key component in determining who takes the crown.&#10;&#10;Firstly there is a Pre-Invasion Political Event phase (PIPE) which is designed to showcase the political intrigue that took place prior to the death of Edward. During this phase the players can gain additional support from other leaders and regions and, crucially, they can gain additionally legitimacy from various monarchs, religious bodies and events. Many events are outside their control; death of the Aethling, Scandinavian Wars and the activities of Tostig but they will also be crucial.  This simple game preamble will provide an infinite variety of starting points to be played out on the map itself. In addition this phase can be a time of acquiring operational and tactical chits to use advantageously later.&#10;Legitimacy is central to the game. Unless a player gains an automatic victory then a players legitimacy level will be key in determining who has won the war. As well as during the PIPE phase it can also be changed by winning and losing battles and by taking controlling of areas on the map.&#10;&#10;However before the Operational phase there are the perils of the sea crossings. When to sail is a crucial decision by both William and Hardrada. Go early and the weather should be kinder, go later and you can recruit more troops.  Lady luck, in the form of stormy seas can destroy the best laid plans, in addition the prevailing winds can prevent you invading, even when you  are ready to go (as occurred to William). If a crossing goes badly wrong, or you lose an early decisive battle your claim lies in shreds. Don&rsquo;t despair &ndash; &lsquo;Become a Dane&rsquo;. A player can abandon their attempt, as William or Hardrada, and instead take up the cause of Sweyn of Denmark and try and gain the throne for the Danes (they historically invaded in 1069). It won&rsquo;t be easy winning as the Danes but it means you are still in the game.&#10;&#10;The first week in September is a dangerous time for Harold as the Fyrd stand down to collect the harvest, is this the time to strike? , will the weather conditions be in your favour.&#10;In the operational players move around the map of England to gain control of areas and improve their legitimacy as well as deciding when to strike to win a decisive battle against one of the two opponents. The operational phase is a real &lsquo;rock, paper, scissors&rsquo; problem. How to square the problems of keeping your forces concentrated to win battles, spreading them out to take control of areas whilst keeping them feed without turning areas into wastelands.&#10;&#10; When battle is joined them the action is transferred to a battle board where the individual characteristics of the differing armies is highlighted. The longer you stay on the battlefield the bigger the loss if you are defeated; often the losses from pursuit are greater than the losses from the battle itself. Winning and losing battles result in big legitimacy swings which can decide the game.  &#10; Never before has this iconic campaign been gamed with all four key facets illustrated (politics, invasion, operational campaign and battles)&#10;There are a number of very good battle games but not much for the operational phase and nothing showing the political interplay or the perils of the sea crossings themselves.&#10;The victory conditions for each player differ slightly, requiring differing strategies for each side. &#10;Sweyn of Denmark is waiting in the wings. If no one &lsquo;Becomes a Dane&rsquo; then the system takes over the game system will determine if he arrives or not. Leave London inadequately protected and he will take it and without it neither William or Harold can win a decisive victory.&#10;&#10;The game is easily playable in a single session (4-5 hours)&#10;4 Kings 1 Crown &ndash; have you got what it takes to become the undisputed King of England.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Failure on the Tugela covers the attempts by the British to relieve Ladysmith following the failure at Colenso on the 15th December 1899. These attempts took place during the months on January and February 1900, most famously at Spion Kop.&#10;&#10;The core game will be the same as Redvers Reverse utilizing the same scale for the map and counters. To reiterate the games mechanics -  it is at Battalion and Battery level with emphasis upon the leadership of the British at a Brigade level for Infantry and at Divisional level for the Cavalry.  The key feature of the game is to present the player with the problems and difficulties that Buller himself faced.&#10;&#10;However there are key differences. Most notably is the fact that a game system that previously covered nothing more than a few hours will now cover a number of weeks. This is achieved by giving the player the opportunity to make a maximum of three breakthrough attempts in order to reach Ladysmith. This fits with the historical attempts on the Tabanyana Heights, Spion Kop and Val Krantz.  Each breakthrough attempt, and its outcome, will have an impact on subsequent attempts.  The player will have a series of predetermined target areas, at three different levels for each attempt. The level of success will determine the starting level  of the Boer Confidence track for the next attempt. The more casualties inflicted the more diluted will be the Boer variable strength marker pool. However push too far and you own strength levels will be compromised with the increased likelihood of losing good quality leaders for the next breakthrough attempt. For each attempt you can push on into a second day but this is not without risk and will require you to reach a higher level of target area. Failure to reach any of the harder targets may well improve, rather than decrease Boer confidence levels.&#10;&#10;It would not be a British Empire campaign without command confusion and there is plenty of that here. Events cover the situation where, historically, there were three people who believed they were in command during the attempt to secure Spion Kop. In addition whilst Warren is in charge for the first, and probably the second attempt, he must achieve a level of success otherwise he is demoted and either Buller or Clery take charge. If Warren or Clery are in command then Events exist where Buller meddles and further confusion occurs.&#10;There are four possible breakthrough scenarios, the three historical ones and Brakfortein Ridge. You determine which you undertake by rolling on a table; which attempts you have already undertaken and the level of success achieved, will influence where the next attempt is. It is possible that you could undertake an attempt against the same location twice (but not all three times).&#10;&#10;One change in the  game map is that certain areas are designated &lsquo;Peak areas&rsquo; and one area (Spion Kop) is split into three &lsquo;Peak areas&rsquo;.  Peak areas improve Fire distances for artillery, are more vulnerable for defending Infantry (if not in an emplacement) and will be occupied by Boer units if vacant and adjacent to them.&#10;&#10;In addition they provide the reasoning behind employing a number of additional Event counters.&#10;Tugela has Event counts, amongst others, for Murderous fire (basically free shots at units adjacent to both Infantry and Artillery in a Peak area),  British Surrender, Boer Loss of Nerve, Boer Inspired Leadership and  Acton homes (will explain as testing progresses).&#10;&#10;Given some of the steep slopes certain movements will require the unit to stay put for a turn before moving again. There will be no searching for Drifts in Tugela, unlike Redvers Reverse, as the four main drifts are well known. There will be three Pontoon bridges which can be laid under certain conditions. &#10;There are a number of addition battles from the Boer War which lend themselves to the system, particularly those concerning the relief of Kimberley. In addition the Natal campaign has more to offer notably the eventual success at Tugela Heights and the siege of Ladysmith itself.&#10;&#10;However the third volume of the system will be moving to the Crimean War and the battle of Inkermann. This time, as the British, the player is in a largely defensive roll.&#10;  &#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

New technologies have been developed which allow interstellar star pilots to overcome challenges like stellar debris, warped space, and black holes. Mass production has finally brought the costs of these technological marvels down enough to be accessible to the private sector, and like any good space civilization you capitalize on the opportunity.&#10;&#10;In Kepler Run, you play an independent space runner attempting to win the most riches for yourself by being the first to fulfill lucrative contracts the fastest. You'll need to put all of your runner know-how to good use, and with a little bit of planning and luck, you can be the first to complete your Kepler Run.&#10;&#10;In more detail, Kepler Run is a card-drafting and route-planning game. Each round, new cards are revealed. In turn, players draft a card and decide whether to add it to their ship as an engine, add it to the board (the run) for points, or discard it for fuel modules. After each player has drafted two tiles, in turn players attempt to make it as far as they can, crossing from one side of the board to the other. Players collect points depending on how far they get and on which objective they complete along the way. After three rounds of drafting and running, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Interregnum is a science fiction strategy board game set in a time of cold conflict between competing stellar kingdoms in a fallen Galactic Empire. The 2-to-6 players win by dominating the other kingdoms and earning the seat of Emperor, either by building a military hegemony or a powerful merchant empire. Both paths to success require careful planning, resource management and cunning strategy.&#10;&#10;You will take the reins of one of the six Star Kingdoms that are part of the fallen Empire, ruled by the leaders that have the best claim to the throne after the late Emperor&rsquo;s demise: The Duchess, The Princess, The Marquis, The Baron, The Caliph, and The Khan.&#10;&#10;Your mission is to guide your people to the stars, secure vital resources to support your growth, make important decisions that will forge your Kingdom&rsquo;s fate, and take back what&rsquo;s rightfully yours &ndash; the title of Basileus, Emperor of Mankind.&#10;&#10;The Interregnum is played on a modular map divided into hexagonal Sectors and Solar Systems. These are each further divided into 3 smaller tiles that allow for a better random distribution of Planets and Resources on the map and also keeping the scale Galactic yet detailed enough to be enjoyable.&#10;&#10;The Interregnum gameplay is structured into Rounds that each represent a galactic standard year. Within one Round, all players have a Turn &ndash; meaning that a Round is further divided into 2 to 6 Turns.&#10;&#10;Within a Turn, a player has 1 or 2 Actions (depending on their position on the ISC&rsquo;s Turn/Dividend track). Actions are the following: Moving Fleets or Building. If a player has two actions he/she may move twice or move and build in the same turn.&#10;&#10;During their Turn, a player may also do any of the following: trade once with the Galactic Market, repay their own debts, acquire loans, sell loans, buy a Technology card, use any number of cards, change their focus (but only when you are the Board Director). These are not considered Actions and can be done at any time during your turn after receiving your resource input.&#10;&#10;While there is no actual combat in The Interregnum, players are required to use their Fleets in order to occupy Sectors and build structures inside them.  Generally speaking, Fleets move on the between the Sectors &ndash; called Hyperlanes. They can also be &ldquo;Parked&rdquo; within a Sector (Deep space or Solar Orbit), but cannot move from Sector to Sector while Parked.&#10;&#10;Building Fleets, Miner/Traders or Space Stations use up Resources (gained from Deep Space resource tiles or from inhabited planets) and Research points (gained from Citizen or Immigrant population)&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the players gathers 5 Reform Score (Mercantile or Hegemonic) through any means.&#10;&#10;Once the end is triggered, your victory points are determined by your populations and assets. These are scored differently depending on which path you take when reforming your Star Kingdom into an Empire.&#10;&#10;Hegemonic Empire path rewards military expansion while keeping the power in the hands of the few and alike. Citizen and Colonist Populations along with finished Space Stations add to your score, while Immigrants and Offworlders reduce your final score.&#10;Merchant Empire path rewards population diversity and powerful Trader presence. Offworlders and Immigrants along with Trade Stations add to your score, and indeed Citizens and Colonists reduce your score.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

In addition, the game does not have a goal as such: we simply sail across the bay, enriching ourselves by trading and looting each other, trying to surpass the wealth of our opponents.&#10;&#10;Players usually set their own rules for the game, ether to accumulate a set amount of wealth or fight other players until they don't have money to buy new supplies.&#10;&#10;However, this is one of the few Russian-made board games in the 1990s, which will be really interesting for the participants to play: calculate where to swim, how to avoid or impose a battle, and how to protect your savings with promissory notes.&#10;&#10;The spirit of sea adventure calls you.&#10;&#10;",

The game takes place in a 1920's &quot;gangster&quot; era where Prohibition is in full swing, making the use or trade of any item with magical properties against the law.&#10;&#10;Players form small teams of heroic Runerunners to scour the streets of Sanctuary City, taking jobs to hunt down illegal artifacts, before rival teams can get them first. Teams are formed at random and each character will move about the board, exploring the town and looking for clues, but sometimes the easiest way to score an item is to steal from your enemies, or defeat them in battle and run off with all of their loot.&#10;&#10;The game features large double-sided board tiles that can be arranged any way you wish, creating a different map every time you play. Your team of Heroes has taken a contract to search for contraband magical items. There will be a variety of different jobs or game modes, allowing you to have a regular battle game, or take an hold specific areas of the board, or search for clues to find special items. The rulebook will feature many different scenarios, and include instructions for how to create your own custom games as well.&#10;&#10;Each board tile features a 9x9 grid for movement. Both players alternate activating one hero at a time, and each hero has a set number of actions where they can move, search for clues, and steal from or attack enemy heroes. Each Hero may only be activated once per game turn, and the game will typically last for 6 full turns. Whoever can score the most kills or gather the most loot before the game ends will win.&#10;&#10;Runerunners is designed to be simple to learn, but also tactical and strategic, where each hero's unique skills can make or break a mission.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Softwar, players are electronics intelligence operators, or in common parlance cyberspies. Their job is to assemble, deploy and control teams of specialist digital programs into the world&rsquo;s electronic networks. &#10;Their aim is to access a set of key assets protected by their opponent, while simultaneously defending their own assets from enemy attack.&#10;&#10;Players choose and control a set of programs, each of which is represented by a dice. The value of any program is called its state.&#10;A program&rsquo;s state is reduced as it takes damage; if it ever lowers below 1, that program is immediately eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;After setting up the board and assembling their teams, players take turns to run all of their programs. Programs come in two forms, Agents and Crypts. &#10;Agents are active, movable pieces. Crypts on the other-hand are immobile; sat atop assets like protective turrets. Crypts are arguably more limited than agents, though unlike their mobile cousins, they also serve as an advanced asset deployment platform.&#10;&#10;Every agent may take a number of standard actions including moving, supporting (recharging their teammates) and attacking. In addition to these standard actions, each agent has a single specialised action, chosen by its owner before the start of the game. Players use these specialised actions to create advantages and opportunities to successfully win the game.&#10;&#10;A player wins the game by either eliminating three out of four of their opponents Crypts (granting them access to the assets on which they sit) or by completely destroying their opponents team of agents.&#10;&#10;Components include:&#10;&#10;     35 dice per player in a variety of types (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 and D20)&#10;     A batch crafted set of a board and tokens. &#10;     A range of 15 special action cards per player, each of which may be applied to any dice type per player.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the pulbisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's been 84 years since the great Kaiju Wars. Humanity has made many advancements and discoveries since that dark time. However no revelation was as ground breaking as the discovery of the islands. Beautiful Oblivion, one of three islands, was formed by the synthesis of earth's geography with the fallen enemy of our past and with it a treasure trove of new resources. Harvesting these resources changed our future and quite possibly sealed our fate. Because of our ignorance a new gate is now forming and it is only a matter of time before a breach occurs unleashing Kaijus hell bent on destroying us all.&#10;&#10;In Beautiful Oblivion, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you are the master engineer tasked with creating the next great mech (Krieger) to save us all. Your team of engineers are sent out to harvest the resources needed in order to construct such modern marvels. These new resources come with a cost though, as over harvesting only accelerates the end game.&#10;&#10;During the course of play, you'll gain points by using those resources to build or upgrade your Krieger. Choose to follow a blueprint for additional points or shoot from the hip on your design. All the while, navigating world events that can help you or stop you dead in your tracks. The points you earn translate to the strength of your Krieger. Building bigger is stronger, but much slower to do. A light upgraded Krieger might do the trick but will it be strong enough. Either way you'll need to hurry, once the gate is inevitably opened, ending the game, only completed Kriegers will fight for glory against a variety of Kaijus for the possibility to gain bonus points. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The game manual also features a Palm City History section you can fill out that keeps track of the winners and their game stats. So family and friends can forever remember your victory... Hero or Villain.&#10;&#10;&#10;        HOW TO PLAY&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Players will roam the Palm City streets on this 8x8 grid gameboard, using powers they gain to complete city events. At the start of the game all players will be competing against one another as heroes. Frantically moving around the board trying to complete city events before other players beat them to it. Each of the 54 city events are original and will make this city feel alive. City events could be anything from saving a family in a burning home, stopping a meteor from crashing into Palm City, or helping the mayor's cat out of a tree. Each city event requires certain powers to complete though, so players will also be competing to obtain genetic mutations around the board that grant powers. Palm City is full of stuff happening where your help is always needed but you know what they say. Live long enough... and you'll find yourself the villain. At any point in the game, a player may attack another player. The moment a hero player causes damage to another hero player, they become a villain. There is no going back from this. At this point in the game, your only objective as a villain, is to eliminate all other players using the powers you've gained. Each power in the game has a unique ability and with 38 of them, make sure you build your character carefully. All of this happens within a player's turn and a turn consists of two phases.&#10; Phase 1: Move&#10;Phase 2: Complete Action&#10;&#10;Actions that can be completed include: Completing a city event, gaining a genetic mutation, trading &amp; discarding genetic mutations, applying powers, or attacking another player.&#10;&#10;Win the game as a hero by completing city events found on comic book cards and getting your city respect to 100 before any other player.&#10;&#10;Win the game as a villain by using your powers to bring the health of other players to zero, destroying them all, and taking over Palm City.&#10;&#10;This is a large game featuring a lot of content. At first it might feel overwhelming, but the manual should easily guide you through the process of learning how to setup &amp; play. Once you learn, you'll never want to leave Palm City.&#10;&#10;&#10;        GAME STORY&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;You and your neighbors notice something break apart in the sky outside the city. All of you gather and travel to the wreckage. You discover a glowing purple material. Something never before seen. It calls to you. It calls to each of you. One by one you all touch it. Everyone feels different. Everyone feels powerful. You realize each time you touch it, your genetics are mutating.&#10;You're becoming stronger. You all decide it's best to keep this wreckage site a secret. The only question though, is what you'll do with your new powers. Will you become palm city's greatest hero... or its most feared villain?&#10;&#10;Welcome to Palm City.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ancient Rome, IV century A.D.: it is a stormy period in Roman Empire, the quiet of past centuries is only a memory and the struggle for the title of Emperor is increasingly harsh.&#10;In the Capital of the Empire, the most important &quot;Gens&quot; do not miss a chance to try to increase their power, to be able to influence the new Augustus as much as possible. Despite political instability, each faction wants to enlarge its possessions and is not afraid to face also armed clashes, with bloody battles later forgotten in the windings of the official historiography... Meanwhile, the Arena and the gladiators are important faces in the fight for the power: the people worship their idols!&#10;&#10;Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome is a strategy and combat board game, set in a period where the power of emperors is often challenged by ambitious province governors or by smart military commanders. In Rome, the Senate is torn apart by the struggle among the various factions, while the people can be influenced by the charisma of the heroes fighting in the Arena. You will have to balance the development of each settlement, the conquest of new territories (even through military battles) and the growth of the skills of your Hero, so to control the most of the Eternal City&rsquo;s seven hills: only in this way it will be possible to dominate Rome and, perhaps in the future, even the entire Empire...&#10;&#10;In Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome, each player will command a powerful Roman dynasty and will have to struggle to gain the domination over the Capital of the Empire: build barracks and farms and expand your influence on the &ldquo;domus&rdquo; on the seven hills of Rome, but do not forget to use your resources to erect a temple in honor of one of the deities! In return, you will have incredible relics for your hero, as well as unique powers for gaining an advantage and defeat your rivals. But do not underestimate the Arena, if you manage to accumulate more glory, the whole city could be yours, but if you were defeated... well, in Rome the losers have a short life!&#10;&#10;Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome offers exceptional components, many miniatures and the 3D models of the seven hills of Rome, true focus of the game and whose conquest will determine the winner. Next to them there is also the Gladiator Arena, in which the players&rsquo; fighters will compete to the death to increase glory and influence of their faction. The union among resources management, cards and combat make this game unique, but also the historical accuracy is important: indeed, we tried to rely on really existed events, characters and places, to allow players to immerse themselves in a sometimes neglected, but also fascinating and glorious, historical period.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These functions as a sort of currency in the game. Currency which can be spent on different Gear. Gears can be anything from a medpack, a helmet, goggles, that grant you new abilities. If these are combined correctly, you will have a Set. The Sets offer a huge bonus to these abilities.&#10;&#10;The Murder House offers you free movement, based on a limited set of movement points. These points can be permanently or passively be either increased or decreased based on effects given through either Action cards or Gear and Sets.&#10;&#10;As you plan your escape, you will be hunted by villains. Each round, a Villain card is drawn - revealing the location of the Villains. If you want to make it out alive, you'll need to make use of the many hiding places inside the house: Shower curtains, fireplaces, underneath tables and inside cryo tanks - when the Villains show up, you do NOT want to be seen.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For almost 600 years, from the fabled shores of the Bosphorus, the Ottoman Sultans ruled over a vast land in Europe, stretching from the Mediterranean to the Danube.  Sometimes enlightened, sometimes cruel, the rule of the Chalifs of Islam had steadily receded before the fury of national ideals and the rising might of European imperialism promoted by bayonet and capital. And yet it still survived, still stubbornly clinging to Balkan territories rich in history, industry and population. The &ldquo;Great Patient&rdquo; seemed to spite Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro; the states created by bloody struggle by those who once were termed the gavur rayahs of the Sultan. They saw with worry the growing appetite of aggressive great powers, all making claims to what they saw as their just inheritance. And then by coup and counter-coup, the fall of a Red Sultan, and the rise of a Committee, the rapaciousness of a young Great Power, and the entente of two old foes, the Balkan states saw danger and opportunity and struck. In the span of just a month of the greatest battles seen in Europe since 1871, the dream of Osman was shattered.&#10;&#10;This scenario supplement for Bloody Big Battles! permits you to re-fight those great battles that saw the end of the Ottoman Empire in Europe and the formation of the basic modern borders in the Balkans. Nine scenarios cover some of the most important battles of the First Balkan War, covering the campaigns of Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria against the Ottoman Empire which would drive the Empire to the very gates of Istanbul/Constantinopole/Tsarigrad.  Five scenarios then cover the Second Balkan War, the conflict between the successful allies which pitted Serbia, Montenegro and Greece against Bulgaria over the legacy of the Ottoman Empire.&#10;&#10;Each scenario provides a distinct operational and tactical puzzle for war-gamers to resolve. From straightforward assaults against fortified positions like the First Battle of Chataldja, to complex double envelopments like the Battle of Lule Burgas, from the extensive broad fronts of the Battle of Bregalnitza, to the knife fight in close quarters of the Battle of Bizani. There are small scenarios easily played in one or two hours, like the Battle of Dioran (the actual First battle of Dioran), and more substantive scenarios like the Battle of Kumanovo, still playable in an evening.  There are battles fought on rolling hills and plains, like the Battle of Kirkkilise, and battles fought in some of the worst ground people have ever thought of fighting each other in an organized manner, like the Battle of Kalimanchi.&#10;&#10;You will see how these wars where similar and how they differed from The Great War. You will understand the crucial role of terrain as a military variable and grapple with key decisions of force to task distributions in an unforgiving strategic operational and tactical environment. You will see the last glory days of the bayonet charge, and the opening bloody howl of modern artillery.  There is challenge to satisfy all types of war-gamers.&#10;&#10;An included overview of the historical events and biographies of many of the commanders whose roles you reprise on the table-top will provide you with the background to give you an inkling of the vast stakes and human drama associated with these battles. An annotated bibliography provides you both with the sources used to build the scenarios and further reading to enrich your understanding and experience. A figure guide helps you find suitable ways to represent the armies in almost all scales of miniature war-gaming.&#10;&#10;A struggle for a vast future awaits! Take command and see how history was forged!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each of the five were once champions of their race before transcending from mortals to demigods while on a quest to destroy the gods of old.&#10;&#10;Their quest was bestowed upon them at The Gathering, a time when the major races of Athien came together to select five among them, so they could travel to the plane of shadow and stop the meddling of the old gods. The orcs and dwarfs nominated their most respected spiritual leaders, Krognar and Bruell to guide the five. The Elves and Minotaurs nominated their most powerful mage, Ista, and warrior Grul, to challenge the gods. By consensus the humans provided their greatest knight, Tomas, to provide leadership for the company.&#10;&#10;As one of the Everlasting, you summon heroes from the mortal world of Athien to the shadow plane (Between), so they can harvest souls at your behest. Souls that give you power and sustain your immortality. This is the game of Judgement.&#10;&#10;Judgement brings all the elements of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) video game genre to the table top. Powerful, diverse and fun heroes, neutral monsters, magical items and hero levels. These ingredients provide a truly amazing gaming experience like no other miniature game on the market. The game design team worked tirelessly for almost 2 years creating, testing and perfecting the core mechanics which ensure diverse, dynamic hero activations and a fast, flexible combat system. The icing on the cake are superbly detailed 54mm scale resin cast miniatures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the base game, you have to watch out for pirates and other players while sailing, and nothing else. When you deliver your spices back on your home island, they are safe. Now, not anymore&hellip; You start with a fort on your home island with which you can defend against other players trying to steal your spices. Pirates get 2 forts on the High Seas to aid them, but if you defeat them, you could own those forts!&#10;&#10;2 &ndash; Settlements. Because this expansion comes with a lot more options to spend your gold on, it&rsquo;s only fair that you also get the opportunity to earn more. You can now build settlements on wild islands with no cards left on them. The settlement will produce crates for you, and act as a harbor to protect you from attacks too!&#10;&#10;3 &ndash; Treasures. Similarly to settlements, when you find a treasure, you find gold! Which aids you wih modules 1 and 6.&#10;&#10;4 &ndash; Events. No longer can you only draw trade propositions at wild islands. When you least expect it, lightning strikes! Or you summon the Kraken. Or who knows, something helpful may happen. It also means you can no longer safely look at the last card at an island. It may be an event, which means then the deck is empty and you can be attacked!&#10;&#10;5- Reefs. Another danger on the High Seas for you, your opponents and the pirates! Are you going to be safe and sail around them, or take the risk and hope your ship passes safely through it? Getting stuck is no fun, except for when it happens to the pirates!&#10;&#10;6- Crew. When an island runs out of trade cards in the base game, they are of no interest. Not anymore! You can now build settlements, but the locals on the island are also looking for something to do! Pay a local for their services and upgrade your ship in a whole new way! Just be careful in battles not to get your crew killed!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.&#10;&#10;Hanabi Deluxe II is similar to the Hanabi Deluxe edition first released in 2013, which features the same gameplay as the original game, but with the cards being replaced by Mah Jhong-style tiles. Hanabi Deluxe II includes six unique tiles that comprise the &quot;Master Artisan&quot; expansion.&#10;&#10;",

Breaches in reality begin to rip through the fabric of the Earth, and a faint melody of discordant pipes can be heard throughout the streets of Arkham. Frightened citizens have sealed themselves in their homes, yet you continue to patrol the streets, desperate for some solution to end the chaos.&#10;&#10;In In the Clutches of Chaos, doom does not accrue at the usual rate. Instead, breaches are made at various locations, marked by resource tokens. When enough breaches have been made a single location, an incursion occurs. An incursion adds doom to its location and causes the breaches to spread, opening rifts in reality at connecting locations. Your goal is to prevent incursions by removing the breaches that cause them, but this can only be done by activating the action abilities on each location. If you do not maintain control over the breaches, you may soon find yourself overwhelmed with Arkham falling into madness. You cannot allow that to happen!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In many ways it is the illigitemate [sic] child of Panzerblitz and Grunt. But it is distinctive and in many ways superior to both ... In this game we have squads of 14 men, and we have teams of two ... Some may complain that the game is too close to Panzerblitz. Well, part of that us intentional. I saw no reason to require the gamer to learn a new game system when most are familiar with Panzerblitz. For that reason, I left the factors where they were on the counter, and used, for all practical purposes, the same CRT ... Besides, this game is sort of a companion to PzB, allowing you to get closer to the action. Basically, we had to contend with Bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic rifles, machine pistols, and machine guns. Assault rifles are also included, and the heavier fire factors are indicative of the fire-generation of these weapons. The Vietnam type infantry provided for the Americans include not only assault rifles, but Grenade Launchers - pocket cannon ... German paratroopers might carry rifles, smg, or assault rifles ... Any differences in the relative intelligence or training or minor differences in weapons are reflected in reduced or increased range, reflecting more or less disciplined fire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Story and goal&#10;&#10;All children are rooting in the leaves. Because under the colorful foliage  many animals have hidden - also fruits and cones are below it.&#10;&#10;Each turn adds an extra sheet with a new theme mixed on the  bottom among the others.&#10;&#10;Who finds it the first to root?&#10;&#10;Preparation:&#10;&#10;a) Sort out the leaves with pictures and put them in the bag.&#10;&#10;The other leaves are distributed on the &quot;forest floor&quot; in the box bottom. Then you put the coins next to the Box ready.&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts, then it goes clockwise continue.&#10;&#10;If you are the youngest child, take the fabric bag and take out a sheet without  looking into it. Look at the motive on the underside secret, without the others can see.&#10;&#10;Remember this motif and hide it under the leaves in the box  while the other players turn around.&#10;&#10;If you have hidden the sheet, your teammates - with one hand - dig in the pile of foliage, just for this new one&#10;&#10;To search motive. The leaves may be opened and closed&#10;&#10;Be careful, but be careful when digging: Leaves must remain in the box.&#10;&#10;Anyone who thinks they have found the new motive they are looking for calls the name of  the animal or the fruit.&#10;&#10;     Was it correct, the player may take a gold coin. The sheet comes back in the box, in such a way that the picture is hidden.&#10;     If it is wrong, the other players may (only) continue to dig,&#10;&#10;&#10;until one  finds the right motive and gets a gold coin.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game:&#10;&#10;As soon as the last motive has been found in the heap of leaves and given the correct name, the game is over. Who has collected the most gold coins, wins the game! If two or more players have the same number of coins, they win together.&#10;&#10;Have fun digging, grumbling, rustling and finding!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introduction:&#10;&#10;Ark of Atlantis is a worker placement style board game. During each turn, players work hard to collect resources, save creatures, and find artifacts all while trying to build a ship large enough to save all of their workers before Atlantis sinks. As players race against time and each other, Atlantis continues to sink around them. Players must juggle their time between building a ship to save themselves and risking everything in order to save all that Atlantis holds dear. Players receive bonus points for risking and saving precious items from around the island before they too are lost to the sea. &#10;&#10;&#10;The Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to acquire more victory points than any other player. Players receive victory points for building ship sections, collecting treasure tokens, and selling resources. Players lose victory points for each worker they were unable to save at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;How Ark of Atlantis Plays:&#10; Players take turns placing their workers around the island. On a player&rsquo;s turn they can collect resources, build ship sections, or save valuable creatures, treasures, potions, and rare books from around the island to gain extra victory points. Each time a player places a worker or a group of workers they must then move their time track marker forward for each worker they placed. In Ark of Atlantis, the turn order is constantly changing depending on where a player&rsquo;s time track marker is positioned on the time track. If a player&rsquo;s marker lands on or passes over an event space the player draws an event card and then resolves it by flipping over an island tile. The second time an island tile would be flipped it is removed from the game. The game ends once all island tiles have been removed. Next, players tally up their victory points by adding any bonus points or deducting points for each worker they were unable to save. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On January 17, 1781, Banastre Tareltons' [sic] Brigade of Light Infantry broke cover shortly after dawn, and faced a low hill sloping to a crest about 1/2 a mile away. A few hundred yards away were the American Rangers, the three light infantry companies that formed the pickets of the American position. Behind them, about half way up the slop stood 300 American Militiamen, none of them eager to face the enemy. But at the crest stood the American line. Six hundred regulars, they were the heart of the American force. Wearing bright blue uniforms, they stood in straight lines measured carefully by their officers. At the crest of the hill stood Morgan, the swashbuckling American light infantry commander. The British had chased him for two weeks, and now they had him, for he could go no further.&#10;&#10;This game is at best an experiment in muzzle-loading warfare. If it works out, and I feel it has, we shall produce a line of such games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;A game depicting the American Revolutionary War battle of Cowpens. The game does not define its time or unit scales.&#10;&#10;American units, except for cavalry, are deployed on the map. Cavalry units being off-map but are allowed to enter at any time. British units enter the map on designated turns during the first nine turns of the game. The turn order starts with one side firing, moving, and then designating bayonet assaults. This is followed by a defensive fire phase, after which the bayonet assaults are resolved. The opponent then executes the same phases which constitutes a completed game turn.&#10;&#10;A CRT is used for combat resolution. Unit rankings include an attack factor, defense factor, movement factor, and range. Victory conditions are based on points received for destruction of units, ranging from 3 points for destruction of a militia unit to 10 points for destruction of a cannon unit. You win by scoring 10 or more victory points than your opponent. A margin of less than 10 victory points results in a draw.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Cowpens was published in the first issue of JagdPanther magazine. While the rules and counters for the game were re-released in a 2012 PDF reprint of the magazine, the game's map could not be located and the publisher has asked for a scan of the map from anyone who owns the original edition.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
