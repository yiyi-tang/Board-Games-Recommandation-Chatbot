    "Description": "June 1944, the Allies have finally opened the second front demanded by Stalin. The Red Army then launches the Bagration operation. Bringing considerable resources, over 2 million men and 4,000 tanks, it aims to liberate Belorussia. Taken by surprise, the German Army Group Center collapses quickly. The Soviets then advance 600 km in a month, causing an unprecedented defeat to the Germans. They are stopped at the gates of Warsaw, where the insurgency that has just started will be ruthlessly suppressed.&#10;&#10;But the Axis forces are not yet beaten and 10 months of fierce fighting will be necessary until the final victory.&#10;&#10;Victory Roads is a historical simulation retracing the campaign on the Eastern Front, from June 22, 1944, the day of the launch of the offensive Bagration in Byelorussia, until May 1945 in Berlin.&#10;&#10;Victory Roads uses the same game system as Liberty Roads, our wargame on the Western Front, from the D-Day to April 1945, while integrating the specific characteristics of this campaign. The counters are the divisions (Axis) and corps (Soviets) of both sides involved in the campaign.&#10;&#10;The system focuses on the different structure of the two opposing armies. Supports represent the effects of various materiel, equipment, as well as specific battle events.&#10;&#10;Players who are used to play with Liberty Roads should find Victory Roads very familiar.&#10;&#10;The main difference the game offers relies in the way to handle the Soviet player&rsquo;s offensive. A TO marker represents an area of logistic and administrative support from the Chief Commander of Stavka. Theaters of Operation markers are somewhat similar to PLUTO markers although slightly more tricky to handle.

    "Description": "Star Scrappers: Orbital by Jacob Fryxelius, the designer of Terraforming Mars, is based on his Space Station card game, which has been mechanically streamlined, updated and re-themed to fit the Star Scrappers universe - a space western setting created and developed by Hexy Studio.&#10;&#10;You start your space station (Orbital) with a core module tile on the table, then over five years (rounds) you expand it by paying and placing new module cards. Each year you start with a five card hand, crew tokens and new money, with the amount of crew and money determined by the structure of your orbital. You use money primarily to pay for new modules, and the crew gives you special effects on many of your modules.&#10;&#10;During the year, the players take turns doing actions such as building, using module actions, playing event cards, repairing or passing. When everyone passes, the year ends and victory points are awarded: there are six kinds (colors) of modules and for each kind, the player(s) with the most modules of that kind is awarded a victory point. At the end of the fifth year, the player with most victory point wins.&#10;&#10;Background story:&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Star Scrappers universe! Have a seat and get comfortable in the commander chair on a Space Station - one of many that are being constructed in the asteroid belt called the Sybil Cloud. Deposits of Hexis - the most desired mineral in the entire Galaxy - have been discovered there, attracting numerous daredevils willing to extract the precious crystals. Miners have to live somewhere, so you and your corporation are here to provide them with accommodation and, naturally, to get rich!&#10;&#10;Terrons:&#10;&#10;Terrons, the space station builders, are descendants of the humans who came to this galaxy a long time ago. Over a thousand years, united in the Interstellar Terron Federation, they have colonized many corners of the universe. The democratic system of the Terron society has encouraged the creation of many independent structures, such as corporations, commercial consortiums and mercenary guilds. By making contact with different alien species, they have caused their civilization to flourish and their influence to spread. At the base of their success lies ambition. Ambition that knows no bounds. This trait of character drives Terrons ever forward, to conquer new territories, to discover the unknown, to push the frontier of the Federation another step further. Their military forces are well-known across the Central Sector, as they strike fear in the hearts of alien beings inhabiting the Galaxy. They became famous during the two Hy&rsquo;Dran Wars, proving unshaken and well-trained. Even now, in times of peace, the Terron fleet remains ready to defend their territories. And their businesses.&#10;&#10;Other inhabitants of the Galaxy:&#10; In the distant future, countless alien species explore the Galaxy in search of fortune and fame. The last interstellar war with the Hy&rsquo;Dran Empire ended over fifty years ago and since then peace treaties have been in power. Newly discovered cosmic nations, like the cybernetic Biosses and the expansive Weedlocks, are beginning to influence the fate of the Galaxy, while the inhabitants of ancient planets, such as the mechanical Metanels and the mysterious Minegglers, are once again striving to achieve their goals.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, players are dealt eight trail cards where they&rsquo;ll draft two cards, arrange those cards in their personal area, and pass their hand to the next player three times.  Cards must either be placed adjacent to or overlapping other cards.  While players can push their luck by aiming to construct long and elaborate trails, only closed loops that start and end at a matching campsite will score points.  Players also compete to fulfill &ldquo;First To&rdquo; and &ldquo;End Game&rdquo; goal cards.  After four rounds, the game ends and the player with the most points from closed loops and goal cards wins.&#10;&#10;The Super Travel Edition of Trailblazers plays up to 4 players and includes PVC cards, the clamshell case, and carabiner.  It does not include any expansions.  There is one solo mode. Another version of this edition exists as the &quot;Pocket Edition&quot; which features the same game content but instead comes in a tuck box with regular cards.&#10;&#10;(The Standard and Deluxe editions play up to 8 players, include the Animals and Adventures expansions, and have three solo modes.

Fate, in the form of the dice, can be controlled to a certain degree but still might thwart your plans; Sandstorms and the mighty Shai-Hulud plague the surface of Arrakis; A charismatic leader might tip the balance in a forlorn combat in your favour.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one Faction or Alliance is in control of a certain number of Arrakis&rsquo; strategic Regions at the end of their turn, or after 6 whole rounds.&#10;&#10;Inspired by and based on both, this game tries to find a middle ground between the complexity and duration of Dune and the excessive simplicity of Dune Express while staying true to former&rsquo;s general feel and steering closer to the lore of the original novels than both.

It is said people have a year of misfortune and woes &mdash; at the age of 42 for men and 33 for women &mdash; so to be cured and avoid bad luck, pilgrims of those ages attend the temple 23 called Yaku&#197;&#141;ji and place of the Buddha of healing, Yakushi Nyorai. In every step, pilgrims leave a coin while singing the Yakushi mantra, which favors them with spiritual healing and prevents misfortune.&#10;&#10;In Shikoku, players play the role of pilgrims who are going up the 33 steps while singing mantras until they reach the pagoda. However, the &quot;Middle Path&quot; seeks moderation, not the extremes: To be the first one, or the last, is not welcome! The winners will be those who are second or next to last on the steps when a player reaches the top. The game is played in rounds, each of them with three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Following the turn order of the mantra line, each player plays one card from their hand placing it in the mantra area along with their pilgrim.&#10;    When all players had played a card, pilgrims will be moved on the board. Players whose cards are second counting from the left and second counting from the right, don't go up. The other players go up as many steps (ICONO) as the card with their pilgrim indicates.&#10;    Move the mantra card (and its pilgrim) with the lower value from the first position to the last one of the mantra line. This will determine the turn order of the next round.&#10;&#10;&#10;The last player in the mantra line gets a new mantra card and other players take one of the cards (in turn order) that have been played during the previous round to have three cards in their hands.&#10;&#10;After the moving phase of a round, if one or more players reach the pagoda (square 33), the game ends and the player, or players, who are second counting from the top and second counting from the bottom, win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Battle Hymn Vol. One includes two games: Gettysburg: The Tide Turns and Pea Ridge: The Struggle for Missouri.&#10;&#10;Battle Hymn is a new brigade-level game system that simulates the chaos of the America Civil War using a simple activation system combined with a detailed combat system. The system&rsquo;s designer, Eric Lee Smith, originated the &ldquo;chit-pull&rdquo; activation system in his game &ldquo;Panzer Command&rdquo; and later used it in &ldquo;Across Five Aprils,&rdquo; Battle Hymn&rsquo;s forerunner, both published by Victory Games. Units are organized by command, usually divisions, and activate for movement when the command&rsquo;s activation marker is picked from the cup. The system uses traditional mechanics for movement, with units differentiated by type, but adds a level of detail to combat that feels almost miniatures like. In fact, the system is designed for easy conversion to miniatures. When one side has the initiative they decide when their combat phase occurs, without it, you don&rsquo;t know when it will happen.&#10;&#10;Units have strength point steps, which are either &ldquo;formed&rdquo; or demoralized, and losses are taken point by point. Based upon the latest research into Civil War combat and tactics, units suffer attrition in both losses and demoralizations until they finally shatter and are removed from the map. There are two combat phases, each of which consists of two rounds of combat. Engagements are fluid, with retreats and advances setting up unexpected confrontations during the second round of combat.&#10;&#10;Battle Hymn is a &ldquo;player&rsquo;s game&rdquo; designed to play fast and provide lots of fun and historical insight. With scenarios taking as little as an hour, up to eight hours for the full campaign, there is plenty of variety. The system is streamlined and does not have the complications seen in other games, such as logistics and leadership hierarchy. Here, it's all about strategy, movement, and fighting.&#10;&#10;Gettysburg: The Tide Turns needs no introduction as to subject, but the treatment is noteworthy. Using a graphics approach based upon the maps produced by the US Government after the war, the map is a pleasure to behold. There are six scenarios in the game, some of which have alternatives for additional variety.&#10;&#10;Pea Ridge: The Struggle for Missouri simulates the decisive battle of Pea Ridge, which determined that Missouri would stay in the Union. It could have gone the other way. This is a classic meeting engagement with the Confederates on the offensive and outnumbering the Union for once.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include hidden movement and more randomization during combat (more historical and also simulates async computer play).&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;Note: Some scenarios have alternatives making them in effect two or more scenarios.&#10;&#10;Gettysburg&#10;&#10;Pickett&rsquo;s Charge - 3 turns, 45 minutes&#10;The Best Three Hours (Devil&rsquo;s Den) - 3 turns, 1 hour&#10;The Accidental Battle (Day One) - 11 turns, 3 hours&#10;Longstreet&rsquo;s March (Day Two) - 9 turns, 3 hours&#10;The Tide Turns (Day Three) - 7 turns, 3 hours&#10;The Battle of Gettysburg (campaign) - 31 turns, 8 hours&#10;&#10;Pea Ridge&#10;&#10;The Surprise Attack (Day One) - 9 turns, 2 hours&#10;Missouri Redeemed! (Day Two) - 5 turns, 1.5 hours&#10;The Battle of Pea Ridge (campaign) - 15 turns, 5 hours&#10;&#10;Product Information&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium (4 out of 10)&#10;Playing Time: 45 minutes to 3 hours (scenarios), 5 to 8 hours (full campaigns)&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High (due to variable activation system)&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = 60 to 90 minutes depending on the game and day &#10;Map Scale: 1 hex = 300 yards across &#10;Unit Scale: Brigades, strength point = 150-300 men (depending on the game &amp; unity type)&#10;Players: 2 (but far above average as a solitaire game)&#10;Game Designer: Eric Lee Smith&#10;Artist: Robert Shields&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The 98 cards in the set include new heroes, villains, equipment, locations, constructs, and features two different approaches to play. The Sinestro side is built around attack and forcing his opponent to take bad cards, while the Green Lantern side prefers drawing extra cards and a strong defense.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players take on the roles of Green Lantern and Sinestro. Each oversized character card has a cost of 9, 12, or 15 and has a unique ability. As they are defeated, the characters grow in difficulty to take down, and their abilities also improve. Players start off on an even playing field with identical decks of cards. They then use the cards in their hands and special abilities to buy bigger and better cards. As the game progresses, each player's deck becomes unique, strengthened by their decisions. Players attack and defend until Green Lantern or Sinestro stands supreme over his iconic rival!&#10;&#10;The DC Deck-Building Game: Rivals &ndash; Green Lantern vs. Sinestro is fully compatible with the earlier Rivals &ndash; Batman vs. The Joker and the Confrontations set. It is also compatible with all other Cerberus Engine games.&#10;&#10;",

This game is designed to be enjoyed by 2-3 players. Players play stronger cards than each other to win the game by getting rid of their hand.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are two types of card ranks: numbers and colors (symbols).&#10;&#10;At the start of a game, whether you are playing for numbers or colors hasn&rsquo;t yet been decided. If the subsequent card has a stronger number, you play by numbers, and if it is a stronger color, you play by colors. If you play a card with stronger number AND color, the rule remains undetermined, and the next player will have options to choose.&#10;&#10;To win, it is important to plan ahead and take control of the dynamic card strengths.&#10;&#10;&#10;Ambiente Abissal is a shedding game for 2 or 3 players, which is to say the first person to play all cards from their hand will be the winner of a round.&#10;&#10;The cards used in the game vary by player count, but there are an equal number of card ranks and suits, and each of these give the players a way to rank cards.  That is, if a person plays an Orange 2, it could be beat by any higher ranked card (number) or any card of a higher suit (color).  In addition to playing one card, the first player could play 2 cards (of the same number or same suit), which can be beat in similar ways.&#10;&#10;Play continues around the table with players playing 1 or 2 cards to beat the current high play or passing.  Once all but one player has passed, the current trick ends and the last player to play begins anew.&#10;&#10;Once a player has played all of the cards from their hand, they will earn points, and when a player has earned a given sum of points, they are determined to be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each time one player activates a company, he/she adds to his deck more decision cards.  Decision cards give the players various possible actions (like buy/activate/hire/obstacles). The most important is the &quot;buy&quot; action, with which players can either buy a building or a resource from the market.&#10;&#10;",

A new noble visits the market each day, offering a special power to whoever wants to pay for the privilege, with his price dropping each day.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the seven action cards in hand, then they resolve them in order of who has the most gold. They then do this twice more, getting discounts now for the cost of taking certain actions. The action cards let you earn gold, take all the cards from one store or bazaar booth, hire a noble, swap gems, protect yourself for inspections in case you have fake gems, copy your previously played action, or (most important of all) sell gems.&#10;&#10;In addition to points from nobles and prestige cards, most of your score will come from gems that you sell &mdash; but you need to sell the right gems in the right way. When selling to a jeweler, you need to sell four different types of gems (or three types and gold), but you score only for one of the gem cards sold; when selling to a collector, you sell gems of only one type, but you have to hold the most gems of that type and you score only the difference between what you hold and what the player with the secondmost gems of this type holds. Status matters in the collector community!&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most prestige points after ten days wins.&#10;&#10;",

He can use formulas in front of himself or other players to do this. Any elements under formulas reused this way are returned to the Desk. Any opponent who loses one or more formulas this way scores half the points of the more difficult formula just completed. The player's turn then ends.&#10;    Plays a spell from his hand to take a card from the desk into his hand, to decompose one completed formula or to transform one formula into another. After playing a spell, he must take another action, which could be playing another spell.&#10;&#10;&#10;After the deck runs out, players continue to take turns until no one has cards remaining in hand.

    "Description": "To The Last Man! is a strategic level wargame of World War 1 covering all aspects of the western front.&#10;&#10;To The Last Man! uses cards to allow units to fight, take replacements and affect the course of the game with key technological, military, and political events. Players alternate playing cards and moving pieces. The game sequence is very interactive, with NO down time waiting for the other player to take his turn. The combat system has both players rolling dice in each combat.&#10;&#10;In this two-player game each player starts the campaign game and 1914 scenario with cards that also represent the prewar stocks of ammunition, reserves and planning that allows the war to start off with a large bang. After players expend this allotment of cards, they must purchase more cards along with new units. Each player's resources are limited, so players often will not be able to launch large offensives every turn. They'll need to husband their resources. This represents the preparation for the next &quot;Big Push.&quot; All of this leads to difficult game decisions all the way through the game.&#10;&#10;There are scenarios for each year of the war from 1914 to 1918, along with the hypothetical Fuller or 1919 offensive. Also included are the many war plans conceived prior to the war and their appropriate set-ups so you could, for example, try the French 1909 plan vs. the German Schlieffen Plan.&#10;&#10;Rules include: Great Offensives, Stosstruppen, tanks, gas attacks, cavalry, huge dogfights, reserves, siege guns, forts, events on other fronts, and much more.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Autumn For Barbarossa, (AfB) is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game covering the the struggle to seize Smolensk in the late summer of 1941. This marks the end of the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa and the stabilization of the front until the effort to take Moscow in Operation Typhoon in the fall.&#10;&#10;AfB features a small map area and a limited number of units, making it easily accessible for fast or competition play. The entire campaign finishes in 10 turns.&#10;&#10;Play begins with the German offensive in full bloom. The German player attempts to rapidly seize as much of the map (in the form of Victory Point locations) as he can. Speed is essential; while he has several cities to reduce, he knows the clock is ticking before Hitler pulls the plug on his efforts. The commanders did not realize this was in the cards, but for design purposes we assume the player feels the pistol pointed at his head. The Germans have copious air and mechanized forces to accomplish their goals...for the moment. At some point determined by the &quot;Hitler Roll&quot;, the German mechanized forces are taken off the map, their air support is cut in half, and the Red counteroffensive strikes in an attempt to turn things around.&#10;&#10;The Soviet player stalls, withdraws, and conserves his forces while letting the German offensive expend itself. As the high tide passes, he prepares his rebuilt Red Army for the second half of the game: the Soviet effort to blunt the German gains and recoup their losses as best they can.&#10;&#10;It that was first published in Special_Ops magazine #7 (2017).&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 6 days&#10;Hex: 7 miles / 11.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Regiment to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Special Ops edition):&#10;One 16 x 28&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page Autumn for Barbarossa rules booklet&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-6&#10;&#10;",

When a case comes to court, players add their Evidence cards, and make Motions and Objections, in order to sway the jury to their side. Then the case is either settled by plea bargain (an agreement by lawers to divide the case money) or by the jury (a 2D6 dice roll of 13 or more which includes all card modifiers played on this case).

The deck is passed to the left and an action taken until there is just one action card type left in the deck.  Dividends are then paid (based on railroad value and total number of shares), and a new round is started.  The game lasts for nine rounds, at which time a final payoff is made based on value, income, and actual shares sold.  There are only 5 shares of each railroad available, with the money from the stock purchase going into the railroad treasury.  Also, all track construction must be paid for out of railroad treasuries, and the track is drawn along pre-defined routes using plastic crayons.  Settlements are developed using player funds, which in turn increases the income available to a railroad.  The player with the most money after the final payoff wins.&#10;&#10;The fourth game in the Prairie Railroads Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The story so far &ndash; exploration of mineral resources on the moon&#10;&#10;The year is 2117. Climate change has taken its toll on Earth and new resources are needed to fuel a very technically advanced society gathered into ever growing megacities around the globe. Research during the last 50 years has shown that the Moon has several very pure and effective mineral resources that are needed on Earth. This year, mining corporations has established bases on the Moon with the purpose of building a transportation network to mine valuable mineral resources. As these resources are of global interest, the top 20 nations on Earth have invested in a freight rocket &ldquo;Future One&rdquo; scheduled to fly to the moon and transport minerals back to Earth.&#10;When the game starts, the corporations got eleven months to gather as much minerals as possible before the rocket leaves the moon.&#10;Players are opportunistic investors &ndash;most wealth at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;The players (referred to as &ldquo;investors&rdquo; in this game) see an excellent opportunity to make credits (=money) by investing in and running private companies and mining corporations on the moon. The corporations establish bases on the moon and build road networks to valuable mining resources, mining as much resources as possible until the freight rocket leaves the moon with its cargo of minerals.&#10;&#10;The winner is the wealthiest investor when the rocket leaves. An investor's wealth is made up of personal credits and current market value of owned shares in the seven corporations.&#10;&#10;21Moon is an 18xx game.&#10;&#10;",

The captain has rounded you all up because you're all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid. That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!&#10;&#10;In game terms, each round players secretly stack three of their ten action cards, then they take turns revealing and playing those actions one by one no matter what's gone wrong between the planning and the doing. If you plan to have a pirate shove someone off the plank on your third move and all he sees are his own best mates, he will still shove away! Some cards bear a skull on them, and these powerful cards must remain on the table the round after they're played, but otherwise players then pick up their action cards and start a new round. As soon as two or fewer pirates remain on board, the game ends and the owner (or owners) of these pirates win! Watch out, though, as sometimes every pirate will end up in the drink, which means that no one wins other than the sharks circling in the water below...&#10;&#10;This all new deluxe tin edition features a reworked version of the rules, all new artwork (by Felideus Bubastis), screen printed meeples, and the Ghost Meeple mini-expansion (with rules).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warhammer Age of Sigmar is more than a game &ndash; it&rsquo;s a hobby. Build armies of plastic warriors drawn from the many warring factions that inhabit the Mortal Realms, paint your models to personalise your collection, and take them to the tabletop to play fast-paced games of strategy and action that will allow you to tell your own stories within the Age of Sigmar.&#10;&#10;The new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar features the most comprehensive look at the core rules since the first Generals Handbook, and like those changes, the new ones will have an equally huge impact on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;Artefacts of the Realms&#10;The Mortal Realms are enormous, and the factions that fight among them are characterised as much by which of the realms they hail from as by their Grand Alliance. Previously, we&rsquo;ve seen this represented largely through creative paint jobs and appropriate basing, with some hobbyists using clever conversions to identify where their force comes from. Now, in the new edition, you&rsquo;ll be able to represent where your army hails from with 84 new magic items. When you&rsquo;re writing your army list, you have the option to pick a Realm for your army to be from. As well as providing you with loads of opportunities for roleplaying (not to mention painting and converting), you&rsquo;ll be able to replace one of your normal Artefact picks with a special artefact from your chosen realm.&#10;&#10;Battling in the Realms&#10;The new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar turns the Mortal Realms into rich backdrops for all of your battles. These aren&rsquo;t just optional expansions, but a core part of the game. Each of the Mortal Realms has a set of unique rules that create unusual challenges and opportunities for the armies fighting in them. Firstly, each realm has a command ability, apart from Shyish, which has two, and Ghur, which has wandering, feral monsters instead. Available to every Hero fighting in that realm, these abilities ensure that your army fights in a thematically appropriate way for the realm it&rsquo;s in. Secondly, each Realm has a set of Realmscape Features &ndash; a random in-game effect that&rsquo;ll often have a significant impact on how your game will go. Last, but not least, each of the Mortal Realms has a massive selection of spells associated with it, representing the unique powers that Wizards are able to harness. Each realm has seven spells, ALL of which will be available to ANY Wizard fighting in that realm. Finally, choosing a Realm has a range of impacts on certain warscrolls. Each endless spell, for example, is more powerful when cast in its associated realm.&#10;&#10;Command Abilities and Command Points&#10;There are loads of awesome command abilities in Warhammer Age of Sigmar, but in the previous edition, some would almost never see play because they belonged to models who weren&rsquo;t being used as generals. In the new edition, every Hero can contribute and use their command ability, whether they&rsquo;re your general or not. There&rsquo;s a twist, however &ndash; to use any of your command abilities, you&rsquo;ll need a new resource, known as command points. Command points represent the tactical cohesion of your forces &ndash; you&rsquo;ll receive one to add to your pool every turn, and you&rsquo;ll get an additional point at the beginning of the game per warscroll battalion you&rsquo;ve used. That&rsquo;s not all! There are now three command abilities every single army and every single general can use &ndash; a tweaked Inspiring Presence, At the Double and Forward to Victory.&#10;&#10;Endless Spells&#10;Magic is changing in the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, offering you something never seen on our tables before &ndash; physical sorceries with models and rules of their own. Endless spells are cast like normal spells, but rather than resolving their text with a mere roll of the dice, each summons a model to the table. This miniature then persists throughout the game until it&rsquo;s dispelled. Endless spells are moved at the start of each battle round after determining who gets the first turn, with players taking it in turns to pick a spell to move, starting with the player that has the second turn that round. You&rsquo;ll be able to move any Endless Spell with this move, not just the ones you control, representing their wild and untameable nature.&#10;&#10;Look Out, Sir!&#10;With the new command ability system making Heroes more useful than ever, the last thing you want is to watch a critical support character get shot off the table before they get to do anything interesting. In the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, we&rsquo;ve balanced this with a new ability for Heroes that&rsquo;ll make your smaller and more vulnerable characters a lot more durable at range. By keeping your heroes close to your units, you&rsquo;ll make them much harder for enemies to kill at range.&#10;&#10;Magic: Casting and Unbinding&#10;Magic is most interesting when each army&rsquo;s magic phase is distinct and defined by the unique character of the wizards involved. To do that, the new edition sees a change to two classic spells &ndash; Arcane Bolt and Mystic Shield &ndash; to offer more incentive to use the unique spells each Wizard has access to. You&rsquo;ll still find these spells a valuable part of any wizard&rsquo;s toolkit, but they&rsquo;ve been toned down in comparison to others. Secondly, you can now attempt to unbind a spell at a massive 30&Prime; range, up from 18&Prime;, making unbinding much easier and also giving you a chance to deny your enemy key spells even in the first turn of the game, where you may not have had a chance to move your wizards into defensive positions.&#10;&#10;Measuring and Piling In&#10;We know most people play Warhammer Age of Sigmar measuring from bases already, so this is just a case of enshrining it in rules and making way for a more tactical era of Warhammer Age of Sigmar. Piling in has changed to work with the new, official base-to-base system, to allow you to get as many models into combat as possible. Where previously, you could only pile in towards the closest enemy model before having to stop, now, you can pile in even if you&rsquo;re right next to someone &ndash; provided you don&rsquo;t move any further away from the nearest enemy model. This should make large units a bit easier to use and should make surrounding enemies a bit simpler. Secondly, you can&rsquo;t choose not to attack with a unit anymore &ndash; the combat phase only ends when every single eligible unit has piled in and participated.&#10;&#10;Shooting in Combat&#10;Shooting in the new edition is changing slightly. While you&rsquo;ll still be able to shoot whilst in combat, you won&rsquo;t be able to shoot out of it. This makes for a more dynamic game as far as shooting is involved. Taking a few fast-moving, durable units in your army will be key for quickly occupying shooting units that&rsquo;d usually play havoc with the squishier elements of your forces, while defensively, you&rsquo;ll want to screen your key ranged troops with support troops.&#10;&#10;Summoning, For Free!&#10;In the new edition, summoning has been changed to work better for everyone and to properly reflect the unique character of each army that uses it. Rather than summoning units through magical spells, every army that could summon units before now has a unique resource that allows them to bring fresh reinforcements onto the tabletop that fits with their army&rsquo;s background. The big change for matched play, though, is that summoning now no longer costs reinforcement points! Instead, you earn your summoned units with in-game actions: bloodshed, spreading plague, mastering magic, and other thematic goals.&#10;&#10;Turn Priority&#10;In Warhammer Age of Sigmar, the game is split into battle rounds, and players roll at the beginning of each round to see who goes first. This means, in effect, a player may occasionally get to take two turns in a row. In the new edition, the studio have added an extra level of depth, choice and chance to this mechanic, as well as removing some of the randomness, to make for more tactical games. Previously, players would roll off to determine who gets to decide who gets the first turn in each battle round, with the winner getting to choose. This works in much the same way in the new edition, but now, if the players get a draw, the player that went first in the previous battle round wins the roll.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In more detail, the game board shows a map of a city with certain locations being connected by colored paths. Each player starts with four colored parade float cards in hand and two tickets; each ticket shows two locations, and you're trying to connect those two locations with a contiguous path of your trains in order to complete the ticket.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either draw two parade float cards from the deck or discard parade float cards to claim a route between two locations by placing your ghost trains on it; for this latter option, you must discard cards matching the color and number of spaces on that route (e.g., two yellow cards for a yellow route that's two spaces long). If you connect the two locations shown on a ticket with a path of your trains, reveal the ticket, place it face up in front of you, then draw a new ticket. (If you can't connect locations on either ticket because the paths are blocked, you can take your entire turn to discard those tickets and draw two new ones.)&#10;&#10;If you create a route all the way from the Dark Forest region to the Seashore region, you collect the &quot;trick or treat&quot; bonus.&#10;&#10;",

The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.&#10;&#10;The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.&#10;&#10;Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.&#10;&#10;The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.&#10;&#10;It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;. It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.&#10;&#10;",

Get Me Off This Planet! is a fast-paced, &quot;gateway&quot; game where you use the moon and spacecraft to get your Aliens off the planet before it explodes!&#10;&#10;The game has a casual space theme and never takes itself too seriously. Lift Off! Get Me Off This Planet! is easy to learn, fast-paced game, where everyone feels engaged and &quot;in it&quot; until someone has won or the planet explodes!&#10;&#10;The objective of Lift Off! Get Me Off This Planet! is to be the first player to get their Aliens off the planet using resource cards, action cards, and phases of the moon to escape. If the planet explodes before everyone escapes, the player with the most saved Aliens wins.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s special about Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is that lift off points (space vehicles) are all different and often require multiple players to work together to take off. For example, a rocket ship takes a lot of resources and can carry 6 aliens from various players. This creates a great dynamic where initially all players are working together to get, say, the first half of their aliens off the planet, but once it starts thinning people become more competitive and tricky about things using action cards to manipulate the moon, change the board, create tornadoes, etc.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rolling Japan is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of Japan that's divided into the 47 prefectures, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild purple die. All players now write down each number rolled on any prefecture of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue prefecture and a 2 in one yellow prefecture. If the purple die is rolled, you can place this number in a prefecture of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-purple die as any color. However, neighboring prefectures &mdash; including those in different areas connected by blue lines &mdash; can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a prefecture of the appropriate color. (If all the prefectures in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After eight rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on her map wins.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately you can't just grab them for yourself as everyone in the neighborhood wants to claim those adorable kitties. Outwit your fellow feline fiends as you lure cats onto your property, move cats into your house, and steal cats from your neighbors. All's fair in love and cat-collecting!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player chooses a Property board, which contains three zones: the Yard, the Porch, and the House. At the end of the game, cats in the House are worth 5 points each, cats on the Porch are worth 3 points each, and cats in your Yard are worth 0 points. However, having cats in your Yard does have advantages for special scoring conditions, such as having the most cats of a single color or the most cats overall. All 40 cat miniatures are placed in the center of the table, and represent the Neighborhood. Each player is dealt 2 or 3 cards, depending on the number of players in the game.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, they perform two Actions: moving a cat, playing a card, or discarding cards. Cats can be moved 1 space for 1 Action, by picking up the cat and putting it in the next zone of the property. For example, a cat can be moved from the Neighborhood to the Yard for 1 Action, or from the Yard to the Porch or from the Porch to the Yard (and vice versa). Playing cards may allow a player to move multiple cats at once, to move cats multiple spaces, to steal cats from opponents, or to make opponents give up cats. A player may also choose to discard 1, 2, or 3 cards as an Action. Once both Actions have been taken, the player draws back up to a full hand, and play passes to the person to the left. If an Instant card (red border) is drawn, it is played immediately and affects the entire group. The player then draws a replacement card for the Instant card until a full hand is achieved.&#10;&#10;The final round is triggered when a player draws the last card from the draw pile. From that point every player, including the player who drew the last card, has one final turn to maximize their score. Then, the cats are counted and a winner is lauded for their purr-procurement proficiency.&#10;&#10;",

Since then, his mummy has restlessly roamed the pyramid corridors, scaring away anyone who dares intrude. Courageous heroes are the only ones who can free the mummy of the curse. Only those who possess the precious scarabs and can creep through the dark tunnels past the scary mummy all the way to the burial chamber stand a chance of breaking the mummy curse. Whoever hurries through the maze without being careful will attract the furious mummy and quickly find themselves right back at the pyramid entrance. Many adventurers have already tried and failed miserably. Can you get rid of the mummy's curse?&#10;&#10;Pharaoh's Gulo Gulo, a reimplementation of the 2003 game Gulo Gulo, challenges players to make their way through a desert, then through the Pharaoh's pyramid. Before the game begins, players lay out face-down tiles on the desert path, in the pyramid, and in the mummy's burial chamber. The mummy figure starts outside the burial chamber, and the players start at the beginning of the desert.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player first explores the tomb either by flipping over the closet tile that has not yet been revealed, or by choosing the color of a desert or pyramid tile that's been revealed. The player then digs for the color chosen or revealed on the tile in a wooden bowl. This bowl contains twenty &quot;boulders&quot; (wooden spheres) and a thin Pharaoh's staff that's placed standing up in the bowl. If the player successfully removes a boulder of the proper color without the Pharaoh's staff or another boulder falling out of the bowl, that player moves &mdash; either forward or backward &mdash; to the next space on the path of that color. If the player lands on a scarab space, they take a scarab token and place it in front of themself (with a maximum of four scarabs for a player).&#10;&#10;If the player creates a landslide by dropping a boulder or causing the staff to fall and touch the table, that player must retreat to the starting desert space (if in the desert) or the pyramid entrance (if in the pyramid). (You refill the bowl with all the boulders should someone cause a landslide or when all the boulders of one color have been removed.)&#10;&#10;If the player lands on a tile showing one or more mummy heads, the mummy advances that many spaces, moving again if it lands on a tile showing mummy heads. If the mummy passes a player or lands on the same space as one, that player must discard a scarab or retreat immediately to the pyramid entrance. The mummy roams back and forth from burial chamber to entrance, so you'll encounter it at least once!&#10;&#10;A player must have at least two scarabs to enter the burial chamber, after which the player must complete two boulder grabs in a row based on the tiles in that chamber. The first player to do so wins!&#10;&#10;",

The subject of this small two-player card game is America's Quasi-War with France, viewed through the lens of factional conflict within the Federalist Party. One player assumes the role of the supposedly obnoxious and disliked President John Adams, and is opposed by that ten dollar founding father without a father, Alexander Hamilton.&#10;&#10;The players purchase cards from a market, play those cards in front of them for influence in three categories - Politics, Military, and Opinion - and activate those cards for special effects. Political influence comes easier for a veteran intriguer like Hamilton than for the somewhat guileless Adams. Each player has an advantage within their preferred branch of the Military - Navy for Adams and Army for Hamilton. Opinion allows players to wage a war of words, usually by discarding enemy cards that have not had their powers activated.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to best your opponent in at least two of these categories when the Coup of 18 Brumaire brings the Quasi-War to a close. But there's one more wrinkle: your score across these three categories must also best that of the non-player Thomas Jefferson, who has been quietly accumulating power and influence while you and your opponent are tearing each other apart. Beat Jefferson and you (or your preferred candidate in Hamilton's case) win the election of 1800. Come up short and Jefferson wins. This historical result is the most likely, but with skill and a little luck, you can defeat your opponent with enough strength intact to secure ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Players must contend with the effects of plague, tax rebellions, slanderous pamphleteers, and events from abroad. From the Haitian Revolution to the Battle of the Nile, from George Washington to Napoleon Bonaparte, this short little game with a tiny deck captures the chaos and flavor of a fascinating era in American history.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players reveal cards from the draw pile one at a time, and may stop at any point and collect the cards into their score pile. However, if two fish of the same type are revealed, the player loses those cards and all cards in between, as well as forfeiting his turn. An octopus card when revealed also will end the turn and cost the player the other cards turned up on that turn, but allows the player to attempt to steal cards from another player's score pile. Only the biggest fish of a type in a player's pile count for scoring purposes.

Have they focused on resources and mined stone or gold, collected wood, created new vikings, or built up the food supplies?

Or maybe they have gained a favour from one of the Norse gods or goddesses?&#10;&#10;Each turn you may use one action (for example go on a raid or use a favour from a God or Goddess) and buy one item from a central Market. You buy items using resources in your hand, and you can choose between ships for your Navy, buildings for your Clan and valuables for your Loot. Each item gives 1-3 Victory Points, and the first player to have an agreed number of Victory Points in each category wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are also four rare Abilities that sometimes turn up in the Market.

    "Description": "Clash of Giants contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering the two most famous battles of the opening phase of the First World War. Tannenberg was the German victory that halted a Russian offensive into East Prussia and destroyed the Russian 2nd Army. The Marne was the climactic battle of Germany's attempt to defeat France in the war's first six weeks. Arguably a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the Germans as their armies recoiled from the gates of Paris.&#10;&#10;Designed by eight-time Charles S. Roberts award winner Ted S. Raicer (whose most recent game was GMT's Paths of Glory), and developed by Krieg designer Steve Kosakowski, the Clash of Giants system is intended to emphasize playability while still providing players with proper historical feel. The games focus on the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll.&#10;&#10;Clash of Giants includes the standard and exclusive rules (including rules for Paris Taxis at the Marne and Geman wireless intercepts at Tannenberg), two full size large-hex maps, two player aid cards, and 264 large counters. Units are divisions and brigades.&#10;&#10;Simple but not simplistic, Clash of Giants has a unique combat system based more on a unit's training, equipment, and morale than numbers. In Tannenberg, the victory conditions force both sides to take risks - and the German player will have to use every advantage to avoid being crushed by superior Russian numbers. At the Marne, the Allied player will first have to successfully disengage and rally his French and British armies, before turning to deliver a powerful counterattack. (But don't forget that the Germans can win instantly if they take Paris!)&#10;&#10;The two battles in Clash of Giants [...] are good for solo or competitive play. The Marne (which contains an Allied Counterattack scenario in addition to the full campaign) can be played in an afternoon. Tannenberg can be completed in a couple of hours, making it the perfect game when time is short.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:    1-2 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     4.5/3.3 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Divisions and brigades&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One or two&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;        264 full-color counters&#10;        Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;        8-page Rulebook&#10;        12-page Battle Book&#10;        2 Player Aid cards&#10;        One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(from GMT Games website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the final field exam of your bomb disposal training course. The instructor has rigged three training bombs for you and your team to defuse, but little do you know that there is no way to actually defuse them! The bombs will explode eventually, and if you want to graduate at the top of the class then you&rsquo;ll want to cut high-value wires without triggering the explosives! Grab your wire cutters and steady that shaky hand, because it&rsquo;s going to be an explosive night!&#10;&#10;In Bomb Squad Academy there are four decks of cards representing the four &ldquo;wires&rdquo; of the bomb, and a trigger track next to each deck. Every round, each player secretly decides (then simultaneously reveals) the wire that they will cut this round (or perhaps they&rsquo;ll chicken out, or even call &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; preventing a wire from being cut). After actions are revealed, the chosen wires are &ldquo;cut&rdquo; by flipping cards from those decks. When a card is flipped, its value dictates how far the trigger moves down the trigger track and how many points are earned; cutting wires alone is worth a lot more than cutting the same wire as other players. Push the triggers too far and the bomb will explode! Whoever causes the bomb to explode loses points. Players earn useful Tools during the game that they can use to break the rules. Get through three gruelling bombs with the cleverest cuts to finish your final exam with the most points!&#10;&#10;",

After years of failed peace negotiations, they have finally decided to take up arms and stand ready to fight &ndash; which is great news for you because you'll be selling them their weapons.&#10;&#10;Battle Merchants is an economic game set in a fantasy land in which players manufacture four different weapons, then sell them to various warring races. Demand for each type of weapon differs throughout the game, but a well-crafted weapon will last longer.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players can forge weapons, sell a weapon, upgrade craft (to build better weapons), or take a Kindom Card (for special powers); for players with a high-enough level of craft, a fifth action is available: forge and sell a weapon in the same turn. Players earn money by selling weapons, and it's permitted (nay, encouraged!) to sell your weapons to both sides of the same battle. The game takes place over four seasons in one game year. At the end of each season, the races fight with the weapons that the players sold. Weapons are at risk of being destroyed in battle, and surviving weapons earn money for surviving. After all, someone has to get paid to sharpen all of those weapons...&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

The tribes compete for opportunities to hunt dinosaurs, recruit tribesmen, and discover new technologies, vying to be the first with enough knowledge and prestige to invent fire and usher in the age of modern humanity!&#10;&#10;You have two resources to manage: Food and Teeth.  You must spend Food each turn in order to keep your Tribe from starving.  Teeth indicate prestige among the tribes.  Use Teeth to bid for the conch and to acquire Cavemen and Caves.&#10;&#10;Each turn, cards are drawn from the deck to fill a common Card Pool.  Players take actions based on what is available in the pool.  For example, if a Beast is drawn into the Card Pool, you can hunt it for Food and claim its Teeth as a sign of your bravery.&#10;&#10;If you hold the conch during the Action Phase, you benefit by taking your Action first and taking a second Action after everyone else has gone once.  Players can bid Teeth to take control of the Conch from another player.  This can be important to get the first pick of the cards in the Card Pool.&#10;&#10;The game features 21 different inventions that allow players to evolve diverse strategies, capitalizing on their tribe's individual strengths. There are challenging decisions every turn as players must evaluate what resources are available, guess what their opponents will do, and weigh the amount of risk they're willing to take.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;The Ancient World: Rise of the Roman Republic is the first volume in a projected series of games that will cover virtually every war and campaign in ancient history on the same scale and scope that the legendary Europa series did for WWII. Each game and module in the series will add maps, units, and all the personalities that will enable you to play, in some, but not daunting, detail your favorite periods.&#10;&#10;Volume I, Rise of the Roman Republic, is the introductory game to the Ancient World series with shorter, smaller scenarios. Rise of the Roman Republic includes scenarios for the Samnite Wars (which also includes a three-player version that takes in the invasion of Alexander of Epirus), the invasion of Pyrrhus (including his Sicilian adventures), and also the first three years of Hannibal, all on a single map of Italy, complete with dated road system.&#10;&#10;The focal point of the game system is the unusual set of mechanics that, in essence, have no allowance limits to movement. Units - troops under a leader - are free to move as far and as long as they want, subject to two major factors: leader capability to do so, as well as attrition.&#10;&#10;The Romans are really fun, mostly because you have to master the Roman political system, from yearly elections, to pro-roguing consuls, even to asking the Senate permission to do many things, all of which serve to make running the Roman armies about as close to realistic as has ever been seen in a wargame.&#10;&#10;The land combat system uses a unique Combat Results Table that includes the dreaded Unusual Result dicerolls, which replicate the battles that took place wherein the outcome belied the odds. But you still get the Carthaginian cavalry, the Epirote hoplites, elephants, and all the usual goodies you'd expect in such a game.&#10;The Ancient World is aimed at aficionados of the subject, as well as those interested in the breadth and depth of campaign operations. Yet it is a very playable system in which most scenarios can be finished in an evening, and none, in Rise of the Roman Republic, take more than one map.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;TIME SCALE     1 year per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     13 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Strength point = either 500 men; 300 cavalry; 10 elephants&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     1-2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER Richard Berg&#10;DEVELOPER Alan Ray&#10;MAP ART Mark Simonitch&#10;COUNTER ART Rodger B.

    "Description": "In this western themed game, players are looking to drive cattle across the west, establishing towns.  If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.&#10;&#10;During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.&#10;&#10;There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.&#10;&#10;Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.&#10;&#10;Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.&#10;&#10;",

It is no longer just people or nations that are subject to exploitation, but entire planets and moons. As the CEO of one of these mega-corporations, in Charon, Inc. you will vie against CEOs of other corporations as you exploit the planet&rsquo;s resources and colonize Charon, the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto.&#10;&#10;You will stake claims to the various mining regions of Charon, acquire resources for building facilities, use special actions (fair and unfair) to gain advantages over other CEOs, and build your empire to achieve victory in this fast-paced game of planetary domination!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;The board shows Charon divided into several regions. Each round, seed the regions with a mix of gems. Players start with a hand of building cards: at the start of each round, everyone puts one into a common pool. At the end of each round, you get additional cards.Players' bidding flags start out 1 in each of the special power areas. Go around bidding till each player has just one flag unspent. Bid by moving a flag from its space to a location on the board -- in a region, on a border btwn 2 regions, or on an intersection (corner) touching 2-4 regions. After all bids placed, use the special power where your last flag stands -- that is a pretty cool twist, where you have to decide which special power you want to try for (but you only get it if you're alone on that power; or if there's 2 of you in a 5er game!). Then resolve each region: the player with the most flags in/around it wins all the gems. Ties broken by seniority, where a flag is more &quot;senior&quot; if it affects fewer regions (center then edge then corner).&#10;&#10;After all gems collected, players (in turn order) use their gems to build cards from common pool and/or their hand (but may never build cards with same number). May trade gems (3:1?) to get the colors you need, and may only save a limited number of gems from turn to turn. Some special powers change trade ratio and holding limit.&#10;&#10;After 5 rounds, player who built the highest sum of buildings wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deep within the rain forests of the Yucatan, rival teams of treasure hunters have recently discovered the lost city of Codinca. In the center of the once great citadel stands a stone temple. Local legends tell of great treasures that lie buried beneath the temple, but despite many weeks of searching no doorway has been found.&#10;&#10;On the top of the temple stands a square stone altar. A small totem stands in the center of this, surrounded by a pattern of sixteen carved tiles. Examining them closely you discover an intricate series of mechanisms which allow the tiles to switch places and turn over, which reveals that each tile has a stone side and a gold side. Carvings on each side of the pillar indicate that a sequence of four key patterns must be made with the tiles to open the temple. Can you be the first to unlock the secrets of Codinca?&#10;&#10;In Codinca, each player has control of a set of four matching symbol tiles: Air, Water, Earth or Fire. Players take turns attempting to move their tiles into a series of four specific key patterns indicated on the key discs drawn at the beginning of the game; those patterns are a block of four, a line of four, four corners (can be four corners of any nine tiles as well as outside corners) and a diagonal line of four.&#10;&#10;On each turn a player must either switch and flip one of their own tiles with any adjacent tile, or switch one of their tiles with any adjacent tile and switch the same or another of their tiles with any adjacent tiles or flip two tiles, one of which must be one of their own tiles. In addition, players are allocated three Spirit Card that gives them the bonus move choice of Line Push or Rotate Four. This allows players to disguise their planned moves. On the back of the Spirt Card is a Trap Pattern. This can be used to change a set display of tiles from gold to stone and visa versa to match the pattern on the Trap Pattern. Players can match their required patterns in any order, and the first player to match all patterns wins.&#10;&#10;",

The whole atmosphere of such battles is transcribed here in one &quot;small&quot; box with a simple but deep game system and beautiful miniatures.&#10;&#10;It features a high replayability -- and with a modular board, six special weapons to equip the Battleships, advanced and optional rules, and four scenarios -- no battle will be the same.&#10;&#10;The game system of Fleet Commander: 1 &ndash; Ignition is flexible and allows for expansions, with multiple ones now available.&#10;&#10;&#10;For more detail on the latest evolution of this game, see Fleet Commander: Genesis.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

What he did with that power over the course of the next forty-plus years is the stuff of legend. His unparalleled achievements in warfare, diplomacy, administration, and culture led to the sobriquet Carolus Magnus: Charles the Great: Charlemagne, King of the Franks and of the Lombards, and Emperor of the Romans.&#10;&#10;In this solitaire strategy game, you assume the Frankish throne, and seek to duplicate - or exceed - Charlemagne's singular genius, while hopefully avoiding some of his mistakes, such as the famous defeat at Roncevaux (immortalized in the Song of Roland). As you conquer new territory and incorporate it into your empire, you'll need to contend with rebels and palace intriguers. Building public works and patronizing the Carolingian Renaissance will increase your prestige and wealth. Along the way you'll need to win the support of the papacy, buy off Viking marauders, convert the pagans in Saxony, contend with incursions from Al-Andalus, build a powerful army, and maintain detente with the Byzantine Empire.&#10;&#10;Gamers who are familiar with the game Agricola, Master of Britain will find many similarities between it and Charlemagne: Master of Europe, though this is a longer and more complex game, with its own nuances. The core mechanism of cup adjustments is of course alive and well. Chits representing enemy units reside in one of three cups representing how they feel about your rule: Friendly, Unfriendly, or Hostile. Chits are drawn from the hostile cup and placed on the map, manifesting themselves as overt challenges to your rule. Every action you take will subtly change their stance, blindly moving chits from one cup to another.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Greedy Greedy Goblins is a simultaneous play, strategic tile placement and bluffing game.&#10;&#10;Players lead a clan of goblin miners who want to gather the most valuable collection of gems. Coins are scored for gem tiles on the mines you have claimed, with bonuses for dynamite tiles &mdash; but if there is too much dynamite, the mine (and all the riches within) are destroyed!&#10;&#10;In more detail, players sit around a circle composed of cave game boards and the guildhall game board, with sixty mining tiles placed face-down within this circle. Each round, while playing at the same time, players use one hand to look at one mining tile at a time, then place it on one of the cave game boards. At any time, a player can claim the guildhall or a cave by placing one of their three goblins on the board, after which no more tiles or goblins may be placed on this board.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has placed all of their goblins (or decided not to place them), players resolve the boards. The goblin on the guildhall draws a minion card that provides a special ability, while each goblin in a cave scores coins based on the gems, diamonds, dynamite and monsters found there; these goblins can also take minion cards if minion tiles have been placed in the cave. Dynamite multiplies the value of a cave, but three or more sticks blows the place up, costing you coins.&#10;&#10;If someone has one hundred or more coins, the game ends and whoever has the most coins wins; if not, set up another round and go digging again.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Somewhere in Mexico, rival gangs of desperadoes clash. To survive the inevitable shoot-out, you need to keep the coolest head and have the fastest trigger finger&#203;&#155;&#10;&#10;Adios Amigos is fast-paced card game runs for five game rounds during each of which each player represents three desperadoes. All players act simultaneously. They need to realize quickly which pistol counter allows them to shoot at which desperado, and then immediately pull the trigger. They can do this if the hit number corresponds to either the sum of or the difference between the desperado numbers on the cards. If you don&rsquo;t forget to reload and have your bundle of dynamite ready for just the right moment, chances are you may be the last desperado standing and get a loot tile in reward.&#10;&#10;",
