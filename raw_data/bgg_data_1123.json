Special points are awarded for taking time to improve the birds' habitat!&#10;&#10;In Game 2, players do not use the spinner, and can only collect birds if they are able to correctly identify them, based on a photo.  Random events are reduced, making it more a game of skill and knowledge.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 300 beautiful cards, featuring nature photography by Bob Ball.  A handful of scoring variants are also included.&#10;&#10;Endorsed by the Greater Ozarks Audubon Society.&#10;&#10;",

As you are chased by your fate across the cosmos, you may be forced to bring &quot;empty space&quot; into play, losing the top card of your deck as you place it facedown to embody the seemingly infinite space that divides you from the rest of humanity. This is not a location; it cannot be entered or investigated, and the only way to reclaim your lost card is to fill the empty space with a Cosmos location. These impossible places, drawn from the new Cosmos deck, do not have set places they must connect to. Rather, each Cosmos card has a connecting instruction you must obey in order to place it. Torn from all you know, it may be easy to surrender to the existential dread, but even if all you can do is delay the inevitable, the battle is not over yet!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hemlock is a strategic, medieval themed, card game.&#10;&#10;In it, your goal is to manipulate an unfolding conspiracy to your advantage. Populate your King's court with high-valued figures, reduce the likelihood of their deaths, and minimize your opponents&rsquo; ability to do the same.&#10;&#10;Hemlock features a play deck of 66 cards (11 cards per suit). Each card has a static or variable point value as well as an associated ability. When a player plays a card from their hand, they choose to play it for either points or for ability.&#10;&#10;Hemlock is played over a series of rounds. At the beginning of each round, 2 cards are dealt face down to the center of the play area. These are the conspiracy cards. Actions played during the course of a round can change the conspiracy cards, but there are always, and only, 2 conspiracy cards in a given round.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving clockwise, playing 1 card per turn from their hand with the goal of accruing the highest round-point total. The player with most points at the end of a round earns the privilege of examining the 2 conspiracy cards and then assigning them to 2 different players' courts (score piles).&#10;&#10;The number of cards in each player's court is known to all, but the value of the cards are kept secret even to their owner until a specified number of cards is present in a given court. When this number of cards is reached, the game ends. Players tally the value of the cards in their court (the ones that aren't poisoned by Hemlock!) and the player with the highest valued court wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Something's rotten in the realm of Labamba...&#10;&#10;The annual rave party is an event where every self-respecting wizard and sorceress has to make an appearance; however, this year's party was so epic, that in the morning the guests &ndash; all tired and hungover &ndash; discovered that someone has murdered the Archmage!&#10;No one knows how, no one knows when. It's quite possible that even the murderer him or herself is not aware of what happened last night, since barely anyone remembers anything. Unfortunately, according to the ancient laws of Labamba, the one that kills the Archmage may become a powerful Darchmage, bringing Darkness onto the land. And if there is one thing that Darkness hates, it's fun, techno, lasers and glitter &ndash; which is all that is dear to the magical folk.&#10;Thus, it's time to pull yourselves together, put your holo detective hats on your aching heads and catch the killer, before he grows too powerful!&#10;&#10;RAVEHARD: Magiczna Gra Karciana is a party game that mixes elements of classic card battle games, games of deduction and deception, as well as more cooperative titles. It's meant to be played by 2-5 players aged 12 and more.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, which lasts three rounds, the players will have to work together in order to discover who killed the Archmage during the magical rave party yesternight. To achieve this goal, they'll have to overcome dangerous obstacles, including boss fights (each boss capable of summoning powerful minions) and unpredictable events. After each round the players gain a new clue which sheds some light on the last night's incident and points towards a possible murder weapon.&#10;If the players manage to survive all three rounds, they reach the Archmage's Chamber. There they may incapacitate one of them, should they be certain that he's the killer. If they are correct &ndash; they win the game; if they are wrong &ndash; the murderer steps out of the shadows and attacks the rest of the players. The side that emerges victorious from this final confrontation wins the game.&#10;&#10;Do not trust anyone &ndash; not even yourself! Each player starts the game with two different objects which may turn out to be the murder weapons &ndash; or they may prove your innocence. During your turn you may switch the objects with those belonging to other players in order to frame them and clear your name. However, not until the very end will it be possible to tell which object is really the murder weapon. Thus, during the game you'll have to bluff, form alliances, deceive and distract, both openly &ndash; and secretly, using the Flirt Cards that let you pass private messages, scheme and conspire (and flirt).&#10;&#10;This game is for you if you enjoy playing such titles as Magic: The Gathering, Munchkin, Hero Realms, Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards, Love Letter, Mascarade, Coup, Not Alone, PENNY DREADFUN: Duchy, Demony, Dickensy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#197;&#185;le si&#196;&#153; dzieje w magicznym &#197;&#155;wiecie Labamba&hellip;&#10;&#10;Doroczna techno-impreza, na kt&oacute;rej musi pojawi&#196;&#135; si&#196;&#153; ka&#197;&#188;dy&#10;szanuj&#196;&#133;cy si&#196;&#153; mag i czarodziejka, by&#197;&#130;a tak epicka, &#197;&#188;e o poranku&#10;skacowani i zm&#196;&#153;czeni go&#197;&#155;cie odkryli, &#197;&#188;e kto&#197;&#155; zamordowa&#197;&#130;&#10;Arcymaga!&#10;Nie wiadomo jak, nie wiadomo kiedy.

These words actually look mostly like nonsense words and are likely a set of names, perhaps associated with Monaco.&#10;&#10;It looks apparent that an important part of the game is to combine cards so that a prefix and a suffix combine to make a word in the list.

You may exchange that one card for another if you wish to. High hand wins.&#10;&#10;Now, try playing with two Texas Poker Cards to each player, making the best five-card Poker hand from the now ten different numbers and suits each player has. You may also exchange or draw one more card, turning in to the dealer your discard. Try playing 6-7-8-9 or even 10 Poker with just two cards.&#10;&#10;You may play this together with an ordinary deck of cards. To play the game this way, deal out one card from the Texas Poker Deck to each player. Each player may then receive up to three cards from the regular deck of cards. Have Fun!!!

Each contains a letter and a number 1-11.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 3 cards, and in a turn a player either plays 1-3 cards to the table to form a word, or draws 1 card and discards 1 card.&#10;&#10;The cards in the center form a 5x5 array. With the first word played, one of the cards is designated as the center of the square. After the first word, each word must use all the cards played and at least one card already on the table. Consecutive letters in a word must be adjacent in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal, but the word as a whole may zigzag and change directions. It's like the array from Big Boggle, built up gradually with cards rather than dice.&#10;&#10;Each word scores like this: letters already on the board score their printed value, letters played from the hand are double their value, unless they are played to a corner of the square, or are the last cards played in the square, in which case their value is tripled.&#10;&#10;Their is also a solitaire game: one plays cards in a row, one at a time, and when a set of consecutive cards make a word, they are made into a single pile with any of those letters on the top. If all the cards can be combined into a single pile at the end, one wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summmary&#10;&#10;",

WorkBots are the driving force in the Factory and each Workstation needs a WorkBot on it. Only then will the Workstation be a functioning part of an Assembly Line.

Each type of Workstation is limited in number, and players will try to move Workstations out of other players&rsquo; Assembly Lines to use within their own. Take control of a Workstation by having more WorkBots on it than anyone else, then it can be moved. Protect a Workstation by having enough WorkBots left on it to prevent the other players moving it.&#10;&#10;Nuts And Bots has simple rules and simple actions but requires thought and puzzle-solving to win in an ever-changing environment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players bid how many of the thirteen tricks their partnership can win (or, unlike Bridge, lose). Also, players can communication information about their hands through their bids (and, unlike Bridge, the cards they can exchange) with a system of conventions. Here are the main differences:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players get to exchange cards with each other. There are two ways of playing Skruuvi depending on how players exchange cards: Kitty games and No-kitty games.&#10;&#10;&#10;- In a Kitty game, players receive 12 cards; the four undealt cards is the kitty. The highest bidder adds the kitty to their hand, then gives any four cards to their partner. The partner adds these cards to their hand, then gives one card to each of the other three players.&#10;&#10;- In a No-kitty game, players receive 13 cards. The highest bidder gives any four cards to their partner. The partner adds these cards to their hand, then returns any four cards back to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players optionally play several rounds of Bolshevik, where one player attempts to win or lose all 13 tricks (without a partner).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players can bid misere, which is a bid of how many tricks a partnership will lose (without a trump suit).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     As mentioned, there is no dummy!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     As in Bridge, the lowest bid is to win 7 out of the 13 tricks. However, the lowest bid you can win the auction round is 11 tricks! (Or for misere bids, to lose 11 tricks!) In No-kitty games, the lowest bid is to win 12 out of the 13 tricks. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A game of Skruuvi lasts 24 rounds. Each player plays with a different partner for 8 rounds each.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "You've never played UNO like this before! Now with a Jurassic World theme, the rules are similar to those of regular UNO Attack, but this game features the &quot;Attack! Attack!&quot; command card that offers an exciting and unpredictable way to play UNO. If you draw that card you&rsquo;ll have to push the button on the Dilophosaurus shooter, and you&rsquo;ll either be the target of a stream of UNO Attack Jurassic World cards, or you will get lucky and nothing will happen! But if you&rsquo;re not so lucky, the shooter will fire a stream of cards that you have to add to your hand! And when the shooter is launching cards, it makes a variety of funny sounds that add energy and silliness to the game. UNO Attack Jurassic World adds speed and surprise to the game because you never know when an attack is coming! The goal is still to get rid of all the cards in your hand, and when you&rsquo;re down to one card, don&rsquo;t forget to yell, &ldquo;UNO!&rdquo; Contains 112 cards, Dilophosaurus shooter, and instructions. The unit is both portable and designed to help with storage&mdash;you can keep the cards right inside the shooter!&#10;&#10;Now Jurassic World fans can play a special version of UNO Attack!:&#10;The &quot;Attack! Attack!&quot; card - When this card is played, whoever played it gets to call any color and then choose ANY OTHER PLAYER in the game to &ldquo;Attack.&rdquo;  The Dilophosaurus Card Launcher is rotated to face the chosen player, and then &ldquo;attacking&rdquo; player gets to press down on the Dilophosaur&rsquo;s nose twice.  The player being &ldquo;attacked&rdquo; must keep all the cards that come out of the launcher.  The game then continues with the next player in regular rotation (the second player to the left &ndash; or right in Reverse rotation - of the player who played the Wild Attack-Attack card).&#10;&#10;The goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand, and the first player or team to 500 wins. When you&rsquo;re down to one card, don&rsquo;t forget to yell &ldquo;UNO&rdquo;!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For the 20th anniversary of Roads & Boats, the game is being reprinted for the fifth time. This edition will include the &amp;Cetera expansion, so the game can be played with up to six players and you will get all the additional modules of &amp;Cetera included in the game. There are no other changes to the game.&#10;&#10;In Roads & Boats, each player builds a civilization over a long period of time, as in many other games. Unlike most games, however, the emphasis is not on warfare, population growth, city or statebuilding, but on logistics, or rather on transport. Each player starts the game with three donkeys, a pile of wooden boards, a number of stones, and two geese. With these few resources, you try to build such diverse things as woodcutters, roads, boats, mines, a stock exchange... but beware! There is no concept of territory in this game! You cannot own land, nor buildings, so the things you build can be used by any other player...&#10;&#10;The original game can be played by two to four players, but it can also be used as a one-person puzzle.&#10;&#10;&amp;Cetera adds new buildings, new goods, new land types, new transporters, new ways to win, and new strategies. It also includes 24 new scenarios and material to play with five or six players. &amp; Cetera contains all the rules and material previously published as Planes &amp; Trains, plus a lot more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Unlike the classic card game, Mau Mau - the board game is not just about getting rid of your cards quickly and saying Mau Mau - it's about get as many points as possible. Shouting Mau Mau doesn't end the game, but gives you 5 bonus points. Playing identical cards and some special spaces also wins bonus points. The game ends when all the spaces on the board are covered with cards. The winner of this fast-paced board game version of the classic card game is the player who scored the most points!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;Draw two on the 7, skip a turn on the 8 - the famous card game mau mau gets its own special charm as a board game. Anyway, if Reiner Knizia takes over the implementation.&#10;&#10;Placing a suitable card on another, the next player must react - this is the classic principle of mau mau. The suit or number must match the previously placed card. Reiner Knizia has transferred this principle to the game board: tiles are placed on a path. The color or symbol shown must match the adjacent tile. Special fields provide surprise effects. And the classics such as &quot;two draw&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; are also present here. For the penultimate card, announce &quot;mau&quot;; for the last card, &quot;mau mau&quot; also applies. However: &quot;mau mau&quot; is not the end. But only when all fields on the map are occupied. This creates tension: the winner is not who got rid of his cards first, but who has collected the most points.&#10;&#10;So it is important to proceed strategically and reach the special fields, because they certainly lead to the coveted point chips. In addition, you usually have several investment options.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description form the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rally Point Volume 16: A World at War 1937-1945 is a set of 10 all new scenarios that are set in World War II. These scenarios were originally scheduled to appear in Schwerpunkt Volume #24. Production of future volumes of Schwerpunkt is on hiatus for the foreseeable future, so the Tampa ASL Group decided to publish them in the pages of Rally Point instead. Each scenario was handmade and play-tested to the high standard players expect from the Tampa ASL Group&rsquo;s fine craftsmen. Each scenario is presented in the Schwerpunkt easy-to-read format on high-quality card stock.&#10;&#10;RPT151 Luodian Lament &ndash; LUODIAN, China, 23 August 1937: Nineteen squads from the Chinese 66th Regiment attack to clear the defending 44th Japanese Regiment (11 squads) from the village on boards 10z and 70. This medium-sized 5.5 turn scenario is a tense all infantry action that features Chinese OBA.&#10;&#10;RPT152 Shaken Not Stirred &ndash; VILLERS-MAREUIL, France 29 May 1940: Six R35 tanks and seventeen squads conduct a rare French combined arms attack to seize five buildings from twelve defending squads of the German 57th Infantry. This 4.5 turn scenario is set four half boards: 64, 65, 67 and 70.&#10;&#10;RPT153 Run Gurkha Run &ndash; ASUN, Malaya, 11 December 1941: The title says it best. A company of Gurkha infantry is forced to withdraw across boards 17 and 72 while being hotly pursued by thirteen squads of the Japanese 11th Infantry Regiment and three supporting Ha-Go tanks. This 5 turn scenario has lots of exciting action that usually culminates in a Banzai charge near the end.&#10;&#10;RPT154 Mars Begins &ndash; GREDIANKO, U.S.S.R., 25 November 1942: If you like fighting in the snow, this Eastern Front gem is for you. Twenty Russian squads supported by Lee, KVI and T-34 tanks attack to clear eleven German squads from the buildings on board 3a. This action-packed, 5 turn scenario (Designed by Mike Augustine) features German OBA and Russian rocket artillery.&#10;&#10;RPT155 Schutzstaffel Shindig- GRUSCHKI GRAVE, West of Kharkov, Ukraine, U.S.S.R. 31 August 1943: In this 5.5 turn, medium-sized scenario, a company of ten Russian tanks (T-34s and a KV-2) from the 2nd Tank Corps attacks with infantry riders to clear two StuGs and two PzIVF2s supported by panzer-grenadiers of the 5th SS Panzer Division &ldquo;Wiking&rdquo; from the hills overlooking the roads on boards 18 and 61. This tank battle will test your nerves and require you to use all your tank fighting skills.&#10;&#10;RPT156 Wiking Rescue- ZERCZYCE, and STACJA-NURZEC, Poland, 22 July 1944: Veteran Tampa ASL Group member, &ldquo;Mountain Man&rdquo; Dave Brown makes his designing debut with this unique scenario in which both sides get to attack. A full SS panzer-grenadier company mounted in halftracks and supported by Panther tanks from the 5th SS Panzer Division &ldquo;Wiking&rdquo; attacks to clear a farmstead and relieve the besieged Penal Battalion 560. Will the fifteen Russian squads and six SU-76ms from the 44th Rifle Division overrun their village before help arrives? This is an action-packed, 5.5 turn, scenario that uses boards 9a, 16 and 43.&#10;&#10;RPT157 Ozarks and Frundsbergers &ndash; RURDORF, Germany, 2 December 1944: A company of American infantry from the 102nd &ldquo;Ozark&rdquo; Infantry Division with five supporting Sherman tanks tries to out-flank and cut off the retreat of seven squads, an SPW251/22 and a PSW 234/3 from the 10th SS Panzer Division &ldquo;Frundsberg&rdquo;. This fast playing, 5 turn scenario is set on boards 53 and 72.&#10;&#10;RPT158 Hungarian Hetzers &ndash; EBED, Upper Hungary, 6 January 1945: Eight Russian squads, four T-34s and an SU-85 from the 22nd Guards Tank Brigade attack to clear the village on boards 1a and 9a. Here, the Hungarian Division &ldquo;Szent Laszlo&rdquo; is defending with six squads and three Hetzers, one of which must exit the board. This 4.5 turn scenario is perfect for tournament play and has lots of tense action that is sure to go down to the last CC Phase.&#10;&#10;RPT159 Lesson Learned in Lessin &ndash; LESSIN, West Prussia, 25 January 1945: The Soviet 9th Tank Corps attacks with a company of infantry, two IS-2s and four T-34/85s to clear elements of the 7th Panzer Division from buildings along a frozen lake. Hidden JgPz IV/70s on the opposite shore pour deadly flanking fire upon the attacking Russians, making this an exciting Eastern Front action in the snow. Mike Augustine designed this 5.5 turn scenario that uses boards 75 and 79.&#10;&#10;RPT160 Willie und Fritz &ndash; MUSKAU, Poland, 10 March 1945: Elements of the Soviet 112th Rifle Division (17 squads) with two ISU 122s and four IS-2s execute a two-pronged attack to seize five buildings. Fallschirm Grenadier Regiment Hermann G&ouml;ring defends this town with thirteen squads along with three Panthers and must simultaneously prevent the Russians from exiting two AFVs. This 5.5 turn scenario has multiple victory conditions and a unique tactical situation that provides a lot of re-playability. It is set on boards 2, 3b and 79.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dicey Crafting is a single player, dungeon crawling, dice rolling adventure game.&#10;&#10;The gameplay consists of a deck of monsters that you must battle your way through to complete the game. You also have a weapon (how you attack) and a shield (your health) that are crafted out of dice. These gear pieces lose durability (the number decreases on them) as you attack enemies and they attack you. As a gear piece wears out you can 'mine' dice from a dice mine, roll them, and re-craft your weapon.&#10;&#10;Game time is between 30 to 45 mins. You can build the monster deck smaller for a shorter game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The game is meant to appeal to just about anyone from any background, and can be used as an ice breaker or as a tool to get people to open up.&#10;&#10;TOP TALE is a deck of cards where each card has a topic on it. Along with each topic, there's a caption that is meant to spark ideas for responses to the topic, or in many cases the caption is just meant to get a chuckle out of the players to help lighten to mood. Topics are things like, &quot;Your Worst Day at School&quot;, where each person is expected to recount their worst day at school story. The game has some hidden strategies, where it's not always about what stories are told, but sometimes how entertaining they are when told.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round of game play, each player votes for their favorite response without voting on their own, and the person with the most votes wins the round. If there's a tie, then you have a tiebreaker round between those that tied, responding to a new topic card. The game continues until you hit a predetermined number of cards, or you all call it quits.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Stealth Assassin Showdown is a battle royale board game for 2 to 4 players, who use deduction to find and strike moving opponents while trying to evade attacks themselves.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 10-by-10 grid, and involves playable Move and Attack cards, as well as Ninja Star and Footprint tokens. Each player begins with the same hand of 12 cards--the 12 Styles of Ninja, which depict and describe the strategies in the ninja's toolbox, and which can be used to help find, hit, or dodge opponents. Turns alternate between Moves and Attacks, in which all players plan secretly, and then reveal and resolve simultaneously. Players record their own turns and track evidence of their opponents' movements in writing on a Notepad.&#10;&#10;Although the in-game goals remain the same for every game of Ninjas!!, players can change the end-game conditions to allow for different game times and styles of gameplay. The standard game involved 3 wounds and player elimination, other options include Sudden Death matches as well as point-based games in which players count the number of successful attacks against the number of times they were wounded. Each game of Ninjas!! can also be played on a differently laid out board and with different starting positions.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

On your turn you must take 3 actions in any order: Traverse, Tectonic Twist, and Scout (a choice of component actions Explore and Forecast).&#10;&#10;These actions allow players to move across the board towards their goal, reorient tiles, and accumulate Tremor Tokens. Tremor Tokens are placed on the separate Catastrophe Board, and players must strategically allocate and optimise them to ignite a disaster.&#10;&#10;There are 6 disasters that will help or hinder your passage to safety. Each of them have unique effects, and the area of the board they affect is based on how you manipulate their position and orientation. You can also evade, combo and amplify their effects by using secret Catastrophe Cards, Disaster Die rolls, and abilities unique to your species.&#10;&#10;Tremor can be played as a competitive or team co-operative game. It's easy to learn and hard to master, making it suitable for all skill levels.

Vowels are worth 5 points each, consonants 10, doubles and pairs 20, and triples 50.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 13 cards each, or 11 in partnership games. In a turn a player: &#10;1. Draws: either A) the top of the draw pile, or B) the entire discard pile. B) can only be done if the top discard is used to extend an existing word, or meld a new word of 4+ letters using cards from the hand. &#10;2. May do this as much as they wish: A) meld new words from the hand of 4+ letters; B) add cards to either end of an tabled word of theirs, making it a new word. &#10;3. Discards a card from the hand, unless they are going out.&#10;&#10;Doubles, pairs, and triples are considered Wild cards for the purposes of impure words (it's impure if it ends in a Wild); and of freezing the discard pile (which cannot be drawn unless the top card is used for a new word of 5+ letters rather than 4+).&#10;&#10;A player or team may go out if they have at least two Word Canastas (words of 7+ letters), or one Alphanasta (a word of 10+ letters played from the hand).

The player who goes first does not get to draw a card on their first turn.&#10;&#10;-Level phase-&#10;For this phase each player gains soul tokens equal to their head dragon's soul cost. You can only have a max soul count of 20. If you go above this, just take 20.&#10;Now each player can choose to level up. If you have 10 souls then you can spend them in order to gain one level. Each player starts at level one.&#10;&#10;-Play phase-&#10;You may now play cards. If you wish to play a card there are a few requirements you must meet. You must be that card&rsquo;s level or higher, and you must also pay that&rsquo;s card soul cost. If you do both of these things then you can play the card. After you play a card, remove soul tokens from your soul pool according to the cards soul cost. Example: if you play a card that costs 5 souls, you must remove 5 soul tokens. You can only play 3 cards onto the field a single play phase.&#10;&#10;-Attack Phase-&#10;The first player will now attack. The player can choose any number of dragons to attack. Your dragon can only attack at an opponent&rsquo;s dragon with a lower than or equal level to that dragon. Once you attack that dragon its health decreases by the attacking dragons damage value. You may attack with any number of dragons on the board as long as they can fulfill the requirements above.&#10;&#10;-Resolve phase-&#10;Both players now remove health counters from all their dragons that took damage this turn.&#10;&#10;-End Phase-&#10;Your turn ends and your opponent's turn starts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There isn&rsquo;t a pie that doesn&rsquo;t have their fingers in it, and nothing happens in our streets without them knowing about it. They&rsquo;re permanent fixtures at the Capital Hotel casino (heck, some even say they might own it), where they engage in high stakes games of chance while plotting how best to expand their empire. In fact, gambling seems to be their preferred way of interacting with people; if you meet them, expect them to roll the dice in more ways than one!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wordage has two identical decks; one deck is used for 2-4 players, both decks for 5-8 players. Each deck has: 3 A's and E's, 2 O's, I's and S's, and 1 of each other letter, all in red, and the same again all in black, plus two Joiner cards that can stand for any letter, making 68 cards. Each letter has a point value of 1-5.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 14 cards (children 10 cards), and during their turn a player draws a card, lays down cards if possible, and discards a card. The initial lay-down must be one or more words that have at least 14 points in value and include at least one 5+ letter word in one color (for children, at least 10 points and no color requirement). A word's value is the sum of its letters' values, plus bonuses for length, doubled if the word is of one color.&#10;&#10;In turns after the initial lay-down, a player may also: draw the top discard instead of the top of the deck; add letters to any word on the table instead of playing a new word (this doesn't score points, though); replace a Joiner (wild) card with the letter it currently stands from from the hand.&#10;&#10;The player who plays all the cards in their hand except one which is then discarded, wins the round. The game is won by the first player to win two rounds consecutively; for shorter games, the consecutive requirement is dropped.&#10;&#10;In the party version of the game, points for words played are tallied and totaled -- a score pad is included -- and a round's winner gets a bonus of 50 points plus the values of the cards left in others' hands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the word-game portion of the popular British game show. (It does not include the numbers game or the conundrum game.) It includes 22 vowel cards, 33 consonant cards, a tray, and sand timer.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn they turn up 9 cards from the vowel and consonant decks, with the balance of vowels and consonants up to them. They then turn the timer and everyone writes down words they can form from the revealed cards, trying to come up with the longest word.  When time is up, the player with the longest word scores the length of their word; tied players all score. The winner is the player with the highest score after an agreed number of rounds.&#10;&#10;There are also rules for a Word Count Game. The mechanics are the same, but players score for every word they write down: &#10;1 pt - 3 letters&#10;2 pts - 4 letters&#10;3 pts - 5 letters&#10;5 pts - 6-8 letters&#10;10 pts - 9 letters&#10;The highest score after the agreed number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
