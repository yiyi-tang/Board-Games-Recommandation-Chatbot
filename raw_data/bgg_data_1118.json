    "Description": "Lords &amp; Servants is a game system designed to recreate skirmish games with 28, 20 or 15mm miniatures. It covers the Medieval period and it shares the mechanics of our popular system Smooth &amp; Rifled.&#10;&#10;In the Appendix you will find all the information that you need to create your games, from simple clashes involving a few men per side to bigger encounters with 60-80 miniatures per side. This system is ideal for multiplayer games.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll need a few miniatures for the period (based singly, both 2x2cm or 1-inch diameter round bases are ok), some rulers or other measuring sticks and a few 6-sided dice, which we&rsquo;ll call d6. You&rsquo;ll also need markers to show who is &ldquo;Shaken&rdquo; and a figure&rsquo;s weapon reloading status. Some markers are available&#10;in the appendix.&#10;&#10;The game can be played on 90x90cm or 120x120cm tables with 28mm miniatures or 60x60cm when using 15mm.&#10;&#10;The scale of the game is: 1 figure = 1 man; 1cm is equivalent to 2m in real-life when using 20mm or 25/28mm miniatures, while it is 4m when using 15mm models. A turn represents 10-20 seconds. You can halve the distances when using 15mm miniatures. All measurements are taken from base to base. A miniature can shoot with a 180&deg; arc, Groups with a 90&deg; arc (45&deg; per side). In order to simplify the rules we ask players to use their common sense to decide shooting priorities. There must not be any intervening miniatures on the shooting line unless they are in base contact as in a 2nd rank (only) shooting. In theory, you should give priority to the target that is in front of you rather than one that is behind. You can always target a mounted miniature behind a foot figure.&#10; Additionally rules are provided for: Cavalry, Artillery, Religion, Weather all manner of Medieval Things!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is a stand alone game for solitaire and two-players and is fully compatible with the other Panzer Orders games and expansions. This game also includes some new gameplay mechanics and special scenarios to add to the Panzer Orders range.&#10;&#10;The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a game and comes complete with everything you need.&#10;&#10;You can combine two copies of the game to make either larger or tank-vs-tank games for both solo or multiplayer games or combine this game with existing Panzer Orders games.&#10;&#10;With the game you will receive two decks of cards - one deck for the Soviets and one for the Germans, plus rule summary cards (56 cards in total). You also get a full set of the rules plus a dice - everything you need to play.&#10;&#10;Each card has a points value based on the card characteristics and special rules. The players agree a point based battle and then build their decks, spending points on specific cards.&#10;&#10;Each player must form two columns of any mixture of tanks and then attack the opponents columns. The first player to defeat both their opponents columns or force the opposing player to draw their last card, wins the game.&#10;&#10;During the player turn you can choose to dig and defend with your card, moves cards from one column to another or attack with ling range or close combat. Non of these are without their risks and weighing up the risk vs the strategic gain is part of the decision making elements of the game.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast, simple but very brutal with all the dice rolls required on the cards - no charts or looking up in the rules. Damaged cards are suppressed first before being removed from the game and can still make a free saving throw on the dice to keep in the fight.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

From left to right:&#10;&#10;1. the action card (attack, defense or production);&#10;2. it is a numbered card representing wealth allocation;&#10;3. it is a numbered card representing armament allocation;&#10;4. it is a numbered card representing civil tech allocation;&#10;5. it is a numbered card representing military tech allocation.&#10;&#10;There are some restrictions on playing numbered cards:&#10;&#10;     Each state has a budget of 7 billion per round, so they have to choose how to allocate it: the sum of number of the player&rsquo;s cards has to be 7 or less. Unused budget is lost.&#10;     The maximum military tech allocation is 2, so it is possible to play only 0, 1 or 2 for military tech&#10;     The maximum civil tech allocation is 2, so it is possible to play only 0, 1 or 2 for civil tech&#10;&#10;&#10;When both players have placed their cards, every card is turned face-up. If a player wrongly played cards exceeding the sum limit of 7, the opponent decides which card or cards to decrease in order to be within 7. If both players make a mistake in the same round, the round is considered null and void.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Peace/War Scoring&#10;If a state attacks the other one or both states attack, a war begins. Otherwise, states are at peace.&#10;Based on the cards played and the tech levels, states score points as explained below.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Tech Increasing&#10;If a state didn&rsquo;t lose the war in the round, it can increase its tech levels based on its tech allocations.&#10;&#10;PEACE&#10;If a state at peace chooses the production action, he scores as many points as the value on its played wealth card + civil tech level.&#10;&#10;If a state at peace chooses the defense action, he scores as many points as the value on its played wealth card -1 (reputation cost).&#10;&#10;WAR&#10;A state&rsquo;s firepower is the sum of its armament allocation, military tech level and action bonus:&#10;&#10;     Production: +0 action bonus.&#10;     Attack: +1 action bonus.&#10;     Defense: +2 action bonus.&#10;&#10;&#10;If states are at war, whoever has the higher firepower wins the war.&#10;&#10;If production or defense wins the war: it scores its own wealth allocation + the opponent&rsquo;s one.&#10;If attack wins the war: it scores its own wealth allocation + the opponent&rsquo;s one - 1 (reputation cost).&#10;&#10;When production or defense lose the war, it scores nothing and it loses its tech allocations.&#10;When attack loses the war, it scores -1 and it loses its tech allocations.&#10;&#10;ARMISTICE&#10;In case of equal firepower, the war ends with an armistice: attack scores its own wealth allocation &ndash; 1; production and defense score their own wealth allocation. Tech allocations are not lost.&#10;&#10;MILITARY TECH&#10;A state can allocate part of its budget researching tech for military purposes. The number on the military tech card, namely the military tech allocation, determines how many steps a state can progress on the military tech board. The resolution of military tech cards occurs after the peace/war scoring.&#10;&#10;Initially, the military tech level is 0; then, every 4 steps, a state increases its military tech level by 1. The military tech level contributes to a state&rsquo;s firepower.&#10;&#10;If a state is defeated, he loses its military tech allocation (but it doesn&rsquo;t lose its military tech level).&#10;&#10;CIVIL TECH&#10;A state can allocate part of its budget researching tech for civil purposes. The number on the civil tech card, namely the civil tech allocation, determines how many steps a state can progress on the civil tech board. The resolution of civil tech cards occurs after the peace/war scoring.&#10;&#10;Initially, the civil tech level is 0; then, every 3 steps, a state increases its civil tech level by 1. The civil tech level contribute to increase the efficiency in the production processes: the civil tech level contributes to the score of a production state at peace.&#10;&#10;If a state is defeated, he loses its civil tech allocation (but it doesn&rsquo;t lose its civil tech level).&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME AND SCORING&#10;The game ends when the first player gets 50 or more. Before the beginning of the game, players may arrange to play for less or more points.&#10;At the end of the game, the player who has more points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game Planetary Destruction was inspired by the dark forest version of the Fermi Paradox.&#10;&#10;In its simplest form, it asks the question: 'If odds are good that many advanced alien races exist, how come none have been discovered?'&#10;&#10;The answer, according to the dark forest theory, is that all civilizations that are found to exhibit intelligent life are immediately and utterly destroyed. Why bother facing a potential enemy tomorrow, when they can be turned into ash today.&#10;This game captures some of that sense of desperation, but remains simple in its implementation.&#10;&#10;As such, there are three actions to choose from each turn: bomb one planet, search a general area for enemy colonies nearby, and search two planets for enemy colonies to confirm their specific location.&#10;&#10;The galaxy is a dark forest, filled with ravenous enemies.&#10;There can only be one victor.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'Zone Raiders is a fast-paced tabletop skirmish game where small groups of hardened survivors battle against each other in an unforgiving post-technological world called the Matroshka. Within an unending world of inscrutable science, radiation storms and machines dedicated to exterminating life, players create narrative stories and rewarding tactical gameplay in an open-model skirmish ruleset.&#10;&#10;Distinct in our design is an emphasis on mobility, vertical space, and accomplishing asymmetrical objectives before escaping to safety. Your tactical decisions and smart positioning will decide every encounter with the enemy. The world itself is lethal, but can you adapt your strategy, characters and exotic weapons to meet the challenge against both other players, and solo/cooperative scenarios?&#10;&#10;Combining inspirations from small-scale tabletop wargames, campaign skirmish games, RPGs and tactical turn-based video games, Zone Raiders is a fusion of what we love best about all of these.&#10;&#10;We wanted to strike the right chord between tactical depth of play, narrative campaigns and character development along with a commitment to streamlined rules while maintaining sophistication. Combined with a stunningly alien scifi setting that is vast enough to encompass many themes as a player's imagination can conjure, it's a game meant to scratch an itch we've felt for ages.&#10;&#10;Or on a more direct note Have you ever wanted to play a game where you could...&#10;&#10;&#10;     Grappling Hook to tall ledges, snipe foes, then dive to safety?&#10;     Wallrun up a steep slope, and kick a bad guy over a railing to their doom?&#10;     Fight AI Monsters issuing from an automated factory, then lure them into a nest of explosive barrels before blowing the lot up?&#10;     Open an cryo-vault to rescue an ancient survivor with lost knowledge?&#10;     Project force-field bridges across vast gaps, only to turn them off when foes set foot on them?&#10;     Combine versus and cooperative play into a single ruleset, with stealth and objective focused mechanics?&#10;&#10;&#10;All of these are within the domain of Zone Raiders.&#10;&#10;We are an Open-Model game, meaning that the rules and setting are designed for what miniatures you may have and adore. There's numerous fantastic manufacturers out there, and many of us certainly have collections ourselves. Additionally, creating your own group and their stories is all the easier as inspiration can be drawn from all the beautiful models our greater gaming community has created.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;&#10;Zone Raiders has a mixture of elements veteran players will both feel familiar with, and refreshed by. In our ruleset, you will find:&#10;&#10;&#10;      Rich, Easy to Learn Rules - Combine easy to learn core gameplay with mechanics that reward tactical positioning, maneuver, and applied firepower to outfox your opponents. Practical rule design ensures that no decision is without appropriate consequence.&#10;      Tactical Team Skirmish - Build a Raid Team of 6-12 hardened survivors in your quest to endure. Equip each one with different weapons and specialized skills and watch them grow... or die.&#10;      Dynamic Movement - Feel the mobility of our unique Dynamic Movement system, where your Raiders can be equipped to parkour, wallrun, grapple or powered vault across broken terrain and lethal gaps. Smash opponents off tall ledges, or create forcefield walls to trap them in place!&#10;      Deadly Environments - Your opponent is not the only threat on the battlefield. Protecting ancient relics and scavenge are automated exterminator machines, psionic mind-scorchers, fierce nano-contaminant storms and radiation fluxes. When the lights vanish or unexpected snipers arise during a Dark Emergence Event, can your forces adapt?&#10;      Diverse Factions - Command 7 unique factions with engaging playstyles, from the regimented Reclaimers, the agile Technomads, cunning Zone Stalkers to the evolving robotic NthGen, each force is dripping with flavor and tactical options as well as unique researchable doctrines and equipment.&#10;      Campaign System - Lead your team beyond a single battle, but to victory in a campaign where your strategic decisions have great importance. Will you build up your team's tech skills, or abort the mission to retrieve an ancient cryopod? Should your team construct a mighty industrial robot, or develop maps of the battleground for a tactical edge? &#10;      Asymmetric Missions - Winning a battle isn't the same as winning a war. Players can elect  different goals during a mission, from capturing prisoners to hacking an automated train. Perhaps it's worth it to cut your losses during a failed mission, or even change objectives mid game as a new, more valuable prize is discovered!&#10;      Exotic Equipment - Featuring over 100 different types of weapons, armor and survival gear, you will have numerous options on how to equip and defeat your foes. &#10;      Merciless AI Enemies - The Immunocytes are merciless machines that are anathema to all intelligent life. Destroy or outmaneuver their AI-controlled agents during battle, or perhaps even trick them to tie up your opponents!&#10;      Cooperative Play System - Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Join forces with other players to take on thrilling Cooperative Missions, where you must employ speed and stealth to defeat overwhelming numbers of AI foes to accomplish cinematic objectives as either single missions or campaign play.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Guan Dan (&#230;&#142;&#188;&#232;&#155;&#139;), or &quot;Throwing Eggs&quot;, is a 4-player, fixed-partnership climbing card game. It is played with two standard decks and each player starts with a hand of 27 cards; these are typically held in a jagged 2-dimensional array with each rank grouped together--vertically--and then arranged in ascending rank order--horizontally.&#10;&#10;The game is related to Zheng Shangyou and other climbing games. Its main distinguishing feature is its scoring system: Each team's score is expressed as a card rank, starting at 2 and progressing up to Ace. This is similar to the trump promotion system in Chinese trick-taking games like Da Bai Fen. In Guan Dan, however, instead of determining trump, the highest card rank score determines the rank that beats an Ace, and two cards of that rank (the Hearts) become wild cards. The first team to win a hand 1-2 or 1-3, when their score has reached Ace, wins.&#10;&#10;Like many climbing games, Guan Dan's playable combinations include Singles, Pairs, Triples, Full Houses, and Straights. There are also Plates and Tubes, which are consecutive pairs or consecutive triples, respectively. Finally, there are a variety of bombs ranging from 4-of-a-kinds to 10-of-a-kinds as well as straight flushes and the 4-Joker bomb. Given each player's hand size, the variety of combinations available, and the inclusion of wild cards (which can be used to form bombs), the options presented to players at the outset of a given hand are particularly numerous.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

So, truth or lie, who's on your side?&#10;&#10;What's in the game :&#10;10 Character Cards (5 Law Abiding Operatives and 5 Corrupt Defectors)&#10;20 Power Cards (10 Medical Kits and 10 Bullets)&#10;10 Color Id Cards&#10;100 Questions (50 Cards)&#10;1 Rulebook&#10;1 Marker to indicate turn&#10;&#10;How to play :&#10;In this game of 4 to 10 players, you will take on a role as either a LAW ABIDING OPERATIVE or a CROOKED DEFECTOR. Each role remains hidden and your objective is to help your allies and harm your foes. But how? Depending on your spy code, you will communicate to your team using either lies or truths.&#10;&#10;Once you determine your fellow members, hurt players on the opposing team with the BULLET and heal those on your side with the MEDICAL KIT.&#10;&#10;For each BULLET wound received, your team loses a point. For each MEDICAL KIT you receive, your team will gain one point. Side with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;If there is an EVEN number of players, shuffle together a deck of character cards with half the players on the Law Abiding Operative side and half on the Corrupted Defector side. Randomly distribute one to each player. Players must keep their role card secret during the gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each player also takes a set of tool cards: One BULLET and One MEDICAL KIT. If there is an ODD number of players, select two even sets of ROLE cards (one more card than the number of players). Deal out the ROLE cards and reveal the last one. The team revealed will receive a scoring bonus at the end, to compensate for a fewer player.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;&#10;There are two rounds in this game.&#10;&#10;Round 1: Gameplay begins with each player getting a choice to MAKE A MOVE or CALL FOR AN INTERROGATION.&#10;&#10;MAKE A MOVE: When a player makes a move, they take one of their Tools, either Bullet or Medical Kit, and gives it to another player. The Tool Card remains facedown. Only the player who received the tool card can look at it. Send Medical Kits to your teammates to score, and fire your BULLET at the other team to reduce their point total.&#10;&#10;CALL FOR AN INTERROGATION:  If you need more information, you may select one of your Tools, either Bullet or Medical Kit, and discard it without revealing to &ldquo;Call For An Interrogation.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Draw the next Interrogation Card and read it aloud. Starting with the next player clockwise, they must make a statement that answers the card. Law Abiding Agents, they must answer honestly. Corrupted Agents, they must tell a lie.&#10;&#10;Feel free to discuss! Because the first player has less information to act on, that player does not have to give up one of their tools to Call For An Interrogation.&#10;&#10;Second Round: After each player has had a turn to either Make A Move or Call For An Interrogation, in reverse order, each person now plays their remaining tool card. There is no more Interrogating in the second round. Gameplay ends with the first player distributing both of their Tool cards at the same time.&#10;&#10;End Game: All the players reveal their Role Cards. All Tools are turned over. Your team gets +1 for each Medical Kit and -1 for each Bullet played on you. Team with the highest score wins. If there is an odd number players, the team with less players gets an additional +1 point. If there is a tie, the team with the most MEDIPACKS wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each round players select one of their cards to play, which will direct the movement of their serpent, and cards are resolved highest to lowest.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Players will have to decide which card to play when for the best move to either gain ground or counteract what their opponents may play. It is as much about knowing the game as it is about knowing the other players.&#10;&#10;Place the game board in the center of the table and each player chooses a color of their choice and takes the associated cards and tokens. Players shuffle their cards and sets aside  4 random cards without looking at them. The remaining cards form a player's hand.&#10;&#10;Each player finds the token with their serpent head and places the head next to the side of the board from which they will enter (players cannot enter on the same space as another player).&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;&#10;Each turn players select one of the remaining cards in their hand to play and places it in front of them face down.&#10;&#10;All players simultaneously reveal their cards.

To do so, you must outsmart your rival investigators and correctly deduce which apocalyptic predictions are true and which are false. The player who saves the most lives wins.&#10;&#10;In each round, shuffle the twelve prophecy tiles, then lay out three rows of four tiles: the top row (face down) are true prophecies, which players must deduce; the middle row (face up) are false prophecies; and the bottom row (face down) are hoax prophecies. Below each hoax prophecy, lay out a column of four cards face up. The cards come in five prophecy suits, with values 1-3. Among the tiles are two of each prophecy and two 2x.&#10;&#10;The lead investigator for that round places one of their two personal tokens by a hoax prophecy tile, looks at that tile, then chooses a card from that column and places it face up in front of themselves. Each other player then chooses a card from this column. If a hoax prophecy tile has two player tokens next to it, don't refill it; otherwise, do refill it. The next player becomes the lead investigator, and this process continues until each player has chosen eight cards, which they now take in hand.&#10;&#10;Now you evaluate how well you predicted which disasters will take place. The lead investigator reveals one of the true prophecy tiles, then all players simultaneously reveal two cards from their hand. For each card that matches that revealed prophecy, you score positive points equal to the value of the card; otherwise, you lose points. If the prophecy tile instead shows 2x, you score positive points if you lay out two cards of matching value, but different suits; any other combination loses you points.&#10;&#10;Record your scores for the round, and after a total of four rounds (with four players), whoever has scored the most points wins. (With two and three players, you make adjustments to the number of cards and prophecy tiles used and rounds played.&#10;&#10;",

Pollen is the currency that players take to do their actions. Starting with the starting player which rotates each round, each player will take 1 action per turn until a player either passes or runs out of pollen. Once that happens no additional pollen can be awarded through pollen rewards that round. A round ends when all players have passed or run out of pollen.&#10;&#10;Players can move their bees to uncover hive hexes from the field which allows them to decide on receiving a one time pollen reward for that hex or pay its cost to purchase immediately before any other player. They may also move to bee quests which grant end-game victory points, to the waggle dance track which gives players access to their own exclusive field with special abilities, to their hive bank where all pollen and nectar is stored, or to the hive hexes where larva is layed and matured. Field hexes also contain random seasonal challenges which when explored will cause trouble based on the season.&#10;&#10;Other than moving, players may choose to harvest nectar from the field which is used to mature larva based on the color of flowers purchased into the hive, they may lay larva, buy hexes based on the seasonal chart and the location of their bees, and they may mature larva as actions on their turn. As players build their hive they will unlock permanent upgrades to their abilities.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has completed their hive or when the end of the season track is reached.&#10;&#10;Victory points are calculated based on the number of flowers on the hexes purchased into their hive, the number of worker bees they have alive, the pollen in their hive bank, and any completed quests.&#10;&#10;",

In segment X only the number die is used.&#10;&#10;The fox starts at the foxhole in the center of the game board and uses the red track to catch the hares at the intersections or on the red circles. If the fox rolles green and a number, it advances on the black dots. If it rolles red and reaches an intersection with the white track or the center of a circle it may catch a hare on the intersection or on a red space on the circle. If a hare is caught it gets eaten and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;If a hare gets on an intersection it cries &quot;Fox!&quot; and the fox has to immediately return to the foxhole.&#10;&#10;The first hare to reach the orange space at section X wins the game. The game ends when all hares have escaped or have been caught. The caught hares pay the fox and the fox pays the escaped hares.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Noisy Neighbors is an eavesdropping game where you have to guess what your teammates are doing solely by listening to them act out various activities from behind a wall.&#10;&#10;You are separated from your teammate behind a handheld folding board that serves as a thin apartment wall.  The wall prevents you from seeing what's going on.  Your teammate draws a card and acts out the activity shown using sound effects only.  Listen carefully and shout out what you think they're doing.  If you guess correctly, you teammate shouts &quot;yes!&quot; and quickly moves on to another card.  You have two minutes to guess as many activities as you can, earning one point for your team for each correct guess.&#10;&#10;The game is very simple to play and can accommodate large groups.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hubris: Twilight of the Hellenistic World places players in the shoes of the 2nd century BC Hellenistic kings, heirs to the famous Successors who fought over Alexander the Great's empire for more than 40 years, into their dotage. The world they are living in is different in many ways as, under the Macedonian kings, the Eastern Mediterranean has experienced a boost in urban life and an unprecedented sharing and cross-fertilization of culture, but the dominant theme remains major powers' rivalries and endemic warfare.&#10;&#10;In those years, even though the great kingdoms of the Lagids (Ptolemies), Seleucids and Antigonid Macedon have been established for 80 years or more, power remains a very personal endeavour, with everything revolving around the king, and he himself having to rely on his entourage of family members, childhood friends, and veteran advisers to conduct state affairs, whether leading armies, undertaking diplomatic missions, or governing provinces.&#10;&#10;Even though the great kings are fixated on their rivals, the world around them has been changing, both from within, where minor kingdoms such as Pergamon have been pushing for a space at the table, and leagues of Greek cities are offering a new challenge to century-old Macedonian hegemony, and from without where, beyond the ever present Barbarian incursions from the savage North, new powers have been flexing their muscles both in the Western Mediterranean and Central Asia...&#10;&#10;The times for a final push for final triumph, or descent into irrelevancy, are near...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Yomi is a fighting game in card form in which physical dexterity is replaced by hand management skills. Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.&#10;&#10;More specifically, Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.&#10;&#10;Yomi Starter Set: Midori versus Setsuki features two character decks, allowing players to face off immediately. Individual character decks allow new matches to be fought between different pairings.&#10;&#10;Game Modes&#10;&#10;1v1, the main mode&#10;    2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom&#10;    A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent&#10;    A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.&#10;    Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.&#10;    Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.&#10;    Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.&#10;    Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.&#10;    Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck. In that case, time is out and the player with the highest life wins.&#10;&#10;Note Contained in:&#10;Yomi (Second Edition)&#10;Yomi: Round 1&#10;&#10;",

Each player who contributed takes their Build markers back and flips them over to the 5VP side, then the Ward Tower card is placed next to the Monster row. For each completed Ward Tower, the cost to slay any monster is reduced by 1 Strength or 1 Magic as a player chooses. This benefit is cumulative and is available to all players, even if they did not contribute to building the Ward Towers.&#10;&#10;The Ward Towers Pack contains 5 rules card, 5 Double-sided Ward Tower cards, 1 Divider, and 30 Punchboard Build markers.&#10;&#10;This is a Kickstarter Limited Exclusive and will not be available at retail.

Like some other Swiss card games, the descending rank of cards is A-10-K-Q etc.  In this particular game J's are both Trump and their own suit, so that a lead of a Jack must be followed by another Jack.  Jacks are ranked by their suits to determine which is highest.  The Qs of spades are the Schwarze Sau's (= Black Sow), which are 150 points for the first and 250 for the second taken.  All points are bad; best possible score is to stay at zero.  If you can't follow suit then you can play anything you like.  However, you can &quot;Lie&quot; and not follow suit if you prefer.  Winner of the trick may challenge any one player who has not followed suit.  If the challenge is successful, then the liar takes the trick and 50 points for lying.  If unsuccessful, then the original winner of the trick takes the trick and 50 points for challenging incorrectly.  Players are not allowed to lie when challenged; they must tell the truth.  Trick-winner leads next hand.  Winner of last trick gets 100 points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

To get there, you follow the cards. Each turn you&rsquo;ll play a Board Action (the mandatory action of the card your token sits on), a Hand Action (one or more available options from the cards in your hand), and a Draw Action (replenish your hand from the draw pile).&#10;&#10;Some cards are straightforward; they tell you exactly what to do. But most cards have options. Do you use the card to help yourself? Or burn your opponents? Wait &ndash; is there a way to do both? Of such is SetBack strategy born.&#10;&#10;SetBack combines the portability of a card game with the playability of a board game to give it a fast-paced style where strategy shifts on the fly and the whole game can turn on the play of each card. Using the same cards to build the board AND your hand simplifies mastery of basic game mechanics while also resulting in millions of possible board configurations and unlimited replayability.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, you have to utilize limited time and money to visit the Monuments and taste the local food in Tamsui to gain &quot;knowledge points&quot;. After finishing the game, the player with the most points will win the title of &quot;Master of TamGu&quot;.&#10;(This paragraph of description comes from the English rulebook.)&#10;&#10;The game proceeds clockwise during the first round. On every turn the active player may choose either to visit a site or to earn money. To visit a site, the player chooses an available Traveling Card to buy (with both money and his limited time) and moves his pawn to the corresponding zone. If the player has insufficient money or he wants to gain the traveling fee, he can instead move back to the starting zone to convert any amount of time to money. After the first round, the game proceeds like the well-known game Patchwork.&#10;&#10;The game continue till all players have moved for no less than 72 hours. The player with the highest knowledge points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There are four volatile altcoins to bet on in the game: Ledginvest, Dodg-E-Coin, CryoCoin and Block Burster. Each altcoin has a corresponding stack of Market Cards that predict gains or losses. You need four players to be Investors to start the action. Each Investor gets two wallets and 10 physical Bitcoins. One Investor is also the Exchange Manager for the round. The Exchange Manager passes out one Insider Trading Card to each Investor and spins to see which altcoins will be open for trading that round. The Exchange Manager also secretly sets a timer for any time between 3 and 15 seconds so that only he or she knows how much time is on the clock for placing bets. Each Investor reveals their Insider Trading Card to the group to see what action they can take before the Market opens. You might even get an insider tip that gives you a competitive advantage in placing your bets. The Market is open! Investors simultaneously bet their Bitcoins on the altcoins by placing their wallets on the board. Trading immediately stops when the timer rings. The Exchange Manager then flips over the Market Card for each altcoin to reveal a gain or loss for each Investor. It&rsquo;s Bitcoin boom or bust--one minute your wallet&rsquo;s full and it&rsquo;s Lambo time, the next second you lose everything in a scam! Keep playing until the Bitcoin Bank runs dry. The Investor with the most Bitcoin wins!&#10;&#10;Contents: Includes: 160 Bitcoin, 12 Plastic Bitcoin Wallets, 1 Altcoin Speculation Mat, 1 Spinner, 40 Market Cards, 1 Exchange Manager Card, 4 Insider Trading Cards, 4 Character Cards, Instructions.&#10;&#10;",

Two of those cards are turned face-up.  On a player's turn, he or she will do one of three things:&#10;&#10;1.  Flip a face-down card so the number shows&#10;2.  Draw the top card from the deck&#10;3.  Draw the top card from the discard pile&#10;&#10;If either of the latter two happen, the player will have a choice: discard the just-drawn card, or replace one of his or her six cards with it (a replaced face-down card becomes face-up at that point).&#10;&#10;This continues until one player has the numbers of all six cards showing.  Play continues until everyone has an equal number of turns, and then they move on to scoring.&#10;&#10;When scoring, if the top and bottom number of the player's grid matches (e.g. both a 7) then the numbers are negated and they become 0.   Alternately, if a player can form a &quot;square&quot; of numbers - both top and bottom match on four consecutive spaces - then the player scores -40 points ---- they just went Forty Below.&#10;&#10;",

The French and Prussian scenario set up and arrival information is unchanged (except as noted).&#10;&#10;No new Counters are required.&#10;&#10;New Scenarios added:&#10;&bull; # 38.0 THE WATERLOO CAMPAIGN - Three Approaches to Brussels, 15-19 June 1815&#10;On June 14th, Napoleon has concentrated his forces between Maubeuge and Beaumont and must decide whether to move directly on Brussels or shift westward through Nivelles to Hal and confront the Anglo-Allied Army at a distance from the Prussian Army.&#10;&#10;&bull; # 39.0 THE HAL BATTLE - No Relief in Sight, 18 June 1815&#10;Off the map, Grouchy is successfully blocking the Prussian Army from joining forces with Wellington&rsquo;s Army at Hal. Napoleon and Wellington&rsquo;s Armies are roughly equal. Who is the better commander?&#10;&#10;&bull; # 40.0 THE FIELDS OF HAL - Wellington&rsquo;s Predicament, 17-18 June 1815&#10;Wellington had prepared for battle at Hal and would have quickly assembled his forces in pre-planned positions. The Prussian Army would have strained every nerve to join forces with the Anglo-Allies, facing a longer march. Can Napoleon defeat Wellington before Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s arrival?&#10;&#10;&bull; # 41.0 THE TURNED FLANK - Napoleon&rsquo;s Phantom Left-Hook, 18-19 June 1815&#10;&ldquo;I think I should have respected the English infantry more&hellip;and that I should not have taken the bull by the horns; I should have turned a flank. I should have kept the English army occupied [at Mont St. Jean] by a demonstration to attack&hellip;whilst I was in fact moving the&#10;main body by Hal on Brussels.&rdquo; &mdash;Wellington.&#10;&#10;Wellington politely failed to mention that French command issues could be fatal to any strategy. This scenario allows the players to explore Wellington&rsquo;s Turned Flank strategy while minimizing French command errors. Can Napoleon prevail?&#10;&#10;&bull; # 42.0 WELLINGTON REINFORCED - The Corps from Hal&mdash;Two Variants, 18 June 1815&#10;Historians are often dismissive of Wellington&rsquo;s leaving 17,000 men at Hal. These are two variants for the NLG &ldquo;Battle of Waterloo&rdquo; (30.0) which explore the What If possibilities if these units were better utilized. All other 30.0 rules are in effect.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;&bull; 1 Map sheet, Hal (WX) &ndash; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; &#10;&bull; 1 Study Folder (4 pages)&#10;&bull; 2 Initial Anglo-Allied Setup Cards &#10;&bull; 6 Turn Record Cards&#10;&bull; 1 Casualty Record Card&#10;&#10;",

Monkeys move in one of two ways, either climbing directly up their current bamboo stalk or leaping to the next one while dropping down one or more spaces in the process.&#10;&#10;Monkey Duel is a game of positioning and timing. Monkeys positioned higher up the bamboo stalks hold an offensive advantage, but every move requires giving up some altitude. Monkeys can also keep one another safe, so deciding when to stick together and when to make an individual break for it is key to victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Squirrel is a family friendly game of tactical foraging. To win you must gather the biggest hand of acorns before the last leaf of Autumn turns brown.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a grid of 9 green leaf piles. Under each green leaf card is a chance to find either a brown leaf or 1 to 3 brown acorns.&#10;&#10;Players must each build a maximum hand of 3 cards by hopping their squirrel counter from one leaf pile to the next. After each move they must take 1 card from the top of a neighboring leaf pile to add to their hand.&#10;&#10;If their hand exceeds 3 cards or they make a gap in the grid, they must drop a card with its brown side face up. In this way the leaf piles change color from green to brown and when the top card of all 9 leaf piles shows a brown face, the game (and autumn) has ended. Players must then reveal their hands and the player with the greatest total number of acorns is the winner.&#10;&#10;Beware. &#10;The best foragers may be pushing their luck. A squirrel who holds more than 3 acorn cards must drop one in plain view. An opponent who stands on a dropped acorn can steal from your hand! &#10;Wise foragers can manage their hand as well as the length of the game by choosing when to voluntarily drop a card and which green leaf piles to cover or reveal.&#10;&#10;Squirrel has enough gameplay for adults and older children to enjoy with enough luck to keep young children in the game without constantly feeling out-maneuvered.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Charged Canada is an electric vehicle mission-based board game.  Charged Canada brings you back to a not too distant past where there are no charging stations across the entire nation.  It's up to you and your friends to decide where to put the charging stations as you see fit with your missions.&#10;&#10;Missions include traveling from a specific city to city, collecting resources, and building charging stations or solar installation.  Each player receives their own mission cards at the beginning of each game playthrough.  With hundreds of mission cards to choose from, your three starting missions are not going to be the same as the other players.&#10;&#10;Each round is determined using the actions cards, which can be used right away or held for later use.&#10;&#10;Strategy game elements include:&#10;map building&#10;deck building&#10;point to point movement&#10;&#10;With multiple ways to win, typically through completing a mission card for the victory point on that card.  Another way is to create charging stations or solar installations to earn a victory point for each.&#10;&#10;The first one to the victory point limit wins.  The VP limit is dependent on the number of players as Charged Canada can have up to 8 players.  The higher the number of players the lower the VP limit.&#10;&#10;Each playthrough will be different based on the mission cards that everyone has and decides how to proceed with those missions.&#10;&#10;Charged Canada is easy to learn and play for even the most beginner to board games.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
