    "Description": "The games system of Archworld is designed with several purposes in mind:&#10;&#10;1) To explain in terms of wargaming the capabilities of the armies and the peoples of the Archworld campaign setting&#10;&#10;2) To provide a simple yet realistic set of rules that will cover ancient, medieval, and early gunnery periods.&#10;&#10;One of the reasons behind the genesis of the Archworld rules has been an attempt to respond to the needs and complaints of many wargamers who feel that most of the ancient warfare rules now available are far too complex. Too many of these game systems require an excessive amount of log keeping and the use of overly long sets of tables. A need for referees and a lot of pencil pushing detracts from the enjoyment of the game.&#10;&#10;The other problem with many fantasy rules is that they bear little relation to the literary fantasy tradition. These games tend to rely upon vast numbers of omnipotent beings and spell-casting wizards rather than the strategic capabilities of a kingdom's legions of ordinary soldiers.&#10;&#10;Archworld is intended to provide a reasonable and easy-to-understand accounting of the uses of weapons and armor of the period, and the strategy of empire making and the like. The gamer who is not interested in the re-fighting of Archworld battles may simply disregard the fantasy elements and still use these rules to create realistic battle situations for any period up to the late 1600s.&#10;&#10;Bases and Scale:&#10;&#10;Scales is given in terms of paces, with one real inch equaling ten paces, one scale pace equals 2 1/2 feet (or 1 mm. equals 1 foot). All movement and the proper sizes of bases can be worked our from this scale. As a rule, one figure equals twenty men, except in the case of personality figures, which obviously are one to one.&#10;&#10;Archworld also contains a complete set of rules for naval combat.&#10;&#10;Archworld also includes a 4 panel paper foldout map of Archworld, 3 single sided sheets of cardboard ship cutouts (these are not counters-the cut outs of the ships are much larger and are used for naval miniatures combat), and 2 single sided cardstock sheets of reference charts.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, players turn over clue cards with colors or shapes and then attempt to find a playing piece that matches the color or shape (purple starfish, green seashells, and yellow sand dollars) and add it to their playing board.  The second game, for ages four and up is similar, but it introduces wild cards and has a competitive element.  The third game, for ages five and up, challenges players to create an original, repeating pattern using the shapes.&#10;&#10;No reading required. Chunky playing pieces, easy for little hands to hold.&#10;&#10;(This is not the same game as the 1994 Parker Brothers 'The Little Mermaid Under the Sea Card Game'.)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Political Football&quot; is a simulation of the infamous Rugby [football] Tour of New Zealand in 1981 by a racially segregated team from South Africa ( which was then governed by the Apartheid system of racial separation). The Tour was opposed by a coalition of anti-racist groups in New Zealand. The result was a watershed in NZ politics, as the previously peaceful and harmonious country was bitterly divided by the violence that resulted from the confrontation between these opposing elements. In particular, the NZ Police force emerged without its previous positive image as an agent of fairness and social cohesion.&#10;&#10;The name &ldquo;Political Football&rdquo; is a play on the common expression in NZ and elsewhere, where a contentious issue may be referred to in this way, particularly where the original problem has a non-political nature but when there may be an element of political opportunism apparent. In the case of the Rugby Tour, as well as being literally descriptive, there was an element of cynicism readily evident in the controversy.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Game Play is generally intuitive, and the number of Counters ( total 21 only) means play is readily comprehensible as well as fast moving. There are no dice, but some small randomness in the appearance of some features earlier or later. There is only one &ldquo;scenario&rdquo; and the whole Game must be played to determine a winner. Time for whole Game is about 2 hours&#10;&#10;The Game has four protagonists&#10;1. The Demonstrators, who seek to disrupt the Tour to the extent that it must be abandoned&#10;2. The Rugby groups, who seek to complete the scheduled Tour.&#10;3. The Police, who seek to allow the Rugby to conduct their lawful business of playing Rugby&#10;4. The Government, which manipulates the other Players, seeking to extract maximum political advantage from a Law &amp; Order issue&#10;&#10;Everybody except the Government has an inventory of Counters, which are able to move about the board under a movement allowance system, interacting with opposing counters. Players also have a suite of Action Cards which allow certain Actions to be played. Government uses its Turn to play certain cards influencing the other Players.&#10;&#10;The Board is a stylized representation of &#10;&amp;#61623; four Sports Grounds, where the Rugby matches are scheduled ; &#10;&amp;#61623; a Court, where arrested demonstrators are processed;  &#10;&amp;#61623; a Hospital, where &ldquo;injured&rdquo; Counters wait till released by Government. &#10;&amp;#61623; between these venues, a gridded surface of &ldquo;streets&rdquo;, across which the Counters move from place to place. Only one Counter is allowed on any one square; counters cannot &ldquo;jump&rdquo; other counters.&#10;&#10;The Tactics of the Game involve each Player trying to &#10;a. achieve certain mandatory objectives ( eg Rugby fielding sufficient Counters at the same time and place to actually play a match !).&#10;b. prevent Opposing Players establishing themselves in such a way as to frustrate opposition objectives.&#10;&#10;Progress is measured and the Game won, by accumulation of Points for performing certain Actions ( eg for Rugby ,&ldquo;Play the Match&rdquo;; for Demonstrators &ldquo; Destroy the Goal posts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confront Police&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;In short, each Player can ( and must) adopt a mix of Offensive and Defensive play.&#10;In general, all Counters can &ldquo;bash&rdquo; all other counters, putting them out of action for an extended but indeterminable time; while the Police have the power to arrest Demonstrators, removing them (briefly) from play. All counters can be also used to form defensive &ldquo;walls&rdquo;, preventing opponents from achieving their objectives (eg preventing Rugby Counters from getting to the Sports ground to play their game&hellip;).&#10;&#10;These tactics will be familiar to anyone who has ever attended a political demonstration, particularly a violent one.&#10;&#10;This Game has a number of very interesting features :&#10;1. the protagonists are a-symmetrical in numbers, capacities and objectives yet play is finely balanced,&#10;2.  Both the Police and Rugby lose Points by attacking Demonstrators, but may lose more by NOT doing so!&#10;3. While the non-Demonstrator Players have mutual interests, these are NOT identical &ndash; leading to subtle conflicts that preclude any lasting alliance.&#10;4. The result see-saws wildly throughout the Game&#10;5. Novice Players learn rapidly how their tactics need to change&#10;6. No Player is ever permanently eliminated, which upsets novices !&#10;7. Players offensive capacities are governed by non-recurring Action Cards : when to use them is a matter of judging opportunity.&#10;8. Play often appears counter-intuitive to novices, but in fact is an accurate simulation of this particular variety of conflict, ie the maintenance of Law &amp; Order in a democratic society where Police powers are limited by Human Rights considerations. Playing the Game itself demonstrates these principles powerfully.&#10;&#10;In summary, this is a unique and workable game system that provides for very subtle calculations of both short term tactics as well as longer term objectives, within a simple set of rules.&#10;&#10;",

Next to 6 of those fields there is a field to put a card on. The cards have values between 3000 and 10000 DM and corresponding 3 to 10 fields to place chips on the cards.&#10;&#10;Every player gets one figurine and the chips in the corresponding color. The figurines are placed on an empty field on the board and each player gets 2 white chips. The remaining white chips are placed in the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;The cards are shuttled and 6 of them are placed face up on the  discard fields.&#10;&#10;On your turn you can move your figurine 1 to 4 fields clockwise. The field you're ending on defines what you can do next. When you end on a field with a card laying next to it, you have to put one of your chips on the card. The fields on the card are numbered and have to be covered one by one.&#10;&#10;Do you reach the red field on the board, then you can place a chip on the card of your choice. On the blue field you can exchange a chip of your color from your supply for a white one. The white chips have a special function. During your turn only one colored chip can be placed, but on that same turn several white chips can be placed on the same card. Instead of a colored chip you can also play one white chip. White chips are neutral and don't belong to any player once they are placed.&#10;&#10;When a figurine arrives at an already occupied field, the new arrival has to discard one of his chips. After that the player can continue his turn.&#10;&#10;There is a scoring as soon as the last field of a card is covered. The player who has placed the last colored chip on that card gets the card. After that, the opposite card goes to the player who has placed the last colored chip on that card.&#10;&#10;The chips that were on those cards leave the game. New cards are placed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no one has any chips left. The winner is the player with the highest total value on his gained cards.&#10;&#10;",

The box contains a board, a wooden champagne bottle, 48 cards, 6 party characters and 20 chips.&#10;&#10;The board shows 6 persons who are more or less undressed. In the middle of the board there is a tract on which the champaign bottle is moving. The tract contains 4 kinds of fields.&#10;&#10;The cards are showing a number value of a special symbol. The party characters are the ones also showed on the board. But now they are dressed and each character is split in 4 parts.&#10;&#10;Each player takes place in front of one of the characters on the board and gets the 4 pieces of his character. These pieces have to be put on the picture on the board.&#10;&#10;Aim of the game is to stay dressed as long as possible.&#10;&#10;Each players gets 3 cards from the shuffled stack, the rest of the cards are put aside the board.&#10;&#10;On your turn you play one of your cards and you draw one new card from the stack. If a numbered card is played , the champaign bottle is moved accordingly on the tract. You get a chip when the bottle lands on a dark green field, you have to give a chip if the bottle lands on a red field. Landing on a light green field results in nothing.&#10;&#10;On passing the start field with the bottle, a piece of clothing has to be removed from your character. This can only be prevented by playing one of the 4 special cards instead of a numbered card. When playing the R-card, you can leave the bottle where it is and the player on your right is on turn. If you play the card with a rectangle on it, the next player has to remove a piece of clothing from his character. Playing the card with a star on it brings you right to the start field and playing the card with a question mark on it causes your left neighbor to draw a card and play that card immediately.&#10;&#10;The chips have a special meaning. Each player can only have max. 3 of those chips. When playing a card the use of a chip allows you to lower the number of fields you have to move by one.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the characters is completely in his underwear. The winner is the character which is still most dressed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game for ages 6 and up. The box itself is the board and contains 1 die and 50 wooden pins.&#10;&#10;The wooden board can be folded into a box to contain the die and the pins.&#10;&#10;On top of the board there are 6 numbered borings. The pins fit in these borings. The boring with number 6 leads directly to the inner part of the board. If you put a pin here it goes down directly.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to get rid of your pins as fast a possible. The pins are distributed amongst the players.&#10;&#10;On your turn you roll the die and you put a pin in the boring with the number you have rolled, if that is still free. You can choose to  roll again or you can pass and give the turn to the next player.&#10;&#10;If the rolled boring is already occupied, you have to take the pin and your turn ends.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the players got rid of all his pins.&#10;&#10;",

The pawn moves accordingly to the die roll, but for each &quot;6&quot; you roll your turn continues. On crossings you can choose to take the short trajectory across the center or to stay on the saver loop. When you end up on an occupied field, you can throw that first pawn off the board. This pawn has to start all over again.&#10;&#10;The sheriff can reach all pawns on the fields within the loop. If a player rolls a number that allows the sheriff to take one or more pawns, the sheriff has to be played. All pawns that are caught by the sheriff have to restart. The sheriff never beats the pawns of the player who has made the sheriff active.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player has his 4 pawns on his destination field.&#10;&#10;",

The first player reaching this, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Movement is done by throwing 2 dice, one normal die and one colour die. The normal die determines the number of spaces a playing piece can move, the color die enables the use of shortcuts of the appropriate color, though throwing black lets the piece move backwards.&#10;&#10;Jumping over pieces is not allowed and landing on an occupied space lets the piece go back to the start.&#10;&#10;",

And since 54 spaces are empty at the beginning, a slower development of the game is achieved.&#10;&#10;Several additions are made to the normal rules, like enabling the capture of own pieces (which allows an additional move) or making a putsch against the own pieces. It's not explicitly mentioned, but I guess, these additions can be left away to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

The castle has 7 entrances. The castle cards are placed face down on these entrances. The castle cards are showing robbers, vermin or the treasure.&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of equipment cards : hats, keys and boats. The cards of the same kind have a similar look.

An action takes place when your pawn ends on a special field. &#10;When your pawn lands on a boat field, you get a boat card. Landing on a hat field gives you a hat card and landing on a key field gives you a key card.&#10;When your pawn ends on a sleeping robber, you can roll a second time. A horse helps you move faster, if your pawn lands on a horse field you can move to a field of your choice.&#10;If you land on a fallen tree field, you have to skip one turn and landing on the bridge will cause you to lose all your equipment cards.&#10;&#10;If your pawn arrives on an already occupied field, you can take one equipment card of the player whose pawn was already on that field.&#10;&#10;Your pawn can go to the castle if he lands on a pier. Therefor you have to hand in one of each of the three kinds of equipment cards. On your next turn your pawn can move on one of the 7 castle cards and turn it face up. If that castle card shows a spider, a ghost or a bat , you can turn the card face down again and move 1 field further. If the castle card shows a robber you have to start all over again.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player has found the treasure card.&#10;&#10;",

The person with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;Note that due to the recycling of the cards, this can be a very lengthy game if the players are not experts on General Hospital of the mid 1980s.&#10;&#10;There are also rules for solo play (go through the deck once, rolling the die for each one -- if you get 27 or more correct, you win.&#10;&#10;",

It is ruled off in 1&quot; squares, with numbers from 0 to 9 printed in about 10% of the squares. The tiles are cardboard counters of decent thickness - the numbers are red and the symbols (+, -, and =) yellow.&#10;&#10;Players mix up the tiles, then draw seven numbers and three signs.  In turn, each player places tiles on the board to make a &quot;legal&quot; equation, using at least one tile already on the board, crossword-style.  Typical Scrabble rules are used regarding challenges and redraws.  Player score the sum of the numbers they used, disregarding the results of the equation they formed.  If a tile is placed on a space bearing the same number, it's double score.&#10;&#10;A surprising rule is that a player may remove the equal sign from an equation on the board and replace it with a plus or minus if they can form a new equation that way.  The removed &quot;=&quot; is reused further down the new equation.&#10;&#10;Game meant for 2nd/3rd Grade and up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hoplon 3 is the third edition of a fast play set of ancient and medieval miniatures rules using an amended version of the DBx basing system. This allows players with DBx-based armies to play Hoplon with only minimum changes necessary.   &#10; Although designed for 15mm miniatures, the system also supports 25/28mm play.  Hoplon has been extensively play-tested in clubs and by members of a dedicated Yahoo group, and this testing has led to a number of revisions which have been incorporated into the third edition.&#10;&#10;The philosophy behind Hoplon is to provide an easy-to-learn but deep system emphasizing the relative capabilities of different troop types and morale classes, the difficulties of effective command and control and -most of all - the close matching of historical tactics and performance.&#10;&#10;In Hoplon, armies are separated into commands, and commands are separated into units. Troops are activated and controlled by means of command points. While single elements can function individually, they do so at a cost when detached from their parent formations, losing their unit's stamina, cohesion bonus, and ability to maneuver in groups. This in turn forces players to deal with the tactical control problems inherent in commanding large bodies of ancient and medieval troops. Sequence of play is by interleaved-Command (both players moving on the same round by order of initiative of their commands) rather than alternating on every round, which makes tactical decision-making all the more interesting.&#10;&#10;While it uses a points system and army lists loosely based on the DBM model, Hoplon has taken a fresh approach to game-play which provides a realistic and historically satisfying simulation of ancient and medieval warfare. As a result, most historical battles require little or no tweaking to re-fight making this set a real tool for simulating actual battles.&#10;&#10;",

But even so there, flowers of the trick-taking game had quietly and gallantly flourished!&#10;&#10;Kan is the short form of the Kankei(relationship). At first, Kankei team and Non-Kankei teams are determined by dealt cards and the fight  against each other for the 16 picture cards(Each A, K, Q and J). Friends in earlier rounds could be opponents for the next deal!&#10;&#10;A deal consists of ten tricks. Trumps are determined each deal. For each individual case, each player should try to guess what in other  players hands and then try to help each other according to game-rules using the cards in one's hand.&#10;&#10;If Kankei team wins, they will play same team up to 3 deals. At 2nd and/or 3rd deal of same Kankei team, they can decide trump suit from definite information.&#10;&#10;At Go-nin-Kan (or 5 hands Kan), Kankei team consist of two players against Non-Kankei team with three. If a player plays as a dealer, the game becomes easier and smooth. (At official tournament, always six players play.)&#10;&#10;You can play less than five players with Variant rules.&#10;&#10;For four hands, Damari-Kan (quiet Kan, two against two).&#10;For three hands, Ganbari-Kan (bearing Kan, one against two).&#10;&#10;&#10;    Japon Brand version&#10;&#10;&#10;The special deck of the Go-nin-Kan from JAPON BRAND featured Japanese four seasons as suits (Spring: Night cherry blossom. Summer: Beech leaf. Autumn: Apple fruit. Winter: Snow crystal). As picture cards, the Japanese summer celebrations Neputa(sleeping-purging) and Mushi-Okuri(worm-purging) are illustrated. In addition, this set includes marker cards for displaying examples of playing situation.&#10;&#10;We wish for you to experience Japanese and/or Tsugaru soul!&#10;&#10;",

The tiles are randomly placed on the board face down. Each player puts the playing piece of his neighbor on an empty space of the board and the game can begin.&#10;&#10;Object of the game is to collect 4 tiles with each friend of Jacob. The player who achieves this first, is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Movements of the playing pieces are handled in a very unusual way: each row of the board shows a number, which indicates the distance that a pieces must move (in any direction). If a piece lands on a tile, the player looks at it secretly and keeps it, if he does not have it already. If he finds a piece already in his collection, he puts it back on a empty space of his choice. This can not only confuse the player's memory, it can also be made in a more strategical way, because the movements of the playing pieces are defined by the already mentioned number of the rows.&#10;&#10;",

The rows are placed parallel to one another on the board. Two start and two destination fields are located on the ends of each row.&#10;&#10;The turntables have each a different amount of fields. The first one only shows values from 1 to 3. The second one shows the values 3, 5, 7, 9 and several times 0. The third one can be used to try to double the number of fields your pawns can move.&#10;&#10;There are 3 categories of cards : joker, super joker and stop cards.&#10;&#10;For starters, each player gets 4 pawns (2 small and 2 large)of one color and 4 cards (2 joker, 1 super joker and 1 stop card). The pawns are placed on their start fields.&#10;&#10;On your turn you can turn one of the two turntables with numbers. You can move one of your pawns accordingly. If you want to, you can turn the third turntable and try to double the distance your pawn can move.&#10;&#10;A field can never contain more than one pawn. You can leap over your pawns.&#10;&#10;If there are pawns on the fields parallel to the one where a large pawn is landing, the pawns on the parallel fields have to restart. Little pawns can never cause a restart to other pawns.&#10;&#10;You can influence the course of the game by using the cards.  Playing a joker befor you turn one of the turntables will double your result. The superjoker can be played after you have turned one of the turntables to double the result. The stop card can be used to stop one of the other players during his turn, but only when that player didn't play a joker or superjoker.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of players has placed his 4 pawns on his destination fields.&#10;&#10;",

One of them is a kind of Rock-Scissors-Paper effect, because an axeman fighting a pikeman, a pikeman against a swordsman and a swordsman against an axeman gets 1 bonus point.&#10;&#10;The advanced version adds several new units (archers, horsemen, veterans, horses), enables ranged attacks, combat support possibilities and faster movements.

In that world there is a place for everyone, and fun for everyone. There is also a place for all of the words on earth - those in your own language, those in foreign languages, ordinary words, and words that are the names of persons or places - if the letters of an alphabet can be used to spell them.&#10;&#10;The game can be as easy, or as difficult, as the players choose to make it - among yourselves you agree on the kind of words that are to be used. The playing time can be readily adjusted to suit your convenience.&#10;&#10;Above all, KAN ZEN is a world for those who let their imagination soar, discovering how much enjoyment they can have with a game that permits almost infinite variation.&#10;&#10;KAN ZEN AT A GLANCE:&#10;&#10;The board is a circular track, on which a step is taken for each letter of a word played. Letters drawn at random at the beginning of each move must be included in the words that you use. UP-TURNS, where the TALLY (letter count) is added to your score, alternate with DOWN-TURNS, where the TALLY is subtracted, unless evasive action is taken. The &quot;perfect&quot; words are those whose TALLIES enable you to move to sectors of the circle where the best advantage can be taken on multiple scoring opportunities on UP-TURNS or where losses can be avoided or minimized on DOWN-TURNS. The winner is the player with the highest net accumulative TALLY at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;HOW MANY CAN PLAY?&#10;&#10;Two, three or four sides can play the highly competitive versions of the The Perfect Word Game - as individuals, partners or teams.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played &quot;solo&quot;. Those who love words, or who find pleasure in drawing on a well-stocked memory of names of persons and places, may well consider KAN ZEN the best solitaire game in the world.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is dealt 4 soccer player card, 1 of each color, and some money.&#10;&#10;During Phase-1, the players walk around a 16 space course, spend money for soccer player cards, superstars and fan cards. They also need money to make transfers with other players or to replace soccer players, which have been hurt by injuries. The strength of all teams is always kept up-to-date, because the income depends directly on it!&#10;As soon as all soccer playing cards are sold, Phase-1 ends and players with incomplete teams pay for making up their teams again. If they don't have enough money, they get the worst available cards.&#10;&#10;Phase-2 is the match phase (money does not help here anymore): &#10;The matches are played on a 7x13 playing field. Each team has 3 tokens which merely serve as defenders. The ball is moved by putting cards on the table. The attacker must announce, which card(s) he wants to play and the defender can then arrange his tokens according to certain restrictions. Goals can only be realized by Superstars - but there are 12 in this game, so most matches will end with a winner. A match is finished, when one player has played all his cards.&#10;&#10;All succeeding matches must be played with the same deck of cards, so it's clear, that Phase-1 is most important to become the final World Cup Winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Rymdimperiet (Space Empire in English) is one of the few games the Swedish publishers &quot;&Auml;ventyrsspel&quot; did on their own without licensing an already exciting American game. The gameplay in itself is simple and each player will play the part of a space trader shipping goods across the galaxy. The goal of the game is to generate a net of 150,000 credits and return to your home planet before any of the other players.&#10;&#10;Players move on already existing trade routes which they later can choose to buy to make their own for a set price. Once a trade route has been bought it will earn that player revenue each time another player is forced to use that particular route, as well as create safe passage way for your own trading ship when traveling in the sense that you do not have to pay the expenses to another player and give them the edge.&#10;&#10;Trade routes are different in length and usefulness and players will also be given the option to upgrade their ship to go in Hyperdrive, thus allowing them to move around the board to their destinations faster. The game uses a table where you look up the revenue from each trade between the starting planet and the goal for your shipment.&#10;&#10;The element that makes the game difficult is that you cannot actively choose your trade route. It is randomly generated by dice rolls through a table to see to what area and which planet on the board you have to go to. This is also where owning and buying trade routes plays the part of a tactical element.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Rail Baron&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Stones can not be moved to other spaces, but they are (must be) flipped over, if the sum of own stones in a row or column is higher than the sum of the opposing stones.&#10;&#10;The game ends, when a player can not place a stone on the board. To determine the winner, the numbers on the not yet played stones are subtracted from the total on the stones on the board. The higher total wins. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Of&ouml;rberedd (&quot;unprepared&quot;) is a Swedish trivia game, but not quite like most trivia games.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get through high school, get a doctorate, and finally win by becoming a professor.&#10;&#10;When a player is still a student, his examiner (the next player) draws a card and reads a subject from that. The subject is something like &quot;Name a city by the river ....&quot;. The examiner reads the question and fills in the blank with something of his own choosing. If the student can answer, he gets a diploma in that subject (there are four different subjects). If the student can't answer, the examiner must answer the question. If he can't, he gets a warning. Otherwise, the student gets the warning. The rest of the players are arbiters in the case of disputes as to what is the correct answer to a question.&#10;&#10;After collecting three diplomas, the player is finished with high school and can now start working on his doctorate. To achieve that, he must get a diploma in each of the four subjects. Once he has that, he must also hold a lecture. To get the subject of his lecture, the player arranges his diplomas in a certain order and reads the sentence that this creates (if he has more than one diploma in a subject he may choose which one to use). This will result in a subject like &quot;The bad influence / of movies / upon art / in troubled times.&quot; The student must now keep a two-minute lecture on this subject. If there are no obvious errors in his lecture, he gets his doctorate. To become a professor, the doctor must get another diploma in each subject and hold another lecture over a given subject.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10; - 48 student question cards&#10; - 16 doctor question cards&#10; - 12 warning cards&#10; - 64 diplomas&#10; - 6 &quot;finished high school&quot; counters (student's cap)&#10; - 6 &quot;become a doctor&quot; counters (doctor's hat)&#10; - 1 &quot;become a professor&quot; counter (laurel)&#10; - Rules booklet&#10; - Booklet with explanations of questions&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Stones River is a simulation of the battle of Murfreesboro in the American Civil War.&#10;&#10;The game uses a fairly standard system reminiscent of SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) quads of the period.  The rules do have a few points of distinction.  For example, units have a stacking limit of two, and cannot attack on the same turn that a stack is created, so building up a concentrated assault takes time.  The advanced rules add different movement rules for different unit types and introduce battles which can continue over more than one turn.&#10;&#10;The game is most notable for its map, which is full-color and mounted - highly unusual for a small wargame company at the time.  The map is 21.5&quot;x22.5&quot;.  Besides the map, two rules booklets, and a die, the game contains 110 counters, of which 41 are blanks.&#10;&#10;",
