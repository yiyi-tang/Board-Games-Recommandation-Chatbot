The relationship to Monopoly is so blatant that at the start of the rules (and in the rules' largest font) is this quote: &quot;This game plays similarly to the famous Monopoly game.&quot;&#10;&#10;The board features a rectangular track with spaces for each movie featured in the game (akin to Monopoly properties).  There are also Tombstone Award and Dead or Alive spaces (causing card draws, as with Chance and Community Chest in Monopoly).  Finally, there are Ghoul Agency spaces that allow you to draw and purchase actor cards.&#10;&#10;As you travel around the board, you buy movies and acquire stars.  There are two actors associated with each movie and upon landing on a Ghoul Agency space you draw three actors for possible purchase.  You can attempt to buy any actors who are in a movie that you already own or, if none match, you may still choose to purchase one of the three cards drawn.  The price of an actor card is determined by a roll of the dice, multiplied by a base dollar amount.&#10;&#10;Completing a production (acquiring the movie card and both associated actor cards) requires other plays to pay you a fee if they land on the movie's space on the board (making the actors somewhat like adding houses to a property in Monopoly).  Also, having a completed production allows you to draw a card when you land on an award space.  If you win a major award, you place it on the movie and anyone landing there has to pay you a premium (similar to having a hotel on a property in Monopoly).&#10;&#10;",

The players go around the board, but which leg of the board they're allowed on depends on how far they've risen in the hierarchy yet.  The most visible status symbol is your apartment size --and the competition for the one and only full-size Dacha can be ferocious.  There are a number of other status perks, such as use of the State Car.  All in all, a very amusing game that actually does capture a fair amount of the flavour of life in the communist USSR before its fall.&#10;&#10;The game was invented by Harley Sachs in 1969 under the name POLICE STATE, and sold in England and the USA, even as far as Ireland and South America.  It was copyrighted, patented, and published by the IDEA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (IDEVCO), licensed by Gameophiles and later by the L.A. Producers' Partnership under the name COMRADES.&#10;&#10;It got his second name COMRADES from a BBC documentary series (1983-84), which aired in 1986 in the US. The documentary was about the life of ordinary Soviet citizens, which got interviewed by the producer Richard Denton.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Game of television network battles for ratings. Each player plays one of four semi-fictional TV networks (ABZ, NBZ, ZBS, IND), and the goal is to have the most money when the game ends, after three rounds.&#10;&#10;Players move pawns around a standard square-track board, with spaces that trigger various events: drawing an event (Flash) card, buying a TV show or star, etc. Stars are assigned to shows, shows are assigned to time slots. Shows may be bumped to the next night to accommodate a new show just purchased. Each player goes around the board once, populating his Friday night schedule. Once all players have completed the round, each 30 min slot awards money to the top-rated network, with ex-aequos splitting the money. The process is repeated for Saturday and Sunday. When going around the board again, visiting an owned show space forces a payout to the owner. Finally, the Sunday round is followed by an additional weekend scoring, where the ratings across all three nights are summed and compared. The richest network wins.&#10;&#10;Note that when one rolls doubles, one either moves ahead the full die score, or one goes backward by the single die score. This adds strategy.&#10;&#10;The game was later republished by Avalon Hill as TV Wars (q.v.), but the latter's rules are considerably different.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game of strategy with bluff and tactics for 2-4 players whose object is to eliminate all other players.&#10;&#10;At first glance, this is a Risk knock-off. A closer look reveals a different game.&#10;&#10;For starters, each of the 42 lands can only be occupied by a single token, which act more as visual aids than as armies per se. Combat is card--driven, each player playing from a hand of five cards. There are Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry cards, of various values; you're allowed to play up to one of each kind when attacking or defending. Joker cards can substitute for any given type. You can play your entire hand of five cards if you wish, but you only draw two per turn, so this could leave you exposed.&#10;&#10;Treason cards allow you to take over a non-contiguous land; Desertion cards allow you to get army cards from another player. The Revolution cards are very powerful as they will take over an entire continent! Luckily, there are Counter-Revolution cards in the deck as defense.&#10;&#10;A refreshing change from Risk, and certainly playable in a lot less time.&#10;&#10;",

One player enters words with the blue side up, the other with the red side up. At each move the object is to take the lead and end up with at least one more tile on the board then one&rsquo;s opponent. But words entered on the board are by no means permanent-they may be stolen-which is indeed the main point of the game. Whenever a player is able to change both the form and the meaning of an opponent&rsquo;s word, by substituting one or more letters in the word and/or by adding letters to either end, that player may steal it by turning over all its letters, so a previously blue word becomes a red one, or vice-versa.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player is unable to take the lead on his turn and over-steps the time-limit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game board is a square grid showing a meadow which is enclosed by stables, a river and some trees. The goal of the game is to have the fattest cows (i.e., the cows who ate the most grass, in the form of green plastic chips).&#10;&#10;There are eighteen event chips showing different weather conditions. Sunny weather means the cows are moving around eating grass. Lightning kills all cows standing in the water or under a tree. Cows caught in the rain (i.e. are not in the stables or under a tree) catch a cold and cannot eat in the next turn. If there is dry wind (after a sunny turn), new grass grows. Wind after rain also damages the cattle's health.&#10;&#10;The game has a push your luck element - which locations are safest while offering good grazing grounds? The stables are safe, but the cows don't get fat.&#10;&#10;When all eighteen events have been played, the player with most grass chips is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

He had been so close to victory, so nearly had he trapped and destroyed the Emperor and his forces in the ancient fortress at Karak Varn. But he had been foiled at the last minute by the Emperor&rsquo;s accursed Champions. The same fate had befallen his powerful ally, the Witch Lord, whose Army of the Dead had crumbled following the slaying of their leader.&#10;&#10;Morcar needed some new and subtle means to attack the Empire and weaken its forces before he could lead his armies against them once more. Suddenly his gaze froze and a smile sent ripples through the lines of his ancient face. A plan had come to him.&#10;&#10;A month later, Morcar again sat back to examine the scheme he had set in motion. He had never before considered the ancient race of Ogres as a potential tool. Their undisciplined and random nature made them unreliable as servants and dangerous as allies. However, using the magical arts at his disposal, Morcar had planted one of his Chaos sorcerers, Festral, within the subterranean fortress of the infamous Dirgrusht Ogre clan. Drawing from a magical pool of Chaos power, Festral had subtly taken control of the Ogre clan and started them on a series of raids on the Empire&rsquo;s farmlands. This was only the beginning, for as raids went on, other Ogre clans and Orc tribes came to swell the ranks of this new army.&#10;&#10;Contents.&#10;&#10;A new Quest Book containing 7 new adventures that must be played in sequence with rules for variable Body Points, Chaos Sorcerer Spells (Mind Lock, Dominate and Mind Blast) and new dungeon features.&#10;&#10;7 finely detailed Citadel Miniatures that require assembly featuring:&#10;- 1 Ogre Lord&#10;- 1 Ogre Chieftain&#10;- 1 Ogre Champion&#10;- 4 Ogre Warriors&#10;&#10;New full-colour die-cut game board overlays including:&#10;- 1 new large overground starting tile&#10;- 2 new double-sided room tiles&#10;- 15 Chaos Spell tokens&#10;- 4 Stone Doorways&#10;- 4 Pit of Darkness tokens&#10;- 4 Secret Door tokens&#10;- 6 Fallen Rubble tokens&#10;- 1 Ogre Throne&#10;&#10;Expands&#10;&#10;    HeroQuest&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Their slow climb up the rocky slopes to the foreboding tower at the summit seemed to last an eternity. At last the figures escaped the storm and entered a dark hallway. As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a rocky throne.&#10;&#10;A solitary traveller stepped forward from the huddled and dripping group and addressed the presence on the throne.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;My Lord Morcar, we come bearing grave tidings. We must report the failure of your plan to raise the Ogre Horde against the Empire. Once again we were routed by those accursed Champions and once again we were forced to flee.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the silence.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have learned from my failures. Firstly I have learned not to underestimate the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes. Secondly, I have learned not to rely on fools. I have therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes forever. I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my Lieutenants.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Fanrax the Malicious.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at the group.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Boroush, the Storm Master.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted the refugees.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;And finally, Grawshak, Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers and skulls, carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a greeting or a curse at the party.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you have so miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows.

The campaign game pits most of the players against the one playing the Scarlet Witch King.&#10;&#10;If you liked Divine Right, you'd like Scarlet Empire -- everything that made the first game great is also present in the other.  Mercenaries, special locations, diplomacy, magic, etc.&#10;&#10;Scarlet Empire was supposed to be published by Excalibre Games and made it as far as the advanced play-test stages, but the publisher hemmed and hawed and tried to cut costs, so much so Glen eventually gave up in disgust.

The game is a variation of Nuclear War, The food cards are the warheads and the Phart cards are the delivery system.  There is no propoganda-peace phase though.&#10;&#10;",

It is similar in some ways to Settlers of Catan; here too cities sit at the vertices of hexes, which produce resources.  However, the cities move, and the resources aren't renewable.&#10;&#10;Each player buys a single box containg his colour components; when multiple players meet, the use their combined components.  Most of the tiles make up Earth, but some may be used for the Moon and even Mars.  Cities begin at Tech Level 1, Stone Age; as you explore surrounding hexes to recover the resources, you'll eventually be able to advance in technology to Iron, Coal, Oil, Uranium and Deuterium.  Gold is money.  Advance enough in tech, and your cities can go into orbit and eventually reach the other planets.  Tech also gives you an advantage in city-to-city combat.&#10;&#10;The game is very dynamic, since it is over by the time the last resources are harvested.&#10;&#10;",

From there, play mechanics are reminiscent of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: cards representing potential cult members (a/k/a Sheep) are dealt into a common pool in the middle of the table. Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or &quot;deprogram&quot; (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.&#10;&#10;When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds. If you do successfully end the world, you win; if you fail, you pick a new Doomsday and start gathering a Flock again; if the world hasn't ended by January 1st, 2000, everybody loses.&#10;&#10;The game is DTP quality, with the cards laser-printed on (pre-cut) heavy marbled paper.&#10;&#10;",

This reserves the two letters for your own use. You don't have to say what the word is when you place the boat. (Two boats may be between the same two letters if they point in different directions)&#10;&#10;Once placed, boats may not be moved! When the sand runs out the round is over. Each player in turn spells out their words. Each letter in each word earns you one point. The game lasts four rounds. Most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players take the part of powerful merchants attempting to gain economic prominence throughout the Known Lands.  Gold is earned by using caravans to transport resources (wood, grain, fish, stone, ore, and precious metals) from source locations to demand locations which change dynamically during the game.  Trading is not always peaceful, though, and merchants must hire mercenaries and build warehouses to protect their shipments.  Diplomacy plays a key role as players are free to make all manner deals and treaties with other Merchants, including such things as setting up toll roads or extorting weak trade groups by threatening them.  Mythrole: Merchants is suitable for 2-6 players working alone or in teams, and plays in 2-6 hours, with the length being customizable by choosing the appropriate victory conditions.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A simple card game of empire-building rivalry.&#10;&#10;There are some 15 territory cards rated 1 through 3, some of which are dealt out to the players at the start (each gets a 1 and a 2 territory).  There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.&#10;&#10;When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1&times;, 2&times; or 3&times;) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.&#10;&#10;Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.&#10;&#10;Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.  Plundered cards must be allocated to your territories right away or discarded.&#10;&#10;Cannon can also be used, if rated four or better, to empty one of your territories from its development cards so as to redeploy them - in effect, you are raiding yourself.&#10;&#10;A number of small variant rules are supplied in the rule book.  The cards are printed in French, English and Dutch.&#10;&#10;It is good strategy to build your hand for the end game, so you can, for example, protect a territory with a Revolt, then unprotect it, redeploy Development cards with a strong Cannon, and complete the territory's development with your last few card plays.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;Card Game As d&#039;Or 2001&#10;&#10;",

Only a portion of the tiles are uncovered at the start and the board is different every game.&#10;&#10;Players bid for starting areas and play begins.  &#10;Players search (or discover) terrain (similar to the search process used in 2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt).  This phase also allows players to apply various counters that affect terrain (help themselves or hurt other players) and to discover mines.&#10;Then players use labor that they have procured to build tracks.&#10;Finally, players get paid.  If a player has track to a mine, the railroad services the mine and collects income.  Coal mines pay the least and Gold mines pay the most.&#10;&#10;But watch out for the Dalton Boys or the Clinton gang.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to get a line of three of the same color.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you may do ONE of the following:&#10;&#10;(1) Put a red counter in an empty square.&#10;(2) Replace a red counter with a yellow one.&#10;(3) Replace a yellow counter with a green one.&#10;&#10;So ultimately the board will fill with green counters.&#10;&#10;According to the book &quot;What's your Game&quot; by Michael Cornelius &amp; Alan Parr, the game is a first player win with perfect play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Add-on module for War Galley: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World.&#10;&#10;Salamis, one of the most famous naval battles in history, was a direct result of the Persian need to keep their large, invading army supplied by controlling the sea lanes. With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.&#10;&#10;With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.&#10;&#10;At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.&#10;&#10;To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.&#10;&#10;There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This &quot;action&quot; appears to have been a stand off, with both sides &quot;blockading&quot; and not fighting.&#10;&#10;At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.&#10;&#10;The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.&#10;&#10;Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;",

The board is a map of Europe and of the many areas where the European powers had colonies (Africa, Asia, Carribean, N &amp; S. America).  There are 32 ports depicted on the map and the shipping lanes connecting the ports.  Also in the game are cargo charts - which show what goods are sold in each of the ports, port cards which list the ports and the price to buy the port, destination cards which list a port (some ports have more than 1 card depending on how busy that port was in real life), and cargo cards which represent each of the 9 types of goods in the game, and finally weather and pirate random event cards.&#10;&#10;The game starts by all players drawing destination cards and a cargo card.  You then roll the dice and move your ship from your home port to a port that sells the trade good that you need which you then buy and transport to the destination port.  During the game all ports can be bought and if owned you have to pay a premium to the owner if you use that port.  You win by collecting 150,000.&#10;&#10;",
