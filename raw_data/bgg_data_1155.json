Construct buildings in your name and convince your friends to visit them. Convene surprise committees and focus all the attention on you because it&rsquo;s a race for whomever will have the biggest measurable impact on campus before the end of the school year! Lead a department and assign your student workers to gather resources. Use these resources to complete your department&rsquo;s strategic plans and graduate students to have the biggest measurable impact on-campus. The goal of the game is to earn the most Contribution Points (CP)&#10;&#10;Assets&#10;These four sets of tokens complete Strategic Plans, earn additional student pawns, and graduate alumni. There is a hard limit on how many assets tokens there are (23) and once they are taken no more can be taken from the Public Supply until players return them. These are the four assets: Blue Labor, Red Satisfaction, White Prestige, and Yellow Approval.&#10;&#10;Money&#10;Use Money to construct buildings and enact Strategic Plans. There is no limit to how much money can be in the game. If players must use more than what is provided, keep track in any other way.&#10;Special Regulations&#10;&#10;Strategic Plans&#10;These cards can be held face down or face-up at the discretion of each player. Keeping them confidential ensures other players don&rsquo;t strategically monopolize resources you need. To complete a Strategic Plan, return the asset and money cost from your personal supply to the Public Supply or bank and retrieve the listed reward. Draw from the four face up cards unless instructed otherwise. Always replace a drawn Strategic Plan card with a new Strategic Plan. Put completed Strategic Plan cards under your Department Identity card and these remain secret until the end of the game.&#10;If instructed to reset the Strategic Plans, shuffle the face-up four plans back into the deck and draw four new ones.&#10;&#10;Committees&#10;These will give you benefits or hinder other player&rsquo;s progress. Go to the Alumni Center to play these and discard them after use. Players have a hand limit of 4 Committee cards and must discard down to 4 immediately whenever they exceed this limit. When the draw deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile to create a new one.&#10;&#10;Constructing Buildings&#10;Player 1 chooses a building to discuss. Starting with Player 1 and going clockwise, each player commits any amount of money towards the construction of a new building. Continue to go around until all players are satisfied with their contributions. If the total money committed meets or exceeds the building&rsquo;s listed cost, move all contributed money to the Bank and build the building. Otherwise, return all player&rsquo;s money and discard the building in question.&#10;Continue this until all three buildings have been discussed.&#10;When the draw deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile to create a new one.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The people value a well-rounded leader, so you must establish your legacy by building, taxing, fighting, and accomplishing great deeds.

Stronger advisors earn greater benefits at the cost of performing their action later than other players. Conversely, weaker advisors earn lesser benefits but perform their action quickly. This planning mechanism (&quot;auction programming&quot;) adds a fun tension to the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is your goal to end up as the richest bank of Amsterdam. You do this by earning as much money as you can. Luckily, you have an endless supply of credit to invest!&#10;&#10;The game works like this:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bid against your friends to acquire valuable companies.&#10;     The highest bidder is allowed to invest in the company using their bank credit.&#10;     Using the companies you invested in, produce consumption or production goods.&#10;     Sell the goods to the markets, earn money, and hopefully make a profit!&#10;     But be careful! The more credit is introduced into the economy, the more inflation will rise, causing fluctuating prices. You might not get the return you were counting on and cause a financial crisis...&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lazer is a cute kitty, and as such, loves to chase moving spots of light. To make the game more exciting for her, show her how to change the color by mixing 2 color frequencies with prisms and creating a third color. The player that can mix colors the best will be the winner here.&#10;&#10;Semi-cooperative mode:&#10;&#10;To set up the game the 12 tiles have to be placed on the table in a circle. Laser the cat will be placed randomly onto one of them. After this, the remaining 11 tiles each have to be filled with one prism meeple. The cards showing the color mixing rules have to be placed next to the tiles.&#10;&#10;Each round starts by drawing two prism cards from the deck, these show the next color mixing tasks. The players have 30 seconds to find the solution, that is which meeples (or the cat)  to move how many tiles to a meeple on another tile in order to make the requested colors. After 30 seconds each player shows a number 2 to 10 simultaneously, this indicates that they can solve the task in that many moves. The player with the bid closest to the starting player&rsquo;s bid will join him/her. Without communicating, they have to solve the task by moving the meeples in turns under the indicated number of movements. If they succeed, they receive points equal to the number of movements. The winner is the player with the most points once the round is complete (everybody was starting player once).&#10;&#10;Competitive mode&#10;&#10;Setup is the same as in semi-cooperative mode, except you use the backside of the tiles (depicting 3 different types of floor: wood, stone, carpet) and the prism cards (not only the required color is indicated, but also the type of floor where the mixing is to be to performed ). When the first player claims a number of movements in which he/she can solve the problem, the 30 second countdown starts. In these 30 seconds all the players can decrease the bid by claiming a lower number. After the 30 seconds ends, the player bidding the lowest has to solve both prism cards in as many movements as the bid. If he/she manages to complete it, he/she will score points. If somebody fails 3 times, they will receive minus 6 points. The first player to reach 15 points will win the game.&#10;&#10;",

They collaboratively confer together, then take turns attacking the faction cards in play, intent on eventually eliminating humankind's last remaining strongholds. Meanwhile, the factions offer an ongoing resistance as they strive to establish their game ending survival conditions. Combat is quick, based on stats comparison, yet remains diverse from the wide range of abilities. Game flow is fast paced, yet decisions still have depth, including some deck building undertones. Pick up the game and gather your friends. Do you have what it takes to achieve Gaia's ambition?&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Compete for knowledge, favor and glory as one of the greatest artists the world has ever known! Renaissance Rivals is a 2-4 player card-driven game that can be played in about an hour, combining streamlined tableau and deck building with an innovative system of tactical movement. Players take on the role of artists of the Italian Renaissance as they move around a &quot;map&quot; of Italy (represented by a 4 x 4 grid of cards), using the cards drawn from their decks to obtain Commissions and complete eight unique Masterpieces. On a typical turn, you will draw four cards from your deck to generate Influence points (which allow you to acquire Commission cards) and Advancement points (required to complete your artist&rsquo;s Masterpieces). Every time you acquire a Commission, you must decide whether to add the card to your deck to generate more resources in future turns, or add it to your Palette to unlock the Skills that will enable you to obtain more valuable Commissions and complete more prestigious Masterpieces. Different kinds of Commissions trigger movement in different directions, so you need to be strategic about the order in which you acquire them. Furthermore, each Masterpiece can only be executed in its designated city (or &quot;map&quot; row), so completing all eight will require strategy and foresight!&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player completes all her Masterpieces, or as soon as a player obtains the most highly prized commission, the rebuilding of the Basilica of St. Peter&rsquo;s.  Victory Points are scored for Commissions remaining in each player's deck and for each completed Masterpiece, and the player with the highest total is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The government responds by building a series of defence robots to protect the people. But Japan is too small to store the robots intact, so they must be kept in pieces and re-combined as needed.&#10;&#10;The players work to build a robot out of a variety of components in order to meet the oncoming threat. The main robots form a series of specialities: land, space, ground, air, underwater, female, force, flame, and almighty. But in the game, these parts are inter-changeable into infinite combos. So players try to build the robot with different characteristics by combining parts from all types.&#10;&#10;The game has 12 story cards (the players work to resolve five of the stories), and 48 robot parts. A complete robot has a head, torso, arms and legs. Players are dealt five robot cards at random and then draw and discard cards to try and get a whole robot in their hand that will resolve the story.&#10;&#10;When everyone has a robot prepared, they are shown. the one that scores highest against the target wins the round and takes the story card. The robot parts are shuffled and redealt and the game continues. the winner is the player who gets the most story cards.&#10;&#10;The robot deck includes a computer virus card. If theis is included in the game, it disrupts play by making random changes to a player's hand. Their neighbour discards a card at random from their hand, disrupting their plans.&#10;&#10;The designer intended players to enjoy the experience of building robots like the anime of their childhood. The game can be played by young children by just experimenting with robot combos.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Dice are generated when 4 tile corners meet, aim to place you own colours together. The majority colour generates a die of value equal to the number of that colour segments in the quadrant. Each tile is unique and all possible combinations of coloured corners are represented once. Tiles are double sided and each colour is balanced to have the same odds of drawing a tile with its colour on both sides, one side or none at all! There is also a custom 'action die' that comes into play once a player has generated a die.&#10;&#10;DiTiC plays a bit like chess for 2-4 players. Each level die has its own unique attributes and the game can get quite strategic. 2 players can get through a round in 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A unique engine building board game where you pilot a generation ship to a distant planet. Every turn, you must choose how your crew spends their lives - installing new parts on your ship, working in those facilities to increase the Crew you have available, creating immortal Drones and innumerable Clones to take their place, or resting comfortably with ample time to raise the next generation.&#10;&#10;As your ship approaches the planet, you must carefully balance the needs of your ship with the future needs of your colony. Once the planet is reached, the Crew you have in stasis on your ship will determine which among you can start the most successful colony. &#10;Humanity has a chance for a new start. You could lead what is left of us into a bright future on our new home.&#10;&#10;Each game features a randomized sub-set of available Parts for you ship and Landing Sites that determine scoring. Every game will play differently. Bidding Fuel to outrace the other ships determines what Parts you can buy every turn, while Influence can be used to determine additional rules every ship must adhere to. Simultaneous turns keep the action moving and everyone engaged.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Learning any game system can be daunting, but don&rsquo;t be dissuaded; we use large font sizes to accommodate the eyes and have lots of examples to illustrate the mechanics. Further, we understand that the best way to learn a game system is to be shown you how to play by another person, so we have produced an extensive play-list of &ldquo;boot camp&rdquo; videos, available on YouTube, that walk you through the entire system. And since you&rsquo;ll need to download the Core Rules for FREE in order to get the scenario and walkthrough, you can see how expansive the system really is.&#10;&#10;This WaW85 Starter Kit comes with the fully printed map, 2mm thick counters, and a set of playing cards.&#10;&#10;Requires the World At War 85 Core Rules v2.0 or higher manual to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Not only do you get a host of daemonic minions that serve these rival Chaos Gods, but there are no less than three booklets that introduce new background and rules for both Warhammer Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40,000! Here&rsquo;s what you'll find in the set:&#10;&#10;- 38 Citadel Miniatures, including the following:&#10;&#10;Daemons of Khorne&#10; 1x Karanak, the Hound of Khorne&#10; 10x Bloodletters&#10; 3x Bloodcrushers&#10; 5x Flesh Hounds&#10;&#10;Daemons of Slaanesh&#10; 1x Infernal Enrapturess&#10; 10x Daemonettes&#10; 3x Fiends of Slaanesh&#10; 5x Seekers of Slaanesh&#10;&#10;- A 24-page Wrath and Rapture booklet, describing the endless and ever-shifting dimension utterly devoid of reason and logic that is the Realm of Chaos (if such a thing is even possible). The concept of the Great Game played (and fought) between the Dark Gods is introduced, in which Khorne and Slaanesh are two of the fiercest rivals. There is an entire section of the nature of daemonic names, and there are also three tables of such names for you to generate for your Daemons.&#10;&#10;- A 24-page Denizens of the Warp booklet, which introduces tales of murderous conflicts fought between the daemonic legions of Khorne and Slaanesh in the 41st Millennium. Also included are three Echoes of War missions and a campaign to help you refight these battles, as well as Stratagems and a full set of datasheets for the models included in the box.&#10;&#10;- A 24-page Bane of the Mortal Realms booklet, describing an exciting storyline that led to bitter war between the rival Chaos powers and providing a trio of battleplans to refight them. It also includes full sets of warscrolls for all of the Khornate and Slaaneshi miniatures in the box, as well as their allegiance abilities and warscrolls, and two warscroll battalions.&#10;&#10;- A double-sided token sheet containing two 9&quot; range rulers, a Prey of the Blood God marker (used to identify Karanak's prey), Khornate and Slaaneshi wound markers, and six numbered objective markers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
