No dice are involved. The only random element of the game is the decision at the beginning of each phase which player goes first. The player with the highest number of territories at the end of the game, is the winner.&#10;&#10;It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules. However, this is deceptive, for the game requires good grasp of strategy in both phases.&#10;&#10;For complete rules and additional information see Revaler&rsquo;s website on Farlander http://www.revaler.ee/&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The map is a point-to-point map, using city-states and the common land and navigable sea routes as the conduits that defined the Grecian Mediterranean. The game is designed for simple movement and combat mechanics to resolve battles and sieges, all centered upon the predominance of famous and historic leaders (e.g., Alcibiades). The game is richly historic, and keeps players within historic parameters in such a way that alliances and politics can shift, depending on how the war is going, but only within the limits of historic possibilities. Some city-states of the Delos Confederation may ally with Athens, while others may ally with Sparta, for example. Athens vs Sparta includes four scenarios: The Archidamian War (431 - 422), The Peace of Nicias and the Sicilian Expedition (421 &ndash; 413), The Ionian War (412 &ndash; 404), and the campaign scenario covering the entire war.&#10;&#10;The game includes one 22x34&quot; map of the Grecian Mediterranean, including Sicily and southern Italy, and as far east as the Persian empire, 280 counters of all participants in the Peloponnesian War. Each game turn is played as four seasons of one year. Each inch equals ~18 miles. One naval strength point represents 5 galleys of the era (Triremes), and one land strength point represents 350 to 450 heavy infantry (Hoplites) or 500 to 600 light infantry or 200 to 300 cavalry.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters.&#10;&#10;",

And, security must work together to spot the fake using clues in the subtle size differences in the diamonds. But be careful! There are also burglars hiding among the security. Don't let them fool you in the discussion...!&#10;&#10;The Diamond Swap combines trying to spot the difference and tricking your opponents. All 30 diamond chips are slightly different in size. In this identity-concealing type game, you are divided into two groups: the burglars whose mission is to deceive, and security, who needs to see through the subtle size changes after the diamond swap.&#10;&#10;The player who draws the &quot;burglar&quot; card steals one of the five authentic diamonds in the center and secretly replaces it with a fake from their hand. All within the time the security guards are counting to 10 with their eyes closed. After everyone has opened their eyes, as a group, everyone has to deduce which diamond has been swapped. Though, the differences in sizes are hard to distinguish.&#10;&#10;In the midst of all this guesswork, the burglar tries to deceive the security guards and lead them astray. Sometimes the burglar isn&rsquo;t alone, and has partners in crime to help with to disrupting deductions. Can security avoid being deceived by the burglars and reveal the diamond that&rsquo;s been swapped?&#10;&#10;",

And in the saloon, sticks are some-times used to attack one another.&#10;&#10;GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;There are two ways to win: &#10;&#10;     The player collects victory points. You get one victory point in exchange for five bananas. Once a player has collected five victory points, they win the game. &#10;     The player collects symbols. Each character card shows a certain combination of three symbols (stone / water / coconut) located at the top of their character card. A player wins as soon as they have collected their three symbols. These symbols are activated by playing coresponding action cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;So if you are the first to collect five victory points or the three matching symbols on your character card, you win the game.&#10;&#10;How to Play &#10;Phase 1: Draw a reward card &#10;The player who monkeys around the most begins. They draw any one reward card in the display in Phase 1 of which they see only the front side. However, they receive the reward on the front and the previously hidden back side of the reward card. The drawn reward card then must laid on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Phase 2:&#10;In Phase 2 the Player can choose between the following options: Activate action card, play an effect, disable action card&#10;&#10;The character cards &#10;There are six different characters. Each character card shows a combination of symbols for the symbol victory at the top. As soon as a player has activated the action cards with all the corresponding symbols, they win the game. Under the symbols the character is pictured with the respective special effect. The special effect can only be played once in the entire game. It can be done anytime during your own turn. To do this, the player places the character card face up in front of them for the rest of the game, so that the symbols are also revealed.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;Once a player has five victory points or their combination of three required symbols in front of them, they win the game. It is also possible that four symbols are laid out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Ihr seid Affen im Wilden Westen und versucht euch gegen die anderen Affen durchzusetzen.

It is a mystery solving game that combines three main elements:&#10;1) A modern mystery story written by professional crime author Arttu Tuominen. 2) Finding details from a &quot;Hidden image&quot; picture. 3) More or less classic puzzle solving. The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.&#10;Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.&#10;The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;&#10;The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story. These can be skipped by parents playing with their children (12+), as long as they are aware such exist in the game.&#10;&#10;Challenge Level 3/5&#10;&#10;",

The players are trying to save different species of whales from extinction.&#10;&#10;From the introduction:&#10;&#10;&quot;Very few games are based on cooperation.  However, in this game, all players work together, trying to save eight Whales.  Your goal is to beat THE SYSTEM - the worldwide forces which are causing our great Whales to become endangered species and extinct.&#10;&#10;&quot;The only way you can really 'win' this game is to save all eight Whales.  However, this is a game of fun, so enjoy yourself while trying to do the very best you can.  As you play, you'll discover various strategies you cause to SAVE THE WHALES.  Naturally, the more you play, the better you'll become.&quot;  (End quote.)&#10;&#10;The game comes with a board, pewter miniatures of eight different whales and a ship, 42 cards comprising two different &quot;chance&quot; decks, and two six-sided dice with the '1' replaced by a picture of a whaling ship.  There are also various chits and a rulebook, which also contains a lot of information about whales, and how to find out more.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game that one probably doesn't admit to owning in public.  Monogamy is a two player game meant for committed couples to get to know each other better.&#10;&#10;Some alcohol and your partner and you're ready to start.  You move a playing piece around a board and land on squares which involve kissing, drinking, taking clothes off, or taking a card which asked the partner something about themselves or reveals something about you.  Every time you complete the board once you move up a level and the questions, and the kissing become more intimate.&#10;&#10;The game starts slow and warms up very nicely.  Not at all tacky although it gets quite exciting at the end!  It is really good to find an adult game not aimed at large numbers of drunken party-goers but at improving the romance and sex-life of a committed couple.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the rule book: A Hot Affair will have you loving, laughing and lusting after each other with just a few throws of the die. It all begins with a loving gaze into each other's eyes. The last to blink throws the dice to start the game!&#10;&#10;As you progress round the board, the questions become more intimate &amp; the challenges more steamy.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you'll experience new, exciting and occasionally hilarious challenges with stimulating, sexy and wild conversations.&#10;&#10;The game climaxes with the winner choosing to make real one of fifty breathtaking fantasies!&#10;&#10;A Hot Affair brings back the art of fun, laughter and lust through a game so neither of you needs to be the instigator. It really does lead to the feeling that you are having an affair... but with your partner!&#10;&#10;The other great thing about the game is it can be played on a number of different levels, depending on how you both feel. If you just feel like a romantic and fun night, you can play with the first two levels; if you are both feeling a little more romantic, just shuffle the fantasy cards and have fun! With over 400 ideas at three progressive levels and 50 scenarios, the game can be enjoyed over and over!&#10;&#10;",

At the top of the cards there are one or more small icons of dino&rsquo;s that can be defeated by that dino card. In DinoBattle every player receives four dino cards, and the player whose turn it is has to act on the last played dinosaur.&#10;&#10;The smallest scavengers are eaten by the medium sized hunters. Medium sized hunters are in turn eaten by the bigger dinos that also eat each other or can be defeated by smaller dinos working together well. Even the biggest dinos are not safe, because the meteorite can be fatal for them and thus mark a new beginning for the scavengers.&#10;After playing a card, the player replenishes his hand, unless the player failed to play a card that fitted the previous dino card. In that case the player plays on with a hand with one card less. The game ends when a player cannot play his last card, and the player with the most cards in hand wins the game. In case of a draw, the winners play a knock out round until one winner is left.&#10;It is also possible to play multiple rounds. In that case, each remaining hand card counts as 1 point, and the game ends when a player has 10 points or more.&#10;&#10;The basic game of DinoBattle is already very playable for children from 8 years, but the game contains optional cards that can make the game more challenging and interesting for older players&#10;and veterans.&#10;The survival cards offer each player a second chance and give players the possibility to survive for longer in though situations. There are three different survival cards, each with two different options that can offer salvation.&#10;Event cards add new tactical elements and offer players the possibility to achieve a unique advantage over the other players. These cards are face up on the table, visible for all players. Each player can use one event card during his turn. Used event cards are no longer available for other players. Which event card can be played depends on the dino card that is on top of the discard pile.&#10;When these optional cards are used, it is no longer possible to play another card than the askes card.&#10;&#10;If you cannot play a matching card, you are out of the game for this round. The last remaining player wins the round, and the player who wins the most rounds, wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Thus, while one player would prefer to go to cultural places, another wants more adventurous options.&#10;&#10;Gather points by convincing the group to add your favorite destination to the list! It won't be easy because in Jalan-Jalan everybody has an equal voice to vote where to go, but with action cards you can (possibly) shift the outcome in your favor. Remember that this is your vacation, too, so make sure you enjoy it the most!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Vault Assault (originally announced as Hucking Heist) is a fast-paced &quot;cops &amp; robbers&quot; dice game for 2-4 players aged 8+ taking 10-20 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players take turns alternating between the roles of cops and robbers; the robbers will try to steal as much money as possible, and the cops will try to arrest the robbers before they escape.&#10;&#10;Using their set of dice, the robbers will attempt to cut the bank's alarm and steal the precious diamonds. Then they will continue to steal as much money as possible by tearing through the safety-deposit boxes, and loading up their getaway cars. Although they can use hostages to keep the cops at bay for a short period, eventually they will have to gather their loot and escape as fast as possible.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile the cops, using their unique dice, will attempt to foil the robbers' plans by cleverly hiding the alarm's weak point, setting traps, and securing the diamonds. Then the cops will be rolling their dice to complete mosaics signaling the completion of each stage in the heist&mdash;from fueling up at the donut shop, to getting dispatched in their cars, to surrounding the bank, and finally arresting the robbers before they can escape.&#10;&#10;After a set number of rounds, the game ends and players add up the value of their safety-deposit boxes along with any diamonds they have stolen. The player/team with the most valuable loot wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&#239;&#187;&#191;The Challenge is a card game of deadly combat and formidable magics. (It is clearly a knockoff of Mayfair's Encounters, though it never mentions that fact.) Action is fast paced and tension-filled as characters exchange blows, fire spells, and even attempt to backstab. It is the fantasy battle at its best. &#10;More than simply hack and slash, strategy IS the key to victory, with cunning and skill playmg a central role in your success. Game play is an exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, as &#239;&#187;&#191;treaties and trickery can make all the difference between victory and defeat. &#10;While The Challenge is easy to learn (start playing in less than 15 minutes), it has a depth far beyond that of the typical card game. With its excitment filled, strategy oriented, fullthrottled action, The Challenge is sure to become a classic. If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;&#10;The player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced). Remember, you can't do two defensive turns back-to- back.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Keep Running! is a quick-playing game based around the legendary tale of the two guys being chased by a bear in the woods. One of them briefly pulls up, grabs a pair of running shoes from his backpack and hastily throws them on. &quot;What are you doing? You'll never outrun it!&quot; yells the guy who is still moving. &quot;I don't need to outrun the bear,&quot; replies the first (who by now has rapidly overtaken his friend). &quot;I just need to outrun YOU.&quot;&#10;&#10;Between three and eight players will be able to force and fight their way to the front of the pack, leaving their friends behind as The Bear gets ever closer. Each player has a rapidly diminishing hand of cards and one must be played every turn. Roll a die to see how fast you're going, but don't forget the modifier on the card you've put down! Some cards allow you to get more in your hand, keeping you in the game longer. Others will let you attack your opponents, pushing them ever closer to that ever-chasing bear. Run out of cards and you're no longer running &ndash; you're dinner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game designed to simulate a tavern brawl.&#10;Each player receives 3 characters with different powers, a little money, 30 hit points and the 9 weapon cards.&#10;Before the first turn, each player chooses one of his characters that will be played until that character has lost all hit points. Then he'll use any one of the two remaining until they suffer the same fate, upon which he'll use his last character.&#10;&#10;The turn is divided in 4 segments. All players undertake a segment before any begins the following segment.&#10;&#10;The 4 segments are:&#10;- &quot;D&eacute;pensez vos butins&quot; (expense your loot) where you can buy some of the &quot;big&quot; weapons cards and add them to your hand (the small ones are ALWAYS in your hand)&#10;- &quot;Pr&eacute;parez vos esquives&quot; (prepare your dodges) where you put on your character, face up, any of the weapons you bought, up to the prestige (fame) value of your character&#10;- &quot;Attaquez&quot; (attack) where each player chooses a weapon in hand and say who he attacks (players at his side for contact weapons, other players with ranged weapons)&#10;- &quot;Videz vos querelles&quot; (end your quarrels) where attacks are resolved. An attack is dodged if the defensive player has correctly found the value of the attack coming. A successful attack make the defensive character lose some of his HP, and the attacking character win prestige or loot.&#10;&#10;In plus of the weapons card, there are other cards that players can use to affect the game.&#10;&#10;If a player arrives at 5 in prestige, he can call the militia that will end the game. If a character becomes KO by losing all his Hit Points, its player takes his next character.&#10;&#10;A player can come in the game, or leave, at any moment. The game is prepared for that occurence.&#10;&#10;La Taverne de la Licorne (tavern of the unicorn) is a light hearted tavern, in opposition of La Taverne de la Crypte, which is a tavern with undead and horrors.&#10;Both games are decorated with cartoon art and can be combined.&#10;&#10;",

The board simulates an old map and is divided into four trading regions, each with multiple ports.  Each region sells a different spice and the market price is controlled by card play.  However, an &quot;expert price&quot; can be obtained by guessing the identity of a mystery spice.  The game actually comes with around twenty small containers of real spices that get thrown into a bag.  If a player is trying to get an expert price, he picks one container  at random, opens it, sniffs it, and guesses what it is from a list of common and not so common spices.&#10;&#10;This is not the main aspect of gameplay, but it does spice it up, so to speak.  It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.&#10;&#10;Title translates to &quot;The Spice Route&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Legal actions include body, hand, and foot checks, passes, and actual goal shots.  Illegal actions, or actions requiring a penalty check, include striking with the ball or elbow, shooting the player with the ball, and all-out assaults.  The usual result of such body contact is a high player turnover rate.  The player's body armor does not guarantee physical safety from opposing players or from the ball itself.  If the game gets too rough or a fight occurs, Heartless Huey is released.  This invulnerable robot will incapacitate the nearest player.

But when it formed, it instantly became an exit point &ndash; a extra focus &ndash; for every wormhole in the entire galactic octant; the same wormholes used for interstellar travel by every starfaring species. Soon, a human starship found the Nexus, by the simple process of noticing the alternate exit point while traversing one of those wormholes. The commercial and navigational value of the nexus was obvious, and the humans began exploiting the asteroid field surrounding the exit point. They hollowed out the largest asteroid creating the core module in preparation for building a full-blown space station.&#10;&#10;Led by those same wormholes, other starships soon showed up. Then more. Now all alien civilizations want access to the Nexus. Rather than see bloodshed, the humans, ensconced in place, offered to let all share the Nexus peacefully. The humans would build the space station modules, ensuring compatibility, but the aliens would purchase and own the modules themselves. In effect, the aliens became outside investors &ndash; potentially controlling investors &ndash; thus Startropolis was born!&#10;&#10;You are the alien CEO of one of these galactic corporations, and your masters have given you seed money. What will you purchase? A solar power monopoly? Luxury habitats? Will you outperform your competition, and prove your dominance?&#10;&#10;Startropolis is a modular 3-D space station game for 2-4 people. Each turn, players buy modules and connect them to the existing space station. This creates revenue, and allows them to purchase more modules. The player with the most credits at game end wins.&#10;&#10;",

A potion consisting of ingredients in the same color earns your extra bonus points.&#10;&#10;Magic cards allow you to break the rules and influence the game, specifically by having effects such as taking an extra turn, switching ingredients with opponents, and looking at (or even stealing) cards.&#10;&#10;",

Cultists around the globe are mobilizing, preparing the Seals to open the Gates, hearkening the Elder Gods return. Their goal, to usher in the Age of Madness! Will you heed the Master&rsquo;s Call?&#10;&#10;Cthulhu: Age of Madness (C:AoM) is a competitive strategy card game for 2-4 players, each assuming the role of Cultists of an Elder God. Azathoth, Cthulhu , Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth are commanding their minions to unlock the four Seals, open the Cosmic Gate, and create the path for your Elder God to cross the Void and reign Madness upon humanity. Will you be the first to usher in the Age of Madness?&#10;&#10;Each player chooses an Elder God Card, and places it in front of them. A Player is chosen to be the dealer, shuffles, and deals 5 cards to each Player. The Player to the Dealers left plays first, and play continues clockwise.  On your turn, you perform 2 Actions, and then draw. Actions include playing a card, Sacrificing a Cultist, or Exchanging Cards. A &ldquo;Pass&rdquo; is also a valid Action.&#10;&#10;Play a Cultist - Play any Cultist to your Pool. Matched Cultists are grouped together.&#10;Play an Elder Sign - Elder Sign unlocks a Seal; Place it on your Elder God, activating its Cosmic Primal Power.&#10;Play a Power Card - Powers are played to the Discard, with the Target chosen by the Player.&#10;Play an Advantage Card - Advantages are played directly to your Pool.&#10;Play an Eldritch Power Card - Eldritch Powers are played to the discard pile, with the Target chosen by the Player.&#10;Sacrifice a Cultist - Send a Cultist from your Pool to the Discard, gaining an instant Convert Cultist Power.&#10;Exchange Cards - A Player can choose to discard their entire hand, or a portion thereof, and redraw to their current Maximum Hand Size (usually 5). This counts as both Actions.&#10;&#10;After all Actions have been completed, draw until you have five cards in your hand, and play continues to the left.&#10;Grouping 4 Cultists of your Elder God, in your Pool, unlocks a Seal. Move these cards to your Elder God Card, activating its Cosmic Primal Power.  When all 4 Seals have been unlocked, your Elder God&rsquo;s Gate opens, and you win the game. Congratulations for ushering in the Age of Madness!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players receive two random cards at the beginning of the game and on each turn players can either gain an additional card (optionally discarding it to draw again), swap a card in the player's hand with the top card of the discard pile, stand (take no cards), or junk (fold). Players do this in turn, and at the end of each round the dice are rolled. If the symbols match then everyone's hand is discarded, players are dealt the same amount of new cards that they discarded, and play continues.&#10;&#10;At the end of three rounds, the player whose score is closest to 0 wins the game. There are several winning hands ranked in a hierarchy that can be assembled similar to poker. For example, Pure Sabacc (both zero cards and no other cards) or Full Sabacc (a hand of +10, +10, -10, -10, and 0).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Hasami shogi is a traditional Japanese game played on a shogi-ban, i.e., a 9&times;9 grid of spaces, using the fhuyo (&quot;pawns&quot;) from a shogi set (and as such this game should not be considered a Shogi Variant as the capture rules differ greatly.  The pieces initially occupy the entire back row, i.e., the row of spaces nearest the controlling player.  As in shogi, the sides are called sente (&quot;black&quot;) and gote (&quot;white&quot;) with sente going first, but the colors associated with the names are purely conventional.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to capture either five or eight of an opponent's pieces, as agreed upon before starting the game.  An opponent's piece is taken by custodial capture, i.e., by being sandwiched horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) between a player's own pieces.  A piece must be moved into such a postion immediately on either side of an opponent's piece to make a capture, but multiple captures can be made simultaneously.  This occurs only if a piece is moved so that it causes more than one enemy piece to be positioned between the piece moved and another of the player's own pieces.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Feed the Shoggoth is a fast and furious card game, in which players each control a different cult faction, facing a very angry and hungry Shoggoth in the middle of the table. To earn points and win the game, the players attempt to sacrifice Minions from their cult to the Shoggoth (bad news for Minions, but what do you expect when you join an evil cult?). However, the Shoggoth is indiscriminate in who it eats; if you can't feed the Shoggoth on your turn with a Minion, it eats you, and you're out of the game!&#10;&#10;During your turn, if the Shoggoth is in front of you, you have the ability to sacrifice on Minion from your hand. The other Cult Leaders at the table can attempt to disrupt your sacrifice by casting spells to move the Shoggoth away from you, stealing Minions from your hand, or any one of many dastardly methods (Rival Cult Leaders are insidious that way).&#10;&#10;If the active player is still able to keep the Shoggoth in front of them during their sacrifice phase, the Minion is gobbled up, the player earns a point token, the Shoggoth moves to the player to the left, and the active player draws back up to their hand limit.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the first player to reach the victory point goal (determined how many players are participating), or the last player standing.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the works of HP Lovecraft; those players who are familiar with either the stories of HPL and/or the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game will recognize many of the names and terms on the cards. However, this isn't yet another game with the name &quot;Cthulhu&quot; tacked on at the end (and in fact, Cthulhu himself never directly makes an appearance in the game). The theme has been interwoven into the game play itself.&#10;&#10;",

Each round the players flip over a card one by one. If a shark is revealed, a player has to turn another card until a numbered fish is revealed. Shell tokens are moved to the sandbank tile.&#10;&#10;If after revealing the cards a shark card is face up, the shark eats the highest numbered fish (both cards are discarded). The player who turned over the highest numbered fish collects all shell tokens, the fish card, and all cards of the same species (if present).

The goal is to use the natural resources available (Oil, Coal and Uranium) to earn as much money as possible. Money is mainly gained by having factories, but factories need energy and they pollute. To create energy you need power plants, to run the plants you need natural resources which are limited. When creating the energy you also pollute and this you must compensate by cleaning the environment, but to do this you must have energy.&#10;&#10;So all in all, this is a resouce management game.

Give them a wink. Caribou? Pull your tongue out. Be discreet because at any moment your opponents can catch you and steal your points. Speed, observation, grimaces, and laughs are plenty in this crazy party game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A children's trick-taking card game of racing pirate ships around a series of islands to reach the treasure.  The card play is straightforward with four suits, called trump, and following lead suit.  The number of tricks won determines how many spaces a ship moves, but certain spaces move your ship forward or backward, limit your movement, or force you to take the long way around an island; therefore, there are times when you may not want to win as many tricks as you would be able.  Landing on an opponent's ship sends them back to the closest harbor.  The first ship to land on the treasure wins!&#10;&#10;",
