Wrangel and his 25,000 men were evacuated from Novorisisk in March 1920, later reforming and re-supplied by the British. The Red 13th army was responsible for Wrangel's containment, as well as the Communist's attempt to break through to Sevastopol. In April, both sides tried in vain to achieve their goals.&#10;&#10;Wrangel's forces were not numerically as strong as the 13th Army, but their morale, as well as skillful use of tanks and aircraft, returned the balance of power to their favor. By May 1920, Wrangel had up to 20 operational tanks and an equal number of DH9A bombers. Their tankers and pilots trained since March, and learned well the lessons taught by their British advisors in combined arms tactics.&#10;&#10;During the battle, both sides fought tenaciously, but it was the use of tanks and aircraft that tipped the scales. The DH9A bombers faced little Red air opposition and &#239;&#172;&#130;ew constant missions over the front. The tanks were massed into a hammering force for a breakthrough. All of these lessons were ignored by Wrangel's former superior, General Denikin, a year earlier. To supplement the attack, Wrangel also had several divisions land along the Black Sea coast, which was weakly held by the Communists. By June 12th, the Communist 13th Army lost 8,000 men and was &#239;&#172;&#130;eeing to the protection of the Dniepr River. Wrangel, lost nearly the same amount and exploiting the White victory was not easy. The Reds counter-attacked a few days later and brie&#239;&#172;&#130;y retook Melitopol. Eventually, the&#10;&#10;Whites recaptured the city and the lines became static, with neither side having the strength to overcome the other.&#10;&#10;Components &#10;(High Flying dice edition):&#10;&#10;    Four 11&quot; x 17&quot; map sections&#10;    Two sheets of 280 playing pieces&#10;    One Players' Aid Sheet&#10;    One, 12 page rule book&#10;&#10;&#10;(Firefight edition):&#10;&#10;    one 11 x 17 map&#10;    280 DTP counters&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This makes one of the other players IT.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game players will be installing, stealing and interfering with each other&rsquo;s Upgrades. Upgrades give each player additional abilities such as alternative ways of moving their robots, increasing their hand size and any of up to 30 special powers.&#10;&#10;Special Trigger cards add to the excitement as players wrest turn order from each other, steal upgrades from one another and basically sabotage their opponents.&#10;&#10;Playground tag was never quite like this!&#10;&#10;",

The cards tell the story of 8 thieves, each story consists of 5 parts. All parts are shuffled. Now, on a turn, a player can take 1 pile and look at the top 3 cards, choosing one of them (he doesn't have to take a card). As soon as someone has all 5 pieces of one story together, he wins the game. The problem is, that you have to take the parts in the right order, you don't know what parts the other players have (the parts 1 &amp; 2 are all three times available, 3 two times, the 4th and 5th part only once), so you have to memorize the right stacks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "10 Scenarios covering the 37th (Buckeye) Infantry Division on New Georgia and Bougainville in 1943-44.&#10; Hill 700, Bougainville, March9,1944. &#10;The fanatic Japanese attack resulted in a slim but dangerous penetration. The Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment had captured several strategic positions on the crest of Hill 700, including seven pillboxes, and had moved light and heavy machine guns into the American trenches and pillboxes. Now the Japanese were in position to put fire on the American supply routes beyond the hill. The Japanese would have to be thrown off the hill &mdash; the only question was how. &#10;On the morning of March 9, the Buckeyes launched several scattered counterattacks with no results. At noon, the 145th Infantry made its first major effort, sending elements of two battalions up the hills with tank support. However, the tanks could not operate on the hill and the Buckeyes could only seize a few pillboxes. Air and artillery bombardment, including point blank fire,could not dislodge the Japanese. At 1700 on March 10, the two battalions attacked again, making some progress, but on March 11 the Japanese counterattacked, taking another pillbox at heavy expense. The 145th&rsquo;s commander, Colonel Whitcomb, was relieved for &ldquo;extreme battle fatigue&rdquo;. &#10; New Georgia Island, July 18, 1943.&#10;The American assault on New Georgia was spearheaded by the 43rd ID, with the Buckeyes of the 37th ID in reserve. The 43rd ID, as untried as the 37th, ran into difficulties in its drive towards Munda Airfield and began to fall apart. The 37th ID was committed in mid-July. However, in addition to stopping the American advance, Japanese General Noburo Sasaki sent infiltrating units to cut the Munda Trail, which served as the tenuous U.S. supply line from the far away beachhead. One group of Japanese hit the rear-echelon defenders of a supply and ammo dump at Parachute Drop, defended by the newly arrived Ammunition and Anti-Tank Platoons of the 1st Battalion, 145th Infantry.&#10; Mark Pitcavage's Buckeyes!:&#10;The 37th (Buckeye) Infantry Division on New Georgia and Bougainville in 1943-44&#10;The Pacific Theater at its Best&#10;&#10;",

The objects are to capture the opposing Duke, capture territory, and capture buildings. Parliament, when captured, can be relocated to any available area on the board. Capturing the opposing Duke wins the game immediately. If neither Duke is captured, when no more buildings may be legally played the player capturing the most territory wins.&#10;&#10;The publisher also included rules for a solitaire version.&#10;&#10;According to the designer, fewer than 100 copies were produced.&#10;&#10;",

This was used by Dr Andrew Millard and Prof. Terry Tao as the basis for an actual card game. The complete rules and design of this game were posted on USENET around 1993. It contains elements of blackjack and poker.&#10;&#10;The rules as posted on USENET were approved by Pratchett himself.&#10;&#10;The most notable aspect of the game is that it requires an eight-suited card deck: a deck using the normal suits (clubs, hearts, spades, and diamonds) must be shuffled together with a deck using the Spanish (and Tarot) suits (staves, swords, cups, and coins) yielding a complete deck with eight suits.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a hand of ten cards: five cards are dealt face-down to each player, and the player may then discard up to four of them, receiving new cards to replace them. Then a further five cards are dealt face-up to each player except the dealer, who receives his face-down. The first player begins by assembling his or her cards into one of the winning groupings described below, and displaying them. The next player must then create a more valuable grouping or fold. If the player is successful in creating a more valuable grouping, the original first player may try again to create an even more valuable grouping for themselves, or fold. This process passes left around the table until only one player remains, who then wins the hand.&#10;&#10;",

The other progenitor game for Dong Wu Qi is Lu Zhan Jun Qi and it would be accurate to describe Dong Wu Qi as a hybrid between Dou Shou Qi and Lu Zhan Jun Qi.&#10;&#10;In brief, the 8 kinds of animals in Dou Shou Qi are doubled for each player and pieces are placed face down on the board as in Lu Zhan Jun Qi rather than face up as in Dou Shou Qi. The board has similarities with Lu Zhan Jun Qi, with safe areas for animals to move into, and a base at each end of the board which the opponent is trying to get an animal into. The hierarchy of pieces is the same as in Dou Shou Qi, with the Elephant as the strongest piece, but susceptible to the Mouse.&#10;&#10;Play is as in Lu Zhan Jun Qi - pieces are known only to their owner and combat (when a piece moves onto another) is resolved by a third person acting as a referee.&#10;&#10;Unlike the traditional games of Dou Shou Qi and Lu Zhan Jun Qi, which many companies manufacture, Dong Wu Qi appears only to be made by one or two companies - currently, Da Fu Weng (Uncle Wang) produces this game.&#10;&#10;",

For now they may be listed as the source only of Narrow - possibly in the same field that contains that game name, e.g. &quot;Narrow from Yi Qi Intellectual Toys&quot;. Since I have not read their actual rules, I cannot say whether that game is an illegal copy/translation of mine, or a distinct game that belongs on a separate page.

    "Description": "&quot;Planetenspiel&quot; or &quot;Planets Game&quot;&#10;&#10;In a galaxy far far away, 7 suns are orbited by 2 planets each. These planets are home to the Plonx and the Quirx, who both feel they are the better tribe. The more common galactic option to prove superiority, open warfare, has been abandoned. Instead both tribes go head to head in an annual contest, using their ability to manipulate the speed with which their tribe's planets turn around the suns. The tribe that is most skillful at manipulating the planets in such a way that it manages to establish contact between tribe-members on neighboring planets most often, wins the tournament and gains the brag rights for that year.&#10; This is a highly abstract space game for 2 players that is a slight step away for a designer that is better known as a safe pair of hands for decent children's and family games. Manfred Ludwig shows here he can be equally at home with challenging the more abstract gamer as within its simplicity lies an engaging little dice less strategy game that isn't spectacular, but works surprisingly well.&#10;&#10;The board shows a large sun on each corner of a hexagonal, and a seventh sun right in the middle of it. Another 3 lines are drawn that divide the hexagonal in 6 equal pizza slices. Then 6 planets are placed at equal distance in circular orbits around each sun, in such a way that the planets closest to a foreign sun are directly facing a planet of that sun. These are the possible meeting points.&#10;&#10;Each player get 5 contact chips and places one tribe planet around each sun on the prescribed starting places. Then, in turn, each player moves one own planet. When a player ends a move by making &quot;contact&quot; with another planet of the own tribe, that player  claims one contact-chip of the opponent. The first player to own all chips wins the tournament.&#10;&#10;Movement follows a strict pattern. Each player can only move one (own) planet each turn. The first player moves a planet exactly one space clockwise, the other player gets to move two spaces. Then moves of three, four and five spaces follow, and when a player has moved five spaces, the whole sequence gets repeated, starting with one. Planets can overtake each other, but moves that would result in planets landing on each other are blocked and force a player to move one of the other planets instead. In the rare cases that a player cannot move any own planets, the opponent gets to move instead.&#10;&#10;Publishing history: this abstract game appeared in the German game magazine P&ouml;ppel-Revue (1987/2 April-MAY) as that edition's &quot;Das Spiel im Heft&quot;. A pull-out board and rules were provided, players still needed to supply their own pieces (2x7 pawns and 10 contact-chips).&#10;&#10;",

Reset card:  have 4 different kinds of cards&#10;   a) 8 CARD: Reset the number to 8.&#10;   b) PRIME CARD: Reset the number to any prime number, eg.2,3,5,...89,97.&#10;   c) 3 CARD: Reset the number to the multiple of 3. eg. 3,6,9,...,99.&#10;   d) 0,64,100 CARD: Reset the number to 0, 64 or 100.&#10;&#10;2. Functions card: contains 5 kinds of cards.&#10;   a)MULTIPLE CARDS(x2, x3, x5, x10) : Each of difficult cards multiple the number to x2, x3, x5, x10. Eg. the number on table is 14. You can play x5 to change the number to 70. But you cannot play x10 because it is out of the range 0-100.&#10;   b)DIVISOR CARDS(/2, /3, /5, /10) : Each of difficult cards divided the number to /2, /3, /5, /10.&#10;   c)ADDITION or SUBTRACTION CARDS(+1, -3): Add or subtract the number same as the number on the card.&#10;   d) SQUARE CARDS(X^2, X^(1/2), X^3, X^(1/3)): Square the number follow the card. eg. you use the card &quot;X^2&quot; to change the number from 8 to 64. Then the player next to you can use the card &quot;X^(1/3)&quot; to make the number 64 to 4.&#10;   e)LOG CARD (log, log^-1): To log or log^-1 the number.&#10;&#10;Beside two kinds of cards in function, there are 2 different color backgrounds on the side of the function.&#10;BLACK BACKGROUND: The function cards except &quot;addition or subtraction card&quot;.&#10;BLUE BACKGROUND: The reset cards and &quot;addition or subtraction card&quot;(function cards)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Are you a food lover who likes trivia games or a trivia game lover who likes food? Whichever you are you'll love The Original Food Lover's Trivia game! This is the first game of its kind dedicated solely to food trivia. The game features 1,800 questions in the categories of Beverages, Geography and Culture, Ingredients, Recipes, Food People and Food Arts &amp; Science. Game play is not confined to a game board, players gather their game pieces and get comfortable wherever they want to play! Teams of chefs are challenged by opposing teams of guests with trivia questions all about food. Players start with full plates and the winners are the first ones to Clean his Plate.&#10;&#10;1. The starting chefs roll a 6-colored die.&#10;2. The next team in line (the guests), draw a card and ask the question matching the color that the chefs have rolled on the die. The timekeeper starts the sand timer once the question has been read and understood.&#10;3. If the chefs answer the question correctly, and before the timer runs out, then the chefs remove the matching color food chip from their &quot;plate&quot;. That &quot;food&quot; (chip) is now considered &quot;eaten&quot; and the chefs roll again. &quot;Eaten&quot; chips should be returned to the game box or set-aside. Used cards are returned to the card boxes. Chefs must continue to answer questions matching the color they roll, even if they have already &quot;eaten&quot; the chip for that color category.&#10;4. If the chefs give a wrong answer, then their turn is over, and play progresses in a clockwise direction to the next chefs in line.&#10;5. The first chefs to &quot;Clean Your Plate by &quot;eating&quot; all of their chips are the winners of DINNERTIME!&#10;&#10;Over 40 recipes and party ideas are included so that the game can be played with edible game pieces in the game options; Play With Your Food, Potlucky, The Diet Plate Special and The Blue Plate Special.&#10;&#10;There are also variant rules (including &quot;Seconds Dice&quot;, which let you challenge other players), and suggestions for using real food instead of tokens (including recipes).&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a row of numbered tiles corresponding to the possible outcomes of the roll of 2d6, except 7.  On their turn if a player rolls a number equal to an un-flipped tile, they flip it; if the tile is already flipped their turn ends.  Rolling a 7 or 11 ('kitty') forces the player to pay a chip to the pot while rolling a 12 ('keeno') allows the player to collect the accumulated chips. The first player to flip all of their tiles wins the game and collects points based on the chips they have collected and the un-flipped tiles of their opponents.&#10;&#10;",

Once the Germans had encircled the Russians in the first defensive line, there was a slight problem: their supporting infantry lagged far to the rear and what infantry had arrived was far too few to destroy the pocket. Immediately ahead was the 2nd Russian defensive line, manned by a Guards infantry division with armor. The first defensive line had crumbled under the classic German pincer movement, but German reserves were not ready to be committed. Nevertheless, piercing the 2nd Defensive belt and reaching the critical hills further south was not the same animal. It was nothing less than a head-on, in your face, battle. After regrouping, the German animals gathered in a armor wedge and began their breakthrough to the other side.&quot;&#10;You must mount and cut out the counters and provide your own d6 and d10 to play this game.&#10;&#10;",
