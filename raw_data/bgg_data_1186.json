    "Description": "Corpse Cat is a silly card game where the objective is to keep your cat alive while killing off the other players' cats. The player with the last cat alive wins. Game play is based off luck not skill.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, a D6 die roll and a chart determine the action taken. Actions can be playing a card on yourself or another and playing a card from your hand, another's hand, or the deck.&#10;&#10;The cards have various ways a cat can die and different combination requirements. Some cards require two or three of the same card to be lethal like &quot;Choked on a Hairball&quot;, and some cards are instant death such as &quot;Hit by a car&quot;. Some cards are positive and heal or protect your cat.&#10;&#10;When a player's cat is killed, the player has lost the game but continues to play, taking turns as normal to get revenge against those who harmed the player's cat.&#10;&#10;",

Each player will get points for &ldquo;squares&rdquo; with their respective colors, as well as Water squares. Green starts first by placing one of his cards onto the table.

Each game starts with the Detective making up a crime and accusing the other players of committing it. No one knows who is guilty until the very end, and players have to make up excuses, relationships and alibis in order to not become the criminal.&#10;&#10;The Detective asks the suspects questions so they can get to the bottom of who-done-it. Suspects have to think on their feet, while making sure they don't contradict their own narrative and attract the Detective's attention.&#10;&#10;When Suspects draw the attention of the Detective by saying something strange or inconsistent, they can play cards from their hand as Alibis. These cards act as hard-evidence, solidifying their story and diminishing the Detective's suspicions.&#10;&#10;Suspects can also use these cards offensively, accusing other Suspects of acting suspiciously, and turning the gaze of the Detective away from themselves. Just watch out you don't accidentally place yourself at the scene of the crime!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Black Hawk Down: Operation Gothic Serpent was a military operation in 1993 conducted by the US Special Forces during the Somali Civil War. The  Operation objective was to arrest two of the faction leaders&rsquo; top advisors. Our brave US soldiers prepared for a quick 90-minute mission to fast-rope in, arrest the two advisors, and quickly get out. The mission was a success, as the two advisors were arrested. However, upon completion of this mission, the first Black Hawk Helicopter was shot out of the skies by an RPG. Shortly after, a 2nd Black Hawk was shot down by another RPG and what was supposed to be a 90-minute mission, turned into a 17-hour struggle.&#10;&#10;This expansion shows how the men were not prepared for 17 hours of combat and the difficult situations they encountered in that time. This  expansion will do its best to honor those who lost their lives in this Operation by representing them as Soldier cards, and including the Medals they earned.&#10;&#10;This expansion offers 112 cards including:&#10;&#10;&#10;     10 Player Soldiers &#10;     6 Non-Player Soldiers &#10;     4 Squad Soldiers &#10;     13 Weapons &#10;     6 Eqiupment&#10;     4 Missions&#10;     5 Objectives&#10;     14 Locations&#10;     12 Skills&#10;     9 Medals&#10;     29 Hostiles&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Outnumbered more than five to one, and with nowhere to run, the SNLF fought, nearly to the last man. Of the 2600 Naval Infantry sailors there, only 17 left the island alive, and all as prisoners of war. The Americans were destined to win&mdash;they had the numbers, the naval advantage, and the air advantage, and despite the heavy fortifications of the Japanese defenders, the outcome was never really in doubt.&#10;&#10;Take command of IJN SNLF Sailors, and do your best to honor the Emperor as you fight to the last man. If you can&rsquo;t stop the American advance, you can at least make them pay in blood for every inch of Tarawa.

The engine, body, and suspension roll all build up.&#10;&#10;You start from 1 gear if you use all of your tires and spin around. If you overshoot again, you go a gear down (e.g., max 4), and so on. The tires are automatically replaced, thus this does not need to be repaired in the pit.&#10;&#10;Pit:&#10;&#10;Instead of wrench keys, you sit over a round in the pit and lose a stroke for each wear point you must have again, as seen below. As a result, you can sit three strokes over to score three wear points.&#10;&#10;Only hard tires and rain tires are available, and there is no way to make a quick pit stop.

    "Description": "Above the Clouds! is a set of air-combat miniature wargame rules for fighting large air battles from the late 1930s through the 1970s.&#10;&#10;The rules are intended to produce a free-flowing and fast game to represent air combat.  Although air warfare is a very technical form of combat, rules which focus too much on the technical details quickly lose the &quot;feel&quot; of air combat by turning the game into a slow, plodding simulation where seconds of combat time require hours of game time to resolve.&#10;&#10;To avoid this, a fairly minimalist approach was taken in the game design.  Individual aircraft have unique capabilities, and pilot skill/experience determines advantages and disadvantages, but the emphasis in the game is rapid execution of turns so that they game moves quickly.&#10;&#10;To achieve this, the following concepts guided the game development:&#10;&#10;     Each player will typically control 2-4 aircraft&#10;     Minimal plotting, make a quick decision for each aircraft and move on&#10;     Aircraft speeds should matter, but it should not take more than a couple seconds to determine speed changes&#10;     Combat should be decisive and quick to resolve&#10;     Aircraft damage should not be overly detailed -- aircraft will either be fully functional, crippled or destroyed&#10;     It spans the gambit of combat from WW1 through the wars of the late 1930s (Spanish Civil War, 2nd Sino-Japanese War), WW2, and 1950s-1970s (Korean War, Arab-Israeli Wars, Vietnam War)&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based upon GT Publishing's Commit the Garde! rules for Napoleonic warfare, &#10;Sound the Charge! is intended to simulate battles of the American Civil War on the grandest of scales.  Based upon the Napoleonic rules Commit the Garde! entire epic battles are represented in Sound the Charge!  No longer must the players extrapolate the results of the entire battle of Gettysburg based upon their game&rsquo;s recreation of the fight for Devil&rsquo;s Den or Cemetery Ridge.  &#10;Players represent the highest level leaders in any given battle and as such make the decisions that will shape the entire battle.  Gone are the minutiae which their historical counterparts left to their subordinates, your focus is on your army&rsquo;s brigades, not on the battalions and squadrons.&#10;&#10;Decisions made by lower level officers are abstracted into the mechanics of the game, players should understand that there is someone at the lower level who should be taking care of those details (spacing of battalions and squadrons, deployment of skirmishers, sighting of artillery sections, availability of spare ammunition, etc.).  Like it or not the real commanders had to trust subordinates to do their duty well.  Often these abstract subordinates will make mistakes (represented by bad dice rolls), whether or not your subordinate&rsquo;s failure is catastrophic to your plan will depend on the allowances you have made for that possibility. This of course is a good reason to have plenty of reserves available.&#10;&#10;And speaking of reserves, the most unique aspect of Sound the Charge! is the use of off-table reserves.  No longer can your opponent see the deployment of your entire army.  The location of your reserves is not determined until you commit them to the battle, at which time you place them where you want them (with limitations based upon distance from your Army HQ and proximity of enemy forces).  The skill of your army commander and staff determine how effectively you can commit your reserves.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hex-grid map; the reason for this is to remove the ambiguities of &ldquo;free movement&rdquo; common to most miniature rules.  With hexes there is no doubt about a unit&rsquo;s location, it&rsquo;s facing, and what the range is to any other unit on the battlefield.  The intent with this approach is to make this a game/simulation of decisions, not of inches.&#10;&#10;Sound the Charge! includes two introductory scenarios, Manassas where the fledgling armies learned to fight, and Champion Hill where Grant completed the encirclement of Vicksburg.  Complete scenario briefings, orders of battle, maps and unit labels for these scenarios are included with the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This scenario set includes the historical scenario where the fort was largely damaged but flooding before the attack, as well as a &ldquo;what if&rsquo; scenario where the Confederate defenders are not hampered by flooding, and may even have the support of their own gunboats.  This scenario file includes two record sheets for Fort Henry, one for Fort Heiman, and record sheets for another 7 Union and 3 Confederate vessels.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "My previous ruleset Dreadnoughts At Dawn reproduced large capital ship engagements in or around the 1st world war. It did not deal with aircraft or submarines, and focused on the larger capital ships.&#10;&#10;Carrier Strike at Dawn has a number of different &quot;Mission types&quot;, one of which is large surface ship combat in daylight, there are changes from WW1 but not that many.&#10;&#10;The most important and innovative missions though involve aircraft carriers and long range carrier combat, there are a number of options here, pure carrier combat such as Midway etc, or combined operations where carriers and surface combatants are engaged in the same battle though the carriers are likely to be in a separate task force than the surface combatants.&#10;&#10;Getting this part of the rules right has been very difficult but I believe I have got it as good as I can get it.&#10;&#10;As per DaD I propose utilising 1:3000th or 1:2400 scale models for the ships and personally I use 1:600 scale aircraft for the air wings, whilst each model ship represents 1 ship, a model aircraft represents a flight of 4 aircraft. This still means the larger carriers will have around 20 model aircraft assigned to them and we have happily played a game to completion in a normal gaming night with 2 or even 3 carriers per side.&#10;&#10;For such large air wings the aircraft are forced to attack in waves.&#10;&#10;There are simple and fun mechanisms for the carriers spotting aircraft to spot and track enemy carrier fleets, rather than a clever dice mechanism each player writes down a number between 1 and 10, this is where their fleet is &quot;hiding&quot; and then try to guess their opponents number.  Whilst not materially different than rolling a dice it adds an atmosphere of suspense and fun as players try to guess where the other players carriers are hiding.&#10;&#10;There is also a mission based on north sea convoys that involve wolf packs of submarines hunting merchantmen and their escorts, the wolf packs may be assisted by land based aircraft and or surface raiders whilst the convoy may have an escort carrier assigned for air defense&#10;&#10;To avoid complexity the rules for each mission type are put together and duplicated where necessary, so for example if it is a night time cruiser action mission you don't need rules for air combat, if it is a carrier V carrier action you don't need rules for surface combat as the opposing fleets never come within 100 miles of each other, etc.&#10;&#10;Whilst all ships from destroyers to super dreadnoughts are represented the emphasis is on capital ships, escorts are covered in a simplified way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

I have written many rules before but never gone to the extent of publishing them before.&#10;As my primary aim is to enjoy the hobby rather than become a publishing millionaire, I have tried to keep the cost of these rules as low as practical.&#10;&#10;The initial rules cover British and German ships in the north sea, any additions to these rules or this list will be free of charge to registered purchasers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As per all my rules they are designed to be able to field large numbers of units but still be very fast to play; also they must be fun; lastly they have to have at least a &quot;feel&quot; of the period they are set in. &#10;In other words they are fun rules set at the game end of the spectrum rather than the simulation end of the spectrum.&#10;&#10;Despite that there are numerous troop types to choose from and full details on how to make up your own units and your own army lists if I have not included your favourite unit or army.&#10;&#10;Speaking of which spreadsheets are included with army lists for 20 armies from Early Persian (500BC) to Early Imperial Roman (ending about 250AD). None of the spreadsheets are protected, details can be changed if you wish and when creating your own army lists just copy one of the existing sheets closest to the army you want and modify a few values.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed to be played with 28mm models though 15mm can be used without changing any of the ranges. Smaller figures I suggest halving all distances.&#10;&#10;I don't want you to waste your hard earned money on a set of rules you don't like so i have created a free sample of the rules which include about 10 pages of the rules and some of the army lists. I am hoping this is enough for you to be able to make a reasoned decision on whether to buy these rules or not.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Red Dawn 1980 - 1989 Nato Vs The Soviet Union in Western Europe&#10;&#10;Whilst you may use any scale models from 6mm up to 28mm if you have worlds largest wargames table, it is designed to be played with 6mm or 1:285th scale models. For 10mm 1/200th scale models just use the rules as written. If using 15 or 20mm models, I recommend doubling all distances. I realise some of you may have 15mm Team Yankee models, whilst you may play Red Dawn with those models I think you are going to need at least an 8 X 6 board.&#10;&#10;Using 1:285th scale models a typical meeting engagement would be 3-4,000 points per side, that will equate to around 10-20 tanks plus another 10+ infantry units (squads) and associated transports, air defence weapons, recce etc.  In total about a battalion sized battlegroup&#10;&#10;All of the rule sets I have written have a few things in common. They must be fast to allow a fairly large game to be played within 3 hours. They must be fun. This is a game not a military simulation, compromises will be made where ever necessary to ensure that it remains fun and fast. Lastly it has to at least &lsquo;feel&rsquo; reasonable, I like to get a flavour of the period I am covering.&#10;&#10;I have played WW3 games where largely speaking if you can see the target you can hit it, and if you can hit it you can kill it. I personally do not think in the heat of battle it is that easy to hit and kill a main battle tank. That is of course only my opinion, I have never been in the military and WW3 never happened so to some degree all WW3 rule sets are based on someone's opinion, but it is the basis of these rules, you will find even the hardest tank can be killed, though not necessarily easily, and even the least armoured tank has some chance of surviving long enough to achieve something.&#10;&#10;I have provided army lists for the major armies defending or threatening Western Europe, I have split the period into 3 time periods, effectively the beginning of the 1980&rsquo;s, the end and of course the middle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Naval Thunder: Rise of the Battleship II Pre-Dread Expansion.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the pre-dreadnought era of naval war, where the battleship is the uncontested ruler of the waves.  No subs, no planes, and even torpedoes are just an afterthought.  The big gun decides battles, and the fate of nations.&#10;&#10;Naval Thunder is a fast and furious naval combat game that gives you all the flavor of the era, without bogging you down in rules.  When the first pre-dreadnought expansion for Naval Thunder was released (Rise of the Battleship), our fans immediately began clamoring for more.  Naval Thunder has since become the new standard for pre-dreadnought naval gaming, and Rise of the Battleship II takes it to the next level.&#10;&#10;Naval Thunder: Rise of the Battleship II includes data cards for six navies (American, Austrio-Hungarian, British, German, Italian, Spanish) all the way from mighty battleships, to destroyer and torpedoboat flotillas.  In all, well over hundred classes of ship are represented.  Also included are special rules to tailor Naval Thunder even more closely to the pre-dreadnought era of naval combat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Take your naval warfare to the next level with Naval Thunder: The Atlantic Campaign!&#10;&#10;Finally!  A way to enjoy a naval campaign game without boring administration or complex record keeping!&#10;&#10;This book provides a complete set of rules for running a campaign game covering the critical early phases of the naval war in the Atlantic during World War II.&#10;&#10;The rules introduce a revolutionary chained event system where the choices and outcomes of earlier events and battles influence the events that may occur, and the options you have later.  No two campaigns play out the same way, providing infinite replayability.&#10;&#10;The rules are set up to put you in control of the critical strategic choices that must be made within an ever changing environment of limited information and events that may be outside your control.  But the focus stays centered on the action on the tabletop as you battle it out with your opponent!&#10;&#10;Realistic strategic concerns create historical choices for the commanders.   &quot;Should I prolong the fight to finish off these enemy ships, knowing that enemy battleships might be heading this way?  Or should I play it safe, take what I've achieved and get out before they show up?&quot;&#10;&#10;Victory conditions ensure that players must make realistic choices about trade-offs between achieving objectives and preserving your forces, just as the historical commanders had to.  Fighting to the last shell is rarely the best option.&#10;&#10;Launch raiding sorties, deploy forces to counter your enemy&rsquo;s plans, evade U-Boats, or strangle the enemy&rsquo;s supply lines.  The choices are yours!  Can you anticipate your opponent, or will you be caught scraping together scratch task-forces, to counter an unexpected threat?&#10;&#10;The strategic choices are complex, but the record keeping is simple and easy thanks to the chained event system and campaign tracking guide.&#10;&#10;Also included are a slew of crunchy new rules including:&#10;&#10;     12 new data cards for ships never before seen in Naval Thunder&#10;     Sea State Effects rules&#10;     Rules for incorporating U-Boats into the campaign&#10;     Orders of Battle for the Royal Navy &amp; her allies, as well as the German forces.&#10;     And much more!&#10;&#10;&#10;Naval Thunder:  The Atlantic campaign is for two or more players, and can be played with or without a referee.&#10;&#10;Naval Thunder: Battleship Row and Naval Thunder: Bitter Rivals are required for play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Eadgar is an easy to play set of wargames rules focused on European warfare from 450 AD  to 1100 AD.&#10;&#10;It is easily adaptable to a couple of hundred years earlier or later and an expanded geographic area. The rules do not use a fixed figure scale, allowing players to adapt games to their individual collections. Both small and large scale actions are easily handled. &#10;The rules as written are designed for using 25mm to 28mm scale figures, but are adaptable for smaller scales. &#10; The rules are D6 driven with modifiers reflecting an increase or decrease in available dice.&#10;&#10;The turn system is dynamic with players contending for control of each phase. &#10;The dice mechanics are a little different, but it is still best to roll high. &#10;Players must continually adapt as they will not know if they will move first or second, or shoot first or second. At times movement, shooting, and melee can even be suspended and skipped during a turn.&#10;&#10;Leadership plays a part in the fight with leaders being able to get more from individual units when needed. This can come in the form of additional movement, a additional shooting, launching an unexpected assault or just inspiring men to fight harder.&#10;&#10;If using individually based figures the rules do not require the use of markers of any kind, allowing for an uncluttered battlefield. If not using individually based figures players will need to provide some method of recording unit losses. Other than that no markers are needed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Micro Baseball is a micro version of the game of baseball using dice, tokens and 9-cards.  As the pitcher you decide your pitch with one of six pitch cards.  As the batter you pick your batting style card but hide it from the opponent.  You roll four colored dice to prepare for the pitch and then determine the amount of dice to adjust your swing and for power based on your batting style.  You can then roll dice to adjust the swing to match the pitch.  If you match you get a HIT and then determine how much power you put into the swing.  The power determines how far into the field the ball travels.  When there is a HIT, the opponent must place his player&rsquo;s &ldquo;up to 5 dice&rdquo; on the field in zones to see if they make the out. &#10;You can play a full game solo against an A.I. Bot or 2-player.  All the same rules apply to actual game of baseball with pitching, hitting and fielding but I removed balls and strikes to speed up play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Lead from the front and be rewarded.. or shot from your horse.&#10;&#10;Combat uses a single-roll mechanic: Roll a pool of dice (typically 3-4) and check each die for results.&#10;&#10;That single roll will tell you everything you need to know, without any additional rolls required: Is the enemy in Disarray? Being pushed back? Taking losses? One roll.&#10;&#10;Finally the rules offer simple campaign rules, options to help you set up creative scenarios and a standard &quot;meeting engagement&quot; battle plan you can use to set up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Advanced Salvo! European Theater is a solitaire, tactical naval strategy wargame that enables players to recreate World War II naval battles between individual allied and Axis on the table top.&#10;&#10;The design uses the Salvo! game system, adapted to a WW2 setting. (Great War Salvo! 3rd ed. is its World War I counterpart.)&#10;&#10;The game consists a 20-page rule booklet, containing all rules, game tables, advanced rules and options, scenarios, and designer's notes.  Game components make up the rest of the package, with Scenario Cards, Reference Card, Sea Display, and eight warship counter sheets (sections #1-8), including ships from Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy, 144 ship counters in all, drawn to scale. Using historically rated warships (BB, BC, PB, CA, CL, AMC types), rated in a variety of offensive and defensive categories, players can assess at a glance the relative strengths and weaknesses of each ship.&#10;&#10;Advanced Salvo! European Theater is primarily a ship vs ship solitaire game, but rules are included for two-players as well, with one or multiple ships on a side.  All the major warships from each country are provided (see list below), allowing players to recreate any number of actual and hypothetical Second World War encounters.&#10;&#10;The game may be played with counters, or your own ship miniatures.  The game is adaptable to miniatures on the table top, with scales of one turn equaling several minutes of real time, and each range band representing approximately 5000 yards (2.5 nautical miles).&#10;&#10;Originally published in 2015, Advanced Salvo! European Theater is now available in PDF format.&#10;&#10;LIST OF INDIVIDUALLY RATED SHIP COUNTERS INCLUDED&#10;&#10;GERMANY:  BB: Bismarck, Tirpitz.  BC: Scharnhorst, Gneisenau.  PB: Graf Spee, Adm.

    "Description": "The Second Kharkov Campaign is a pair of Pint Sized campaigns for the TooFatLardies rule set Chain of Command. These platoon level scenarios are perfectly usable for other rule sets and provided the necessary information to make adjustments.&#10;&#10;The first campaign covers the initial Soviet attack on German lines in May 12th of 1942. It follows the advance of the Soviet 38th Tank Brigade and the 226th Rifle Division in their attack on the German 294th Infantry Division which was blocking the main roads leading to the city of Kharkov. The campaign has seven scenarios and involves British Lend-Lease tanks. The entire campaign spans a single day of this battle where the Soviets made significant gains and in many cases broke the German lines.&#10;&#10;The second campaign covers the German counterattack on May 13th of 1942. Having released the armored divisions that were being held in reserves, the German 3rd Panzer Division pushed up from Kharkov and cut through a number of Soviet units. This campaign has six separate scenarios and covers the time from the 13th to the 16th of May 1942. This campaign has scenarios that may be played out with the What A Tanker rule set as well due to their armor heavy nature.&#10;&#10;The third campaign in this book is a What A Tanker Campaign. This allows the player to create a map based campaign to move their forces in a kriegspiel type manner until their forces make contact, then play out the scenario using the What A Tanker rules.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the book provides some sketches of other units and actions that can be used to create your own campaigns with. The maps are based on period maps from German and Soviet armies. Each scenario has a game map and a picture of the table that I used to game these out.&#10;&#10;The PDF comes out to 105 pages and includes a short history of the campaigns to provide the player with a background on the action that they are fighting.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In February 1904, Russia had the world&rsquo;s third largest fleet, while that of Japan&rsquo;s was ranked fourth. By September 1905, Japan had become number three and Russia had fallen below the top ten.&#10;&#10;Dawn of the Rising Sun contains nineteen scenarios for the Admiralty Trilogy&rsquo;s Dawn of the Battleship game, covering all the major surface engagements of the Russo-Japanese War, which led to this stunning reversal of fortunes.&#10;&#10;Dawn of the Rising Sun is used with Dawn of the Battleship rules, which are part of the Admiralty Trilogy system, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers and novices alike. &#10;Tactical turns represent three minutes, with intermediate turns (for extended maneuvering) representing 30 minutes. &#10;Gun hit chances are based on a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds fired at the target, and the speed of the firing and target platforms.&#10;&#10;In addition to well-known battles such as Port Arthur, Yellow Sea, and the Tsushima Strait, several smaller battles have been included. The scenario book is full of original after action reports as well as helpful sidebars on a wide range of topics. Each scenario has its own map, showing the disposition of forces. The separate annex booklet includes all the ships that were involved, including information on the guns, torpedoes, and fire control of the era, making it a valuable reference in itself.&#10;&#10;Players purchasing the Dawn of the Rising Sun scenario booklet will also need the 28-page Dawn of the Rising Sun annexes booklet, which provides information on all the ships and weapons needed to play the scenarios.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But are you the greatest monster? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out, and that&rsquo;s to pit yourself against other monsters in a game of Monster Mayhem! Compete against your fellow monsters in rooms containing bubbling acid, exploding rockets, tentacled terrors, rickety bridges, and much, much more for the thrill&mdash;nay, the honor&mdash;of being crowned the greatest monster ever.&#10;&#10;Monster Mayhem is a push your luck social party game for 4-12 players.  Players choose a monster and vote token, and then take turns reading scenario cards.  Afterwards, all players vote on the scenario simultaneously.  Depending on how players vote, players gain or lose points.  At the end of the game (typically 8 scenarios which takes about 30 minutes), the monster with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Here is an example scenario from the game:&#10;&#10;The Rickety Bridge &#10;Two bridges lie before you. The one on the left is sturdy; the one on the right is barely standing. There is a greater reward for taking the right bridge, that is if it doesn&rsquo;t collapse and drop you down onto the sharp rocks below&hellip;&#10;&#10;Monsters choose to take the sturdy left bridge or the rickety right bridge.&#10;&#10;Taking the left bridge will reward 1 point. Taking the right bridge will reward 3 points.  However, if 50% or more of all monsters take the rickety right bridge it collapses, causing all those monsters to fall and lose 2 points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&Eacute;lan is a set of Brigade to Divisional level scenario driven rules for the European theatre during The Great War.&#10;&#10;Designed as a two-player game using 6mm figures, with little adjustment it can be played solo, or in any scale from 2mm to 20mm.&#10;&#10;The basic mechanism used in this game - &eacute;lan, distills a number of factors - morale, training, leadership, fatigue, &quot;friction&quot; - into a single numerical value. Whenever a unit tries to perform an action, its score is rolled against. Failure not only results in the attempted action failing but a fall in the &eacute;lan score, as the unit begins to succumb to the stresses of the battlefield. Under this system, even the most motivated troops will eventually be worn down and break.&#10;&#10;In the game, much of the minutiae of combat has been ignored. As Divisional or Brigade commanders, the players only see the results of actions, not the process on the ground by which those results are determined. A commander will know only that a unit has not advanced, not which one of the multitude of reasons why it hasn't. This absence of precise control at the company level, is mirrored further up the command structure by using a non-sequential turn sequence to simulate communications failures (and initiative) within the command system.&#10;&#10;&Eacute;lan contains army lists for 22 nations involved in the Great war and instructions on how to convert any MicroMark army list for play in the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

What&rsquo;s changed? There's been lots of minor developments, but also fluid rules for unit coherence which combined with new unit morale rules work in a unique way. If your grizzled captain leading a unit of conscripts is shot, you could be in trouble!&#10;&#10;Shooting has been revamped into a quick and easy system, both for direct and indirect fire. Sequence of play is much more flexible, vehicle and monster hits have variable results, going prone, suppression and overwatch rules have been integrated, etc.&#10;&#10;Finally, and while certainly optional since you can use whatever game universe background you like, we&rsquo;ve beefed up the fluff about our own universe. There are numerous lists giving examples of various troop types which you can use as they are, or as examples to show you how to create troop profiles for you own wargame armies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Japan lies at the center, with countries identified by national flags. Around the border of the map are black and white images of people, animals, and historical buildings relating to the different stops along the way. The text boxes at the bottom give directions for playing the game, and important things for children to learn. It was a New Years newspaper supplement to Mainichi Shinbun, dated Showa 5 (1930).&#10;&#10;Text in Japanese. The subtitle on the right reads: Educational Games for a New Age; the subtitle on the left reads:New Years Supplement to Osaka Mainichi Newspaper. Map title: World Flight Routes. Lower right: Directions for playing. &quot;The easiest way&quot; &quot;Here are instructions for the easiest way to play. Around the map are assembled the world's interesting and well-known places. Most likely, these are all places that everyone wishes they could visit sometime. Departing from Osaka [1] and moving to all the places in order of 2, 3, 4, you then return to Tokyo [52]. The player who reaches there first is the winner. &quot;Throw the dice and proceed as many places as the number you cast...&quot; Upper right text informs players of distances between locations, with basic geographic facts. The legend, toward the bottom of the map oval, shows 5 types of red lines &amp; 1 square: 1. Well-known large aircraft route (refers to zeppelin, seen center of map) 2.

Once a player finds that object on one of their cards, they flip it over to reveal the next object, etc. This continues until one player has flipped all five of their cards, and they are the winner.&#10;&#10;An example would be: the first object to find is a barrel. I find a barrel in one of my scenes that takes place in the Wild West. I show everyone the barrel, they confirm it's correct, and then I flip my Wild West card over - the object shown on the back of that card is flowers. I find a garden of flowers on another card that I have, a scene in Medieval Times. Again, I show everyone to confirm and then flip the card over. The next object, on the back of this card, is a bird. Another player is the first to find a bird on their card, they reveal / we confirm, and they flip that card over to reveal the next object we must look for.

    "Description": "The Action At Ustilug is a pint sized campaign for Chain of Command. &#10;It contains a half ladder campaign with a variable support system that adds an extra level of friction to your support choices. &#10;The campaign covers the opening day of Operation Barbarossa. The German 289th Infantry Division crossed the Ukrainian border at the bridges near Ustilug and encountered the Soviet 87th Rifle Division and elements of the 41st Tank Division.&#10;&#10;The scenarios cover rural as well as urban engagements. The Soviet defenders acquitted themselves well and delayed the German advance through the town at every opportunity.&#10;&#10;The booklet weighs in at 22 pages with full maps for each scenario. &#10;This does not have the same production quality as the Pint Sized Campaigns published through TooFatLardies as it has no graphics other than game maps.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher at Wargame vault&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Campaign for Kharkov contains two pint sized campaigns designed for the TooFatLardies Chain of Command rules. &#10;They are easily converted to any skirmish ruleset such as Bolt Action.&#10;&#10;One covers the advance of the German 57th Infantry Division and the other the German 101st Light Division. The attack came in October of 1941. This city would be the site of three major battles for the city. The interesting aspect of the October 1941 battle is in the nature of the troops involved. The Soviets had superiority in armor. The Germans advanced with only a single STUG battalion in support of the 57th ID. The Soviets fielded the T34 as well as several improvised armored vehicles such as the KhTZ-16. While not a success on the battlefield, it demonstrated the Soviet inventiveness under the extreme pressure of the blitzkrieg.&#10;&#10;There are twelve total scenarios in the campaign.  &#10;Full force lists are available for both German Divisions and the Soviet troops present.  &#10;Maps are based on aerial reconnaissance photographs taken by German troops in September 1941.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Immediately, the crack of a high-velocity gun cut through the air.  Sergeant Glen, peeking out of the turret hatch of Daisy Darling, reflexively ducked.  He scanned the far side of the field, looking for an AT gun emplacement or an enemy tank.  Another round cracked and Mobile Macy, about fifty yards to his right, lurched to a halt and leaked flame and smoke.&#10;&#10;A third round cut overhead.  Over the intercom he heard the driver say a prayer and his gunner curse.  There was a killer out there, and they hadn&rsquo;t even managed to spot it yet&hellip;&#10;&#10;Armored contains scenarios and special rules for use with the WWII small unit game A Sergeant&rsquo;s War (ASW).  The scenarios are perfectly compatible with other wargame rules, of course.&#10;&#10;The special rules included here are intended to spice up armor-only games and to add more detail to combined arms games of ASW.&#10;&#10;To play all the scenarios in this booklet, you will need a 6&rsquo;x4&rsquo; table (or 3&rsquo;x&rsquo;2 if using 6mm figures and half-inch game scale), terrain, and some vehicles:&#10;&#10;At the end of this booklet, A Sergeant&rsquo;s War stats for these vehicles are provided at the end of these rules for convenience, as are simple, printable hidden unit counters.&#10;&#10;New special rules include:&#10;&#10;     Vehicle Leaders&#10;     Infantry manning Vehicle MGs&#10;     Movement in Tight Spaces&#10;     Tank vs Man: Overruns&#10;     Tank vs Tank: Smoke Dischargers&#10;     Tank vs. Tank: Positions in Cover&#10;     Tanks and Pinning&#10;     Vehicle Special Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;These various rules add historical detail to different types of vehicles.&#10;&#10;     Hidden Unit Counters&#10;         Simple &ldquo;limited intelligence&rdquo; rules so that both sides can use hidden unit counters.&#10;    &#10;     Scenarios:  This booklet includes six scenarios in two mini-campaigns.
