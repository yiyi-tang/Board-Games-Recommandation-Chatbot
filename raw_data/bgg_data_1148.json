Words can extend into other player's areas, but must have at least one letter in the active player's home area. Next, they may perform an attack using one of the 3 Implements of Destruction that are unlocked by playing tiles. Each letter tile contains Attack Points that determine an attack's direction, and an attack may be made from any tile that is part of an unbroken chain of tiles that is located over any one of the active player's Vortexes. Attack range is determined by word length (tiles shared by 2 or more words can use the range of any word they are a part of).&#10;&#10;The player removes any tiles destroyed by the attack, and continues to remove tiles until all letters left on the board form legal words. Where a tile is removed from on the board determines it's point value. Destroyed tiles are placed in the corresponding Scoring Pits on the active player's board (no points are scored for tiles destroyed in your own area.&#10;&#10;Play continues until the last tile is drawn. Every player then gets one last turn. Points are tallied from destroyed tiles in your Scoring Pits and those remaining intact in your home area. Highest score wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Some Small Talk cards have pointed and outrageous questions such as &quot;Were you most likely to own a fake ID?&quot; or &quot;Were you most likely to leave the prom with someone else's date?&quot; Other cards let you fill in the blank or ask your own questions for an even more personal game experience. By process of elimination, each answer gets you closer to guessing your opponent's mystery person.

Each hex represents 875 yards, and each of the two days has four to six turns (depending on morale and exhaustion) with a separating night turn in between. Units of maneuver are mostly multi-step divisions for both sides. The French are on the strategic offensive, but there&rsquo;s plenty of opportunity for both players to attack. In fact, the Austrians can win a sudden death victory by capturing the French crossing area over the Danube. The game uses an alternating action sequence that keeps both players fully and tensely involved all throughout every turn. A full match can be set up, banged out, and put away by two experienced players in about three hours.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The backs of each card are identical, and on the front they feature one of three images &mdash; mushroom, leaf or stone &mdash; in one of three colors: yellow, red or blue. In the twelve spaces adjacent to this grid are placed cards showing 1-3 hazelnuts.&#10;&#10;A player starts: he puts his boar card before a row/column of his choice and cross it by announcing out loud what he thinks on the back of the forest card. It begins with the first card, the player announces for example &quot;leaf&quot; or &quot;yellow&quot; (according if the elements or colors are in play) then turns the card over and compares the guess to the actual picture. Initially, we discover, that the cards are random. If the guess it correct, the player continues the path to the hazelnuts that await us on the other side. If it is wrong, it stops there, and the next player start.&#10;&#10;If the next player starts on the same row/column, he already knows what there is on the front of this card, unless he remembers more since it was the visible item at the beginning...!&#10;&#10;Players play with colors or the elements: initially it is them who choose. But as soon as a player has reaches a nut, everyone changes: those who played on the elements switches to colors and vice versa. One must therefore be remember everything and well remember what others reveal!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "30 Seconds to Live is a light-medium 1-2-player competitive zombie card game. Zombies broke thru the defenses into the warehouse encampment and the Lone Survivor escaped out the backdoor into the alley. They barricaded the door but it won't hold long. They must escape the alley to the street where a pickup is waiting, fighting through the hordes of zombies. If the zombies reduce the Survivor to zero health, the zombies win the game. The confined game space and a limit of only 30 seconds to complete their turn make the game tense and fast-paced, so every turn feels like the last 5 minutes of a season finale of The Walking Dead.&#10;&#10;The game is different from most zombie games in several ways. Most zombie games are expensive, take all night to play, have tons of miniatures, require a whole bunch of friends to play and you all are good guy Survivors. This game is the opposite. It's inexpensive, uses only cards and counters, and can be played solo or with two people in 20-40m. Best of all, one of the players gets to be the zombies! If you're tired of being the hero, this is the game for you! Players need to complete their turn in 30 seconds or forfeit the rest of their planned actions. This is tracked using a companion app downloaded from the 30 Seconds To Live website, or with the included sand timer. This forces players to think and act quickly. Nobody likes it when a player takes ten minutes to decide what they want to do on their turn. Do you think zombies are going to wait for you to decide whether to move, draw a card, or attack? They will just attack! Finally, health and ammo are tracked using a simple mechanism that eliminates the need for dice and other counters and makes for faster and simpler gameplay. The game includes male and female versions of eight unique player characters, eight types of zombies, and 19 different weapons.  The game has great replayability due to the numerous ways the game can be played and the different strategies that can be employed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Napoleon was trying re-establish his ascendancy in Germany after his disastrous 1812 Russian campaign; and the Coalition needed to survive the overwhelming numbers of the French forces and entice the Austrians to join their side.&#10;&#10;The French forces are large, but are plagued by inexperience&mdash;reflected by many infantry formations with limited abilities&mdash; and a shortage of cavalry. The Coalition army&#10;has extensive cavalry&mdash;-including marauding Cossacks, but is constrained by weak&#10;Russian organization and by a defense stretched too thin by the sprawling French army.&#10;&#10;The game not only includes the large game on Bautzen, but also includes three additional smaller games recreating battles at Weissig and Konigswartha in an area just north of Bautzen.

There are 4 phases in each round:&#10;&#10;1. Setup Phase: At the beginning of each round, setup Garbage Tiles according to Round Cards.&#10;&#10;2. Planning Phase: Players place all their meeples along the River or on faceup Enhancement Cards at the same time. Each card can only have one meeple on it.&#10;&#10;3. Action Phase: After placing all the players&rsquo; meeples, perform the following actions in order:&#10;&#10;a. Eco Movement: Each meeple placed on a faceup Enhancement Card can acquire the card. Enhancement Cards can be used during the Trash Cleanup period.&#10;b. Garbage Cleanup: Each meeple along the River will have a chance to clean up a Garbage Tile with a dice roll. Starting from River Section A, roll the die if there&rsquo;s a meeple, and choose a garbage to be fully cleaned  (cleared) or reduced (flip over). Retrieve the meeple after each cleanup.&#10;c. If there are any Ocean Vacuums activated, use their functions after Garbage Cleanup.&#10;&#10;4. River Flow: All remaining Garbage Tiles from River Section A goes into the Garbage Island.

After taking your first steps into the Dreamlands, your mind teems with anxiety over the quest ahead, dangers you left in the waking world, and the fate of dreamers who have come before you. Are they also somewhere in these expansive lands? Perhaps if you find the lost castle and return with proof of the Dreamlands, you can save everyone: yourself, your friends, and the other dreamers as well. So, despite the advice of the Dreamlands&rsquo; inhabitants, you and your companions seek unknown Kadath, where the gods dwell.&#10;&#10;The Search for Kadath is Scenario 2&ndash;A of The Dream-Quest. This scenario can be played on its own in Standalone Mode or combined with the other expansions in The Dream-Eaters cycle to form a larger four-part or eight-part campaign. As your team of investigators becomes separated between the dream and the waking worlds, you will need to work together across realms to earn victory and return home. To help you achieve this, you will find new player cards that create new synergies between investigators, letting you offer aid during your turns or even the Mythos Phase. Discover the meaning behind your dreams and discover the proof you seek!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unleash a Flying, Flipping, Spinning Kick on your opponents, but be careful to hang onto a Block or two for when they try to do the same to you!&#10;&#10;As SlugFest&#039;s first published game, Kung Fu Fighting has always held a special place in our hearts and the hearts of our longtime fans. This exciting card game hit a really good sweet spot as a quick and light game that still had some interesting choices and lots of silly, over-the-top cinematic Kung Fu moments.&#10;&#10;So after it was out of print we tried to Kickstart a totally new edition: fancy art, overhauled mechanics, higher production value, etc. Response was overwhelmingly meh.&#10;&#10;Since that failed project, we've thought a lot about this game, and we still get occasional requests for reprints. After the success of our low-key print-on-demand version of En Garde Reforged, we decided we should do the same thing for Kung Fu Fighting.&#10;&#10;We are very much using the KISS principle for this project: Keep It Simple, SlugFest! Rather than redoing everything (art, mechanics, etc.), we are simply creating a lightly-updated set of cards with the original art and mechanics and sending that off to our friends at DriveThruCards for printing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Without having to worry about bogs, swamps and unreliable steppe, the desert becomes a tankers paradise.&#10;&#10;Exclusive rules for movement, sea transport, logistics and more allow players to combine the Afrika Army Korps games with any other games in the DAMOS series in order to create either a mini-monster or linked campaign game. Using the classic AH Afrika Korps as inspiration, AFRIKA ARMY KORPS series offers a brand new take on the campaign at the strategic scale hex-size of 25 miles per hex. Combat is in hex and opportunities for encirclement abound for both sides.&#10;&#10;Players can combine AAK, AAK II TORCH, and AAK III TUNISIA to simulate the entire North African campaign.&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 6/10&#10;&#10;SOLITAIRE: 7/10&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The battle itself is embelematic of the whole Mons campaign in itself where the BEF consistently found themselves outnumbered in every engagement, though managing miraculous tactical victories strung together into a strategic victory at the outset of the war.&#10;&#10;The mechanics put a focus on command and control, only allowing forces in command with one another to cooperate or concentrate fire.

Turns are 30 minutes lasting from 0630 to 1400.&#10;&#10;This game will be part of the 2140 series, so it will include the standard map, 140 counters, rules and possibly some player aids and dice.&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 8-9/10&#10;&#10;SOLITAIRE: 7/10&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Some support units are included in the OOB as to give players a chance to experience how new weapons systems for the time had an impact on the battle space. Moving the PCS series to a desert environment gives mechanized and motorized units a huge level of freedom in terms of maneuver.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Today, trade hubs and hull dealers are everywhere, jump lines connect all of the major systems, and the Rogue invasion has finally begun - Yeehaw! It's time to make some lux.&#10;&#10;You, Sir, can run my trade fleets, if you are interested. I won&rsquo;t be dealing in smelly ass-teroid anymore. Careful though - you won&rsquo;t stand a chance against the Rogue without protection or something to pay them with. They'll turn y&rsquo;all back into stardust in no time. Here is what you need to do: Get rich hauling teratons of freight, then pay security to take care of the Rogue.&#10;&#10;But if you want to get rich and famous, and get your hands dirty, then gear up for space combat. Oh yeah. I&rsquo;m gonna blast some Rogue intruders with my battleship, Dolores. I&rsquo;ve been saving her for the invasion. So long, Sir.

You&rsquo;ve just arrived in a galaxy called The Future and have been promoted to direct a trade fleet. Your goal is to make lots of lux by hauling freight and trading resources, to then develop your technology and eliminate the Rogue, before your spacefaring adventure comes to an end. You might build space stations, explore anomalies, compete missions, and attack the Rogue yourself with the powerful fleets you have acquired. The galaxy is yours for the taking.&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;&#10;     Players control up to 4 fleets that can hold ships, crew, science, relics, cargo, and freight cards.&#10;     The galaxy is made of innovative chevron tiles that create different trading and traveling opportunities in every game.&#10;     The simple AI grows gradually and provides opportunities for scoring points.&#10;     Players can choose from a variety of ways to score points, from base building, the combat, anomaly exploration, missions, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The remaining players then each choose a color and number combination from the remaining dice and write that on their board.  Remember, the higher the value of the die, the more points it's worth (and you want the lowest score possible).&#10;&#10;If you ever manage to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of numbers that are either 3-of-a-kind or 3 numbers that add up to 10, you get to cross out that row, reducing their value to zero.&#10;&#10;The game ends when any one player completely fills in two of their three grids, then all players add up the total value of the numbers showing on their boards.

In this game players race to collect the most stars by filling in their build piles using the numbers rolled on the dice. The game comes with four dry-erase markers, four player boards, and six dice.&#10;&#10;On your turn, roll all six dice. Call out the number shown on the bonus die (the green 10-sided die) - everyone can use this die each time it is rolled. Then, use the dice as best you can to fill in your build piles. Build piles must be filled in in numerical order (starting with 1, then 2, 3, 4, etc.). Each time you fill in a circle underneath a star, you collect the star. Skip-Bo symbols are wild and can be used as any number, but you never collect stars when using a Skip-Bo to fill in a circle.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, all players select one of the numbers showing on the unused dice and write it in in one of their discard piles. You can use numbers from your discard piles on future turns to help you complete your build piles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has completed three of their four build piles, then each remaining player gets one final turn and the game ends.

Players continue playing until no one is able to play a higher number, the last player to play a card takes the pot of cards. The numbers on the card are red or green, 2 of each from each number.

If it good give them to yourself, if bad send it to your enemy, but then if some one plays their Damn It Joe Card, any player can use their Damn You Joe card to trump the round and then they get to select a player to receive the cards. The Damn cards can only be used once per entire hand, so use them wisely.&#10;After all the number cards are played, players will count their total, high score wins the hand.

    "Description": "During a dream, I watch a game being played. Immediately after waking up I wrote down everything about the game. With in a week I had my first prototype, and after the first play test, I realized dream rules and reality doesn't match. Few months of development later, the game is amazing and ready to go.&#10;&#10;This is an anti-worker placement game, the game plays as a worker placement game, but almost everything you do will help you and your opponents, with your opponents getting a better benefit than you. Don't worry they are dealing with the same situation, figuring out how to optimize every move to take make their score at the end of the game the highest.&#10;&#10;Every time you play the game the game layout is different. For each player player there is an addition tile grid added, the grid system is mixed and laid out randomly each round of the game. No player can memorize best moves, because that will change every game. There is 3 round per game, each round depending on the amount of players and players playing speed, between 15 to 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;This is a heavier strategy game, if you like games where every move is important and the wrong move can cost you dearly, then this is the game for you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Creating artworks with all their matching pieces or all from different designs gives you the best score.&#10;&#10;The game contains 6 different art designs, and 2 sets of each. The art designs are divided up into 4 x 4 tile pieces. Each player starts the game with one piece of a design.&#10;&#10;One a players turn they draw from either the face down draw pile or the top tile of the discard pile(once the pile has been created). with the new tile will if able connect to the piece they already have, there are stitch nodes on the sides of the tiles, if at least one of the nodes colors match they can connect it, for every matching node they get a point. If a player finds the entire set, that is worth 16 points, but if each piece of the 4 x 4 design is from a different art design, then the player get a 5 point bonus, which can be more or less than 16 points.&#10;&#10;Once the draw pile is empty or a player completes 3 art designs the game is over, the players count their score to see who won. The game is about 10 to 15 minuets long, having to give in and not waiting for the perfect piece will happen.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Any deck not controlled by a human player, will have their top card played each turn.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with their deck of cards, shuffle and draw 3 cards. Each turn, all players will play one card from their hand, or top card of a deck not controlled by a player. You can tell your team what you are planning to do, but then the other team will hear you, you may not show your hand to your team.&#10;The cards will be flipped up at the same time and played out in alphabetical order. Generally, the wizard will play first, casting a spell on the battle field, followed by the archers to kill as many knights as possible, then the team that has the most knights left over after the wizard's and the archer's onslaught will destroy an enemy's wall.&#10;&#10;Each deck has their ultra actions, wizards have a fireball to annihilate all cards played this turn and remove them from the game and destroy a wall from both team's castle.&#10;Archers can kill a enemy's wizard before they cast their spell.&#10;Knight have a Juggernaut which is very hard to defeat and almost every time destroy the enemy's castle wall.&#10;&#10;All cards in each player's deck will be used, once a player plays a card they will redraw at the end of the turn, but once the draw pile is used up, players will use the remaining cards in their hand before reshuffling their cards.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game is to destroy the other teams castle, first team to destroy the other team's castle wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes five GameRox in on hand, tosses them in to the air, and tries to catch as many as possible on the back of the same hand. Whoever catches the most goes first.&#10;&#10;Players are only allowed to toss, pick up, nudge, and catch GameRox with one hand at a time. After you have tossed the GameRox into the air, you are allowed to nudge any GameRox in the play area closer together using the same hand as long as you continue catching the tossed GameRox.&#10;&#10;Level 1: Cast your GameRox over the play area. Pick and throw one GameRox into the air. Pick up a second GameRox from the play surface, then catch the tossed GameRox. If you succeed, keep tossing and picking up a single GameRox until you have picked up all four GameRox. You can set one GameRox aside after picking it up. If you drop a GameRox, it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn. Once you succeed in picking up all four GameRox, move to Level 2.&#10;&#10;Level 2: Pick up two at a time.&#10;&#10;Level 3: Pick up three or one at a time.&#10;&#10;Level 4: Pick up four at a time.&#10;&#10;Level 5: Put all five GameRox in the palms of your hands. Toss them into the air and try to catch all five on the backs of your hands. Then, with the GameRox, still on the back of your hands, toss the GameRox into the air again and catch all five in the palms of your hands.&#10;&#10;Redo Points&#10;The points on the flat side of the GameRox are Redo Points. Each time you cast your GameRox, add up the numbers that land face up. You can spend 5 Redo Points to redo a toss if you drop a GameRox, or 20 Redo Points to skip an entire level.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

One or more discs may be pushed forward as a result.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the largest group of connected discs of her color wins the game.&#10;&#10;ADVANCED GAME MODES:&#10;&#10;Omega Scoring: The same score as in the game OMEGA (by the same designer) is applied.&#10;&#10;Kings mode: One or two pieces per player (indicated by a blue disc on top) are worth 2 points.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
