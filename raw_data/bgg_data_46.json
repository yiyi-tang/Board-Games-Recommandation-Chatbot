    "Description": "Raise merry hell with the legendary operators of the Special Air Service!&#10;&#10;SAS: Rogue Regiment is a WW2 stealth action game for 1-4 players. Taking on the role of SAS soldiers in the pivotal weeks following D-Day, players must carry out acts of sabotage deep behind enemy lines.&#10;&#10;Ambush convoys, assassinate high ranking officers, destroy ammo dumps and much, much more in your four man campaign against the Axis war machine!&#10;&#10;Strike from the shadows!&#10;Take down enemy patrols and sentries with the vast array of tools at your disposal, from rifles, explosives and grenades to vehicles, traps and your trusty fighting knife.&#10;&#10;Leave no trace!&#10;Move quickly and quietly to complete your objectives. Kill silently and hide the bodies to avoid detection. Get spotted, make too much noise or take too long to carry out your objective and the enemy will raise the alarm. Your heavily outnumbered team won&rsquo;t last long in a firefight so when the attack comes, make sure you&rsquo;re in position to make four men feel like a hundred!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each turn, every SAS operator has 4 action points which they can use to move, shoot and carry out tasks. During the &quot;stealth phase&quot; of the game, enemy movement is dictated by patrol lines, sentry points and an event card which is drawn each turn. Each mission has a stealth meter which will slowly fill each time the players arouse suspicion (firing weapons, leaving bodies out in the open etc.) If the stealth meter completely fills the players are detected &amp; the alarm will sound, triggering the &quot;battle phase&quot;. The aim of the game is to carry out the mission objective and escape the area unscathed, the easiest way to do this is to avoid detection for as long as possible.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is the third game in the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series. It covers the battle of Gettysburg.&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;Roads to Gettysburg is the third volume in Avalon Hill's series on the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War. Unlike most Civil War simulations, which portray specific battles, Roads to Gettysburg concentrates on the entire three-week campaign that led to the great struggle at Gettysburg. The Union player's objective is to defeat the Rebel army and push it back to Virginia. The goal of the Confederate player is to maintain control over the rich agricultural regions of Pennsylvania.&#10;&#10;Roads to Gettysburg is easy to learn and several scenarios can be played to completion in about an hour. The two beautiful game maps, which are based on original Civil War period maps in state and county archives, portray Maryland and Pennsylvania as they were in the summer of 1863, including roads, turnpikes, railroads, rivers, mountains, cities, and villages. In the game, players control Union and Confederate military units in turns representing one day of real time. &#10;The game's interactive system of play assures that each scenario will be unpredictable, exciting, and competitive. An extensive historical article, detailing the day-to-day activities of the actual campaign, is included in the game.&#10;&#10;You do not need to own Stonewall Jackson's Way or Here Come the Rebels! to play Roads to Gettysburg.&#10;Note: Owners of those games can join their maps to the Roads to Gettysburg maps to portray the eastern theatre of the Civil War from Fredericksburg, Virginia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS: &#10;2 Counter Sheets &#10;2 22&quot;x32&quot; Mapsheets &#10;1 Rules Booklet &#10;1 Charts and Tables Card &#10;2 Display Cards &#10;1 Ammunition Pad &#10;2 6-Sided Dice &#10;1 Counter Tray&#10;&#10;Time Scale: One day per turn &#10;Map Scale: One mile per hex &#10;Unit Scale: Divisions and brigades (with corps leaders) &#10;Players: One, two, or teams &#10;Playing Time: One hour for introductory scenarios, 2 to 14 hours for other scenarios&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When it turned out that faster-than-light travel was deadly for every lifeform, humans sent their inventions out instead to explore the galaxy &mdash; colossal factory ships capable of building and deploying automated Extractors. Those ships drilled, mined and transported raw minerals from faraway planetary systems back to Earth. Soon hundreds upon hundreds of star systems were visited and their planets were drilled down to their cores and stripped of valuable resources. After the ships moved on to the next system, the leftover excavation installations still lingered as a grim sign of past mining operations. In no time, two corporations monopolized the galaxy mining business, but with myriad systems to exploit they remained in a state of uneasy peace &mdash; a peace about to be broken due to an automated analysis of reports from a system mined many decades ago that yielded something weird, that led to a discovery of...Metallum.&#10;&#10;This new substance, which seems to carry a promise for interstellar travel for living organisms, is bound to stir conflict. The Earth Government immediately steps in and claims ownership of the system in the name of the &quot;good of mankind&quot;, but it's clear that one of the two corporations will be afforded the exclusive rights to extract Metallum &ndash; and the huge profits that come with it. The tension raises instantly. Outright corporate war is avoided only thanks to a promise to grant the mining rights to the corporation that will develop more efficient mining infrastructure on the planets. Incidents are bound to happen with old installations used to destroy enemy Extractors since it's clear that the Earth Government will be handing their grants based on Metallum extraction rates of each corporation before finally awarding exclusive mining rights to one of them. The best pilots from each corporation sit down behind their consoles as their factory ships approach the system with production of Extractors set to maximum.&#10;&#10;Metallum is a strategy game for two players who take on roles of corporate pilots charged with the task of directing their factory ships in order to construct a more efficient mining network on the system's planets than their opponent does. Each round consists of three main phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Programming: Players simultaneously create a program by composing puzzle-like subroutines that activate various systems on the factory ship (engines for moving, production for deploying Extractors, etc.). Some of the more powerful subroutines take more time to execute and hence impede your ability to react to the other player's moves &mdash; and they might even prevent you from activating other ship systems.&#10;     Action: Players execute programs composed during the programming phase. Since the order of execution of subroutines is decided by the player, the same program can yield vastly different outcomes, which leads to many interesting tactical decisions. During this phase new Extractors are also deployed on the system's planets.&#10;     Profits: Players earn credits for the planets on which they have their Extractors depending on who has more of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, the pilot who's earned the most credits for his corporation is declared the winner. Will you be able to cover the planets of the system with a network of your Extractors and at the same time disturb the plans of your opponent? Although the conflict is officially only an economic one, the successful pilot needs to know when to strike at a rival's mining infrastructure or make &quot;slight modification&quot; to it. When all is said and done, nobody will remember the details of the struggle &mdash; only the name of the greatest pilot in the history of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The computer classic comes to your table.  From the publishers:&#10;&#10;&quot;Fantasy Flight Games and Blizzard Entertainment present the official Warcraft boardgame, where players take command of an army of Night Elves, Humans, Orcs, or Undead seeking to harvest gold and wood, build a strong village, and set out to conquer and destroy! The Warcraft boardgame features an adaptable/expandable geomorphic board, exciting components, and the innovative &lsquo;Command/Movement&rsquo; system that simulates the real-time action and excitement of Warcraft.&quot;&#10;&#10;Warcraft is based on the computer game series. Each player takes on one of four factions: Humans, Orcs, Night Elves and Undead. It can be played cooperatively, with humans and night elves in one alliance and orcs and undead in the second.&#10;&#10;The game is set up with a modular board, depicting resources, victory point locations and the players' town halls. Throughout the game, players need to harvest resources, build units and buildings, and use their army to defeat their opponents.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players move their existing units, harvest gold and lumber with their workers, deploy units onto the board that were built on a previous turn, and finally spend resources on further units, buildings and outposts. Players also have access to a unique deck of Experience Cards, which are drawn during events like battles and can be used later for special effects.&#10;&#10;A player can win by eliminating all opponents, or by accumulating 15 total victory points.&#10;&#10;",

You have joined the ranks of the infamous Guild of Thieves, seeking your own path to wealth and glory. Your tiny gang has been chosen to relieve the fat merchants of the city from a portion of their, ahem, &quot;excess&quot; wealth. But there are many factions within the Guild, and yours is not the only band working in the district tonight! In fact, your greatest challenge may not be the militiamen who guard the streets...&#10;&#10;Cadwallon: City of Thieves is a fast-paced board game of cunning thievery and ruthless skulduggery in a fantasy city steeped in magic and intrigue. Two to four players each control their own gang of four thieves, competing to amass the greatest haul of loot from the many carefully locked chests scattered about the board. This is no friendly competition, however, and there is little loyalty among thieves in Cadwallon! The most successful players are as likely to claim their loot from the other gangs as they are to do the time-consuming legwork themselves...&#10;&#10;Get ready for a deviously fun battle for treasure! Good fortune in the Guild of Thieves is a double-edged sword that cuts to the bone; other thieves will want your loot, and they have no qualms about drawing your blood to get it. The result is a fast and furious brawl for control of the best treasures in the city. Precious jewels change hands rapidly, and you'll quickly find yourself positioning your gang to not only grab the loot, but defend it desperately.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Bluff, each player starts the game with five yellow dice. At the start of each round, they roll these dice under a cup, then look at the results without telling anyone else what's there. The dice show the numbers 1-5 and a star, with a star representing all five of those numbers as well as a star. The start player for the round then makes a public bid as to what they think is showing under all players' dice cups, e.g., &quot;eight 1s&quot;, &quot;twelve 4s&quot;, or &quot;four stars&quot;. The next player in clockwise order must raise the bid (following certain rules laid out on the game board), or call the previous person because they don't think the dice under the cups support that bid.&#10;&#10;Everyone then raises their cups and the result is revealed, with the last bidder or the caller losing dice based on the outcome. If you run out of dice, you're out of the game, and the last player who has dice wins.&#10;&#10;Bluff Jubil&auml;umsausgabe follows the familiar gameplay of Bluff, but this 25th anniversary edition replaces six of the yellow dice with six orange dice, with each player starting with one orange die. This die counts double when determining the results of a bid, providing an extra challenge for those already familiar with the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "1776 is a two-player, turn-based war game played on a hex grid map of the thirteen colonies and Canada.  It is primarily concerned with the military aspects of the American Revolutionary War. There is a basic game, various scenarios with advanced rules and a campaign game.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 7&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;The shot heard round the world at Lexington set off more than just another brushfire war in England's scattered dominions. It gave birth to a struggling new nation led by a comparative handful of patriots whose refusal to bow before tyranny set the tone for an American heritage preserved from defeat to this very day. But victory did not come cheap. &#10;After showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots. But the coming spring found Clinton facing a revitalized and strengthened rebel army which proceeded to chase him across New Jersey in the Monmouth Campaign. Reassured by news of the French alliance and the great American victory at Saratoga that fall, American troops dug in for what they knew would be a long and bitter battle for independence.&#10;&#10;6 Games in One Package - Each a Realistic Simulation of the War for Independence...&#10;&#10;1776, like all Avalon Hill games, is more than just the standard roll the dice and move game. It is a realistic simulation of the strategic situation faced by British and American alike in that fiery decade when the United States won its independence. &#10;Actually, 1776 is six games in one: a Basic Game that gets you quickly and easily into the routine of simulation gaming; an Advanced Game with scenarios that provides additional complexity and realism; and a Campaign Simulation Game that encompasses the entire war and balances successes in one region against failures in another - truly the ultimate in a simulation gaming experience! &#10;And if you don't have the time for a complete Campaign Game, there are four scenarios to choose from; each of which poses a challenge for everyone; from the most erudite of military historians to the fellow who just managed to pass American History:&#10;&#10;Scenario 1: The Invasion of Canada - 1775 to 1776 - Can YOU do better than the bumbling General Schuyler and Benedict Arnold in the vain American atttempt to make Canada a 14th colony?&#10;&#10;Scenario 2: The Saratoga Campaign - 1777 - Can YOU as General Horatio Gates surround and destroy the forces of the British General Burgoyne in this reinactment of the turning point of the Revolution?&#10;&#10;Scenario 3: Greene's Southern Campaignv - 1780 to 1781 - Can YOU as General Nathaniel Greene lead Cornwallis' tested regulars on a merry chase with your force of rag-tag militia and Guerilla bands without being crushed in a major engagement?&#10;&#10;Scenario 4: The Yorktown Campaign - 1781 - Can you duplicate Washington's encirclement and crushing defeat of Cornwallis in the battle that won the Revolution?&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;&#10;     a 16&quot; x 44&quot; four-section, full color mapboard depicting colonial America from Quebec to Georgia; &#10;     two sets of die-cut troop counters representing over 400 units of Continentals, British Regulars, Rebel and Tory Militia, French Regulars, Indians, and naval units of the British and French fleets; &#10;     1 die; &#10;     1 Terrain Effects Chart; &#10;     2 sets (8 per set) of Tactical Combat Cards used in the innovative, new Sustained Combat system; 1 set of scenario, CRT, and play chart cards organized on an index-card format that puts a summary of all levels of the game at your fingertips; &#10;     a 32-page Rules &amp; Designers' Notes Manual telling you how to play all 6 game versions plus the inside story on research and development and why the game was designed the way it was.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rated &quot;Tournament Level&quot; on Avalon Hill's Simulation-complexity scale.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Reworld, players attempt to terraform a newly discovered planet, and to do that they need to use terrabots to establish new cities and shuttles to deliver materials that will populate those locations.&#10;&#10;In game terms, over five rounds players fill the five levels of their spaceship with tiles featuring terrabots, shuttles, material vessels, and satellites. Each round twenty of these tiles are placed at random around the perimeter of a large ship, and each player receives a hand of cards. On a turn, a player can play one or more cards to claim a tile following these rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If neither tile adjacent to the desired tile has been claimed, the player can lay down any card next to this tile, claim it, then place it in the leftmost space of the level of their spaceship that matches the number of the card played. If you play a 4, for example, then you must place that tile in the leftmost position of your fourth level.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     If one tile adjacent to the desired tile has been claimed, then you must lay down a card of the same number used to claim that previous tile or any two cards of your choice (with those two cards thus serving as a joker). Whatever number is topmost indicates the level of your spaceship on which you must place this tile.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     If both tiles adjacent to the desired tile have been claimed and the cards used to claim them show the same number, then you do the same as described above. If the cards have different numbers, however &mdash; e.g., 1 and 3 &mdash; then you must lay down the same two numbers (1 and 3), one matching number and any other two cards, or any four cards. You place this tile on your spaceship in the same manner previously desired.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has no cards in hand or cannot play further, the round ends. Any remaining tiles are thrown away, then you reset the board and deal out a new hand of cards. After five rounds, players now deploy these tiles onto the new planet, each turn playing 1-3 of the leftmost tiles from the row of their choice to create their personal terraformed world. If you deploy a terrabot, which are labeled A-E, you start a new city with this letter or extend an existing city of yours. Material vessels, which come in five colors, can be delivered to the planet's surface only if attached to shuttles, and each city can have vessels of only a single color. Satellites provide bonus scoring when added to a city. Shuttles and satellites can also be used for shields to protect your newborn planet.&#10;&#10;Players earn points during the first half of the game for picking up terrabots and having cards left in hand. During the second half, players score for deploying satellites and for meeting targets set at the start of the game, e.g. having a city with eight tiles in it, having a city of each letter, emptying a level on your spaceship, having a certain number of shields, etc.&#10;&#10;Once all the spaceships are empty, players score their final points for how well they've developed each city and their shields in comparison with their fellow terraformers. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Numerous scenarios are included to play out various smaller battles in Normandy. It is intended for two players or player teams.&#10;&#10;The game uses a unique sequence of play and a system of fire combat throughout the airdrop and beach assault phases with company-level breakdown units, then a more traditional odds-type combat approach throughout the rest of the game. Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel.&#10;&#10;The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved. Scenarios include &lsquo;Bloody Omaha&rsquo;, &lsquo;Operation Epsom&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cobra&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Fight for Cherbourg&rsquo; and more.&#10;&#10;A future expansion will extend the play area south, to include the Mortain and Falaise scenarios, and extend the campaign to late August and the 3rd Army breakout.&#10;&#10;Game Equipment: &#10;&#10;     One Rule Book &#10;     One Scenario Book &#10;     Five (5) 22x34&rdquo; full color Maps &#10;     Nine (9) full color counter sheets &#10;     8.5x11&rdquo; Allied Air Allocation Log (laminated) &#10;     8.5x11&rdquo; Axis AAA Allocation Log (laminated) &#10;     11x17&rdquo; Turn Record Track &#10;     8.5x11&rdquo; Terrain Effects Chart (x2) &#10;     8.5x11&rdquo; Repl/Recon/Weather chart (x2) &#10;     8.5x11&rdquo; German Record Track &#10;     8.5x11&rdquo; Allied Record Track &#10;     8.5x11&rdquo; Combat Results Table (x2) &#10;     Dice - 3d6 and 1d10&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the GMT Website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Enemy Coast Ahead: The Doolittle Raid uses the game format to explore the first raid on the Japanese home islands by the United States during World War Two. It is a solitaire game challenging the player to conduct a successful mission where the criteria for success is not purely military. The player must organize, equip, and train a squadron of B-25 &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; medium bombers to attack a distant and rather dangerous target. The game not only covers the raid from launch to landing, it extends the story on both ends. Threatened from the air and from the sea, the player must do his utmost to strike the Japanese capital, avenging the attack on Pearl Harbor, and then land his aircraft safely. If the raid goes poorly it may boost Japanese morale and deflate the mood in the United States. Getting the B-25s close enough to launch is vital, as is the recovery of aircraft and crewmen, but above all, the player&rsquo;s main dilemma will be secrecy. The risk is great. Failure could mean the loss of an entire squadron, or worse, the sinking of a precious aircraft carrier. Will the Doolittle Raid add to the dismal news of Pearl Harbor, Guam, Wake Island, and Bataan, or will it signal the turning of the tide?&#10;&#10;The History&#10;Washington &ndash; April 21, 1942: After two days of rumor prompted by Japanese radio broadcasts, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt finally agrees to a press conference. Deftly avoiding difficult questions, he claims insufficient information to neither confirm nor deny the biggest news story of the four month old war. To placate tenacious journalists, however, he tells the press that the attack on Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo by United States aircraft, was launched from a mysterious base he would only call &ldquo;Shangri-La,&rdquo; an imaginary island from the recently published novel Lost Horizon. His impish grin, if not his words, tell the press that the top secret operation dubbed Special Aviation Project Number One has indeed been a success.&#10;&#10;That same day China&rsquo;s foreign minister hands a telegram to Army Air Corps Chief Hap Arnold. It has taken some time to arrive in Washington, an indication that all may not be well with the mission. Dictated two days ago by the commander of that top secret operation, a distraught Lt. Colonel James Doolittle, it reads:&#10;&#10;Mission to bomb Tokyo has been accomplished. On entering China we ran into bad weather and it is feared that all planes crashed.&#10;&#10;Telegram in hand, Arnold immediately admits to the commander of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the mission has failed. No bombers have been recovered. After sending that telegram, Doolittle himself expects a court martial, confiding to his engineer that they&rsquo;ll tie him to a desk for the rest of the war, if he&rsquo;s lucky. Days later he is astonished to learn of his promotion to Brigadier General, and even more so when he is notified that the president recommended the Congressional Medal of Honor.&#10;&#10;The Doolittle Raid remains an enigmatic and contradictory episode of World War Two, defying easy interpretation even to this day. Was it a victory or a debacle? Was it a minor footnote in the annals of that war or a significant military event? Was it a desperate bid to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor, or, a harbinger signaling death and horror soon to visit Japanese cities from the sky?&#10;&#10;Narrative Sequence&#10;Much like chapters in a story, the game is organized in six narrative segments, chronologically arranged. Each poses its own set of challenges and prompts decisions that establish the environment and conditions of subsequent chapters.&#10;&#10;Planning&#10;Naval&#10;Flight&#10;Over Targets&#10;Recovery&#10;Debriefing&#10;&#10;Historical Scenarios&#10;Besides play of the full narrative, the game offers a number of historical dissections, each a scenario focusing on a fragment of the raid. They are also a handy way to learn the game, since each scenario uses only part of the rules. For example, Scenario One covers Doolittle&rsquo;s flight over Tokyo, using only the 8.5x11 Target Map and the Attack Segment. An alternative scenario looks at a night raid by that flight, as Doolittle originally planned it. After playing one or two small scenarios using only the Attack segment&rsquo;s rules, a larger scenario can be played adding the Flight segment. Graduate next to an even larger scenario that starts with the Naval segment. In this way a player can learn the game in program fashion, little by little, studying the history of the raid by playing it as he learns.&#10;&#10;Player Aid Folders: The game comes with several 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; bi-fold aids allowing the play of each game segment with minimal study of the rule book. The mapsheet is designed to interlock with other game components, including those play aids, in order to make the player&rsquo;s experience fluid.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a distant future, scientists were able to build small alternate Earths. Exactly 504 such Earths have thus far been built. The scientists programmed each of these Worlds with an individual set of laws and rules which the residents strictly follow and consider most important for their lives. These may be exploration, consumption, economics, military, etc., and each is unique. You can visit all of these 504 alternate Earths to experience how the people are living, and decide which of these worlds harbors the best civilization. On which World do you want to live? Explore them all and decide!&#10;&#10;504 is a game that creates 504 different games out of one box. The game consists of nine modules:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Module 1: Pick-Up &amp; Deliver&#10;    Module 2: Race&#10;    Module 3: Privileges&#10;    Module 4: Military&#10;    Module 5: Exploration&#10;    Module 6: Roads&#10;    Module 7: Majorities&#10;    Module 8: Production&#10;    Module 9: Shares&#10;&#10;&#10;In each single game, you take three different modules from the nine available and assemble them in any order you like to create a new game. (504 = 9 * 8 * 7 = the number of distinct permutations of three items from a set of nine. The order of the three game modules is significant, and modules cannot be repeated.) For example, you can play:&#10;&#10;&#10;    a racing game that expands through exploration with technology improving the racing or exploration (World &quot;253&quot;).&#10;    an 18XX-style stock game with network building for income and production sites to provide workers for the road building (World &quot;968&quot;).&#10;    a war game with a pick-up and deliver economy and bonus scoring from majorities (&quot;World 417&quot;).&#10;&#10;&#10;Each single game takes from 30 to 120 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Flashpoint: South China Sea is a two-player strategy game that simulates the complex geopolitical contest currently taking place between the United States and China in a disputed region of the South China Sea. The game is driven by a card deck that captures developments ripped straight from today&rsquo;s headlines, bolstered by cards with a context-setting reading of recent history, and a set of speculative cards capturing a diverse range of potential future events.&#10;&#10;The Chinese player works to influence other countries in the region, establish territorial claims and regional hegemony, and improve its world standing. The U.S. player works to maintain influence with allied countries in the region, secure freedom of navigation, and keep China in check. Success for both players hinges on the support and allegiance of non-player countries in the region. The game stops short of dealing with a potential full-scale military conflict. Rather, it requires the nuanced exercise of political, economic, and military resources, in a form of prima facie diplomacy &ndash; on the waters, in the air, and ultimately in the minds of the people &ndash; to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "18Ireland is a member of the 18xx family of games, set in Ireland.&#10;&#10;From the rule book:&#10;18Ireland represents a rather different take on the 18xx system. Ireland was a poor country, but there is no lack of enthusiasm for railways among investors. Up to 13 5-share companies will start in a random sequence. Some of these companies will become successful, others, as a result of underinvestment, isolation or poor timing will struggle to survive. All is not lost for the strugglers, however. A unique shareholder voting mechanism allows companies to merge into 10-share companies(sometimes against their director&rsquo;s wishes) with their more or less successful neighbours.&#10;Track laying provides its own problems as many track tiles are unique. Often, there is no available tile to provide the most efficient route so a roundabout route sometimes must suffice. There are two types of track that can be built: broad gauge and narrow gauge. There are no purchasable narrow gauge locomotives; instead narrow gauge track operates in an abstract way and boosts the value of the broad gauge stations to which it connects.  &#10;Trains in 18Ireland are hex trains. They become obsolete in two stages: rusted trains may be bought back from the bank at half price (but also half capability) and continue to operate until they rot and are then removed. As the game progresses the train rush becomes brutal. Player bankruptcy does not end the game and survivors continue until they have broken a bank that starts with just &pound;4,000.&#10;18Ireland can be played by 3 to 6 players. Experience has shown that at a low player count, this is a &ldquo;run good companies&rdquo; game. At a higher player count, the game is more combative as share portfolios are more diverse and the hostile merger becomes a bigger factor in the game. By choosing the player count, players can select the style of 18xx game that they prefer.&#10;&#10;",

Finishing Time, the after-worker placement game for 1-6 players.&#10;&#10;In Feierabend, you are playing a team of workers (female, male, and non-binary, too). Each day you leave work stressed and look for some fun in the evenings &mdash; but thanks to a 70-hour work week and a low income, you don't have many possibilities for relaxation. Sure, you can head to the pub for drinks, go on blind dates to find a partner, or fish or jog outside, but this is not a good work-life balance. It's a rat race.&#10;&#10;If you really want to relax, you need a higher income for you and your fellow workers &mdash; and the women on your team should be paid the same as the men. You want to work fewer hours each week, and taking a vacation would be good, too. Let the union help you fix this depressing lifestyle. This change might stress your employer, of course, but they already earn enough to be able to de-stress their life.&#10;&#10;Each turn, place one (or more) of your workers on any available after-work spaces to gain relaxation. Taking leisure time doesn't cost anything, but going to town for amusement requires you to spend hard-earned money. Going on vacation for real relaxation is out of the question until your employer is convinced to grant your workers some time off. When your workers meet partners, you gain access to even better relaxation options.&#10;&#10;At the pub, workers can relax and have drinks in front of the bar &mdash; or they can earn additional income and suffer more stress by working a second job there. You'll want to visit the union office, too, to strike for better working conditions. If you have enough strike tokens, you can force your employer to reduce working hours, increase your income, close the gender gap, or even send you on vacation.&#10;&#10;After all your workers have been placed and taken their after-work actions, they are forced to return to work. You place them all on your factory where they then suffer stress, earn income, and gain strike tokens from the union, depending on the current working conditions.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered once a team gathers at least 40 relaxation. (In this game, relaxation is considered to be a currency.) Your workers are then placed on after-work spaces and go back to work one more time, after which the most relaxed team wins Feierabend.&#10;&#10;Create a better (that is, more relaxing) life for your workers and their partners. Which team will relax the best and win the game? But really every team is a winner since they fought for better working conditions. Workers unite!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Alhambra: The Card Game is a game that both inspired and was named after the more popular, award-winning game and franchise, Alhambra.&#10;&#10;This game has been released in several different versions, with the same core rules but different themes. The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Game: Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra.  Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.&#10;&#10;The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:&#10;1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;&#10;Stimmt So! A description of this version:&#10;Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six &#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Al Capone  A description of this version:&#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.&#10;&#10;Other versions/re-themes:&#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game. The re-themes are collectors items that people like to collect.&#10;&#10;Player Counts:&#10;Earlier versions typically had a player count of 3-6 players while more recent versions, such as New York, is listed as 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;",

Soviet play requires the use of a ponderous and fragile weapon of great size (the Red Army of 1942). German play requires sabre-like use of mobile reserves in hit and run attacks.&#10;&#10;History: (from the back of the box:)&#10;The German Wehrmacht stands at the pinnacle of  its last season of blitzkrieg. Embattled German troops hold most of the city of Stalingrad &shy; but the flanks are covered with less dependable Axis allied units. Opposing these flanks are the shock troops of the 1942 Soviet winter counteroffensive.

Your dice represent the actions you can take, such as buying ingredients, participating in monthly events, adding flavors to your recipes, and of course, brewing beer! Homebrewers is played over eight months (eight rounds). Each month, you meet with the homebrewing club one weekend (trade phase) and take actions the other weekends (action phase).&#10;&#10;You'll be crafting your own unique beer recipes in four categories (Ale, Porter, Stout, and IPA). Each time you brew a particular recipe, your quality level for that recipe increases.&#10;&#10;You gain reputation in two main ways. First, by moving up the quality tracks for the four beer categories in order to win medals at Summerfest and Octoberfest, and second, by crafting your recipes to meet the particular tastes of a panel of judges at Octoberfest.&#10;&#10;At the end of eight months, if you've gained the most reputation as your club's best brewer, you win!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Divine is dead, the Void approaches, and the powers lying dormant within you are soon to awaken. Divinity: Original Sin &ndash; The Board Game is an epic adventure set in the world of Rivellon. Up to 4 players take their heroes on a branching, narrative adventure filled with tactical combat and meaningful choices.&#10;&#10;Based on the award-winning video game Divinity: Original Sin II by Larian Studios, the board game expands Divinity in new directions, offering new characters, stories, side quests, skills, items, and monsters in this brand-new tabletop experience.&#10;&#10;Players embark on a journey through the Divine Atlas, an interactive book that charts the various realms and locations of Rivellon. This team of adventurers will make key decisions about where to go and how to respond to the world around them.&#10;&#10;A full journey through the Divine Atlas takes approximately 20 hours to complete, encompassing around 16 of the Atlas's 50 locations. The decisions players make during exploration, combat, and character creation can significantly influence the story and the course of the adventure. With various ways to finish the game and multiple diverging paths and choices, no two adventures will be the same. Choices you make will be documented from session to session, creating a responsive experience where player decisions matter and their consequences have tangible effects on the story.&#10;Players can choose a character from 10 unique Origin stories, equip items, runes, and learn skills from 12 skill schools, each with 7 unique skills. Players use the skills acquired throughout the game to perform unique and powerful attacks, some with additional elemental effects. Most skills require a cooldown period before they can be used again, so choosing when to use them is critically important.&#10;&#10;The iconic elemental interactions from Divinity: Original Sin are present here! You can, for example, cover an area in oil so that another player can ignite it with a fire spell, setting the entire area ablaze. Alternatively, your ally can cast rain to make the area wet, allowing you to use lightning to stun the enemy. Creating combinations is essential to ensure victory against the most challenging of enemies. However, be aware that enemies can also create combinations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tin Goose is a game about the early years of commercial air travel. Beginning as a regional operation with just an airmail route and a &quot;tin goose&quot; (the Ford Trimotor), players build an airline empire through the 1930s and 40s. As the game progresses, planes improve, being safer and more fuel efficient while having a longer range. Companies become more organized and shed their early inefficiencies. The stakes of a disaster &mdash; crashes, strikes, and oil shocks &mdash; get higher.&#10;&#10;A deck of 96 cards includes all of the planes and events that enter the game. Of these, only about 36 are played in any given session, and all of those exist in players' hands at the outset. The result is a game of &quot;calamities&quot; with more planning and less luck: A skillful player seeing high bids on the safest planes may guess several bidders are holding crash cards.&#10;&#10;Tin Goose is a business game that features a balance between greed and fear, without random events. It's designed by Matt Calkins, who previously designed Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan, and will be available in print from Rio Grande Games and digitally in the Apple iTunes store.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Artaios, the First Father, had six children with his wife, Branwen, the First Mother. They grew up to be gods and guardians of the biosphere. The siblings loved each other very much. They were strong of build and sharp of mind. Whatever they attempted, they succeeded with ease, and faultlessly. When the young gods had grown to adulthood, Artaois and Branwen bade them each create something to add it to their creation, so that it would enrich the world and populate it. And thus, the gods created six very different types.&#10;&#10;Time passed and the creations of the gods multiplied and spread without restraint across the biosphere. And so it came to pass that Artaios and Branwen bade their children bring order to their creation. Whoever would be the first to bring their population into accord with the biological order would be called &quot;Lord of Creation&quot; from thereon.&#10;&#10;In Biosphere, the player siblings each control groups of different populations (dubbed &quot;types&quot; in game terms). In each round, a percentage of the types goes extinct, then players receive and spend evolutionary points to make their types either larger or smaller, and more versatile or more dedicated depending on what they think is appropriate for the landscape (which is scaled based on the number of players) and the current state of the game. Reproduction, movement, and lifespan can all be modified by players during the game. If a player meets the right conditions, they can play one development card from hand, gaining benefits from this. Players then move across the landscape, reproduce, and fill the different terrains based on their positions relative to other players.&#10;&#10;How do the siblings prove their worth to Artaios and Branwen? By fulfilling assignments revealed at the start of play. One assignment is drawn from each of seven categories, and once a player completes an assignment, they mark it, with others still being able to mark it later. Whoever first fulfills five assignments wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

One day, though, they were tricked: The angelic guardians were turned into stone and demons flood the world ever since.&#10;&#10;Eons later, a captain named Kareem found a petrified angel on a remote rock off the shores of an island. Kareem managed to awake the angel Leanas, who told him about the island of EOS and gifted him with immortality. In return, Kareem swore an oath: To awake Leanas' brothers and sisters, who were still petrified on EOS. Together they would fight back the demons, forcing them to return to the abyss they came from and freeing the world of their dark powers once again.&#10;&#10;EOS: Island of Angels is an engine-building board game for 2-5 players, which also includes some worker placement mechanisms. Players hire a unique, asymmetrical crew and set sail to the island of EOS, to free the angels of old and leave their mark on this mythical world's chronicle. Be wary though: While exploring the ocean, vicious demons will attack the ships and crews. Fighting them and their powerful demon lords will bring players glory and help restore the angels' power. Through awakening angels, players can gain powerful blessings that pose as an advantage to their strategy, while demons sabotage the ship, resulting in disadvantages.&#10;&#10;Finding the perfect balance between progressing on their journey and fighting demons while improving their ship and crew is key for players to gain the most victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The rules are available for free on Knizia's web site. The game is played with eight dice, pen, and paper. In each event, each player rolls a pool of dice, rerolling a limited number of times, and freezing desired rolls. The goal is to obtain the highest score across all the events.&#10;&#10;The first edition of the game (in German) and the second printed English edition (a translation of the first edition) give two variants:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Energy: each player starts the game with a fixed amount of energy and must use one unit of it for each roll. Some minor adjustments are made to the rules for two of the events. Remaining energy can optionally be added to each player's score.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     With two or more players you can play a championship game where the best scorer in an event gets as many points as there are players, the next-best gets one less, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;The web-published version includes a different version of the second variant (3/2/1 for 1st/2nd/3rd place, ties are friendly).&#10;&#10;",

Set in the world of Vengeance and designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi, Noralie Lubbers and Gordon Calleja, Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is a standalone game that transforms the fast-paced dice puzzles of the original Vengeance into roll-and-write mechanisms in which you're building combos, striking off enemies, and scoring points for an action-packed, brain-teasing fighting game that's easy to learn and hard to master.&#10;&#10;The aim of Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is to infiltrate a gang den, carve your way through its rooms, and kill the Boss, while completing side objectives printed on the dens themselves.&#10;&#10;The game is split into three parts: planning, fighting and montage. In the planning phase players roll and re-roll 4 dice in real time, aiming to roll a combination of dice that match an ability they wish to trigger in the upcoming, fight phase. Assigning dice to an ability allows players to fill their hand back to four dice from a large, common pool and repeat the process as quickly as they can manage.&#10;&#10;Once the dice pool is depleted, the fighting proper begins. Here players take a set of dice assigned to an ability and execute that ability, moving their piece through rooms full of enemies, and crossing them out when they are hit with the multitude of available abilities. Finally, players heal and upgrade their characters, bring new abilities and items into play to help them on their road to vengeance.&#10;&#10;Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight comes in two boxes: Episode 1 and Episode 2. Both episodes are standalone games with the same rules, but with entirely different content: different heroes, dens, bosses, abilities and items. Each episode accommodates up to four players, so combining the two increases the player count from 1-4 to 1-8! Content in both Episodes can be switched like-for-like as you choose.&#10;&#10;",

Both the correct guesser and the player who created that image score points &ndash; but here's the catch: Drawings are revealed according to the number of pixels used, so the fewer pixels you use, the more likely you are to show your image first, but the less likely other players are to guess what it is.

However, the convenient route meant that attempts were conducted to transport the coveted coal resource along the river at the beginning of the industrial revolution. The first coal barges reached Kettwig in spring 1770. A little while later, barges reached the Rhine mouth at Ruhrort. The empty barges were drawn upstream by horses afterwards.&#10;&#10;However, the Ruhr was not generally navigable in this time. Large dams at mills and low dams for fishing were common. At these spots the coal had to be transferred from one barge to the next. This decreased the quality of the coal considerably &ndash; sometimes only &quot;coal dust&quot; reached Ruhrort. Only the building of 14 locks between Witten and Ruhrort changed this.&#10;&#10;The Ruhr remained an important route for coal until the end of the 19th century. At that time the railway superseded it.&#10;&#10;In Ruhrschifffahrt 1769-1890, 2-4 players transport and sell coal along the Ruhr river in Germany as profitably as possible. Progress markers are helping them. The position of each player's Ruhr barge is most important; the player furthest upriver is allowed to conduct his action first in each phase of a game turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Part of the Kosmos two-player series, Elk Fest or Elchfest is a two player dexterity game in which players attempt to navigate their moose across a river along a series of stones. Players take turns flicking 2 stones, represented by disks, and moving their moose along said stones. Care must be taken when moving ones moose as if the front and back hooves of the moose do not rest atop of the stones the players turn immediately ends, the moose is returned to its previous position, and the opposing player may flick 3 stones. The winner is the first person to move their moose to the opposing river bank!&#10;&#10;Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Two elk (Jule and Ole) stare at each other across a river. Longing for the greener grass where the other elk is, they set out to beat each other to the opposite bank! In Elk Fest, move your elk to the other bank by flicking wooden disks across the table and balancing your elk on them. Can your elk get to the greener grass across the river? Good grazing is just a stone's flick away!&#10;&#10;Boazu is a Nordic edition from 2024 featuring reindeer but identical rules.&#10;&#10;",

You will not know that a Japanese air strike is headed your way until it actually appears in the skies above your task force.

Set in The Five Realms universe (Merchants Cove, Rise to Nobility, Cavern Tavern), players will adventure to the Halfling Realm, the home to the finest, highly-talented, and most-legendary Bards of all the land.&#10;&#10;As Bards, players will manage a unique tempo dial mechanism to build temporary Song tableaus from your deck, while exploring and activating locations around the lush woodland city. Each Bard starts with asymmetric skill decks that match their style, such as the Bardbarian, Sword Dancer, and Wardrummer. Learn new Bardic skills, tell tales and perform gigs, soothe the dissonant creatures invading the Grove, and contend with other Bards for the most Glory and Fame. Once all Glory has been collected, the Bard with the most combined Glory and Fame wins!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players draw two cards from their unique skill deck and play one to their Story (discard pile) for instant benefits, while the other is added to their Song (tableau). Bardwood Grove challenges players to carefully craft their Song tableaus, coordinating them with their Composition cycle that governs how frequently they sing. As players strategically use resources to upgrade their decks, Songs will release powerful combos and allow players to interact with multiple locations. This creates a unique ebb and flow to the game, as players build their songs, and then decide when and where to sing them.&#10;&#10;Rumor has it that Bardwood Grove is full of hidden secrets. As the game is played and decisions are made, players will unlock content and evolve the game naturally.  An achievement system tied to the choices and performances of each game will guide players through a series of unlockable content.  As new content emerges through each play, the game will provide players with new content that is based on unique outcomes and player decisions. Grove locations will change, additional Bardic skills can be unlocked, Bard decks become more powerful, new Bards arrive in town, and a variety of characters (both good and bad) can enter the game.&#10;&#10;Unravel the mysteries of Bardwood Grove!&#10;&#10;",

He asked the other animals for help, from Swift Sparrow to King Tiger, but they all ignored his pleas. Until Tiny Ant climbed into Tiger's ear and ordered him to help. King Tiger was scared by the voice in his ear. He commanded all animals to look for the bean, and no one dared to refuse. Eventually, Swift Sparrow found the bean, and Hungry Monkey was finally happy.&#10;&#10;Hungry Monkey is a card game where the goal is to get rid of your hand cards and collect beans. You have animal cards both in hand and in a face-down row. You must be the first to play all your cards, first from your hand and then from your card row.&#10;&#10;You have to play cards with the same or a higher number. You can trigger an effect with a powerful animal.&#10;&#10;If you want to play multiple games you keep track of the scoring with Bean cards. The player with the most beans at the end of the last game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

That said, the game has only a single winner &ndash; the player who has the most investigation points at the end of the game. (Villains come in three levels of difficulty, and at the start of the game, you create a villain stack with one card of each difficulty level being chosen at random.)&#10;&#10;The game uses three currencies &ndash; combat (red), cunning (green) and spirit (blue) &ndash; with some cards having a silver cost that can be paid with any currency. Players can acquire cards from a row of six that are available from the main deck or from piles of cards that are always available. If you fight the &quot;Hungry Dead&quot; &ndash; an always available card that costs one of each color &ndash; you can remove a card from your deck or from the central row.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dark Secrets&quot; are a special type of card that get added to your deck through various means. The card is worth negative points at the end of the game, but should you draw it during play, you remove it from the game, then draw a &quot;Shocking Discovery&quot; &ndash; which will affect you or all players with some kind of pernicious effect.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Dien Bien Phu - The Final Gamble&quot; is a two-player wargame about the decisive battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 that not only ended the French Indochina War but also had political repercussions far outside the region itself. One player represents France and her colonial troops. The other player represents the armed force of Viet Minh, the communist/nationalist independence movement of Vietnam. This is a cage fight. There are no victory points, there is no marginal victory and there is no draw. Viet Minh wins by forcing the French troops to surrender. France wins by not surrendering.&#10;&#10;Map and scale: The map covers the former village of Dien Bien Phu and surrounding areas. There is a small submap of the French strongpoint &quot;Isabelle&quot; further south in the valley. There are several groups of French strongpoints scattered around the map, each one with a female name (all named after the commander - de Castries' - mistresses, according to lore). The map is divided into three divisional sectors (plus a fourth one facing the submap &quot;Isabelle&quot;). Each sector has several zones that represent Viet Minh trenches winding from the map edge towards the center of the map. Each hex represents 150 meters and each game turn covers three days. There are 21 turns in the game, but historically, it ended after 19 game turns with a Viet Minh victory. The scale allows stacking of three French units (usually infantry companies) in a hex, but there are no stacking limits for Viet Minh battalions, which creates a chess feel.&#10;&#10;Three Viet Minh battalions form a regiment and three regiments become a division and there were almost four full divisions in the valley, as well as a full artillery division off map. There was also an equivalent of another three divisions in a replacement pool outside the valley. The French troops were a colorful array of colonial paras, Vietnamese troops, units from French Algeria and Morocco, and, of course, the French Foreign Legion. Some units are of average quality, some are outright terrible, but some are the very best that could be mustered ... anywhere. A French battalion consisted of four companies and there were 12 battalions together with 11 auxiliary light companies at the start of the siege, as well as 16 artillery and mortar batteries, and three tank platoons. Waiting in Hanoi were another five para battalions together with an expected replacement pool of about 14 companies. In neighboring Laos, there were four battalions ready to march and perhaps save the day at the very end.&#10;&#10;French supply: This battle took place far out in the wilderness of Vietnam and both sides had to adjust to the limited flow of supplies that could be brought forward, though the air to the French, and through vast forests to the Viet Minh. Supplies, as historically was the case, tend to be a lot less than wished for. There are several supply tracks on the map showing how much ammo, food &amp; bullets, fuel &amp; spares, medicine as well as the amount of truck transport available for the French. Each game turn air transports will bring in a mix of supplies together with replacements and reinforcements. This is done on a chart with a grid where a mix of supply markers are placed together with eventual reinforcements and replacements. Weather will then decide what will arrive and what will abort back to Hanoi. The French player will never know for sure what and how much will arrive and has to take that into account.&#10;&#10;Viet Minh supply and morale: Viet Minh will receive a more steady flow of ammunition, but not enough to barrage whenever wished. There is a large pool of replacements to use, but although it is large, it is not infinite. If Viet Minh losses are too heavy, then the fact that you can only replace one step per regiment per game turn will be a painful experience. If loses are too heavy for too long, then the pool will dry out. Viet Minh's main concern is troop morale. The battle force starts with excellent morale, but each division's morale will decrease when taking replacements thus diluting the experienced veterans with newly drafted peasants with no combat experience. Morale will rise slightly when resting (not assaulting). But then again, time flies and there is a battle to win. Morale is a very important part of the game and if it falls too low, the troops will be rendered useless.&#10;&#10;Artillery: Artillery is another important aspect of the battle. There is bombardment from both sides before assaults commence. You wish to achieve two things with barrage: Losses and to make the target shaken. Targets that are shaken lose abilities to react and support combat, and they become easier to assault. Defending units bring in barrage to make it harder for the attacker to succeed. Viet Minh artillery is off-board and safe from French artillery fire (mainly that they were dug deep into the mountainsides). French artillery and mortar units, on the other hand, exist as units on the board and may fall prey to Viet Minh bombardment. French artillery units that are reduced and/or shaken are not as efficient, and those that are eliminated are obviously out of play. Both sides have a limited amount of ammunition and therefore have to spend it wisely.&#10;&#10;Combat: The main effort in the game is, of course, the assaults. Each player will conduct two die-rolls during the course of an assault to determine the outcome. The defender first conducts defensive fire in the hopes of inflicting losses, but also to possibly force the attacker abort the assault. The defender&rsquo;s first die roll is compared to their strength and will show how well they defend. The defender&rsquo;s second die-roll (modified from the result of the first die roll), is compared to the assaulting unit's morale and will determine the result of the defensive fire. Providing the assaulting units do not abort, the attacker (who has suffered the effects of the defensive fire) conducts two die rolls. The first one to see how well the assault is conducted, and the second one to see the outcome of the assault. Modifications, such as trenches, terrain, support from other units, etc., adjust the strength of a unit to make it stronger or weaker.&#10;&#10;You will never know for sure what that result will be due to the two die-rolls on each side. Dien Bien Phu &ndash; The Final Gamble, will be as tense and brutal a simulation as was the historical battle that determined the fate of this war as well as shaping the events of things to come.&#10;&#10;Kim Kanger&#10;&#10;",

Many time you are ambushed. Sometimes you are the &quot;lead tank&quot; and draw the enemies fire.

    "Description": "Europe in Turmoil is a card-driven game set at the beginning of the 20th Century in which two players each assume the role of a political ideology ascendant in Europe at that time, with one side playing the Liberal (representing not just Liberal but also Socialist principles) and the other side playing the Authoritarian (representing the repressive, autocratic regimes of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia).&#10;&#10;The card playing mechanic is closely related to that of Twilight Struggle or 1989: Dawn of Freedom, with the Naval Arms Race (representing the Dreadnought build-up between Germany and Britain) the closest equivalent to the Space Race / Tiananmen track from the aforementioned games.&#10;&#10;The map represents the political reality of Europe in the late Victorian era, with the politics of continental Europe dominated by the four superpowers of Austria-Hungary, France, Germany and Russia. The rest of the Nations of Europe (and northern Africa) are represented by 'independent' client states who are to be &quot;taken under the wing&quot; to win the game.&#10;&#10;Many of the events refer to (historical) crises which could have started a World War. Each of these events will increase the Tension between the European Nations and cause a Crisis roll, a roll modified by both the current Tension and the amount of Alliances that have been made by the major powers of Europe. Eventually, unless Tension is managed carefully, such a Crisis roll will spark the Outbreak of the Great War, ending the game after resolution of the war and a final Scoring.&#10;&#10;Will the strongly Authoritarian Empires of Central Europe hold out against rising Liberalism? Will the Workers combine forces with land-hungry Farmers and marginalized Intelligentsia to oust the ruling Bourgeois, Nobility and Monarchy? Will &ldquo;The Great War&rdquo; break out, shattering the Status Quo? These and other exciting possibilities will soon be open to players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Noah is tearing out his beard as he doesn't have much time left to finish loading his ark. After all, the clouds are gathering and the rain could come at anytime. Meanwhile, the animals are gathering before the ark and waiting to be told who goes in which stalls. A handful of people have showed up to offer help, but they look like gamblers and game players!&#10;&#10;In Ark, the players need to help load animals and supplies into Noah's ark in preparation for the rains to come &ndash; but you can't just shove animals into stalls willy-nilly. If the meat eaters are boarded with plant eaters, you won't have those plant eaters around by the time the water recedes. Animals from cold and warm climates also need to be bunked separately so that they can all be comfortable. On top of all that, you have to worry about the weight of the animals; load too many on one side of the ark and you'll all be treading water for the next forty days and forty nights...&#10;&#10;The game consists of cards, animal tokens, and &quot;action&quot; discs.  Your goal is to place your animal tokens (as victory points) based on characteristics of the animal and provision cards loaded on the &quot;ark&quot;.  Each player takes turns either placing cards or drawing cards from a face-up draft pile (Card Drafting) and the supply stack.  Each card has characteristics (such as the animal size, diet, climate, scoring category, and special ability).  Animals and provisions must be placed according to rules that prevent animals from eating each other, eating the supplies, or tipping the &quot;ark&quot; with their combined weight.  When a card is played, the player may place a &quot;victory point&quot; animal token on one of the 5 scoring category cards.  In this way, the game combines Tile Placement of the cards with Set Collection for types of victory points.  The game ends when a fifth &quot;Rain Card&quot;, somewhat randomly shuffled into the deck, is drawn.  Players then score points for their animal tokens, and bonus points for having the most or second most tokens per category.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Jerusalem in the 12th Century was a city embroiled in intrigues and power struggles. The Crusader Houses established themselves as the city's rulers, but who would rule over them? Now you must join in the power politics of the holy city, using your resources to control the most important districts and building a castle that towers over your opposition. Prove yourself the most capable Baron, and take your rightful place as the ruler of Jerusalem!&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;The goal for each player is to control the key Sectors of the city: the King, the Church, the Market, the Military, the Nobilty and the Tower of David. This control is achieved gaining the favors of the most important roles of the city (such as the Constable) and by placing Men and Barons into these Sectors. Who owns the most forces gets the Revenue of that area: Men, Gold and Tower-Points. The players can use these new resources to improve their position in the city. At the end of each round the players can rise their Towers building new floors. Also players will have to manage the Special Privileges and bad Events that will take place at end of each Round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the highest Tower will be the winner and his family will rule the city!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From 1941 through 1943, Army Group South fought a campaign in southern Russia. Hitler issued goals that ranged from the far oil fields to a city on the Volga by the name of Stalingrad, finally deciding not to decide and ordered the far flung Army Group to divide and go for both.&#10;&#10;Across endless steppe, in the blazing sun and freezing cold, the Axis legions advanced to the edge of Asia and the Caucasus mountains. Some of the oil fields, and most of the city were taken.&#10;&#10;Then the Red Army had its turn...&#10;&#10;Case Blue is a game that covers both the Axis advance (1941 and 1942) as well as the Soviet counterattacks (Nov 42 to Jan 43) and the German counteroffensive at Kharkov (Feb-March 1943) that ended the series of campaigns in the south. The game covers in great detail all the operations from October 1941 until May 1943 on a large play area extending from Voronezh almost to the Turkish border. The full scope and grandiose nature of these operations come to life here.&#10;&#10;Case Blue covers and replaces the 1994 award winning game Enemy at the Gates. Players get to encircle Stalingrad, run their pocket and relief attempts and the many operations that game covered.&#10;&#10;Case Blue is the 10th game in the award winning Operational Combat System and is the result of over 6 years of intensive research and testing. Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions (OK, there are a few very strange companies), making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.&#10;&#10;Case Blue is designed to be played both separately or linked to the 2001 game Guderian&#039;s Blitzkrieg II. The monster linked game allows players to run operations on the entire Eastern Front (except for Leningrad) from the fall of 1941 until mid-1943.&#10;&#10;Multiple scenarios (one map to very large) allow play to be picked up at various key points in the campaign.&#10;&#10;If you want a serious look at these pivotal campaigns while having fun at the same time, this is the game for you.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the Operational Combat System finest hour, this game is huge.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: Half Week&#10;    Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;    Units: Company to Division&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    Nine 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets (Maps A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K)&#10;    One 14 x 22&quot; full-color mapsheet (Map E)&#10;    Ten dual-side printed countersheets (2,660 1/2&quot; Unit counters)&#10;    Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; Marker counters)&#10;    One 48-page OCS v4.0 series rules booklet&#10;    One 16-page Case Blue game rules booklet&#10;    One 80-page Case Blue Scenario Book 1&#10;    One 48-page Case Blue Scenario Book 2&#10;    One 24-page Case Blue Axis Booklet&#10;    One 24-page Case Blue Russian Booklet&#10;    Two 4-page two-color OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;    Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(from MMP web site:)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pacific Typhoon is a strategy card game for 3-7 players, ages 10 to adult. The game uses the same system that first appeared in the popular 1998 Avalon Hill card game Atlantic Storm.&#10;&#10;The game setting is the naval and air war in the Pacific theatre during World War II. Pacific Typhoon depicts the history of the air-naval battles of the Pacific War with 40 battle cards, each of which represents an historical naval or air battle such as Pearl Harbor, Midway, Surigao Strait, etc. Players compete by fighting a non-sequential series of twenty of these battles. A battle lasts for one round of play, so each player gets to play once per battle. The round-leader starts by picking one of two battle cards (he discards the unpicked one). The chosen battle card determines the year of battle. The battle card is also worth a certain number of victory points and resources to whoever wins it. The round-leader alternates after each battle, and the game ends after 20 battles (when the Battle Card deck is exhausted).&#10;&#10;Players are not assigned to sides. Instead, each player has a hand of force cards that typically includes both Allied and Japanese cards. The force cards represent warships, submarines, aircraft, special weapons, and events. Non-event cards have three separate combat values: Air, Surface, and Sub. For example, the battlecruiser Kirishima has combat values of 1 air, 4 surface and 0 sub; the submarine Flasher has combat values of 0 air, 1 surface and 3 sub; the Zero fighter (Sakai) has combat values of 3 air, 0 surface and 0 sub. Force cards are also worth victory points because they can be destroyed in battle.&#10;&#10;After the round-leader selects the battle card, he announces the &quot;suit&quot; of battle: Air, Surface, Sub or Combined. Only the combat values in the announced suit will affect the outcome of the battle. In a Combined battle, the combat values of all three suits are added together. The round-leader also announces the time of battle: Day or Night. Some force cards are only playable in a day battle (for example, the aircraft carrier Lexington), a few are only playable in a night battle, but most are playable in day or night battles. The round-leader then gets to play from his hand. He may play on one side or the other (but not both sides together). Each player after him in turn may then play on one side or the other.&#10;&#10;",

They explore, using a new movement mechanic, for the raw materials they need to build the settlement. Along the way, they discover useful natural products - but also encounter wild animals and are confronted with adventurous situations. Those who survive these encounters obtain the raw materials they sought as well as experience points that improve the abilities of the player's character. Over time, then, the player becomes stronger, smarter or more charismatic and is better and better suited for the dangers of the wild.&#10;&#10;Back in the village, the natural products can be used to brew beverages while the raw materials are used for building. Through this building, the settlement grows and players obtain victory points.&#10;&#10;The main attraction of the game lies in the exploration of the island and the development of the individual player characters. But trading and interaction between the players is also important.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This racing game is packaged in a long, plastic tube.  Included in the game are huge maps on large poster-sized sheets, a collection of miniature touring cars (complete with spoilers, hood ornaments, roll-bars and lots of other details), and dice.&#10;&#10;The cars are lined up and the race begins.  Going in order from first to last, players have a choice of rolling one, two, or three dice.  The first die is a special die with only 1's, 2's and 3's on it, but the other two are normal d6.  The dice may be flipped to the opposite face. Before moving the car, the player must commit to the order that the dice will be used. The dice are then used to move your car.  However, if you use a die for movement in a corner that's not rated for that speed, you'll get a driving error.  Depending on the severity, you might have to journey through pit row on the next lap.  Dice showing 2,3,5 allow the car to move diagonally, or else the car must maintain its lane. There is a drafting mechanism that entails following into specially marked spaces. All of this would make the game fairly computational and boring, until you time the players' turns and make the rule, &quot;A die laid is a die played...&quot;&#10;&#10;The original game came with the DTM Hockenheimring track and there are two subsequent maps to find or purchase, which includes the latest track released at Essen 2000.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    N&uuml;rburgring&#10;    Oschersleben&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sixty years of tense, uneasy peace are shattered as the Korean Peninsula erupts in renewed warfare. One historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous people polarized and separated by superpower politics and economics hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their arbitrary division once and for all.&#10;&#10;From Pyongyang in North Korea to Busan in the South, the war rages. In a scene reminiscent of the first attack by the In Min Gun in 1950, the North Korean People&rsquo;s Army surges across the Demilitarized Zone and penetrates deep into South Korea.&#10;&#10;Special Operations Forces from both sides conduct raids, interdiction, and reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines while airborne, air assault, and amphibious forces strike far behind those lines attempting to outflank the main army forces of both sides. In the air, both sides wage a heated campaign in an effort to establish superiority over the skies of Korea. With rough terrain and the full ferocity of modern armor, airmobile, airborne, and marine warfighting capabilities, there is no safe haven in the lethal cauldron of battle which has engulfed the Korean Peninsula.&#10;&#10;While North and South battle for a quick, decisive victory, the world awaits the response of the two military superpowers in the region: the United States of America and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. Will the United States, stung by high casualties among the soldiers of its 2nd Infantry Division near the DMZ during the surprise artillery barrages and initial assaults on the first day of the war, be able to reinforce the South quickly enough, and, if so, how and in what strength? Will the Communist Chinese again react (or pre-emptively intervene) to a massive US response and join the fray, thus widening the conflict? As the situation evolves, choices are made, forces are committed, and the security of Japan and the future of the two Koreas hangs in the balance.&#10;&#10;Next War: Korea, the first of a planned series of Next War games, allows players to fight a near future war on the Korean peninsula. In this updated and improved version of the previously-released Crisis: Korea 1995, players have access to virtually all military assets of North and South Korea, as well as large forces from the USA and the PRC. The integrated, easy to learn air-land combat system allows for unit efficiency, armor effects, light infantry, attack helicopters, Close Air Support, Cruise Missiles, and the particularly tough terrain of Korea.&#10;&#10;Make no mistake: Next War: Korea is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;So our hope is that we have created a game with enough variety and scaling of complexity that you can find an engaging and maybe even enlightening experience whether you want to play a fast two-player game, a longer monster game, or an ongoing solitaire study. We intend to provide tools for online game play as well (a Vassal module is being created now for use during playtesting) so that this game can be played in either real-time or over longer periods on the internet.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;UnitsGround units in Next War: Korea represent primarily divisions and brigades of armies of North and South Korea, The United States and her Allies, and the People's Republic of China. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and TerrainThe game's two maps present a portion of modern-day Korea at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The maps cover the entire peninsula east-to-west and stretch from about 30 miles north of Pyongyang in the North to Taegu in the south. Hexes are larger than the standard 1/2&quot; hex found in Crisis Korea: 1995, allowing us to use larger 9/16&quot; counters in this game and make it a bit easier for players to move game pieces in the congested areas around the DMZ.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game SystemAs in Crisis: Korea 1995, there are two types of game turns: Initiative turns (longer turns where the side with the Initiative has more opportunities to move and attack) and Contested turns (shorter turns where neither side has the initiative but each is trying to muster the resources to regain the initiative). Thus the inherent &quot;initiative player advantage&quot; built into the game system incents each player to always be thinking about how to seize and maintain the battlefield initiative.&#10;&#10;A Standard game turn is composed of:&#10;&#10;    Weather Determination. Bad weather can severaly hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.&#10;    Initiative Determination&#10;&#10;&#10;an Air/Naval Phase, wherein air superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.&#10;&#10;    One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns&#10;    Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements&#10;    Victory Determination&#10;&#10;&#10;Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody, reflecting both what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early on in light of the massive artillery concentrations near the DMZ as well as the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses, but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapidity and pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ScenariosThere are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three one mappers, &quot;Seoul Train,&quot; &quot;Uijong Blues,&quot; and &quot;East Coast Highway&quot; (North Map only) cover the first week of the war by dividing the DMZ into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults to break the South Korean lines and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire DMZ front scenario, &quot;Militarized Zone,&quot; (North Map only) for the first week (basically, combining the three scenarios above). In addition, players can add the South Map and play the entire Standard Campaign game, &quot;All In.&quot; Two other scenarios are provided which examine the U.S. Amphibious landing. &quot;Inchon Again&quot; and the battle for Taejon, &quot;Spearhead.&quot; In addition, a scenario, &quot;They Did What?&quot; is provided for players to experiement with a South Korean attack on North Korea without, however, the help of the United States.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.&#10;&#10;There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan &#226;&#128;&#147; The Fifth Arab-Israeli War to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Korean players in the region.&#10;&#10;In Next War: Korea, the Korean Peninsula is on fire with two of the world's most well-prepared, antagonistic forces arrayed against each other. Can you, as the North Korean People&rsquo;s Army commander, conquer the South in 3 weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of Korea&rsquo;s Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will China do?

The goal each round is to have a hand of cards with a higher sum than the opponent, but equal to or less than the sum played to the table.&#10;&#10;To set up a round, deal six cards face down to each player, then remove the remaining four cards, unseen, from the game. On your turn, you take one of these five actions:&#10;&#10;1: PLAY a card from your hand to the table, overlapping any cards previously played and announcing the sum of all revealed cards.&#10;&#10;2: DRAW the most recently played card from the table and place it in front of you; this card counts as being in your hand, thereby increasing the sum of your hand and lowering the sum on the table, but you cannot discard or play this card.&#10;&#10;3: DISCARD a 6 card from your hand, placing it to the side out of play for this round.&#10;&#10;4: KNOCK to end the round and see who wins; you may do this only if the sum of cards in your hand is equal to or less than the sum on the table. The players then compare sums, and whoever has the highest sum (without going over the sum of cards on the table) wins 2 points; if the players are tied, the player who knocked loses.&#10;&#10;5: FOLD to end the round because you think that you will lose; the opponent wins 1 point.&#10;&#10;Shuffle all the cards, and redeal; the player who scored in the round starts the next round, and the first player to collect 6 points wins. Alternatively, players can play only a single round to determine the winner, ignoring the FOLD action since that's a sure loser...&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Catherine: The Cities of the Tsarina takes 2-4 players to the Tsarist Empire of 1762 to win the Tsarina's favor with the help of an innovative card mechanism. As is so often the case, different strategies can lead to different goals: Do you devote yourself to the development of the fine arts or trade, or do you perhaps prefer to secure arms and thus perpetuate the empire? With each card you hold, you must decide whether to gain the resources and use the action on that card or whether to throw it away to activate another action.&#10;&#10;To start the game, choose three of the six project cards in your hand and place them in your action row. At the top of each project card is a list of three cities or an assortment of cannons, books, and goods; at the bottom of each project card is an action and (in most cases) a bonus.&#10;&#10;The game lasts three decades, with each decade lasting four rounds. Players play simultaneously during each round. At the start of a round, draw two cards, then play one card in your action row and another card in your activation row &mdash; located below your action row &mdash; under any project card in your action row that has not been activated. If the activation card matches the color of the action card above it, you carry out that action, whether it's placing a residence on the map, gaining cards, exchanging cards for points or a favor, gaining favor by having cannons or books, etc. If you carried out the action and the card has a bonus, you then get that bonus once. If the activation card doesn't match in color or you choose not to do the action, you draw a project card as compensation.&#10;&#10;If you would ever draw cards over your hand limit, you instead gain 1 point for each such card. If you would gain favor over the maximum, you instead gain 1 point.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, an interim scoring takes place, with players comparing cannons and books in their action row, then gaining points for residences and their placement on the favor track. Players then discard all cards in their activation row, along with the cards above them that were activated, then draw two new cards. After the third interim scoring, players score points for cards in hand, their largest group of contiguous residences, and how well they've completed the order card they received at the start of play. To complete orders, you need goods from cities, which means you need to place residences in those cities, which means you need to activate the right cards and collect lots of books.&#10;&#10;Whatever you do, do your best to make Catherine proud!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As the sun rises over the deserts, rivers, and oases of the Caliphate, a delicate balance has been upset. As one of many rival powers in the region, you now have the opportunity to alter the course of history and seize power for yourself. The ambitious Sultan sits in a golden palace, presiding over great works of architecture. The secretive Murshid works to covertly undermine the central authorities through an expansive network of agents.&#10;&#10;The wandering tribes of the Nomad aim to sow discord in order to secure employment for their experienced mercenary citizenry. The ravaging forces of the Warlord sweep across the land, chasing after promises of plunder. And, in the face of chaos and uncertainty, the Caliph aims to preserve order through military might. Will you successfully navigate this web of rivalries and rise to prominence, or will you squabble with your lesser adversaries and fade into obscurity?&#10;&#10;Crescent Moon is played over three years (or four years in the long game). Each year, players will take four actions which might be to deploy new armies, enlist mercenaries, build fortifications and settlements, conquer new land, expand their influence, and much more. Each character has a unique pool of abilities and available actions, which will shape their game, whether its the Sultan, who cannot raise their own army and must depend on mercenaries, or the Murshid, who can use their political influence to interfere in other characters' battles. Players can purchase potent power cards, representing ploys, wise advisors, and specialist units from a market shared between all players. At the end of each year, players score points according to their own unique character objectives, and at the end of the game, the player with most points wins.&#10;&#10;Crescent Moon is an area control game for four or five players. Take on the role of one of five radically asymmetric characters, each with their own objectives to fulfil, unique actions to utilise, and game-changing special powers to employ. Build symbiotic relationships with your allies, undermine your rivals, and choose your friends and enemies wisely in this cut-throat game of power and politics.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Direwild is a fully co-operative, tactical, dungeon-crawling deck-builder. There is no dungeon master; it is purely the players vs. the game. Players assume the role of animists, heroes that can summon creatures both great and small (represented in the cards you build your deck with), then combine those creatures in unique ways. With the creatures' help, the animists strive to work as a team to defeat the evil forces of Karn. Karn was once a great animist himself, but was corrupted by his lust for greater power. Throughout the game, Karn tries to hunt the heroes and defeat them before they can grow strong enough to face him in the final showdown. The game is split into three chapters, with a &quot;game save&quot; mechanism to allow for the packing and saving of the game between game nights.&#10;&#10;The game also includes treasure, magic, unlockable upgrades, boss fights, a large pool of minions to randomly face each playthrough, over 130 creatures, and ten unique heroes!&#10;&#10;",
