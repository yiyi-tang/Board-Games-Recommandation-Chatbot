    "Description": "It should have been simple--you were hired to steal six priceless exhibits from the museum then get out and get paid. But someone in your crew is a traitor! One of you already stole a target exhibit and replaced it with a fake--and they triggered security to boot. You need to get out before the guards find you and figure out who betrayed you, what they stole, and where they hid it.&#10;&#10;The Clue Robbery at the Museum Escape &amp; Solve Mystery board game offers classic Clue characters and a reimagined mystery to solve in an escape room game. Players move their pawns around the gameboard that's built room-by-room, as they explore the museum exhibits, draw cards, solve puzzles, unlock new rooms in the museum, and uncover clues. After escaping, players review their clues to make a correct accusation and win!&#10;&#10;Gather friends and family together for a game night they won't forget as they immerse themselves in a cinematic, single-play experience.&#10;&#10;Difficulty: 3/5&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A 1-7 player game of diplomacy and warfare in the Napoleonic Era... with a Columbia Block System twist.&#10;&#10;Play as Austria, Britain, France, Prussia, Russia, Spain, or the Ottomans. These major powers cannot survive alone, however. They require the assistance and support of neighboring countries, the Minor States.&#10;&#10;Even though Alliance is best with 3-7 players, the Minor States create added depth for the two-player game and innovative solo rules are included.&#10;&#10;Players start each turn by receiving 5 cards and discarding one. Afterwards, they take turns playing a card, moving and building units, and conducting combat operations if necessary. When leaders are played, a political phase occurs in which the major powers make diplomatic plays for the Minor States.&#10;&#10;Players can forge alliances lasting a year or more, with various conditions in effect: gold tributes, border disputes, non-aggression pacts, etc. By default, the winner is the player with the most Victory Points in cities by the game's end.&#10;&#10;",

If you manage to complete the dungeon, you can move on to another dungeon and so on. If you die before that (which is very likely), create a new character and try to explore the dungeon again (and find your old character's corpse with all the items in the backpack) or explore a new dungeon.

    "Description": "Cycling Party is a game for 2 to 6 players, which reflects the essential features of road cycling. Each player will select a cycling team and take responsibility for managing the movements of 5-6 riders in their team. The aim of each team will be to secure victory at the end of each stage or in the general classification.&#10;&#10;The course is built from hexagonal tiles.  Each hexagon tile is divided in turn into three spaces, with each space representing a kilometre of the race. Mountain sections, intermediate sprints and the finish line are shown using indicator tokens placed at the kilometre points agreed upon by the players at the beginning of the race.&#10;&#10;This game comes in three versions: Junior, Senior and Master.  Each version builds on the rules of previous versions.   In the Junior version each rider is moved by rolling two six-sided dice.  Riders in a peloton (at least five riders in the same space) may choose not to roll and instead move five spaces.  A rider in the peloton may choose to roll in the hope of raising its pace or of breaking away (roll of 10-12).  The difficulty of the mountain sections is represented by rolling just one dice.  Each team has five water bottles that can be spent to move a rider an extra space (cost of one bottle on the flat, 2 bottles in mountains).  The rider furthest across the finish line at the end of a turn is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Senior version introduces different categories of climb and gives each team member a role (climber, sprinter, rouleur, domestique (flat or mountain), and lantern rouge).  Each role has particular abilities.  Each team may launch one attack by rolling four dice instead of the normal two.  Falls, fast descents and falling back to join a team-mate are also represented.&#10;&#10;The Master version makes use of software accessed through the publisher&rsquo;s website to enable whole tours to be run.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bounty hunter &ldquo;Deadeye&rdquo; Dinah Reeves never gets mail, and certainly not from her little brother turned-Deputy-Marshal. But sure enough, the letter in your hands ain&rsquo;t no lie:&#10;&#10;Dear Dinah,&#10;I need your help finding these men. They been making hell for me all over the Arkansas Territory, and now I hear they done run to Texas. I can&rsquo;t keep chasing these cusses. So I&rsquo;m asking you, just this once. There ain&rsquo;t nobody you can&rsquo;t catch. You know I don&rsquo;t beg, but I can&rsquo;t do nothing else now. Just this once, Dinah. Please.&#10;Love, Bass&#10;&#10;Again you check the stack of wanted posters stuffed in his envelope. No mention of a bounty. Twelve years since you last heard from him, and the great Bass Reeves can&rsquo;t spare a dime. Well, you reckon, he&rsquo;s still kin. May-hap you can do your dear brother a favor&mdash;just this once. &#10;&#10;As bounty hunter &ldquo;Deadeye&rdquo; Dinah Reeves, track down each crime boss through a stack of scene cards. A scene may be a peril or shootout. Use your kit cards to overcome each scene card and add it to your kit. You can play a kit card as a bullet to shoot other folk&rsquo;s hats. Or you can play the same card as an item for a special benefit. But outlaws can shoot the hat of any kit card you play, losing you that card. If you ever run out of kit cards, you fail and star t the job over. Reach the boss card to duel the boss. Shoot their hat before they slip away, and you capture them, earning reputation that grows your legend. If you fail, try again. You win the entire campaign by completing all 8 jobs: capture all 8 bosses and bring them to Bass.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;In this in-hand solitaire Western campaign game, bounty hunter &quot;Deadeye&quot; Dinah Reeves is taking down a ring of crime bosses as a favor for her lawman little brother. Aim impossible shots, brave fearsome perils, and stretch scant supplies in your hunt to bring in each crime boss, dead or alive (most likely dead). As you progress, your legend will grow, striking fear into your enemies and granting you an edge...which you'll need, 'cause you've set your sights on the toughest, meanest pack of varmints this side o' the Wild West. Good thing you never miss.&#10;&#10;Deadeye Dinah features an in-hand, cards-only microgame campaign with 8 unique missions, each lasting 4-6 encounters, and persistent character progression through each mission. Each mission, or &quot;job,&quot; is hunting down 1 crime boss.&#10;&#10;Players start a job by setting up the deck for the boss they want to pursue. To track down the boss, they play kit cards (Dinah's equipment) to overcome each scene card (the trials she faces) stacked on top of the boss card. A scene card can be an environmental peril or a shootout with hired thugs. Each kit card is played as either a bullet to shoot or an item to use for special effects, but playing kit cards also leaves Dinah open to being shot and losing cards. If Dinah overcomes a scene, the player adds the scene card to Dinah's kit cards. If she can't overcome the scene, she must escape and lose cards. If Dinah ever runs out of kit cards, and the player can't add any more, she fails the job and must start over.&#10;&#10;If Dinah overcomes all the scenes and reaches the boss, she must duel the boss by playing a bullet to shoot the boss while avoiding getting shot herself. If she doesn't fulfill both those conditions, the boss slips away and Dinah fails the job. But if both conditions are fulfilled, Dinah wins the duel, captures the boss, and completes the job, earning reputation in the crime ring's new territory. As Dinah earns reputation, the player upgrades her legend effect, a passive benefit she carries into each job.&#10;&#10;This game was first published as an entry in the 2021 9-Card Nanogame Print and Play Design Contest, where it won several awards:&#10;&#10;&#10;    #1 Best Solitaire Game&#10;    #1 Best Original Artwork&#10;    #1 Best Cards-Only Game&#10;    #2 Most Innovative Mechanism&#10;    #3 Best Overall Game&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to have the most points by the end of the game (containing as many rounds as the number of the players).&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the round cards are dealt equally to the players (10 cards each by 6 players, 12 by 5 players etc.). Each player chooses cards from the hand and places them face down in the middle of the table (3/4/5/6 players 4/3/2/2 cards). After turning them up, each player picks cards from the table (3/4/5/6 players 4/3/2/2 cards).&#10;&#10;The player on turn plays a card. The player on left must play a card of the same colour as the card of the player that started the round (but no trick compulsion). If he does not have such a card, he can play any card. Other players play a card according to the above mentioned rules as well in clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;The player whose card has the highest rank of the led colour gets the trick. He puts the trick onto his pile (face down). The round ends when players are out of cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;&#10;Each trick is worth 6/8/10/12 points by 3/4/5/6 players. Each red dragon card taken in a trick scores as many penalty point against the player winning the trick, as the rank of the card, except for the &bdquo;red dragon 11&rdquo; that costs 26 penalty points. If any of the player manage to do the slam, i.e. to take all the tricks he immediately wins the whole game.&#10;&#10;Players who take no tricks in a deal gain points depending on the number of the players and the number of the players taking no tricks either in the round.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game tries to recreate the Midgard role playing feeling in a boardgame. It addresses former Midgard RPG players, who don't find the time for role playing anymore, as well as fans of fantasy boardgames. As the complexity level is rather high and the game offers multiple options for players, Midgard is rather successful in achieving it's goal. The difficulty is still light to medium, despite dozens of cards that influence the game and the characters.&#10;&#10;The game is based on tiles (major cities of Midgard) players move across, collecting rare items and fulfilling adventures. Often this ends in the local city jail or in clashes with monsters. Additional threats like terror cards or riots pop up in cities during the game.&#10;&#10;Tests are made with a 20-sided die and the mechanics are just the same as in the Midgard RPG. Movement and actions are controlled by action cards from a four-card-hand which allows tactical gaming. Each action card has different abilities and some may even interrupt another player's turn.&#10;&#10;Players may form groups for the duration of a game turn to help each other solve adventures or make difficult tests. Sticking together earns each player of a group experience points and treasure cards. As only one player can finally win the game, forming groups is a two-edged sword as it helps your opponents too. The goal of the game is to get 3 treasure rewards, rise to character level 3 and find 2 artifacts first. If you deliver the treasures and artifacts to the correct city you have won the game.&#10;&#10;Included are pre-generated characters like Sorcerer or Warrior but players will be able to create their own characters in the final release version.&#10;&#10;This information is derived from the website of Phantastische-Spielewelten.&#10;&#10;http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de&#10;&#10;",

You have one goal and one goal only: Annihilate your foe's believers and thereby move yourself one step closer to absolute power.&#10;&#10;Drafting prayer cards and power cards allows you to slowly build your might. Using those cards, you send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every single hand: Should you put your own power on the line to help your believers win their battles, or should you turn your back on them, sending them to a certain death? If no god yields, hurricanes will face off with deathly plagues, tempests will extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful will grow smaller every second.&#10;&#10;Once you get rid of your opponent's last prophet, it's time to rest and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of gods. You have won Teomachia.&#10;&#10;Theomachie, the second edition of Teomachia debuting in German in 2013, features new illustrations and expands the gameplay for up to four players, instead of the two-player limit of the first edition.

The game comes with 20 All-time great golfers along with the DC Metro Golf Course (Congressional).&#10;&#10;The course has been painstakingly designed for the utmost accuracy and depiction.  Like all of our updated games, the instructions and boards are combined in a handy spiral bound 7 1/2&quot; x 10&quot; booklet.  The course comes in its own booklet!  The course booklet is roughly the size of the Baseball and Football Master Game booklets.  Also, we've printed the course holes on a coated stock that allows us to eliminate the use of the old golf markers.  Now you can mark your holes with a fine tip wipe marker (included) with its own eraser!  That's right no more bumping the table and accidentally moving the markers.&#10;&#10;The current add-on courses available from APBA are Magnolia (Augusta National), Badger Links (Whistling Straits) and NY Empire State (Bethpage Black).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kickstarter Link: https://bit.ly/Seaofplunderks &#10;Sail the Seas in search of fame and riches as a merchant ship captain trying to out maneuver his fellow merchants and the ruthless pirates!&#10;&#10;Sea of Plunder is a light weight strategy game about treasure hunting in which you are a merchant ship sailing across the endless sea, racing to get to mysterious treasure islands while at the same time gathering goods from port cities,dodging pirates, getting pushed around by hurricanes, and stealing cargo from the other merchants/treasure hunters!&#10;&#10;Scoring and Goal: Four things are taken into account for scoring at the end of the game.&#10;Treasures- The players can gather treasures from the mysterious treasure islands throughout the game. &#10;Goods-A second way is by collecting the unique goods that are produced at each of the port cities located on the 4 home islands. The goods are a set collection objective where you get more points for having multiple different types of goods. (this means that you have to travel to the multiple islands or trade with another merchant for them) &#10;Magical Compasses-A player is also awarded points at the end of the game for each &quot;magical compass&quot; that they possess. All the players are given these through out the game but they can also gain these in trades from other players. &#10;Debt-Each player is deducted points based on the amount of debt that they have gained throughout the game. A player will obtain debt any time that they come into contact with pirates and are unable to bribe them with a good. In this instance the pirates attach the ship and the player gains debt which represents the price that they had to pay for repairs &#10;The player with the total highest score wins. In the case of a tie, the player with the most magical compasses left wins.&#10;&#10;Game Play: Players take turns in clockwise fashion. They will draw two cards and add them to their hand. They then choose to play a card (a treasure map, port city, or action card) these will commonly affect the active player (Exceptions would include some action cards). The player then chooses to discard a card. The card discarded allows the player to choose a pirate on the map and move it accordingly&#10;&#10;Player Powers: Each player has a unique player power that allows for new strategies and replayability!&#10;&#10;Action Cards: Allow the player to preform more complex combos or implement some take that upon the other players.&#10;&#10;Event Cards: These are cards that are dispersed throughout the draw deck. When they appear they do not count as one of your draws or plays but they are played immediately and affect all players.&#10;&#10;Treasure Islands: The game starts with one treasure island in the middle of the board. When a player sails across a treasure island they have now discovered it and found the treasure. That treasure island will disappear off the map and a new treasure island location will be randomly generated. Event cards such as &quot;Tales of More Treasure&quot; cause new treasure islands to be generated onto the board so that by the end of the game there are multiple options of islands that you can choose to sail towards.&#10;&#10;The Pirates: There are four pirate ships that can be moved across the board according to each players discard. You can use the pirates to discover the treasure islands (the pirate would get the treasure) if an opponent is getting to close to it for comfort. You can also sail the pirate into another player forcing them to lose a good or accumulate debt. You may also place a pirate on the port cities to help blockade your opponent merchants from gathering the goods from that city.&#10;&#10;Game End: The game end can be triggered in two ways. When a player has collected 3 treasures or when the pirates have collected 6 treasures. When the game end is triggered, the players finish the round and then calculate final scoring.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The second game in the series that includes Imperator and Ultimus Romanorum: La Chute de Rome, Semper Victor offers a grand strategic view of the Fourth Century Roman Empire. The full campaign opens with the abdication of Emperor Diocletian (305 A.D.) and continues to the death of Julian the Apostate (in the 360's or 370's - the date is variable). Scenarios cover shorter periods, such as the fateful war between Constantine the Great and Licinius (313-324).&#10;&#10;The map shows the Roman Empire in 305, divided into zones that, in turn, are grouped into 12 Dioceses, the Imperial administrative districts of that time. Surrounding the Empire are the zones of barbarian peoples and the rival Persian Empire. A turn is one year. Units have Points de Force (Strength Points) representing about 1,000 men each. Roman units come in three types: Ripenses, who cannot leave their home diocese, Pseudo-Comitatenses, whose ability to range far from home is limited, and Comitatenses, who can go anywhere in the Empire and beyond.&#10;&#10;The opposing sides are unusual and may puzzle players who know little or nothing about this era. One player (dubbed &quot;Primus&quot;) represents the senior Emperor (&quot;Primus Augustus&quot;) and his allies, who may include another Augustus, one or two Caesars (junior Emperors), other Roman generals, and even non-Roman peoples. The other player (&quot;Secundus&quot;, misspelled &quot;Secondus&quot; in the rules) has his own set of Augusti, Caesars, generals and non-Romans. An important limitation is that each Augustus and Caesar must have a capital of his own, and only six capital cites are available at the beginning of the game. A seventh, Constantinople, may be constructed, though its advent is not a certainty. (Rome, by the way, is not one of the capitals; its political importance had long since faded.)&#10;&#10;In the course of play, Primus and Secundus may swap positions as the result of either a successful usurpation plotted by the Secundus or the death of the Primus Augustus without an Augustus or Caesar to succeed him. In general, it is better to be Primus than Secundus, but it isn't impossible for a perpetual Secundus to win.&#10;&#10;The Roman leaders are historical figures (38 in all), who enter the game at the same time as in actuality and run an increasing risk of death from natural causes if they aren't killed off sooner. Names are rendered in their French versions, e. g., &quot;Constance Chlore&quot; for Constantius Chlorus. A Leader is rated for &quot;Capacit&eacute; de Commandement&quot; (number of units he can command), &quot;Capacit&eacute; Politique&quot; (a variety of functions, such as determination of the initiative each turn), &quot;Valeur Strat&eacute;gique&quot; (ability to evade combat plus other functions) and &quot;Bonus Tactique&quot; (useful in battles). Many Leaders are also marked as Christian or Pagan, though religion has much less of an impact than it did in real life.&#10;&#10;Very important to play are &quot;stratagems&quot;, which make it possible to embark on a usurpation against the other player, assassinate rival Leaders, spread plagues, trigger barbarian uprisings, pacify barbarians already at war with the Empire, inspire desertions from enemy ranks, and much else.&#10;&#10;Turns have a variable number of movement/combat phases, determined by adding the valeurs strat&eacute;giques of the Primus Augustus and the highest rated Leader in the Secundus camp. The pace of the game thus depends on the quality of the current Leaders.&#10;&#10;Movement and combat are straightforward. Leaders, accompanied by a number of units up to their capacit&eacute; de commandement, may move up to four zones, halting and fighting when they encounter enemies. Units without Leaders may move only one zone at a time. Battles are often bloody, but weakened or eliminated units quickly return  to full strength.&#10;&#10;Players tally Victory Points at the end of each Turn. The list of achievements that garner VP's is long: victory in major battles (35 PF's or more engaged), control of Dioceses, defeat of non-Romans, presence of non-Roman troops in the other player's controlled territory, and so on.&#10;&#10;Players must mount and cut the game's counters themselves, which is a non-trivial task. As a minor annoyance, the counters are a bit too big for the zones on the map. The rules are in French, though English translations are easy to find.&#10;&#10;",

Players draft dice that indicate where on their sheets they may draw. Players try to draw a network of canals that connect houses, parks, markets and ships. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     &quot;Shanghai&quot; uses the same basic mechanisms for dice drafting, but is played on a 6x6 grid and introduces completely new rules for scoring. One new building is the skyscraper. When activated, you either add another floor to the skyscraper, or finalize the building by drawing a road in its space. You then score 1 point per floor multiplied by the number of connected parks. When you score points, all other players must cross out this point value on their sheets, so each value can be scored by only one player throughout the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;Shanghai also has hotels, with which you score points for the length of the road passing through the hotel (as in Doodle City), but again, each value can be scored by only one player.&#10;&#10;There are no &quot;wildcard dice&quot; in Shanghai. Instead, when you choose dice that activate a park, you can draw in any space in that park's row; doing so costs you a tree.&#10;&#10;At game's end, players score points for having made a large network of taxis and buses.&#10;&#10;",

A new dark pantheon of Gods watches over the earth and feeds upon the spoils of war; a banquet of souls slain on the wretched battlefields of Chronopia.&#10;&#10;Once you have chosen your army it will be time to select the troops that you will lead into battle.  Chronopia isn't a game that relies on the strengths of only one model, but rather the abilities of a diverse collection of warriors all working towards a common goal.  You will populate your army with warbands of close combat warriors, soldiers trained in all manner of weaponry from swords to axes; missile weapon warbands that will rain death down upon their enemies in great volleys; and Individuals like spell casters or fearsome monsters or even mighty war chariots.  Whatever the case, you will create a diverse army with which to recreate the epic struggles of the Empires of the Fourth Age of Chronopia.  You will populate your forces with miniatures and models available from Excelsior Entertainment.&#10;&#10;These models will represent your own style of waging war and will be selected for your tastes.  Once you have chosen your warriors you will need to paint them.  A well-painted army will bring your games to life and seize your imagination with the epic battles you will recreate.  There are many resources to help you learn how to paint your miniatures and we recommend that you practice and try new techniques- the results will well be worth it.&#10;&#10;You will need a few things to begin your epic journey into the realms of Chronopia.  Most important are this rule book, some Chronopia miniatures from the extensive Chronopia line, Warband Unit Cards (which come with each model), a twenty-sided die (d20), a ruler or measuring tape, and a pen.  In addition to these items you may need some of the counters and templates found in the back of this book.  You will also need a place to engage your armies in battle.  This can be an inspiring custom war game table that you have spent a great amount of time creating or it can be as simple as a dining room table or a stretch of floor.  The site of a well-designed table however, with your armies spread out before you will do wonders to fire the imaginations and invigorate your play.  There are numerous resources for how to create battlefields and just as many manufactured resources to draw upon.  Excelsior also makes a line of battlefield accessories that can be used in your game&#10;&#10;",

This game is based upon the typical life of a late medieval English court. Many Kings came under the influence of a select inner group of courtiers who used their influence to gain gifts of land, titles, money etc.&#10;&#10;This game recreates the desperate race to get the best and the most gifts for yourself. The game is played over three rounds; each round the King visits a royal castle or house (The Kings Progress). Your aim is to gain the most prestige for your family by collecting courtier cards, melding them to build your influence and thus gain control of the courtiers, advancing those courtiers to the royal castle and then using the courtiers to select various gifts for yourself. Gifts and courtier control gain victory points at the end of each round. As the game progresses gifts become more valuable. Each courtier also has a character ability which can be used by the player in control to gain extra actions or other advantages.&#10;&#10;",

It's a hidden information, bluffing, and deduction family game.&#10;&#10;During setup, each player receives a hand of 5 cards and 10 coins (which are hidden). Regardless of the number of players, there are always five cemeteries on the table which each receive one card at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, the player reveals one of their action tiles and performs the action on it. There are four possible actions:&#10;1. Play a card - The player plays a card from their hand face down to one of the five cemeteries and then draws back up to five cards.&#10;2. Look at one card - The player looks at one face down card on one of the cemeteries (while not showing it to other players).&#10;3. Reveal one card - The player has to reveal and leave face up one of the cards laying down in one of the cemeteries.&#10;4. Rob the cemetery - The player has to choose which cemetery the players will rob.&#10;&#10;When robbing the cemetery, each player chooses the amount of money that they wish to invest in robbing it. Then all amounts are revealed simultaneously. All the cards that lay face down in the cemetery are revealed and the amount of money that can be robbed is shown. The player who bid the least takes his loot first. They take the money invested and the same amount from the cemetery following by other players. If there is insufficient money for one of the players, they take nothing from the cemetery, and so do the players after them.&#10;&#10;Apart from money cards, there are also special cards which change the outcome of the robbery:&#10;&#10;     Guard - Prevent the players from stealing the money. Everyone who invested 0 in this robbery receives 5 regardless of the money in the cemetery.&#10;     Bandit - Prevent the players from stealing the money and also steal the money invested in this robbery by all players.&#10;     Accomplice - Reverse the order of players taking the money.&#10;     Widow - Cancels all other special cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the deck is depleted, play continues until one of the players uses all of their cards. After that, the players rob all the cemeteries one after another and then the game is over. The player who earned the most coins is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The aim of the game is to score more points by winning awards for actors and film directing, building the structures of their studio, or producing more films of different genres. The player must decide which strategy to follow early in the game based on the script and cast with which depart.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three or five rounds corresponding to three years.

For each card played you will place its own &quot;Producer&quot; (worker) to activate areas on your dashboard (the studios) or different locations on the main scoreboard that represent Hollywood.&#10;&#10;You can buy scripts, engage the biggest movie star of the time, young players with a great future and legendary directors.

To set up the game, adjust the deck so that it contains twenty cards per player, with the cards being chosen at random. The full deck contains one hundred cards, with 25 cards for each symbol numbered 1-25.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player draws a card from the deck, then (if possible) you write the number on that card in the column matching the depicted symbol. Numbers must be placed in columns in ascending order so that within each column each number is higher than whatever is below it and lower than whatever is above it, but you can skip spaces in the columns when entering a number.&#10;&#10;If you can't place your card's number on your player sheet in the proper column &mdash; e.g., you draw a blue 14 and you have no open spaces between a blue 11 and a blue 15 &mdash; announce this to everyone before they write down the number on their own card and place your card in the center of the table. After they write their own number, they can also write your number on their score sheet, if possible.&#10;&#10;If you complete a row of symbols, then you immediately get the bonus shown on the left edge of the player sheet, either a number (5, 10, 15, 20) that you can write in any valid column or a symbol that you can fill with any valid number.&#10;&#10;At game's end, for each column you score points equal to your longest connected sequence of filled-in spaces. In the advanced variant, you draw two of the eight bonus cards, each of which shows one of the rows on the player sheet; for each of these two rows that you fill in completely, you score bonus points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tolling of the Bell is a wargame simulation that depicts the last German offensive during World War II, &lsquo;Operation Spring Awakening&rsquo; and its sub-operations &lsquo;Icebreaker&rsquo; and &lsquo;Forrest Devil&rsquo;. It also includes the start of the Soviet Vienna offensive (from the perspective of the 3rd Ukrainian Front).&#10;This game starts with a German thrust against the depleted Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front which was holding the Soviet absolute left flank. The German main goals were the Donau crossings and to the incircle of the 57th Soviet and 1st Bulgarian Armies. A secondary target was to create a starting ground for a new Budapest offensive. An even wider stretch was the oilfields at Ploes&#204;&#166;ti, Romania.&#10;Tolling of the Bell is a game recreating this campaign in Hungary from 6th - 25th March, 1945.&#10;&#10;Tolling of the Bell is taught in 30 minutes and easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players.&#10;&#10;It is built around the same system of wargaming rules that shaped Plan West&trade;, K&ouml;nigsberg'45&trade;, Army Group Narwa&trade; and Stargard Solstice&trade; making it the 5th game in the WWII Battle Series.&#10;It utilizes a Command chit-pull system to activate HQ, which in turn allow their controlled combat units to move and attack.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: about 3 to about 4 km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2+&#10;Playing Time: 3-10 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The world became a hostile place after the gods had abandoned men, embittered by their weakness. The elements appeared to conspire against the mortals and their heritage, bringing pain, hunger and destruction. And when the end of the human race seemed close at hand, an idea emerged amidst the deserted lands, and breathed hope into the surviving few. An idea of great power shimmering in a man about to fight for his own life. Thus began the era of the warrior; a warrior who, defiant to all, challenged heavens themselves. It was then that the wastelands saw the first Arenas, places endowed with mystic character, where the daring fought to death trying to single out the mightiest of them all. Some claimed that he was to win back gods&rsquo; favor; others that he was to become their equal and finally challenge even them. New habitats started to emerge around the Arenas, suddenly all vibrant with life and ruled, singlehandedly, by a Warlord, the best of the warriors. A Warlord sovereign, drawing passionate gaze of women and envious glances of men. A Warlord supreme, who thanks to his triumphs seemed to put humanity on a pedestal. A Warlord absolute, whose place could be taken by anybody willing to issue a challenge. The Warlord of the Arena.&#10;&#10;Warlord of the Arena (W&#197;&#130;adca Areny) is a tactical board game that simulates a duel of barbarian heroes.&#10;&#10;Players will create a unique warrior by distributing a number of points between six skills. Those skills will determine a warrior's agility, toughness, speed, sword mastery, etc. Warriors created this way will gain access to a vast armory. Various medieval weapons raging from daggers to heavy two handed axes await their test in battle. Throwing knives and crossbows, poisoned blades and big hunting dogs - all of this deadly weaponry varies in dealt damage, weight and special abilities, changing players' strategies for the fight. The strongest of warriors will be able to clad themselves in heavy plate armors, while the weaker ones will have to survive wearing only leather. Once warriors spent all of their gold, the players will build the arena. Even though the Arena is divided in several dangerous spaces, delivering special effects and fighting modification, players will be allowed to bring some extra mayhem to this place. Snakes, deadly spikes and a powerful chained beast wandering all over the arena are waiting to be bought for special points by the players to influence their tactics even further. Once the warriors and the arena are ready the duel begins. Each player can choose from arange of fighting moves (both defensive and offensive) to defeat his opponent. Chance of successful move attempt will be determined by your position on the arena, chosen weapon and position of your opponent. Lure your opponent out to the slippery floor and then jump him from behind to gain advantage ! Players will quickly exchange moves dancing in a sophisticated sword fight, using elements of the environment in order to win. There are 3 ways to win the duel. You can defeat your opponent by dealing one powerful blow which will kill him instantly or several minor ones that will cause him to bleed to his death! You may also poison him, which will cause them to lose consciousness and grant you victory. You can also try to deal a injury so painful that the opponent warrior will surrender, fearing for his life. All this brutal mayhem awaits you in Warlords of the Arena.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Excitement in the capital: Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu wants to assign the Han of Takamatsu in a challenge. The competing Daimyos direct their Samurai through the palace following some simple rules and quickly see that they can use the Samurai of the other Daimyos for their purposes. An exciting interwoven competition - with unexpected surpises.&#10;&#10;Takamatsu is a game of conflict and cooperation, with players trying to place (or not place!) their samurai in their own rooms. The palace consists of two circular paths that merge at one point, then separate once again. Players have 5-7 samurai that are split between two color-coded rooms at the start of the game, and a row of scoring cards &mdash; some face-down &mdash; are laid out next to the board.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you choose a room that contains at least one of your samurai, then you move some number of samurai in this room clockwise from this space. If the room contains only one samurai, you can move it one space; if it contains two, you can move both two spaces or only one a single space &mdash; but if an opposing samurai is with you, then you must move both exactly two spaces. When a room has three or more samurai, he must leave at least one behind (while still needing to bring at least one opposing samurai along, if any). When a samurai ends movement in a room of the same color, that samurai's daimyo collects the topmost scoring card, with multiple scorings being possible on a turn. For each open scoring card collected, the player immediately adjusts his scoring marker &mdash; which could move you back on the track, so sometimes you want to escort another samurai to his pad instead of bringing him to your place.&#10;&#10;When one player reaches twenty points, players finish the round, then tally their hidden scoring cards, if any. The player with the most points wins! (With two players, each daimyo controls two colors of samurai and must move an opposing samurai when possible. After one pagoda reaches the twenty point threshold, the players sum their two scores to determine a winner.)&#10;&#10;",

The map scale is 10 miles per hex, turns cover one month each, while units are mostly regiments and brigades, with specialist battalions and a few Italian and Vichy French divisions. The turn sequence is built around a pair of move-fight impulses for each player, with separate phases for events altering the situation (like the frequent Commonwealth campaigns elsewhere in the Middle East), application of air and naval power, and initiative determination. Logistics is the paramount consideration given the vast distances. Fast and furious action alternates with quiet periods as both sides strive to build up forces and supplies.&#10;&#10;Components: Three 17&quot; x 22&quot;, two 8.5&quot; x 22&quot;, one 11&quot; x 17&quot; map &amp; 560 counters&#10;&#10;S&amp;T #300, August 2016&#10;&#10;Boxed edition in 2019 added cards to better depict the impact of off map events (like Greece, and East Africa) on reinforcement and withdrawals.  20 cards for the Axis and 28 cards for the Allies.

    "Description": "&quot;Alexandre contre la Perse&quot; is a tactical level board wargame which presents the first three battles in the &quot;Au Fil de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e&quot; Antiquity series. They bring onto the stage the greatest conqueror of Antiquity in the course of the mighty confrontations which enabled him to bring Persia to its knees.&#10;&#10;GRANICUS - In 334 BC, after crushing a revolt by the city of Thebes, the young King Alexander of Macedonia turned toward the east and set out on his conquest of Asia. He crossed the Hellespont with 35,000 men. On the banks of the Granicus River he came up against an army of 40,000 men commanded by Memnon, a Greek who was in the pay of Persia. Thanks to a vigorous attack by his Companion cavalry, Alexander succeeded in dispersing the enemy horsemen and crushing Memnon&rsquo;s Greek mercenaries. This brilliant victory opened the door to Asia Minor.&#10;&#10;ISSOS - A year later on the coast of Syria the King of Kings, Darius III, determined to assemble a great army and intercept Alexander. The two armies met at Issos. While repelling an attack on his left by the Persian cavalry, Alexander and his right wing charged across the river under a rain of enemy arrows. By hurling himself into a breach on the Persian left flank, Alexander brought about its collapse and the flight of Darius. The Macedonian phalanx advanced inexorably in the center of the battlefield and completed Alexander&rsquo;s victory, with the result that he could go on to invade Egypt unhindered.&#10;&#10;GAUGAMELA - The final clash between Alexander and Darius took place at Gaugamela in 331 B.C. The King of Kings had mobilized impressive forces from the eastern part of his empire. His army, unusually numerous, included elephants as well as war chariots. He compelled Alexander to fight in a vast plain where the 40,000 Macedonians risked being encircled. Once again the king of Macedonia opened the battle with a cavalry attack on his right. The phalanx meanwhile suffered severely from Persian attacks, especially on its left wing where Parmenion was in command. Alexander nevertheless forestalled the enemy by making Darius himself the target of the Companions&rsquo; charge. Once they had opened a breach, the Macedonian cavalrymen passed through it and struck the Persians from the rear, causing them to rout. This occurred in the nick of time, because Parmenion&rsquo;s contingents were by then on the point of breaking. Darius fled in the direction of Arbela. Alexander caught up with him, but by then he was already dead, assassinated by a group of his generals.&#10;&#10;Alexandre contre la Perse puts the players either at the head of the Macedonian army, at whose core the cavalry and the phalangites played complementary roles, or in command of the Persian army, consisting of highly varied troops collected from all over the empire. The three battles were increasingly important chronologically, in terms of the numbers involved and their complexity. Will you, as Alexander, be able to bring down a multi-national army by means of only three battles? Will you, in the role of the King of Kings, succeed in foiling Alexander&rsquo;s maneuvers and vanquishing the Macedonians?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Slouch Hats and Eggshells: The Allied Invasion of Syria &amp; Lebanon - 1941, recreates the World War II campaign in French-held Syria and Lebanon, historically from early June 1941 through mid-July 1941. One player will control the Axis forces (Vichy French, French colonial troops, and Germans), while his opponent controls the Allied forces (British, Commonwealth, Free French, etc). The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated in the campaign and the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. One player wins by capturing certain specified objectives while his opponent wins by avoiding those victory conditions.&#10;&#10;When Free French leader Gen. de Gaulle visited the Middle East in April 1941 he forced a political crisis by demanding the occupation of Syria. As a result London ordered an offensive to place all of Syria and Lebanon under Free French control. Sadly, such posturing caused Allied command staffs to hold unrealistic views of what the ensuing occupation would look like. Certain authorities believed the Vichy French in Syria would offer only token resistance and their defense would collapse like an eggshell. The thinking held that Vichy forces could be won over with wine and coffee along with displays of the Australian slouch hat. Instead, the Vichy-led troops fought ferociously from the start.&#10;&#10;Players should feel free to combine play of this game with that of Rommel&#039;s War, published by L2 Design Group. Both games include the same historical moment, have identical scales, and have some of the same historical units. It is natural that players would want to explore more historical alternatives with combined play. To facilitate such game play, this game uses many of the same rules, charts, and tables found in Rommel&#039;s War.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 10 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 kilometers&#10;Units: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (96 -  0.6&quot; &amp; 20 -  1.2&quot; counters)&#10;One 28-page rulebook&#10;Two 4-page Player Aid Cards (CRT/TEC, etc)&#10;Four 1-page Player Aid Cards (Turn Sequence, Set-up, Counter Information)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;Seven plastic storage bags&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium-High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 2 (or medium high solitaire)&#10;Playing Time: 4-6 Hours&#10;&#10;",

The course to power is not a gala dinner, so all pieces can be physically eliminated. In politics, a dead is as encumbrant as a living person, so all dead pieces are kept on the board, face down.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dead pieces have no color.&#10;&#10;The Labyrinth is the basement of the Legal Power, the road to Absolute Power. Only a Leader may stay on this square. It makes its parti play after each opponent. But there, it can be killed by nearly all other pieces.&#10;&#10;The Leader: can kill any piece on the board by taking its place. The taken piece is placed on any other adjacent free square of the board, dead.&#10;&#10;The Journalist kills a piece that is adjacent to any one of the 4 squares that share a common border with its square. It does this just after having moved. The body lies dead where it was killed. He must move at least one square before killing.&#10;&#10;The Assassin, can kill any piece by taking its place. The piece is placed, dead on the place the Assassin was before moving.&#10;&#10;The Provoker, mover of the living: can move any living piece if it takes its position. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, alive.&#10;&#10;The Necromobile, mover of the dead: can move any dead piece if it takes its position. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, dead.&#10;&#10;The Activists can kill a piece by taking its place. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, dead. They CAN'T kill a leader in The Labyrinth.&#10;&#10;These are most of the rules.

When everybody else passes, the last player to have played a card collects for purposes of end-of-game scoring the whole pile of cards (which for convenience will be called a trick) and then has the lead. The Ohio card is deemed always just a little lower than the last card played, so if a 2 is played and then an Ohio card (or two or three Ohio cards), a 1 would still be lower. When one person plays their last card, finish the trick and calculate the scores. Ohio cards count negative 10. All others their face value. Cards still in hand count negative (including Ohio card which is negative 10 if still in hand). The player with the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the first player to earn 7 Game Points over several rounds!&quot;&#10;&#10;This is identical to the traditional trick-taking card game Schnapsen, except for the addition of a 0 in each suit.  Players take turns playing tricks in order to score game points -- after each round, scoring occurs, and the first player to reach 7 game points wins.  Rounds may end early if a player claims to have earned 66 trick-points during the round.  Marriages allow players with both Queen and King of a suit in their hand to claim additional trick-points for the round, provided they immediately lead with one of those two cards.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;This is a standard trick-taking game. Each trick is won by the player who played the highest card of the leading color. A player that wins enough tricks during a round wins Game Points. The game continues for several rounds until a player wins by reaching seven Game Points.&#10;&#10;NOTE: This game was available as a free, secret bonus for the Pack O Game Set 2 Kickstarter.&#10;&#10;",

The captain has rounded you all up because you're all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid. That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!&#10;&#10;In game terms, each round players secretly stack three of their ten action cards, then they take turns revealing and playing those actions one by one no matter what's gone wrong between the planning and the doing. If you plan to have a pirate shove someone off the plank on your third move and all he sees are his own best mates, he will still shove away! Some cards bear a skull on them, and these powerful cards must remain on the table the round after they're played, but otherwise players then pick up their action cards and start a new round. As soon as two or fewer pirates remain on board, the game ends and the owner (or owners) of these pirates win! Watch out, though, as sometimes every pirate will end up in the drink, which means that no one wins other than the sharks circling in the water below...&#10;&#10;This all new limited edition tin edition features a reworked version of the rules, all new artwork (by Felideus Bubastis), screen printed meeples, the Ghost Meeple mini-expansion (with rules), and a 26 card promo pack.&#10;&#10;The promo pack features a summary card and 5x cards each each of  the five player colors, which now give each player 15 cards to choose from rather than the 10 cards featured in the original  or the deluxe tin editions.&#10;&#10;The new cards are:&#10;&#10;Skeleton&#10;Scallywag&#10;Parlay&#10;Ghost Pirate&#10;Dynamite&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Sword &amp; Spear is a set of wargames rules for Ancients and Medieval battles. They are suitable for any scale figures and any basing standard, the only requirement being that figures are organized into units of equal frontage. A typical game has around 8&mdash;15 units on each side, and games take around two to three hours. The rules are designed from a top-down perspective, focusing on outcomes rather than detail.&#10; Sword &amp; Spear features a clever and innovative system for activating units that creates interesting and challenging decisions, keeps both players involved at all times, and has a lot of depth and subtlety. Each turn is split into phases, where players each receive a number of action dice, which are rolled and then used to activate their units. The number shown on each dice determines which units can activate (with better quality units being easier to activate), what the unit can do when activated, and also determine the activation sequence. Certain dice also give bonuses to combat, movement distance, or shooting range. So there is a lot to think about, and allocating the action dice well is the key to success (although rolling lots of sixes helps as well!).&#10; The rules are relatively straightforward, and there are no &quot;to hit&quot; tables, charts, or lists of dieroll modifiers. They can be played using only the one-sided Quick Reference Sheet, with very little reference to the rulebook after the first couple of games.&#10; Army lists are available as free downloads online, covering a wide range of Ancient and Medieval armies. These include points for each unit, so that players can play relatively balanced games by building armies to a set points total. There are currently over 40 army lists, including many of the most popular armies, and more are being added each week, with the aim to have over 100 lists available. The rules also include guidelines to help in recreating historic battles, and there are three generic scenarios included as alternatives to the pitched battle.&#10; The strengths of the game are that it gives an exciting, interesting and challenging experience, plays relatively quickly for the size of battle that is being depicted, and the rules are straightforward to learn, whilst having the depth to retain interest after repeated play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Dungeon Crawl, players take the role of a brave Hero or evil Dungeon Lord in this dungeon crawler adventure game.&#10;&#10;In Dungeon Crawl's included campaign, the Heroes find a link to a huge, trans-dimensional infernal dungeon that is spreading throughout the underworld of Old Earth.  It is upon the Heroes to explore the dungeons, fight back waves of Monsters and assault Monster encampments.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Crawl features a vast, flexible game system with many different play modes.  Play through the 35 Adventure Campaign with the Dungeon Lord, who fields and plays as the Monsters during the Campaign.  Pit your Heroes against your friends' own characters in the Deathblow Arena.  Play solo or with friends in randomly generated dungeons that don't require a game master, and fight mighty and cruel bosses that will test the Heroes like no other Monster has.&#10;&#10;Combat, the bread and butter of any dungeon crawler, is quick and simple, requiring only two rolls (attack and defense) to figure out if the player has hit, and how much damage he caused.  Gameplay is streamlined for quick play, so you don't have to sit around for hours on end on a single scenario.  Each player can take their turn in just seconds, so you don't have to constantly wait for minutes for someone to make up their minds.&#10;&#10;Players advance in levels to learn Skills, chosen from a list based on the Hero's Race and Class.  Try different Race and Class combinations for interesting skill sets!  Heroes can join Guilds to earn benefits, and must face trials to advance in Guild rank.&#10;&#10;Dungeons are built from 20 available dungeon tiles, each complete with rooms and corridors.  In the dungeons the players will search for treasures in all sorts of different furniture, and fight over 50 different monsters.  Roll on charts or use the included cards to search for treasure or lay out the dungeons.&#10;&#10;Customize your games with a slew of optional rules.  Don't like the Heroes walking around with 50,000 gold in their pockets?  Bring in the Load rules.  Decided that traveling five weeks to another city shouldn't be a cakewalk?  Invoke the Travel rules to add some peril to their journey.&#10;&#10;Think your gaming group might not be up to more advanced modes of play?  Dungeon Crawl comes with Dungeon Crawl Basic, an even lighter-rules version of Dungeon Crawl, designed to get new players acquainted with the game.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Crawl is a Print-and-Play game, and it comes with several print options, to make your game as pretty or as economical as you'd like.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Ecologies: Bizarre Biomes is the second game in the series. It is playable as a stand alone game or used in combination with the original Ecologies card game. Designed by a biology teacher, the game includes 77 unique organisms, 7 biomes, and beautiful vintage Victorian art. (108 cards total). Gameplay is rooted in authentic science, as it is used in the classroom to teach real concepts to biology students. While it is scientific enough for the classroom, it is also strategic enough for any game night.&#10;&#10;This game is a sequel AND an expansion. When using the game as an expansion, you can customize the deck to include cards from both games, including cards you love and excluding ones you don&rsquo;t. Some players love aggressive &ldquo;take that&rdquo; mechanics, while others find them stressful. Some players love particular healthy ecology bonuses, while others feel they are overpowered. With multiple decks, you can create a customized experience to fit your group. If you&rsquo;d like to maintain the same game length and feel, we recommend choosing 10 factor cards and 7 different biomes.&#10;&#10;Players build and maintain food webs in diverse environments. Healthy ecologies reward you with bonus powers and perks. Watch out though, as others may decide it&rsquo;s easier to disturb and degrade your ecosystem than nurture their own.&#10;&#10;Cards are arranged with plants on the bottom and predators on top. Players negotiate trades and use biotic and abiotic factor cards to affect their webs and the webs of players around them. It is a race to get to 12 victory points, with players using different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or disrupting other ecologies.&#10;&#10;The points system is based on ecological trophic levels. The producers (plants) are worth less and as you make your way up the pyramid organisms are worth more, as it takes a lot of energy to sustain them. In real life only roughly 10% of the energy makes it from one level to the next, meaning you have to have acres of land and hundreds of animals just to sustain one apex predator.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The venues vary in difficulty from needing a single skill to succeed at the concert to needing all four skills.  The venue card will show you what skill(s) you need and how many points (millions of souls) you will gain depending on where you finish in head to head competition with the other bands.&#10;&#10;Your band has a base value for each skill and your set list cards can boost your scores or hurt someone else's as you work to out play each other.

In battle with the enemy units are removed 1:1, i.e. combat is deterministic.&#10;&#10;Your mission in each game you play is to assist Sammu-ramat through one of the many challenges that she encountered during her reign. This challenge is presented to you as a scenario, found on a Challenge card that you draw during setup.

    "Description": "(from Decision Games' website:)&#10;&#10;Throughout the mid-5th century AD, Attila's Huns terrorized Europe. The skill of the Hun horsemen, particularly their accuracy with the composite bow while mounted, made them a veritable shock army. They continued to bring victory after victory to Attila, making him the master of Central Europe. After years of conquest, oppression and extortion, however, Attila's recent invasion of Western Europe would be challenged: a remnant Roman army, under the command of Flavius Aetius, was sent to stop him on a field known as the Catalaunian Plain, near the village of Chalons. The Battle of Chalons would decide the fate of Europe.&#10;&#10;Chalons utilizes the tried-and-true Battles of the Ancient World system, providing a simple yet accurate portrayal of ancient warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all of the details that characterized warfare in the era of sword and shield. Various units may simply be swordsmen, while others may be archers or javelin throwers, horsemen, etc. The system includes rules for leaders, charges, melee, diversionary attacks, demoralization and more. A group of barbarians, for example, may be ordered to charge an enemy phalanx that had already hurled their javelins. As the barbarians near the phalanx, however, they may be ambushed by enemy ballistas hidden behind the ranks and waiting to disrupt just such a charge.&#10;&#10;In Chalons the traditional design of the classic Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the true strictures of ancient warfare. Famous leaders, such as Attila, also influence combat, replicating the importance of their presence during battle. Winning will depend on deployment, maneuver and opportunity, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    17 x 22&quot; (43 x 56 cm) terrain map&#10;    100 die-cut counters&#10;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series&#10;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Characters give have special limited-use abilities and modifiers for the tanks they're with.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 cards, and draws 1 each turn. They use the cards to determine what actions they use each turn, such as movement (sometimes one tank, sometimes many), fire, a combination of both (with different modifiers), or other abilties. Other cards may be used as reactions to a card played by the other player, and some are special effects that happen upon drawing the card.&#10;&#10;Game system is based on World Tank Battles.&#10;A sequel Panzer Vor Ausf. 2 was published in 2016.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Normandy Campaign is a two-player game on the fighting in Normandy which occurred after the Allied D-Day landings of June 6, 1944.  There are two identical maps, one for each player each hidden from the other.  Hexes are 10km, each turn 3 days, counters are from regiments to divisions.  Each turn consists of multiple movement and combat phases for each player.  Movement into enemy territory is done by stating the hex you wish to enter.  The opposing player must state if he has a unit in that hex, if not movement succeeds and may continue.  If so, an attack may take place if desired, and may involve multiple units on both sides with the attacker coming from one or more hexes.  Units are only revealed during combat.  Combat losses are in steps (7-8 becomes 5-8, then 3-8, then 1-8, then elim, etc) and determined by dice on a CRT.  Supply, fortifications and air power rules are included.  Victory is determined per scenario and is based on liberating cities or for exiting the west edge of the map.&#10;&#10;This is in the same series with Operation Market Garden: Descent Into Hell&#10;&#10;",

Each round, one player assumes the role of the bartender, who is looking for the best heroes to accomplish a quest.

    "Description": "&quot;VAUCHAMPS&quot; is a tactical game in the La Bataille series with a different rule set from those used by the other publishers in the series.&#10;&#10;Publisher's information:&#10;&#10;For the casual reader who looks into the &ldquo;100 Days&rdquo; and the Waterloo Campaign, one of the early questions is, &ldquo;Who (the heck) is Grouchy?&rdquo; Followed up by wondering why (on earth) Napoleon would give this guy a third of his army and depend on him to keep Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Prussians far from Wellington.&#10;&#10;In context of Grouchy&rsquo;s performance then, it&rsquo;s a very reasonable question. But the answer goes back to February,1814, where - at the Battle of Vauchamps &ndash; then-Cavalry-General Grouchy showed he could be extremely good at chasing Bl&uuml;cher.&#10;&#10;Vauchamps is one of those interesting battles mostly lost in the blur of &ldquo;the 1814 Campaign,&rdquo; where Napoleon kept giving bloody noses to the advancing allied armies but never quite had the strength for a decisive victory. Few Allied noses were as far out in front as that of Marshal Bl&uuml;cher. There, in a small chapter called the &ldquo;Six Days Campaign,&rdquo; Napoleon dealt the &ldquo;Army of Silesia&rdquo; defeat after defeat. Reeling from this, Bl&uuml;cher tried to disengage from Napoleon&rsquo;s personal attention and attack an isolated corps under Marmont, with a mostly infantry force that included the names Zieten, Pirch, and Kleist that we would see in 1815.)&#10;&#10;But &ldquo;Boney&rdquo; anticipated that move and turned the tables on Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Prussians and Russians, who were advancing with little cavalry. For one time in 1814, Napoleon had more horses engaged and used them well.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Vauchamps can be seen in three phases...Bl&uuml;cher advancing while Marmont falls back toward reinforcement, Marmont&rsquo;s counterattack, and Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s shock at discovering &ldquo;the Ogre&rdquo; again confronting him and falling back. Phase 3 is a long pursuit action - French cavalry hounding Allied squares (and breaking several!) Had the ground been less muddy (allowing the French horse artillery to stay closer), things would have been even worse for the Allies. As it was, in the final count, Allied losses may have been greater than 10-1 over the French, and Bl&uuml;cher (once again) was very nearly captured.&#10;[publisher's description]&#10;&#10;La Bataille de Vauchamps is the 2013 ATO Annual.

    "Description": "From the designer:&#10;&#10;ElfBall is rich in tactical stimulation, but streamlined in play. It's the kind of game for those nights when you'd like to play something, but don't want to commit to a traditional fantasy sports simulation.&#10;&#10;One of the great mysteries of the sport of Elfball is just where it began, and how it got its name. The Elves of the vast forests of the Westerlands claim to have been playing the sport since the dawn of time, and that they named it in honor of themselves. The Dwarves and Orcs, high in their mountain homes, dispute this bold claim and insist that the game&rsquo;s name instead refers to the type of severed head that makes the best ball core; both races maintain that they are in fact the originators and some of the bloodiest wars in the history of the realms have been fought over this claim. The men of the Middle Kingdoms ignore the squabbles of the elder races and call the game De Circque instead.&#10;&#10;Today Elfball is played by every nation and tribe of the world, and with a few regional variations, it is played the same on fields throughout The Realms. The design of the field, the distinctive ball, and the rules of play are all quite standardized.&#10;&#10;This game was prototyped in 2002 by Phigs Miniatures but did not see production until the game rules were overhauled and changed about 80% from the prototype and then released by Impact! Miniatures in 2007.&#10;&#10;",
