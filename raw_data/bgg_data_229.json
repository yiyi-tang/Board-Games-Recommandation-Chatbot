Each round states with one player revealing a challenge card that shows a colored image, with numbers on the various colored items. Players then race to stack some of their rings on one thumb in the order shown on the challenge card. The first player to do so claims the card, and the first player to collect five cards wins!&#10;&#10;Thumbs Up! includes variants that have you start each round with the rings on your fingers or in a pile in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Shock Troop: The Israeli Counterstroke Against Syria, 1973, is an operational level game depicting the Israeli offensive on the Golan Heights during the second half of the Yom Kippur War, 11 to 23 October 1973.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #168.&#10;&#10;From the game rule booklet, &quot;The massive Syrian armored attack in the Golan Heights had finally been stopped, with tremendous equipment losses on both sides. The gallant but weary soldiers of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) now prepared a daring invasion of Syria that could put them in artillery range of the enemy capital in a matter of days. Somehow, the IDF reformed the battered 7th Armored Brigade and the 21st Tank Division and sent them forward with the 20th Brigade's old Super Sherman tanks in support. Brilliant flanking maneuvers, a spirit of improvisation, and further reinforcements created a miniature blitzkrieg. Syrian troops and leaders alike panicked. The call went out for help from brother Arab nations. Only the timely arrival of the Iraqi 3rd Tank Division halted the advance of near Damascus. At that point, the United States put its forces on global nuclear alert to head off a Soviet para drop into Syria, and both superpowers proceeded to clamp down on their clients, ending the operation and with it the &quot;Yom Kippur War.&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1-2 days (variable)&#10;Hex: 1.5 miles / 2.4 km&#10;Unit: Company to Battalion&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (240 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page rules booklet&#10;&#10;5 replacement counters were issued in S&amp;T 171.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on how many players have chosen a card, fish can be taken from the barrel. &#10;The game ends when a player has five fish on the bottom of the barrel.&#10;&#10;2. Fresh Fish: The card playing mechanism in this variant is similar to the one in Rotten Fish. In this game players try to buy fish from the different &quot;displays&quot; in the barrel.&#10;&#10;3. Fish in the Barrel: By playing their cards players try to sell their fish to the market (the barrel). Depending on the cards the other players played a player can place 1 - 4 fish in the barrel.&#10;&#10;",

Created by French illustrator Claude Combacau, Catsass won a Golden Blog Awards 2015 in the &ldquo;Best Comic&rdquo; category. First book to be released in spring 2016 by Planeta (publisher in Spain of the comics Game of Thrones, Star Wars and The Walking Dead Chronicles).&#10;&#10;Developed by board game designer Delphin Druelle at Eclosion Games, &lsquo;Make a Mess&rsquo; features the comic&rsquo;s perfectly irreverent cat making an uncontrollable mess in the house &ndash; while trying not to get caught.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY :&#10;&#10;Players begin with 8 Cat Prank cards and 3 Bonus cards.&#10;&#10;Each player has to make 3 actions during is turn: &#10;1. Roll the dice to move the Parents from one room to another. &#10;2. Move the Cat where you want (or stay in the same room). &#10;3. Play a Cat Prank card in the room where the Cat is located. Use your Bonus cards whenever you want to change the rules of the game and play tricks against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each Cat Prank card has a level of nastiness from 1 to 5. If a player reach 10 points or above in a room, he has to take responsibility for the mess and put a Cat Paw Pawn.&#10;&#10;If the Parents go to the room where your Cat Paw Pawn is, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;To win: be the first to play all your Cat Prank cards or last cat standing!&#10;&#10;TESTED AND APPROVED :&#10;&#10;Here are the top 5 game features that the gamers have liked the most:&#10;&#10;1. The players&rsquo; jokes triggered thanks to the Catsass comic art illustrations &#10;2. The level of adrenaline which quickly grows exponentially during the game &#10;3. The possibility to play tricks at the worst possible timing (for the opponent) &#10;4. The duration (15min max) which allows for successive games (revenge!) &#10;5. The fact that no cat was harmed in the making of this game (only humans)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players of Canadian Civil War control the government officials, interest groups, and constituencies who adhere to various schools of thought in regard to Separatism vs. Federalism.  It is the interaction among players during any given turn that affects the course of the game.&#10;&#10;The game map is an abstract representation of the areas where military and political events occur.  These areas all surround the &quot;Crisis Zone&quot;, where control of the issues is decided. Counters represent political forces (premiers, civil servants, interest groups, the prime minister, etc.) and military units (which may be called in case of a national emergency). Election procedures roughly model the Canadian parliamentary system.  If a majority government cannot be formed, players must negotiate to form a coalition.&#10;&#10;The winner must maintain a viable government for two full elections and appease the Separatists (if the election went Federal) or maintain Separatist Sovereignty otherwise.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Blood Royals, a roll &amp; write game book, the political climate of the land changes several times as you play through the game sheets, meaning that the map geography on the game sheets changes over time.&#10;&#10;&#10;The product of years of clan wars, Blackwallen&rsquo;s history is rich. Before recorded history, songs tell of a chieftain named Odif who led Clan Black to many victories and in time chiseled out the land of Blackwallen. He declared himself king and established laws for a royal bloodline. Descendents of Odif occupied the throne through centuries of in-fighting, war, and famine. To many, Blackwallen&rsquo;s constant instability meant it was cursed. To others, it was just home.&#10;&#10;One hundred years ago a new age dawned. Adjacent kingdoms were uninterested in conquering the land, and peace at home meant security in Blackwallen for perhaps the first time. With security came cultural and scientific pursuits and the king himself declared an &ldquo;Age of Peace&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;King Leopold is the third king of the Age of Peace. He has levied trade agreements with neighbors into alliances. He is a young king, but already the people talk of his wisdom.&#10;&#10;When he dies, a very real void will be left. His queen will no longer have a doting husband. His children will be without a loving father. The Orbly Street Tavern will no doubt miss its masked late night musician known only as &ldquo;The Night Singer&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The Kingdom of Blackwallen will no longer have their beloved monarch.&#10;&#10;Blood Royals is a game about two relatives trying to claim the throne from a dying king. Secretly choose your action, reveal and then use your skills (and a bit of luck) to conquer lands and gain the favor of influential people with powerful abilities.&#10;&#10;This is a roll and write game. All you need to play is the perforated game sheets in this book, some pencils, and some dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Stealth Chess is a chess-under-imperfect-information variant, a kind of cross between chess and Stratego. In name and power, the pieces are standard chessmen, but they are shaped like Stratego pieces so that each player can only identify the pieces of his own army. At the start both sides arrange their armies any way they like on the first two ranks. Pawns are allowed to move two squares forward on either the first or second rank. The object is to capture the enemy King. The identity of a piece is revealed when it is captured. The official rules then call for the piece to be returned to its previous owner (off the board), facing away from its captor.&#10;&#10;Stealth Chess has the same pieces as conventional chess(16 Black &amp; 16 White) but unlike traditional chess, all pieces look the same and have the pieces title printed on the back side so your only chance to win is to memorize the movement of your opponents and which piece was moved. This memory play helps with regular chess play by improving your memory.&#10;&#10;The game begins with pieces being randomly placed by each player in the first and second row of each side of the board. You decide the strategic possibilities of the placement of your pieces. For example, you might put your Queen front-row center and hide your King in a corner. The excitement begins with the first move. From that point forward, you must try to figure out your opponent's pieces by their movements and seek out and capture the King. Of course, you may &quot;disguise&quot; a powerful piece by moving it as if it were a mere Pawn--until you strike without warning. No check, no checkmate. Boom! Victory is yours.&#10;&#10;There are several different rule sets included that the players agree upon beforehand. The simplest is a standard opening position setup. You'll know which piece is which at the beginning of the game and the trick is to remember.&#10;&#10;",

This game combines bluffing, hand management, and your ability to be a jerk in one tidy package. In a round, each player starts with a hand of five cards, with the cards being similar to a Pairs deck (one 1, two 2s, up to ten 10s), but with some of the cards from 1-5 being labeled &quot;low&quot; and some from 6-10 being labeled &quot;high&quot;; if a card isn't labeled, then it can be anything from 1-10.&#10;&#10;Each player reveals one card simultaneously, and whoever reveals the highest card starts. On a turn, the player choose one card from hand, places it face down with 1-3 honey chips on it, then draw a new card. The next player can either place the same number of chips on it to pass the card to the next player or take the card and chips; if the card matches a number the player already has, they are out of the round and must ante a number of chips equal to the card number to the pot. If no one takes the card, then whoever first played the card must take it, scoring lots of chips but killing themselves if they played a number they already had.&#10;&#10;The round continues until a player has cards that sum to at least 35, they have three cards valued 1-5 in front of them, or they're the only one still in the round. That player wins the pot, then everyone scores points equal to the number of honey chips they have. After a certain number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Instead, you just get back up on your feet, respawn your Champion, and continue fighting! Think of it as a sort of card-based battle-royal, like a Battle Arena game, where you play for KOs.&#10;&#10;Unlike other battle card games where players take their turns one-at-a-time, in Galatune everyone attacks simultaneously! It's an exciting formula that keeps the game moving and encourages players to predict and react to each other in real time.&#10;&#10;Great game for first-time gamers or serious pros!

A player controls at least one but can control up to three armies per game. You can use the board sections to create inlets, peninsulas, isthmuses, lakes, and more. Adding vortex and terrain markers allows you even more control over the layout of the game board and how it will be traversed. Your ability to take advantage of the layout of the battlefield is crucial to victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;Each army is made up of 12 Army Units, one General, and one Supply Pawn. At the start of your turn, you must decide if you are going for supplies or moving your army.  On taking possession of the dice: first see if any of your Army Units are in danger and if so, respond defensively; second, see if any of your opponent's Army Units are vulnerable and, if possible, attack; third, if neither of these choices applies, go for supplies. Sun Tzu says: &quot;Do not move without considering all the possibilities. Move always with a clear purpose.&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules for movement of your army allow you to simulate many strategies from the ancient battlefield. Even &ldquo;cavalry charges&rdquo; are possible&mdash;where a unit dashes across the board to attack an enemy position. Your mission is to surround and eliminate enemy Army Units until only your Army is left, leaving you the victor.&#10;Deals and alliances can be made in the open or in secret. But only one commander can emerge victorious: knowing when and with whom to form alliances and when to break them can sometimes determine who wins and who loses.&#10;&#10;",

The 4 &quot;clans&quot; have a parallel to classic card &quot;suits&quot; and achieving clan &quot;supremacy&quot; is akin to having a suit being &quot;trump&quot;.&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt to each player, and then players bid for the three treasure cards in the center of the table. The highest bidder receives those cards.&#10;&#10;A trick is led, and players must follow suit if they are able. If not, they may play a card of another clan, but the combat strength is reduced.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules:&#10;- Certain cards can be swapped out for others that add another dimension to play&#10;&#10;- Players can be dealt &quot;roles&quot; which grant them access to 2 &quot;powers&quot;: one activated if they lose the high bid, and another if they win the bid. The powers range from forced card exchanges to card value shifts.&#10;&#10;In 2016 the base game comes bundled with the &quot;Dwarven Kingdom&quot; expansion (PNH0301).&#10;&#10;",

Operation Supercharge: The big offensive that brokethrough the German lines and routed the Africa Korps (7 turns).  &#10;&#10;&#10;The components consist of the following: a 'Standard' Rules fold-out 'sheet'(about 3-Full pages) for the game series; an 'Exclusive' Rules sheet(1-page); a 4-COLOR paper Mapsheet-(17&quot; by 22&quot;); a set of cardboard counters(around 120).

Game scale is given as 1.7 Miles across each hex, each Turn represents 1-Day, and Units range in size from Battalion up to Brigade level.&#10;&#10;One unique thing of Supercharge is that the supply rules in the standard rules game are ignored completely.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Experience the eye-bending effect of Crystallized! In Crystallized, players will match up colors on the hexagonal cards in their hand with those already played in the play area. Once the color or colors have been matched up, the player will deposit the appropriate number of crystals to the facet board. If a player makes a match with a card that scores more than enough to fill the facet board with that color, they may take the leftover crystals, and dump them on an opponent &ndash; as long as that player has at least one of that color in their collection. They are stuck with those unwanted crystals for the rest of the game.  Don&rsquo;t forget that cards can also be built on top of other cards within the play area, making the game even more complex and challenging. The game is made up of high-quality components that feature a satisfying tactile experience. The beautiful, jewel-colored crystals along with the beautifully designed hexagonal cards make up a gorgeous, abstract play area that&rsquo;s different each time. Crystallized is easy to learn and play, but can be as challenging as each player&rsquo;s mind desires.&#10;&#10;&#10;     THE GOAL IS SIMPLE: Deposit as many crystals as you can to the communal facet board by matching up colors on the hexagonal cards in your hand.&#10;     HOW TO PLAY: Deposit crystals to the facet board by matching colors on a card in your hand with a card already played on the play area. The more colors you match, the more crystals you can add.&#10;     STICK YOUR OPPONENTS: When you fill a facet board, you have the opportunity to stick other players with unwanted crystals.&#10;     END GAME: The game ends when the facet board is full of crystals.&#10;     WIN by having the fewest crystals in your collection at the end of the game.&#10;     EASY TO LEARN, DIFFICULT TO MASTER: Crystallized is easy to learn to play, but can be as challenging as each player would like it to be.&#10;     HIGH QUALITY COMPONENTS: Players will enjoy this beautifully crafted game with highly satisfying tactile elements.&#10;     FUN FOR EVERYONE: Families or Friends: 2-4 players, ages 8-99. Plays in 20 minutes. You will want to play again and again.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A continuation of the series of VHS and DVD Nightmare/Atmosfear board games.&#10;&#10;The aim of Atmosfear is to collect a key from each of the six regions of the board before heading to the &quot;Well of Fears&quot; in the centre and attempting to draw your fear from among those of your opponents in order to win the game. This must be done before the clock counts down to zero, or all players lose automatically.&#10;&#10;Like all previous games in the Nightmare/Atmosfear series, Atmosfear makes for stressful play. Players rush to take their turn and pass on the dice as quickly as possible before the Gatekeeper appears and calls on them, and are encouraged to work competitively against each other.&#10;&#10;Atmosfear 2019 uses an App - for apple and android devices - which acts as a timer, constantly ticking away toward the end of the game. It is also a channel for The Gatekeeper, who frequently appears on screen and causes problems for any or all of the players. As in the previous DVD version, the Gatekeeper&rsquo;s appearances are randomised so you cannot predict when he will turn up next or what he&rsquo;ll say. But unlike its predecessor, the game length is also randomised, varying between about 40 and 50 minutes. Where there was only one screen in all the previous versions, the App can run on multiple devices, so the Gatekeeper can sometimes pop on a player&rsquo;s own personal phone.&#10;&#10;",

The first card chosen must be in a corner, and subsequent cards must be adjacent to the previous one, if possible.

    "Description": "The Triple Alliance War (TAW) is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic-level simulation of the second-largest war ever fought in the New World (the largest having been the American Civil War). The Paraguayan player is attempting to hold off the onslaught of three allied nations: Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. The Allied player is generally on the offensive, attempting to win the game by invading Paraguay and seizing key areas on map within that country. The Paraguayan player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also allows for his prosecution of offensives, particularly in the early stage of the war.&#10;&#10;Game play encompasses the period that began historically in 1865 with the Paraguayans launching a preemptive strike into Argentine territory. The game ends during the first half of 1868 when, historically, the Allies broke through the Paraguayan river forts and went on to seize their capital. That advance signaled the ultimate doom of the Paraguayan cause and, though the war officially went on for another year and a half, that portion of it was more a rebellion-and-occupation struggle than an actual war.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 15.5 miles (25 km) from side to opposite side. The ground units of maneuver for both sides are primarily battalions, along with some nominal &quot;brigades&quot; and &quot;divisions,&quot; which are actually all really battalion-equivalents themselves. Each riverine unit represents on naval combat vessel or several armed rafts or transport ships. Game Turn 1 represents three months, while each one after that represents half a year.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In End of Atlantis: Revised Edition, you and your fellow players become leaders of powerful noble families faced with a prophecy of a certain, impending doom. The stone pillars of fate are falling apart while your carpenters and shipwrights toil ceaselessly building new ships for your people to escape from the mythical island before it is swallowed completely by the hungry ocean &mdash; and yet the senators and political factions still bicker for power, heedless of the tragedy of their nation. It is your sole responsibility to manipulate their decisions for the good of your vassals. You will have to evacuate as many as you can to the New Land using different fantastic vessels, hoping that the Atlaneans will recover and their legacy will endure for millennia to come.&#10;&#10;End of Atlantis: Revised Edition, created by the acclaimed Polish game designer Marcin We&#197;&#130;nicki, is an upgraded and reinvented version of a great and masterfully illustrated game of strategy based on a unique action execution and resource management system. Each player will use various methods to achieve victory: senate factions that provide different abilities, politics cards with different actions, and special cards that change the flow of the game. You should also keep in mind that as the game progresses, global events will unfold - if used to your advantage, they may push you ahead or completely hamper your doings... and that's on top of other players plotting against you!&#10;&#10;In comparison to the first edition of End of Atlantis, some major changes have been made. Firstly, the game is shorter and more dynamic thanks to completely new event cards which now affect the game from the very first round. At the same time, it's also more strategic as you can see future event cards and plan accordingly. Secondly, the mechanism used for choosing senate factions has been simplified and the factions themselves have many new, exciting functions and abilities. Thirdly, many politics cards have wider applications, allowing players to affect the game flow in more profound ways and giving them more flexibility in adjusting to the current in-game situation. Finally, the game and its rules have been generally streamlined and clarified with long card descriptions gone - &quot;End of Atlantis: Revised Edition&quot; is now fully language independent; you just need to master a few intuitive icons and keep on playing!&#10;&#10;Think, scheme and manipulate, and use every trick and tool at your disposal to secure your place among the survivors of the New Land &mdash; and whatever you do, remember that every alliance is easily broken in the face of the apocalyptic disaster that awaits just beyond the horizon!&#10;&#10;",

They're not concerned about which horse wins, however, so much as making as much money as possible from the bets they place based on which race cards they hold in hand.&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided into two phases: the bidding and the race. During each race two players will be the bookmakers, the ones who set the odds on the four horses. At the start of the race, four race cards from the deck of 80 cards are turned face-up, while each player (including each bookmaker) is dealt four race cards face down. Players look at these cards to determine which cards are out of play &ndash; that is, which horses are less likely to move during the race. The bookmakers secretly exchange two cards each to give them extra information.&#10;&#10;Then the bookmakers individually set odds on the four horses (1:1, 1:2, and so on, with the total of the second numbers adding to at least ten). They reveal these odds to the other players, who must then place at least one bet with one bookmaker. They can place more bets if desired, even with both bookmakers. Each bookmaker records the amount bet and the odds for that horse, and he can then lower the odds on that horse if desired (but if the total of the odds would drop below ten, he must raise the payoff on another horse. Players continue placing bets as long as they want.&#10;&#10;Once all bets are finished, players remove all cards from play, then reveal cards from the top of the deck one-by-one, moving the appropriately colored horse forward one space for each card revealed. Whichever horse reaches the #10 spot on the track first wins. All players who bet on this horse are paid off in the appropriate amount from the bookmakers. During the race, the betters can ask for credit from the bank to spend and win more money &ndash; but of course in the end, they will be forced to pay the money back to the bank with interest!&#10;&#10;After an agreed upon number of races, with each player being bookmaker the same number of times, whoever has the most money wins!&#10;&#10;Variant rules in Bookmaker add wild race cards that move the horse which moved on the previous turn, a bet on which horse is the nag, and a harness option in which horses can break from the track and be disqualified.&#10;&#10;",

After some fighting and hissing Schrodinger finally manages to put the cat into the box and to close it. Happy that the struggle is over he proudly announces that from now on no one is able to know if the cat is dead or alive as long as nobody looks into the box. Schrodinger orders you and your colleagues assistants to watch the box and take notes. An so you do for hours and hours&hellip;&#10;&#10;Finally, you have had enough. You turn towards your fellow colleagues, announcing that you will wager your position of first assistant to whoever is able to make the best guess on whether the cat is already dead and how long ago it died. Enthusiastically, everybody agrees, however you have a plan: to sneak into the laboratory at night and risk a peek into the box to make sure the most suitable candidate gets the title of first assistant. After all, who else would be more suitable than you?&#10;&#10;In Dead Cat you try to guess how long the cat in the box is already dead. When it's your turn you have two options: you can either look into the box or you announce that the cat is dead.&#10;&#10;If you decide to look into the box you take a card from the box deck, look at it without showing it to your opponent and put it on top of the time deck. After that you have to change your bet. Take the your betting die and change it to another site. You choose which one as long as it is not the same as before.&#10;&#10;If you decide to announce the death of the cat the round ends and you start revealing cards from the top of the time deck until you find a dead cat or there are no cards left. In the first case the player with the closest bet to the amount of revealed cards wins the round, in the latter case the player with the highest bet. In case of a tie both player receive a point.&#10;&#10;You play until one player gets 4 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gambling your fortunes in the Old West for 3 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;In Austin Poker, you will be playing four hands of five-card stud poker simultaneously out of your own deck of cards. Your initial draw is 11 cards. Out of these cards, you will choose your four hole cards and place them face down on your player mat. You will then choose your first show card for each hand and place them face down on the hole cards, leaving you with a hand of three. Each hand's show card is revealed and bid on separately. After all hands have been bid upon, players draw one card for each hand they have not folded. The next show cards are placed with their respective hands, face down. This play continues until all hands have been played to five cards. The winners receive the pots. Then, all players have the opportunity to purchase Bonus cards in the order they finished the poker phase. The bonus cards count toward the victory points required to win the game, as well as having abilities that help you on subsequent turns. At the tend of each turn, the money spent buying Bonus cards is divided equally among all of the players and the next turn begins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Battle of Gettysburg was fought in July 1, 1863 until July 3rd of the same year. It took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. &#10;It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as the war's turning point.&#10;Union Major General George Gordon Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This battle put an end to Lee's plans for an invasion of the North.&#10;&#10;Lee vs Meade is a game that covers the Battle of Gettysburg. It was the first game in a series of games put out by Rand known as the 'Command Series Volume I'.  The later version put out by Gamut of Games featured a mounted map-board while the original Rand Games version had a map on heavy paper.&#10;Lee vs. Meade has a 17&quot;X17&quot; map 72 counters(36 for each player) combat charts and turn records charts along with a rulebook.  The scale used is 1/2 mile per square and each unit is considered to be an entire division.  The two-color map is mainly green but there are also some hills and ridges. There is a clearly shown road network of the area as well as terrain that are suitable for defensive outposts.&#10;&#10;The map of the Gettysburg area is broken up into a 12x12 square grid.  This grid system was used in several of the games developed by Rand Game Associates and was called the Time/Space Grid. Movement costs necessary to go from one square to the next are visible on the grid at the edges and corners between the squares making it easier to move without the use of a movement chart. Unlike some games that use a square grid, diagonal movement is permitted.&#10;&#10;Another feature common to most of the games offered by Rand Games was fairly elaborate combat sub-routine in which the attacker and defender would each pick a combat method from a 6x6 matrix called the Tactical Analysis Chart and draw the appropriate &quot;Tac Card.&quot; These &quot;Tac Cards&quot; are numbered from 1 to 6. The cell on the Tactical Analysis Chart that corresponds to the intersection of the two players' combat methods determines which combat results table is used. There are 6 different types of CRT used in this game.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence is easy. Firstly the Confederate army moves.Any combat resulting is resolved and then the Union army moves and any combat is resolved.&#10;In order to initiate a combat you have to move your units onto a square edge that contains enemy units. &#10;There are four different scenarios in the game. A different time of the battle is used in each one and different victory conditions are required for each one.&#10;&#10;",

As a demigod, a player initially has access to 24 heroes from which he can choose his army. With his choice he then faces his opponent(s) on sacred battleground.&#10;&#10;There are different game modes regarding picking heroes (chieftain, random, mirror, free pick mode), and regarding conditions on which victory is achieved (skirmish, tactics). It is the game that relies heavy on tactics, that is fairly simple to learn but hard to master and that has a great replayability.&#10;&#10;In time of Chaos, the God of War was supreme ruler over all other gods. But Time of Peace came, and lasted so long that God of War started to lose his power. He grew weaker as the years went by and was pushed to the side by other gods. When his power faded so much that he felt that the end was near he gave the task to his four sons, the demigods, to try to prove themselves as best commanders in the field of battle. The one who can emerge victorious should become the new God of War and bring back the former glory to their name.&#10;&#10;Gather your heroes, challenge your friends, become the God of War!&#10;&#10;",

Despite the release dates, the board game was actually designed prior to the computer game.&#10;&#10;The turn-based computer game's origin began with fighting mechanics that were meant to have a similar flavor to Avalon Hill's Titan, but the program lacked a story-line and theme. Meanwhile, development of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up under the working title of &quot;Bounty Hunter.&quot; New World Computing, which owned Task Force Games at the time, decided to have the computer game adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game.&#10;&#10;The computer game, designed by Jon Van Caneghem, is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of computer and video games. A sequel to the original computer game, called King's Bounty: The Legend, was released in 2008.&#10;&#10;New World Computing transferred ownership of Task Force Games  prior to the production of the board game, which delayed the board game's release. The major remaining component that had to be completed was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why rules artwork changed from that produced for other game components.

In each awaits a group of girls, each with different personalities. Each player can use different cards to chat, make a joke, offer a drink, dance, etc., with each action generating positive and negative tokens with each girl. When you have 5-7 tokens with a girl, it's time to decide to &quot;jump in the deep end&quot;. Depending on the tokens generated, you'll have either success (kiss, phone number, passion) or failure (snake, water snake, boyfriend). With a success, the girls give passion points that are needed to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Raven Flight - Draw 1 card from the Raven Flight deck and discard it face up to the bottom of the game board. The card drawn equals the number of spaces 1 or more Ravens will fly (i.e. move) this turn.&#10;&#10;Phase 2. Raven Attack - Each Raven that ends its flight on a space your marker occupies will attack you in turn. For each Raven draw 1 Raven Strength card plus 1 additional card for each freed Raven.&#10;&#10;Then, play cards from your hand into a discard pile in front of you, adding the values of each card together for your defense strength. If your defense strength is greater than the Raven&rsquo;s attack strength you have freed the Spellshard.&#10;&#10;Phase 3. Wanderer Movement/Freeing -&#10;The cards in your hand are used both for defense and movement. Each card you play will go in a discard pile in front of you.&#10;&#10;Recovered Spellshards Deck -&#10;When Ravens are freed they become Spellshards you have recovered. You may use a Spellshard at any time during a round, playing them from your hand, but once a Spellshard is played it is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;This game is part of a series: The other two games are Seeker in the Forest of Wyr and Land of Enin&#10;&#10;",

The aim of the game is to gain the most cultural advances by creating as much stability in a region as possible.&#10;&#10;Huns, Romans, and Germans by Gerhard H. Kuhlmann follows a similar theme although the game is broken down into basic and advanced rules and scenarios.&#10;&#10;The game comes with wood tokens as the playing pieces.  Detailed stickers are applied to the tokens to represent various types of units.  A deck of cards also accompanies the game which drives the invasions and advancements.

He realizes he has been robbed and enlists the help of some other children, &quot;the detectives&quot;, to help find the man who stole his money.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a two-piece board, which joins together like a puzzle, and 31 tiles depicting city scenery that stick vertically into the board. There are 34 places on the board on which the players can move. Each one is covered by a wooden cylinder. The picture of the criminal is under one of the cylinders. One player will move this cylinder around the board.&#10;&#10;One player plays the role of the criminal, Herr Grundeis, and the other players are the detectives. Herr Grundeis needs to try to cross the board from the station to the park before the detectives, played by the other players, find him. If Herr Grundeis reaches the park, he wins. If one of the detectives finds him, the detectives win. Herr Grundeis moves first. He roles the black die. The detectives now put on their blindfolds. Herr Grundeis now moves up to the number of spaces indicated on the die. He cannot move more than the number of spaces indicated on the die, but he can move less. The detectives see the die so they know how many spaces the criminal may have moved. The detectives remove their blindfolds and are given a clue that partially describes the tile in front of the criminal. The detectives role the white die in turn and move up to the number of spaces indicated, hopefully stopping in front of a tile that meets the criteria mentioned in the clue. The player checks bottom of the cylinder he has landed on to see if Herr Grundeis is hiding there. Each detective roles the die and moves before Herr Grundeis moves again.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There's a big mess on the table! Who can clean up the cards the fastest, while also lining up cards that match one another?&#10;&#10;In Connect the Thoughts &ndash; first released as Kuddelmuddel, which is German for &quot;hodgepodge&quot; &ndash; players try to put together chains of cards in order to score points. To set up the game, the players scatter the 80 cards in the deck face down on the table and place the bell within reach of all players. Everyone then simultaneously starts looking at face-down cards one by one. You can place the first card you see face up to start a row in front of you. To place another card next to this first one, whether on the left or right, the newly placed card must have at least one image in common with the card already in place.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has seven matching cards in a row, she rings the bell. If she goofed up, she sits out the round until another player creates a row; if she did everything correctly, she scoops up those cards and places them in a pile beside her while all other players reshuffle their cards into those that remain on the table.&#10;&#10;The game ends whenever the last card is taken from the center of the table. Whoever has collected the most cards (i.e., rows) wins!&#10;&#10;",
