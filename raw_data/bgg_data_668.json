Ally forces such as those found in Tribes of the Vale are represented as tan colored miniatures on the board, differentiating them from the forces of the house they are supporting. This provides greater customization for Skirmish battles and allows players to easily find their allied troops on the field during battle.&#10;&#10;Included in Tribes of the Vale are are three new commanders and three new unit types. Shagga, Son of Dolf is a ruthless barbarian of the Stone Crows, capable of wielding two massive battle axes better than some men handle one. Timett, Son of Timett earned his place as the Red Hand of the Burned Men by taking out his own eye. A fearless expert swordsmen, Timett rarely fails to kill anyone he means to. Finally, Chella, Daughter of Cheyk is a vicious woman, decorating herself with the ears of her enemies.&#10;&#10;In addition to these new forces, Tribes of the Vale also comes with a rules and battle plan book, new terrain, and Clansmen Gambit and Skirmish cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "League Championship is a game for 2-6 players that simulates an entire season of the English Football League Championship.  It dates from the 1970s and has versions endorsed by footballers George Best and Gordon Banks.&#10;&#10;During setup, each player is dealt a face-down stack of action cards which will be used during the game, and a miniature silver plastic trophy is placed on prominent display in the centre of the game's circular board.&#10;&#10;Players then, in turn, simulate fixtures by rolling a blue die for the home team and a green die for the away team, followed by turning over an action card which modifies the dice rolls in favour of either team.  Examples of action cards are &quot;Work out new corner kick - score 2 more goals&quot; and &quot;Recent Cup commitments in Europe weaken team - lose 1 goal in this match&quot;.  The result of the match is thus determined with players scoring two points for a win, one for a draw and nothing for a loss.&#10;&#10;A player's team's progress is tracked by use of two tokens - a small pawn on a score track to show the current points total and a footballer figure on a calendar track to mark the number of fixtures played.  At the end of the season, the player whose team has accumulated the most points wins the league championship, and of course the trophy!&#10;&#10;",

They make use of strategically deployed armies and barricades, occupy neutral cities to control their resources, and fight their way across the battlefield to capture their opponent's capital.&#10;&#10;Fyrdwisa is a turn-based strategy game in which players spend action points and reveal resource cards to perform actions. Depending on the neutral cities they control, players receive between 1 and 6 action points each turn. Players may save action points from turn to turn (up to 12 points) to perform special actions or execute sudden military maneuvers. Depending on the number of players, there are up to 4 neutral cities for players to attack. Each city's resource is revealed when it is first occupied. The game includes cards for 10 possible city resources (which are assigned randomly) so each game plays out differently. When attacked, neutral cities may &quot;bribe&quot; players into retreating by providing them with a single-use special resource card.&#10;&#10;Fyrdwisa is played on a cloth game board printed with a hexagonal battlefield. Each hexagon is divided into six triangles, in which players place small glass game pieces. Action point counters are printed in the corners of the game board, to assist in tracking available points each turn. City resources are printed on heavy stock paper cards.&#10;&#10;",

It plays at company level, meaning that a player controls a company (98 men in the game) and one figure is one man. The models move and fight as units of 4-8 men each. Smaller games can be played (with about 50 figures per player) and of course with enough players, large tables, and plenty of time, you can play much larger actions!&#10;&#10;Figures as independently based but we suggest using magnetic trays for rank and file to speed up movement. Skirmishers are independent figures. Command figures are on a separate stand containing a leader figure, a drummer and a flag-bearer. &#10;Other leaders are single-based. Skirmishers are represented by two single figures in front of a rank and file unit.&#10;&#10;Confusion/disorder in units is represented by turning the disordered figures with their back to the enemy. As corporals rally them back in line, they can recover and be turned back to face the enemy. Casualties are represented by removing figures. Units with less than 4 figures run back to the player&rsquo;s baseline and can be rallied later.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of each player is to get the water situation in the country right, which means there is no dirty water in the country and there are exactly six clean water tokens in the lake.&#10;&#10;Water flows from the mountain to the sea. Also hovering clouds evaporate water or rain down water on the land, depending on weather conditions.&#10;&#10;The game has three levels, increasing in complexity but also making the game less random.&#10;&#10;",

It's not surprising that an expansion this large also had an errate published for it, the year after printing.&#10;&#10;This record sheet set is listed as out of print by the current licence holder, and no electronic version is available.

The mission of each player is to move forward into enemy territory and destroy the enemy command post.&#10;&#10;The game contains 210 counters, most of it whit a fine representation of guns and vehicles that took part in the real battle. Player have to command infantry, tanks, artillery, planes and supply units, in order to move into enemy terrain and to destroy enemy command post. The game involves use of resources as well, so movement and attack of units uses supplies counters, and players have to obtain supply every turn, through supply units.&#10;&#10;Combat between units is defined with dices in a simple but smart way. Artillery units provide extra support to attacking units, obtaining powerful attack even with cheap vehicles.&#10;&#10;The game also includes two card decks, one for each army. Cards provide extra power units and extra resources; it also makes shortage of ammo and fuel to the enemy.&#10;&#10;As in the real battle, there is no invincible unit.

There are many ways to obtain victory, and to defeat the enemy, and only a good strategy is needed to gain the battle.&#10;&#10;",

The sorcerer and a valiant knight are hanging from the towers with ropes. 24 key tokens are spread out around the tower.&#10;&#10;One player now flips open a keyhole card and turns a sand timer. All players are now trying to grab a matching key. When all players hold one, the keys are compared with the keyhole. If a key matches, the knight climbs up one storey. If none matches, the sorcerer climbs up. On certain levels there are guards, which means that the knight has to roll a die to advance (if he's failing it, the sorcerer advances. If the knight gets to the top first, all players win.&#10;&#10;(User summary by HilkMAN)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Aadu Puli Attam (goat and tiger game) is a strategic, two-player board game. It is a traditional game that has been popular for ages in the southern states of India. In the state of Karnataka it's called Huli gatta and in Andhra Pradesh it is known as Puli Joodam or Puli-Meka.&#10;&#10;The game is asymmetric - one player controls three tigers and the other player controls up to 15 goats. The tigers try to capture all goats, while the goats attempt to encircle the tigers and win.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the goats off the board, and the tigers positioned at the apex and the two inner intersections closest to the apex.&#10;&#10;Players take turns and move along the lines.&#10;&#10;The player controlling the goats makes the first move by placing a goat in a free intersection. (Goats cannot move until all 15 have been placed on the board.)&#10;&#10;The tiger can either move to an adjacent intersection along a line, or capture a goat by jumping over it just as in Checkers/Draughts. (Unlike goats, tigers can move right from the first turn.)&#10;&#10;The game ends when all goats have been captured, or when none of the tigers can move.&#10;&#10;NOTE:&#10;Only one goat can be captured at a time. The captured goat leaves the board.&#10;A tiger cannot be captured.&#10;Turns alternate between players, with the goats starting off the game.&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10;Goat: 15 small pieces. &#10;Tiger: 3 big pieces. &#10;Board with lines and 23 Spots for moving Aadu and Pulis.&#10;&#10;",

Her very name meant she was gifted in every way by the gods: beautiful, wise, musical, persuasive, confident . . . and curious.  She was given a jar that contained all of the world&rsquo;s evils, and also one good spirit, Hope.  In the end, she chose to open it, and set the course for humanity.&#10;&#10;Pandora's Box provides a simple and deep abstract party game for a group of players to analyze how well they know the strategic planning of their friends.  Each player receives a few white and black stones (good and evil spirits) that they drop into a box in the center of the play area.  They may also switch the stones in their hands with other players throughout the game.  When someone drops her last stone into Pandora's Box, the box is opened, its contents revealed and taken by the player who opened it, and each player scores points for white stones in hand and loses a point for black stones in hand.&#10;&#10;Though it sounds incredibly simple, the game is fast, deep, thrilling, and offers tremendous psychological fun and unexpected results.  Despite having no random elements, it has plenty of hidden information that makes each game play out differently.&#10;&#10;Pandora&rsquo;s Box is offered as an entry to the Thousand Year Game Design Challenge.&#10;&#10;",

Force your partner to sell you out!&#10;&#10;TRU$T is a game based on the ownership of corporations.  There are 11 corporations in the game, each of which is made up of two to five divisions.  A player may own part of all of a corporation.  Ownership of all the divisions in a corporation is known as a &quot;trust.&quot;  In TRU$T, ownership of a corporation is shared when two or more players own division of the same corporation.  The owners of such corporations are at the same time both partners and opponents.&#10;&#10;TRU$T is played by moving your token around the board from island to island, buying and developing divisions of the corporations, collecting payments and dividends, and paying debts.  The game ends when only one player remains who had ownership in any corporation.&#10;&#10;",

The French Grande Arm&eacute;e under Emperor Napoleon I attacked the Imperial Russian Army of General Mikhail Kutuzov near the village of Borodino, west of the town of Mozhaysk, and eventually captured the main positions on the battlefield, but failed to destroy the Russian army. About a third of Napoleon's soldiers were killed or wounded; Russian losses, while heavier, could be replaced due to Russia's large population.&#10;&#10;The battle at Borodino was a pivotal point in the campaign, as it was the last offensive action fought by Napoleon in Russia. By withdrawing, the Russian army preserved its combat strength, eventually allowing them to force Napoleon out of the country.&#10;&#10;Game allows to play either side and decide about the fate of Napoleon and his conquer of Russia.&#10;&#10;",

Rules include omens, differing types of forces, as well as what the Eastern Emperor, Licinius is up to. &#10;The other game is on the climatic battle of the campaign, Milvian Bridge. This uses a hex map and a separate rules section.&#10;&#10;Components for IHSV include two 11 by 17 maps, 288 unmounted single-sided counters 1 8.5 by 11 battle board, two sets of rules (16 pages for the campaign game, 6 pages for the Milvian Bridge battle game) and 4 pages of charts/tables/tracks.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Based on The Bully Free Classroom by Allan L. Beane, Ph.D., this card game plays like Crazy Eights (players must match an element of the top card of the discard pile to play), so most kids will have some familiarity with the process. The cards are divided into four categories: What Would You Do If...,Self-Esteem Boosters, Ways to Stay Bully Free and Why Should You Do This? &#10;Kids get rid of cards (and move closer to being out, or bully free) by offering reasonable suggestions and responses to questions. Meant to be played with adult supervision (a teacher, counselor, or youth worker familiar with anti-bullying themes).&#10;&#10;",

Step up to using 15mm players on the pitch or make your own 1:1 scale pitch, the choice is yours.&#10;Play one off games using the teams provided or ones you have designed yourself. Next use the campaign system to see if your team can cut it in a League or Cup competition. The rules let you play every aspect of the modern game, dodgy referee decisions, offside nightmares, goal mouth scrambles, professional fouls, hard men tackles even the crowd support plays a part!&#10;&#10;     The Beautiful Game comes with a full color 11&quot; x 17&quot; Pitch.&#10;     Thirty five 5/8&quot; counters - two full teams plus substitutes&#10;     Rules for playing a Cup and League Campaign.&#10;     Two sets of player sheets gathering the tables you'll use for the match in one spot.&#10;     Two pre-generated teams and rules for building your own.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game play represents the action one would see in a &lsquo;Highlights&rsquo; programme like the definitive BBC &lsquo;Match of the Day&rsquo;.

After the fall of Poland the French and British are preparing themselves to face a new, bold kind of war: &ldquo;Blitzkrieg&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Supreme Commander Marshall Gamelin is confident he can hold back the German armies long enough to give its army time to re-equip and prepare.&#10;&#10;With the Franco-German border solidly defended by the fortified Maginot line, he develops an aggressive plan: the allies will race North to meet the enemy in Belgium and Holland, and stop it cold on the Dyle-Breda line.&#10;&#10;Only the Germans have chosen an unexpected, almost scandalous plan: its aim is nothing else than the utter destruction of the whole allied army by breaking through the &ldquo;impassable&rdquo; Ardennes Forest, further to the South.&#10;&#10;The attack through the Low Lands is an immense feint, aimed at luring the French and British armies North and trap them.&#10;&#10;Then begins an implacable race against the clock, as panzer spearheads emerge to the south of the allied armies and run at breakneck speed to the sea. The Allied High command watches horrified the panzer columns emerging on its back. The nervous German High Command is every bit as worried that its spearheads might get isolated and shattered.&#10;&#10;Can the armored tide can be stemmed, or is defeat all but assured?&#10;&#10;Blitz 1940 is a new Conflict of Heroes game that depicts the western campaign of May-June 1940. It pits the French, British, Belgian and Dutch armies against their arch-enemy, Germany. The battles take place in plains, forests, cities, airfields, in the skies and on the seashore!&#10;&#10;Players are presented with the same tactical dilemmas and decisions that commanders faced during some of the most ferocious engagements of WWII.&#10;&#10;Conflict of Heroes (CoH) follows the evolution of modern tactics, from WWII to the present. CoH features a fast and fluid system that is easy to learn, but realistic for every unique theater of battles portrayed.&#10;&#10;&bull; Fun: Quick simultaneous play allows players to interact without waiting.&#10;&bull; Easy: Teach a new player how to play in under 5 minutes. No charts!&#10;&bull; Historically Accurate: Portrays realistic forces and tactics.&#10;&bull; Units: Depict individual vehicles, airplanes, boats, guns and squads.&#10;&bull; Consistent: Each game in the series uses the same rule system.&#10;&#10;Blitz 1940 includes:&#10;4 - 15x19 inch geomorphic mounted map boards that integrate with the maps of all other CoH games.&#10;280 - LARGE 1&rdquo; square counters that include infantry, tanks, guns, aircraft an even ships.&#10;2 - player summary sheets, customized plastic counter storage tray,&#10;32 page firefight book with a full historical overview and 16+ firefights.&#10;A rule book organized to lead in the player through the rules, with plenty of examples.&#10;&#10;Blitz 1940 is an original game and does not require any other Conflict of Heroes game to be played.&#10;&#10;",

All ages can enjoy this simple yet addictive battle of wits.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Castaways puts the players in the muddy boots of 3 eager pirates with aspirations to captain their very own ship. Gameplay is based around building up your attacks and tricking your opponent to defend against the wrong attack. A successful attack could push you off the plank, drop your health or force your crew to desert you. Either way you're shark bait if you can't keep up with your opponent.&#10;&#10;The duel is fast paced and mechanics are simple but strategies quickly form as you try to bluff your intentions while predicting your opponents. Younger audiences will find the duel fun and exciting while older audiences will enjoy the trickery when played with a clever opponent.&#10;&#10;Characters:&#10;&#10;Jennifer Jack Johnson&#10;While simple minded &quot;Jack&quot; found that most problems in life share a simple solution.

    "Description": "Object: To follow the animal tracks and capture the wild animal before the other players can reach it.&#10;&#10;Before Playing: One player lays out the trail by placing footprint cards and the round stop/go cards at spaced intervals to form a trail that will eventually lead to the Big Game (the wild animal card). The trail can be set up inside or outside and even have trails that branch off with ones leading to dead ends.&#10;&#10;To Play: The person who spun and drew the lowest number gun goes first. They spin the spinner and move their gun the number of spaces as indicated along the animal tracks. When a hunter reaches a stop or go card they follow what is printed on the card. The first hunter to follow the correct path and find an animal card gets to keep it and lay out a new trail with another animal (or use the same trail if desired)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Paper-and-pencil game where players try to score the most points by covering square or rectangular groups of fields in an 8x8 board; each coloured field scores 1 point. Of course each player plays a different colour/symbol, and there can be no overlaps. The game should be played in several rounds, each one with a different starting player.&#10;&#10;Each turn players throw a die and colour the corresponding number of fields on the board; these must be orthogonally connected and so build a group, which doesn't have to be a straight line. Players can decide when to stop throwing - if a player can't colour the mandatory squares after a throw they leave the round with no score.&#10;&#10;",
