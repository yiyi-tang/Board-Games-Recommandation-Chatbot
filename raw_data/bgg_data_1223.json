It further requires a rather extensive collection of other Europa items, like specific issues of Bill Stone's ETO fanzine for updated OB's for specific combatants.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: For full 'Bro' rules experience, some counters need to be fabricated and are not included.&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;Clash of Eagles ground rules, Part I - 8 pages&#10;Clash of Eagles air rules, Part II - 4 pages&#10;Clash of Eagles naval rules, Part III - 0 pages (not used)&#10;Clash of Eagles political rules, Part IV - 4 pages&#10;Clash of Eagles German OB, Part V - 3 pages&#10;Clash of Eagles Allied OB, Part VI - 6 pages&#10;&#10;5 Card Stock Charts:&#10;&#10;2 x Bro rules aircraft counters in B&amp;W&#10;1 x 1 page, two sided (front &amp; back), CRT along with 'Bro' Tables&#10;1 x German Off-map Display&#10;1 x Allies Off-map Display&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Murder on the Cards is a quick play card game for 2 to 6 players that combines dark humour with the silly extremes of everyday irritants.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 6 random Save Yourself cards and a Life Card at the start of the game, to be used against the To Your Demise Card scenarios that are presented on each turn. There are also To Your Demise cards that rely on a player's wit and luck alone. The Save Yourself cards counteract the various To Your Demise scenarios, but a player needs the correct Save Yourself card to survive, and if they don't have it, they can either barter with other players or gamble with the house deck. If you can't save yourself then you are Critically Hit and reduced to 1 Save Yourself card and your Life Card. After that, if the murderer gets you through the To Your Demise cards - you're toast.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to last the longest against The Murderer. Every game is different, some result in a lone survivor and others leave everyone dead, but ultimately the last alive wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

He was credited with 352 Allied aircraft downed - of which 350 were Soviet and 2 American over the course of WW2. This was despite 16 separate instances of being forced to crash land his fighter - either due to mechanical failure or to damage incurred from the debris of enemy aircraft he himself had shot down.&#10;&#10;Prior to the War he was a glider pilot, but joined the Luftwaffe in 1940 and had completed his training by 1942. Posted to Jagdgeschwader 52, a veteran wing on the Eastern front, he benefitted from the supervision of some of the Luftwaffe's most experienced pilots, flying the Messerschmitt BF109G.&#10;&#10;As his reputation developed he gained the nickname Cherniy Chort (&quot;Black Devil&quot;), both because of his skill and his aircraft's paint scheme. Hartmann was greatly decorated for his achievements, ultimately receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds on 25th August 1944 having achieved 301 aerial victories. This was, at the time, Germany's highest military decoration.&#10;&#10;Hartmann's final victory came at midday on 8 May 1945, hours before the German surrender. Turned over to the Red Army, he was tried on war crimes and sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. He was released in 1955 and posthumously released of all charges (in 1997).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

He was the son of Polish immigrants to Pennsylvania. Abandoning his second year at Notre-Dame University, Gabreski enlisted in the USAAF, though was not a particularly successful trainee.&#10;&#10;Trained on the P-36 and P-40, Gabreski began flying sorties in the wake of Pearl Harbour to intercept further Japanese attacks, though they had withdrawn. Concerned that the US lacked experienced pilots, Gabreski volunteered and was accepted (as a Captain) on RAF duty with Polish pilots of No. 315 squadron. It was here he learnt the art of staying calm in combat.&#10;&#10;On February 27, 1943, Gabreski became part of the 56th Fighter Group, flying the Republic P-47C Thunderbolt, assigned to the 61st Fighter Squadron, and despite resentment from his fellow pilots he was soon elevated to Major and took command of the Squadron on June 9th. In the cockpit of a Thunderbolt in the European theatre, Gabreski achieved 28 aerial victories, a total never surpassed in the theatre by U.S pilots engaged with the Luftwaffe. On June 20, 1944, Gabreski had achieved the 300 hours required flight time, but rather than go home (for his wedding) he took one more mission. Following damage to his propellers after a strafing run on a Luftwaffe airfield, he was forced to crash land. He managed to evade capture for 5 days before being sent to Stalag Luft.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The P-47 Thunderbolt was a versatile US fighter aircraft produced between 1941 and 1945 operating in both the Mediterranean and Pacific theatres. In addition to eight wing-mounted .50-caliber machine guns, it was capable of carrying five-inch rockets or a bomb load of up to 2500 pounds. When fully-loaded up in this manner, the fighter was one of the heaviest of the entire war. However, this meant it could fulfil a number of roles - performing well as a short to medium range escort fighter as well as in a ground attack role.&#10;&#10;The P-47 earned praise form its pilots for its roll-rate and dive speed, and its general performance at high altitude. This performance would suffer at lower altitudes, however, as the climbing and turning rate would become far from optimal. The P-47 was viewed as a very large lumbering aircraft, and German pilots soon learned to climb, rather than dive, when the silhouette of a Thunderbolt loomed from behind. The P-47 was also fairly rugged, capable of sustaining a fair amount of damage, and its cockpit was roomy and offered decent visibility - this was further improved with the introduction of bubble canopies on some variants of the P47-D.&#10;&#10;The Thunderbolt ended the war with a total of 3752 air-to-air kills, having been deployed in all USAAF operation theatres (with the exception of Alaska). It also gradually became the primary fighter-bomber of the USAAF, with improvements in fuel allowing it to fly sorties as far as Berlin itself. The supposed tallies claimed by Thunderbolt pilots were astonishing; including 9000 locomotives, 6000 armoured vehicles and 68,000 trucks amongst others. They often employed the low-level skip-bombing tactic, to hit difficult secluded targets, such as rolling stock in tunnels.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The items you need to find are scattered across the map.&#10;&#10;In Survive a Nightmare there are two types of specters, &quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Demons&quot;, if you have an encounter with a specter your panic level will increase respectively: Ghost +1 panic point, Demon +2 panic points. If your panic level reaches &quot;5&quot; you will suffer a panic attack and lose the game.&#10;&#10;Each player turn has 2 phases, &quot;Player's&quot; phase and &quot;Specters&quot; phase, on the player's phase you have 4 action points, which can be used to move your character marker to an adjacent room, search for an item (rolling a die), use an item (each one has a different effect), activate fuse boxes, use a portal or to activate the rewards track which grants you additional items.&#10;&#10;After ending a player's phase, the specter's phase begins. The active player will roll the die twice and resolve a spawning of specters across the rooms. When the specter's phase ends, the active player's turn ends. The game takes place by alternating turns between each player, until one player completes the conjuring and wins the game. Survive a Nightmare has a solo mode and a cooperative mode.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Messerschmitt BF 109 was the real workhorse of the Luftwaffe throughout the Second World War, being the most produced fighter aircraft in history, with a total of 33,984 airframes produced between 1936 and April 1945.&#10;&#10;The Bf 109 was flown by the three top-scoring German fighter aces of World War II, who claimed 928 victories between them while flying with Jagdgeschwader 52, mainly on the Eastern Front. Pilots of other Axis nations also achieved ace status in the cockpit of a Bf 109, including pilots from Italy, Romania, Croatia and Hungary. Through constant development and improvements, the Bf 109 remained a potent and competitive aircraft.&#10;&#10;The G series, or Gustav, was introduced in mid-1942 taking its cues from the prior F series (which featured new wings, an improved cooling system and adjusted fuselage aerodynamics). The G series further improved upon the engine, mounting a more powerful 1,475 PS DB 605 engine. It had a multitude of variants, ranging from high altitude fighters with pressurized cockpits to photo-reconnaissance and even a two-seater trainer. As the war wore on, further variants were introduced with water injection boost and high-performance superchargers added, to meet developing tactical requirements.&#10;&#10;The Bf 109 achieved more aerial kills than any other aircraft of World War II. Many of these were against an inferior (in both training and equipment) Soviet Air Force during Operation Barbarossa. The operation resulted in the loss of 21,200 Soviet aircraft, of which, about half were to combat.&#10;&#10;As the war progressed and the Allies made increasing bombing incursions into German territory, the environment became ever more target-rich for Bf 109 pilots, allowing for over 100 individual Luftwaffe pilots to be credited with 100 aerial victories each. This group in total claimed almost 15,000 kills - resulting in more than 2500 Luftwaffe pilots to be considered aces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk is an American single-engined, single-seat, all-metal fighter and ground-attack aircraft that first flew in 1938. Used by most Allied powers during World War II, it would see service throughout the war. It was the third most-produced of US aircraft of WW2, behind the P-51 and P-47 - with 13,738 examples produced.&#10;&#10;Its first combat was with the British Commonwealth of the Desert Air Force over North Africa and the Middle East. Whilst Warhawk was the name utilised by all USAAF and USAAC units that employed the aircraft, other Allies used the name Tomahawk or Kittyhawk to refer to specific variants. It was thus a Commonwealth Tomahawk of No. 112 Squadron of the RAF that first adopted the iconic &quot;shark mouth&quot; design on an Allied aircraft.&#10;&#10;The main theatres of operation for the P-40 were North Africa, the Southwest Pacific and China, though it also served significantly in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Alaska and Italy. The P-40 was not especially effective at high-altitude combat, where it could be outclassed by both the Messerschmitt BF109 and the Focke-Wulf 190. It excelled at lower altitudes, however, performing as an air superiority fighter, bomber escort and fighter-bomber.&#10;&#10;The aircraft's low production cost kept it relevant throughout the war. Though it began to develop a reputation as a mediocre design later in the war, it performed well throughout. If wartime victory claim records are to be believed, the aircraft produced over 200 Allied fighter aces (from 7 different nations), including at least 20 double aces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Graduating from Austin College in 1938, he entered service as a United States Naval Aviator, earning his wings as a TBD Devastator torpedo bomber pilot aboard the USS Saratoga. He also joined a Vought SB2U Vindicator Dive Bomber Squadron aboard USS Ranger. IN 1941 he was recruited to the 1st American Volunteer Group, training on the P-40 Warhawk in Burma.&#10;&#10;Hill made his first kills on January 3rd 1942, shooting down two Japanese Nates over Thailand. 2 more followed on the 23rd and he became an ace the next day with two more kills. He thus became a squadron leader in March of that year, and by the time of the squadron's disbanding in the summer, he was a double ace, with 12 1/4 aerial victories on his record.&#10;&#10;Hill was one of only 5 of the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; to join the successor group, the 23rd Fighter Group, having a rank of major at this time, earning 5 more victories in the cockpit of a P-51. He returned home in 1944 and took command of the 412th Fighter Group, the first operational American jet fighter group (flying the P-59 Airacomet and P-80 Shooting Star). He went on to serve in the Korean War with the Texas Air National Guard.

    "Description": "The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft in the world. Though design work began well before the commencement of World War II, problems with development - from the engines to interference from the highest command levels mean that the aircraft did not reach operational status until mid-1944, too late to make the required impact. The Me 262 was more heavily armed than and outperformed every Allied aircraft in terms of speed. It served in a number of roles such as light-bomber, reconnaissance and experimental night fighter. It earned nicknames dependant on its role, dubbed Schwalbe (German for swallow) in fighter versions, or Sturmvogel (German for storm bird) in fighter-bomber versions.&#10;&#10;Though war records are sketchy pilots of the Me 262 claimed more than 542 Allied aircraft downed. Its phenomenal speed made it an extremely difficult target to intercept, however at lower speeds the 262 suffered from diminished performance due to the limitations of thrust provided by the early jet engine. Allied pilots soon learned to take advantage of this trait by attacking the aircraft at its most vulnerable during take-off and landing. Whilst airborne, Me 262 pilots were relatively safe from Allied aircraft provided they did not get drawn into low-speed manoeuvring contests.&#10;&#10;In targeting enemy bombers, new tactics needed to be developed. Head-on attacks would not work, as the closing speed did not pair well with the rate of fire of the mounted Mk 108 cannons. When engaging bombers, Me 262 pilots developed a 'broadside' attack approach.&#10;&#10;The effect of the 262 on the outcome of the war was compromised by its late entry. By 1944, German armament production had shifted to more easily producible, and cheaper aircraft. Only a small number of Me 262s saw service, with reportedly only a maximum of 200 operating at any one time. Nevertheless, the aircraft influenced post-war military jet development, captured examples being extensively tested by the post-war major powers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Walter Nowotny (7 December 1920 &ndash; 8 November 1944) was an Austrian-born fighter ace of the Luftwaffe. Credited with 258 aerial victories over 442 combat missions. He achieved 255 of these victories over the Eastern Front whilst flying predominantly the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 but also the Messerschmitt BF109. He scored an &quot;ace in a day&quot; on several occasions - five enemy aircraft shot down in a single day. There were even two occurrences of &quot;double-ace in a day&quot; - 10 kills in a day. His final three kills were in the Messerschmitt Me 262.&#10;&#10;Nowotny joined the Luftwaffe in 1939, completing his fighter pilot training in 1941. He was posted to Jagdgeschwader 54 &quot;Gr&uuml;nherz&quot; (JG 54) on the Eastern Front. Here, Nowotny was the first pilot to achieve 250 victories &ndash; 194 of them over 1943 earning several decorations. He was then prevented from flying for several months for propaganda reasons but was reinstated to front-line service in September 1944.&#10;&#10;Nowotny tested and developed the 262 jet fighter as commander of a specialist unit named Kommando Nowotny. The unit had to grapple with the continuing development of the aircraft as well as creating new aerial tactics suitable for a jet aircraft. Nowotny's first kill in the 262 was a B-24 Liberator bomber on 7 October 1944.&#10;&#10;On the 8th November, Nowotny engaged a large enemy bomber force singlehandedly, after a problem with his turbines prevented him from taking off with other aircraft. He reported over radio downing a B-24 Liberator and a P-51 Mustang before radioing with his final words - either &quot;I'm on fire&quot; or &quot;it's on fire&quot;. It is not known whether he was shot down or suffered engine failure. In the wake of his death, the first operational jet fighter wing was named in his honour.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Outclassed by dedicated enemy fighters in dogfights, the Il-2 could successfully take on other Luftwaffe aircraft. The German 7.92 mm machine guns were ineffective against the heavily armoured Sturmoviks, close formations of Junkers Ju 87 Stukas, Junkers Ju 52, Heinkel He 111 and Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor bombers would be favoured targets.&#10;&#10;Sturmovik pilots employed a brave defensive tactic, they would fly fast and low. This meant that the majority of ground fire would miss or ricochet from the armoured tub. If an enemy fighter closed in, they would slow down, letting the fighter overshoot and fly into the Il-2's firing range.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Ancient Royal Game of Ur with a new twist!&#10;&#10;In ancient civilizations, people competed in different sports and games to prove their worthiness to their gods.&#10;&#10;In Tlaczani you choose between the bravest Texotli (blue) or the fearsome Chiltik (Red) to start the run to see who's worthy of the favor of the god Macuilxochilt (5 flowers).&#10;&#10;TLACZANI is the ancient ROyal Game of Ur with a twist!&#10;Do you think you have the luck on your side?&#10;Are you under Macuilxochilt favor?&#10;Prove it!&#10;&#10;Game contents: 3 board/cards, 26 run pieces (7 red, 7 blue, 6 green and 6 yellow) and 4 four sided dices.&#10;&#10;-box bottom info&#10;&#10;The word Tlaczani comes from the Nahualt language and it means &quot;it that runs&quot;. In this game you will find some similarities with 2 ancient games; first the board is similar to the one used in the Royal Game of Ur, the oldest board game known with nearly 5,000 years old and Patolli (little red bean in Nahualt), a game played by the Teotihuacans, the Toltecs, the Mayans and the Aztecs. In this new twist of The Royal Game of Ur you will have an interesting mixture of the essential running mechanic of Ur and resource gain/exchange. Inside the box you will have all you need to play Tlaczani and other versions and interpretations of The Royal Game of Ur.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Wizard x Wizard is a Wizard battle, guess and cooperative game. Players are MaddishIsland Wizards. You can use your own 15 kinds of spell and equipment in 15 rounds. Players can cooperate with each other and start up many kinds of Magic-Combine. The wizard who wins the most has to join a War of Supreme Wizard with limited ability. If you pass the trial, then you can be the real Supreme Wizard!&#10;&#10;How to paly:&#10;Wizard x Wizard is a Key word in this game. When you already choose the spell you want to cast, you need to put your spell in front of you and say : Wizard x Wizard, then wait for your opponent. When your opponent say Wizard x Wizard and get ready, then you can put the spells on your Caracter Board and then begin to judge the effect of spells.&#10;&#10;Every wizard has 15 kinds of spell and 1 Exclusive Equipment. Spell Cards have Attack Spell and Support Spell, Attack Spell can divide into 2 kind, Magic and Physical Damage. Magic Damage is golden frame, and Physical Damage is silver frame. If the type of Damage is the same, the damage of each other will be canceled out. (The wizard with less damage will take damage.)&#10;&#10;When you play team-up mode, only one wizard can cast spell, so you need to communicate with your teammate to decide what spell your team want to cast. But it&rsquo;s a guess game, so you can&rsquo;t let your opponent know what do you think. You can use our wands to communicate with your teammate. &#10;You can use different wizard&rsquo;s Exclusive Equipment to make different combo or use Magic-Combine to double the spell's effects. &#10;  The game will over when one team&rsquo;s Life become 0 or after 15 rounds, the team with more Life will win.&#10;&#10;Another special rule of this game is : the wizard who win the most will become Quasi-Supreme and join the last Supreme Battle. You need to fight with other wizards by your own. If you win, you will be the real Supreme!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You can utilize all of the limited resource and multiple tools to make the combo to plant Taro. And you have to properly help each other and make use of special Paradise System to get more opportunities and harvest. Do not seek quick success and instant benefits, then you can score more!&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;The player who recently ate or planted Taro will be the first one to draw cards. Each player randomly draw 1 Farmer Card from one of two decks (clockwise) ,until all players have 5 Cards.&#10;When it's your turn, choose one of the two actions:Work Action/Lazy Action.&#10;In the end of the action , draw 1 card from Farmer Deck.

After everyone's hand runs out, this game ends.&#10;If all Farmer Deck runs out, the player who runs out of their hand will end the game first and wait for all players ending the game. Finally, start calculating scores.&#10;&#10;Farmer Cards are classified into 3 types: Tools, Resource and Paradise.&#10;Resource include Water and Fertilizer.

Helper System&#239;&#188;&#154;&#10;As a kind-hearted farmer, you need to help each other. If Field's Inside become &quot;Pair&quot; due to your Farmer Action ( Work or Lazy), you can place a &quot;Helper Marker&quot; on the &quot;Helper Area&quot; at the end of Action. When the Field was Planted,each Player's Helper Marker which placed on the Field will return to the Player Boardand immediately get the reward!&#10;2. Paradise System&#239;&#188;&#154;Taro Paradise is a mysterious area hidden in Taro Field. You can discard a taro to Paradise. When Taro is abandoned by Farmer, Taro Fairy will appear to take care of it. When the Field meets the conditions of Planting,Taro will Fall into Field and be Planted.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the end of each turn, the wind blows and all the cards on the board revolve around the center.&#10;&#10;Len&ccedil;&oacute;is is a game of strategy and memory, but with a good dose of about faces and attacks!&#10;&#10;",

The Card Game is bias-free, nonpartisan fun for the whole family.   Politics! The Card Game was created by two-time Senate candidate Jensen Bohren during his initial 2018 run for Senate in Mississippi.&#10;&#10;The basics of the game are as follows.&#10;The first turn, every player puts a card from their hand face down, then reveal at the same time.  The lowest unpaired card takes the cards into their score pile, then plays a card face-up, The rest of the players play their next cards face up in clockwise order. This repeats until all hands are empty.&#10;&#10;If a round can't be scored, another round is played starting with the person who played first last round.  Once a round is won, the winning player takes all the cards into their score pile.&#10;&#10;Once hands are empty, the player with the lowest score wins.  Scoring is based on how many of each number is in the score pile.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "While Dragon Gyas can be played by 1-4 players, the game is primarily designed to be a two-player game in which one player represents the Hexgyas and its seven supporting knights while the other player controls the Grandragon and its seven Dragonewts. All of the characters are represented by either miniatures or cardboard standees, with the Hexgyas and Grandragon being much larger than the other characters.&#10;&#10;What's more, these two figures are the most important ones because if you lose your main character, then you lose the game.&#10;&#10;To set up, players choose a starting configuration for their large figure and seven smaller ones on their half of the game board. The Hexgyas and Grandragon stand in one of the five large hexagonal spaces, while their supporting characters occupy the smaller hexes that form a network around these larger hexes. Each player positions three pieces of armor around their large figure, designating two other positions around their perimeter as a weak spot and a critical weak spot. Players also customize a control deck for their large character with three attack cards and three special cards that are added to their six movement cards.&#10;&#10;The game lasts at most five rounds, and each round consists of four phases. Players first choose initiative from a hand of five initiative cards and program three control cards for their large figure. During the control phase, players carry out their actions, moving their large figure and attempting to inflict damage on the opponent. The command phase allows the supporting characters to attack one another, but also to infiltrate the opponent's giant to discover weak spots and possibly inflict damage or pull control cards from their hand.&#10;&#10;Deal ten damage to the opponent's larger figure, and you win instantly. If no one has been taken down after five rounds, then the Grandragon wins, having overcome the initiative advantage wielded by the Hexgyas.&#10;&#10;",

But, a critical ritual was disrupted by a group of survivors, and Grin himself is now part zombie. And he loves it. Being a half zombie didn&rsquo;t slow Grin down at all. In fact, the twisted experiment made him faster than any necromancer.

He hardly rests, he barely eats, and he speaks of nothing except the most expeditious paths to victory against the undead hordes. To him, killing zombies only addresses the symptom. To truly stem the tide, the necromancers themselves must be destroyed. A favorite strategy is to track these fiends to their lairs and sanctums. Though these are often filled with minions, traps, and other horrors, Scowl points out that the necromancers are also trapped in there with him, a nightmare scenario for any cabal.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a starting character card, and will, after rolling, place a die in each of 4 colors on it: red (passion), blue (logic), yellow (lust), and green (harmony).  Each player also receives a hand of cards which represent their aspirations, and these cards will grant the player special in-game abilities and end-game scoring opportunities.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over 3 rounds, each with 3 turns.  Players draft turn order, with those going later receiving certain bonuses, and then draft life events from a public pool.  In addition to the chosen card, each player will have one life event &quot;happen&quot; to them from a blind draw.  Each round will also feature an event that will affect each of the players.&#10;&#10;Much of the game centers around &quot;tipping&quot; the dice.  For instance, if a card is to be placed into a player's tableau, you must try to place it next to the card that currently has the corresponding die on it; the die is then &quot;tipped&quot; onto the card, changing its value accordingly.  In the game's theme, the higher the value of a die, the more fulfilled a player is in that aspect of their life.&#10;&#10;After 9 rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dogo Dash&#10;Dogo Dash is a quick-playing, super-colorful card game for 2 to 5 players. It&rsquo;s a game of dogs and cats, bears and humans, where one is always trying to outdo the other. Who is going to come out on top? Will the Good Boys cause trouble for the Bears? Or will Cats woo over Cookie? Only a game of Dogo Dash will tell!&#10;&#10;Components&#10;1 rule sheet&#10;60 cards&#10;&bull;    22 Cats&#10;&bull;    18 Dogs&#10;&bull;    12 Bears&#10;&bull;    4 Cookies&#10;&bull;    4 Good Boys&#10;&#10;[b][i]Setup[/i][/b]&#10;1.    Shuffle the deck of cards face down.&#10;2.    Deal four cards to each player. This forms your hand. Keep your cards secret!&#10;3.    Place the deck face down in reach of all players. This is the draw deck.&#10;4.    Now you&rsquo;re ready to play. It&rsquo;s that easy!&#10;&#10;[b][i]Gameplay[/b][/i]&#10;Dogo Dash is played over multiple rounds. At the end of each round, players determine the winner of the round and score points. Then, everyone draws more cards. Once the draw deck is empty, one final round occurs and then the game ends. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;[b][i]Round[/b][/i]&#10;Each round, players follow the same order of play.&#10;1.    All players secretly choose a card from their hand they want to play.&#10;2.    Place it face down in front of you and don&rsquo;t show it to anyone.&#10;3.    When everyone has chosen a card, someone yells out DO-GO DAAAAASH!&#10;4.    All players reveal their cards simultaneously.&#10;5.    Now it&rsquo;s time to see who won!&#10;&#10;[b][i]Round Winner[/b][/i]&#10;To determine the winner, check the played cards to see who played the strongest one:&#10;&#10;Dog is stronger than Cat&#10;Bear is stronger than Dog and Cat&#10;Cookie is stronger than Dog and Bear&#10;Cat is stronger than Cookie&#10;&#10;Whoever played the strongest card takes all of the played cards and keeps them in a score pile in front of them. Each card counts as a point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;If there is a tie between two or more players for the strongest card, the tied players play another round between themselves but do not draw any additional cards. They continue playing until someone wins or they have played all of their cards. If no one wins, then the players split the points as evenly as possible, discarding the extra card if it&rsquo;s an odd amount.&#10;&#10;Watch out! If there is a Good Boy on the table, things get tricky.&#10;Good Boys force a tie, no matter what cards are on the table. Play another round as detailed above.&#10;&#10;Once the winner has been determined, all players draw cards until they have four cards in hand.&#10;&#10;[b][i]Last Round[/b][/i]&#10;The Last Round happens when there are no more cards to draw from the draw deck. Players now play one more round only using the cards they have left in hand.&#10;&#10;1.    All players secretly choose a card and place it face down in front of you.&#10;2.    All players take all of their unplayed cards in their hands and put them face down in the middle of the table. This makes the Super Pot!&#10;3.    Someone yells out DO-GO DAAAAASH! and all players reveal their cards simultaneously.&#10;4.    The winner takes all of the cards in the Super Pot!&#10;o    If there is a tie, the tied players split the Super Pot as evenly as possible.&#10;&#10;[b][i]Scoring[/b][/i]&#10;Once the Last Round has been played, count the cards you have collected.&#10;Whoever has collected the most cards wins.&#10;If there is a tie, then all tied players win!&#10;&#10;[b][i]Keep Your Eyes Open[/b][/i]&#10;If you pay attention to what cards have been played, then you can stay ahead of everyone else. Try and remember the number of different cards there are and use it in your favor to choose the right card at the&#10;right time.&#10;&#10;For instance: if you paid attention to how many Cookies were played, you can win the Super Pot with a cat, which is the character beaten by most cards, but wins against Cookie.&#10;Combos&#10;&#10;[b][i]The Catnip Variant[/b][/i]&#10;When you get comfortable with the basics, here&rsquo;s an extra move to add to the game.&#10;If you have four cats in your hand, you can choose to play a Catnip:&#10;1.    Instead of playing one card, you put down all four cards and say &lsquo;catnip.&rsquo;&#10;2.    You then put all four of your played cards onto your own score pile. You didn&rsquo;t win the round, but you keep the points for yourself.&#10;3.    3. Everyone else continues the round as normal.&#10;&#10;[b][i]The Dogo Dash![/b][/i]&#10;If you played a Dog and didn&rsquo;t win the round, but you have another Dog in your hand, then you can make a Dogo Dash! Before the winner takes the cards, reveal your second Dog card. You now get to keep the Dog you just played and the Dog you just rescued from the winner. Put both cards in your score pile.&#10;&#10;[b]Credits[/b]&#10;Author &amp; Game Designer: Talita Rhein&#10;Illustrator &amp; Co-Designer: Margherita Barrera&#10;Co-Designer: Johanna Janiszewski&#10;Production Support &amp; QA: Philipp Keydel&#10;Rules Editing: Travis D.

It is in part a battle game, as you maneuver around the map and fight the enemy. It is in part tower defense, as you place ambushes to help take out or slow down the incoming fiends. Each hero has unique strengths and weaknesses &ndash; your victory depends both in mastering your own hero and cooperating with your friends.  As the game progresses, you face more numerous foes, and dinosaur bosses enter the field. Eventually, you face the final boss &ndash; defeating her wins the game. Beware: if the dinosaurs devastate your base camp, you&rsquo;ll be stranded on Kyuryushima, prey to the horrors therein.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
