If someone has grabbed this horse on an earlier turn, then you instead race to grab the lowest numbered tile on the table. The first player to do so steals this horse from its current owner. The game ends when the fifth numbered tile is taken, and whoever has the most tiles wins.&#10;&#10;Fast Lane features the same game play as Wild Horses, but now the horses are hidden in the engines of dual-colored race cars and the horseshoes have been replaced by checkered flags.&#10;&#10;",

While Stalin knew about Pearl Harbor in advance, Hitler did not. The Kriegsmarine started Operation Drumroll with just FIVE submarines and were navigating with US tourist guide books. But, with cities alight, US destroyers sitting in port, and merchant ships sailing with navigation lights burning, the Germans called it, &quot;The Second Happy Time.&quot;&#10;&#10;Some say the publicity campaign, &quot;Loose lips sink ships&quot; was not really about keeping information from German agents (which were almost non-existent) but to keep people from talking about the Allied disaster happening within sight of America&rsquo;s shores. It got so bad the British sent ships and planes to help America defend the East Coast!&#10;&#10;&quot;Operation Drumroll&quot; covers Germany's attack on America, from January to June 1942, using the historical U-boat capabilities and optionally, adding the German long-range bombers which could have taken part. The game board is based on the sea maps the U-Boat commanders actually used themselves, covering the East Coast, Gulf, and Caribbean.

Starting with Black, players take turns placing and swapping stones on the intersecting points of a square grid (with side lengths of either 5, 9, 13, or 19) which is initially empty. Passing is forbidden. Same-colored stones with orthogonal adjacency are connected. The game is over when a player wins by connecting their designated sides of the board with a single group of connected stones of their color, at any time during their turn or their opponent's turn. Cutting stones are four stones in the following generic crosscut configuration:&#10;&#10;OX&#10;XO&#10;&#10;On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point, if possible. If that created a crosscut, swap the placed stone with different adjacent enemy stones that share a crosscut with it, until that stone is no longer part of a crosscut. If you haven't placed a stone this turn, then instead choose a friendly stone in a crosscut and resolve as above.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You, on the other hand, are more interested in old shipwrecks &mdash; more specifically, sunken Spanish galleons filled with gold. Time to embark on an old-fashioned underwater treasure hunt. What you didn't anticipate is that several of you have discovered the legends of these buried riches. To make matters worse, a barracuda is prowling through the shipwrecks.&#10;&#10;The challenge in Barrakuda is to be the first player to have eight gold pieces in their vault, but before you can lock away gold in your vault, you need to find it on shipwrecks or steal it from others.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out shipwreck cards numbered 1-6 in some orthogonal arrangement, and give each player movement cards numbered 1-5, along with a barracuda card. On a turn, each player chooses a card from their hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If you played a movement card, move your pawn to that shipwreck card; if you're the only player there (and the barracuda isn't), take both the special action and general action listed on the card. If more than one player is on the same shipwreck card, then whoever has the fewest movement cards in front of them has the initiative and can either take the special action or take all the gold from one player's bag; after this, all players take this card's general action.&#10;&#10;If you're the only one who played a barracuda card, roll the distance die, then move it up to that many spaces in the direction of your choice. If a barracuda is on the same space as a player, they have to drop their gold on that shipwreck space; others can pick up that gold starting next turn. If none or more than one player play barracuda, roll the direction and distance card to determine where it goes.&#10;&#10;Actions on cards let you pick up gold, move gold from your bag to your vault, protect you from the barracuda, take back movement cards, move the barracuda, and so on.&#10;&#10;",

You do not have to purchase boxes of cards to play.  You buy a character pack and a story pack then find someone else who has done the same and play.&#10;&#10;In the character pack you will get a character who stands up and all the cards you need to make him unique.  Each character has stats for might, resolve, savvy and combat.  You can add 5 points to spend upgrading your character.  You upgrade with 5 types of cards called merits with varying costs.  Abilities generally boost one of your 4 attributes.  Advantages are special skills available to the character. Allies are friends that travel with you and add their skills to help you.  Arts are magic abilities that help you in various ways.  Treasures are items that you can carry to help you or you can find them in your journeys.  If you want to add more then 5 points to your character you can add flaws which are worth negative points.  If you add 2 points of flaws then you would have seven points of merits you could add.  These come in three flavors.  Curses represent special liabilities of your character.  Enemies represent individuals or races with great hatred for you which if met fight with an advantage.  Weakness usually affect your stats.  Once you have created your character you can go on an adventure.&#10;&#10;In your story pack you will find leagues which are put together to create a map. Each league has a terrain type or types, cost to enter or leave, special affects and what attribute you may recover if resting there.  In your story pack you will also find quest cards.  The quest card tells you what you are trying to achieve.  Each quest has four attributes.  These are Experience points received when the quest is achieved, Total points of waylays allowed against the quest, total points in treasures that can be seeded and the victory conditions required to complete the quest.  You will also find waylay cards in your story pack.  These will have indicators on them to tell you in what terrain you are allowed to play them in.  There is a point rating that is applied against the quests waylay rating.  Each waylay also has a test that must be passed.  Failing a waylay can have dire consequences or it may just delay you by one turn.&#10;&#10;It is a very simple game that never plays the same way twice as long as you have a few boosters around to mix things up.&#10;&#10;",

Dealer (first to draw and discard) rotates clockwise.  Only cards of the same suit (see variation) count toward your point total. Players take turns to draw the top card from either the stock or the discards, then discard a card. In replacement for drawing and discarding, any player can &ldquo;knock&rdquo;, signifying that each player then has one more turn to draw and discard.  When the turn returns to the &ldquo;knocker&rdquo;, then all players lay down their cards and announce their total.  The lowest score discards a token/coin.  In the event of a tie for lowest score, all lowest scoring tied players discard a token/coin.  At any time, if a player collects 31 points (A, and two face cards or ten), then they immediately lay down their cards and announce &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; or &ldquo;31&rdquo;, and all other players discard a token/coin.  If a player runs out of tokens/coins, then they are out of the game.  The game ends with the last player standing (and collecting all the money, in the event that players have agreed to play for coins).&#10;&#10;Ace is worth 11 points, the kings, queens, and jacks are worth 10, and all other cards are worth their face value.&#10;&#10;",

Anyone who throws a sun (let you leap over dragons and define a number between 1-5, too) can dedicate his/her turn to someone else.&#10;&#10;If all 5 dragons are out and block your way team has lost the game.&#10;&#10;",

While Warriors can move in any direction (like the Queen in Chess), Sabers may only move cardinally (as rooks) and Tridents may only move diagonally (as bishops).  Defenders, as the name implies, cannot capture but are used to block or confound one's opponent.  Pieces are captured in a Checkers-like fashion of being jumped over, with special rules for corner captures, and piece substitution.  An unusual game combining very well-known mechanics from two of the classics.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Big Deal is a game of corporate business deals. Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.&#10;&#10;Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.&#10;&#10;There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable. During this period the judgment of takeover prices becomes even more tricky (and a gamble).&#10;&#10;",

The large energy companies can hardly find new planets with the raw material, and heavy-duty surface scanners are employed to search for a worthwhile volume of the energy source in the few Ranium mines already known.&#10;&#10;Now the Mega Group Troll Factory Unlimited has found some on planet GH-328. Several rival mine crews have been sent to the mine to find the White Ranium and transport it to the space loader &mdash; but the material isn't secure until it arrives at the space loader. Until then it can be intercepted by the other mine crews.&#10;&#10;In TF22 Mine, each player takes the part of one mine crew, collects White Ranium in the mine, and transports it to the space loader. Each space loader can load up to two units of White Ranium. The mine crew must then return to the base camp in the middle of the mine to recharge their equipment. After that, they can send more units of White Ranium to the space loader. The crew then uses the molecular transporter of the space loader for transport to the base camp.&#10;&#10;The player who first transports three units of White Ranium to the space loader wins.&#10;&#10;",

In a round, each player plays each card one by one by (1) adding it as a new separate animal, (2) adding it to a pile as another animal of an existing type, or (3) flipping the card to reveal its property, then placing it under an existing animal stack to grant its power (or drawback) to the animals in that stack.&#10;&#10;In the climate phase that follows, the first player lays out colored cubes to represent how much food is available in this round (red chips), how many refugees are present (green chips), and how many parasites appeared (black chips). Players then distribute chips, placing red and green chips on their own creatures to support them and placing black chips on opponents' creatures or on predators that want to feed on their animals. During the extinction phase that follows, unfed animals die as do animals attacked by parasites or predators.&#10;&#10;Players then get a new deck of cards and the game continues with a new round. When the deck runs out and the final round ends, players scores two points for each of their living animals, one point for each property, and any bonuses from card combinations. Whoever has bred the most successful species in a constantly changing and dangerous world wins!&#10;&#10;",

Only by casting the Ring of Power into the fires of Mount Doom can it be destroyed and the Dark Lord's evil be brought to an end. To thwart Sauron's evil, brave heroes from across Middle-earth have formed The Fellowship of the Ring &ndash; champions such as Frodo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn and Legolas. Each of these stands ready to seek out The One Ring and deliver it to its destruction. Choose which member of the Fellowship you will be, and race against your friends to uncover The One Ring and carry it to Mount Doom! Middle-earth needs heroes like never before! Will you be the one to defeat the Dark Lord?&#10;&#10;In The Lord of the Rings: Quest to Mount Doom, 2-5 players race to locate The One Ring somewhere in the depths of Middle-earth and be the one to take it to Mount Doom &ndash; the one place it can be destroyed. Venture into all corners of Middle-earth in your hunt for The One Ring, avoiding the dreaded gaze of the Dark Lord Sauron and the tricks and schemes of your fellow players. Use the wide array of item and event cards to foil your opponents' plans or boost your own chances, and achieve the ultimate goal, claiming victory at the fires of Mount Doom!&#10;&#10;Players roll a movement die on their turn and use the movement points generated to move along paths of varying difficulty to reach locations across Middle-Earth. Each location begins with one item card available but only one of the forty locations contains The One Ring. Once a player finds The One Ring they must try to keep it secret while moving towards Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;Players can use the Items they gain during the search to help their own quest or to hinder the other players. If you finish a move in a location with another player you can take a card from them. Each turn players also draw an Event card which can trigger immediately or they may be able to keep it in hand for use when the time is right.&#10;&#10;Every turn an Eye of Sauron card is also revealed, moving the Eye marker. If the marker ever lands on a player's location they must discard The One Ring or another Item if they are not the Ring Bearer. The player is also forced to return to Hobbiton or Rivendell. The player who gets The Ring to Mount Doom will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Contains 9 highly detailed Fellowship plastic miniatures, instructions booklet, 1 gaming board, 1 dice, 40 item cards, 35 event cards, 42 Eye of Sauron Cards, 9 character cards and 1 Eye of Sauron Marker.&#10;&#10;",

The &quot;mortal powers&quot; of Armenia automatically pursue the magicians whose major defense is their ability to conjure fearsome demons.&#10;&#10;(paraphrased from the Historical Notes section of the instruction manual)&#10;&#10;The basic story of the key of Solomon holds that when Solomon was building the first temple in Jerusalem, one of his workers was seized by an evil spirit.  The archangel Michael appeared and delivered to Solomon a magical ring which gave him the power to command all spirits.  Solomon commanded the spirits into a brass vessel, which he sealed and cast into a lake in Babylonia.  Solomon had foreseen the possibility of the demons being released again and had prepared a testament detailing the various rituals and instruments that could be prepared by any person to command the spirits once more.  This power was to have been used for curing disease and preventing harm, but when printed examples appeared again in the 17th century the emphasis had switched to the finding of treasure and personal gain by the magician instead.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gemischtes Doppel is an unusual German Memory-type game where the cards in a pair may look very different: matching cards are connected through spoonerisms. Each card in a pair shows a word that is a similar-sounding anagram of the other card's word, each accompanied by its own illustration.&#10;&#10;Here is an example of two cards that form a pair: Gartenkunst - Kartengunst. An English version of the game might have you hunting for a Bad Salad to match the Sad Ballad you just found.&#10;&#10;The format originates in &quot;the world's shortest column&quot; (two words ... plus two pictures) from the weekly S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung Magazin. The juxtaposition of incongruous concepts, the odd but perfectly understandable expressions for familiar concepts that often result on at least one side of the anagram, and the deadpan stock photography illustrations are all played for absurd humour.&#10;&#10;This sort of memory based on playing with words is more difficult than the usual one. The funny images displaying these words add to the fun.&#10;&#10;",

On their turn, they choose two frogs from 60 tiles placed face down.  If the two tiles are consecutive, they choose a third. If this too matches, they can place the three frogs on their board or keep trying to get more matches. If they miss, all frogs are returned to the table (a bit like Can't Stop).&#10;&#10;There is a also a variant for older children and adults that allows players to find matches solely to remove frog tiles form the game and make it impossible for others to complete their board.&#10;&#10;This is a good game and one that adults will like to play with children in the same way as Zapp Zerapp or Zicke Zacke H&uuml;hnerkacke.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Cubilete is an old and very traditional game in Cuba that is second in popularity only to Cuban dominoes. Similar cubilete games are played in other Latin American countries, but the rules vary all over the map, with many cultures playing a version that is very much like the card game Poker/Poker Dice. The Cuban game however is unique!&#10;&#10;There are five Dice in the traditional Cubilete set. Each dice has six sides, and each side has one of the following characters on it: Ace, King, Queen (also known as &quot;Cundangas&quot;), Jack (Jevas, or Mujeres), 10 (Los Gallegos), 9 (Los Negros).&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to roll five dice of the same kind. A hand with less than five of a kind has absolutely no value.&#10;&#10;To win a round, you need to get the highest hand. The winner of each round (and only the winner) wins points based on the value of their hand. A game is played to a total score of 10 patas (points). Whoever gets 10 points first wins the game, even if all of the players have not had a turn.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal of the game is to score &quot;Carabinas.&quot; If you roll any Carabina during the game you immediately win the round and get to keep rolling for another round.&#10;&#10;There are three types of Carabina, listed in order of value.&#10;&#10;Carabina de Aces -- is worth ten points and is very difficult to obtain. To get Carabina de Aces, you need to get a complete set of five aces within the three-roll limit. If you get Carabina de Aces, you are awarded 10 points. The game is over. You have eliminated everyone else in the game. You are the winner of the game, even if no one else had a chance to roll! If you get Carabina de Aces, then you are always the first roller in the next game.&#10;&#10;Carabina de Ks (Kings) Naturales -- you need to have five Kings within your three allotted rolls. If you get this type of Carabina, you get five points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.&#10;&#10;Carabina de Ks (Kings) No Naturales -- the only way to obtain this is by pairing the Aces with the Kings. (The Ace can be paired with any of the other dice because it is wild.) If you obtain this type of carabina, you get two points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.&#10;&#10;If nobody gets a Carabina after everyone has had their turn, one point is awarded to the person with the highest hand:&#10;&#10;&middot; Five Queens&#10;&middot; Five Jevas (Jacks)&#10;&middot; Five Gallegos&#10;&middot; Five Negros&#10;&#10;The strategy in Cubilete is knowing what to play for and when, depending on what your opponents score. Obviously, luck is the dominant factor. Cubilete is often played as a drinking game, with several scoring variations.&#10;&#10;",

From the ashes of a devastating third World War, a precious few golden cities emerge offering hope to those who struggle for survival in the wastelands. Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the golden city you must:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points.&#10;    Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests.&#10;    Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points.&#10;&#10;&#10;In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill &mdash; mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic &mdash; and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.&#10;&#10;The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points.&#10;&#10;Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;",
