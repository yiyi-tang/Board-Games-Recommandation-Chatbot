Oil paintings have gotten so realistic that you've hired an artist to do a portrait of you each morning, so you can make sure your hair is good. Busts have gotten better too; no more stopping at the shoulders, they go all the way to the ground. Science and medicine have advanced; there's no more superstition, now they know the perfect number of leeches to apply for each ailment. You have a clock accurate to within an hour, and a calendar accurate to within a week. Your physician heals himself, and your barber cuts his own hair. This is truly a golden age.&#10;&#10;This is the 12th expansion to Dominion. It has 300 cards, with 25 new Kingdom cards. There are tokens that let you save coins and actions for later, Projects that grant abilities, and Artifacts to fight over.&#10;&#10;",

After all, a dragons lair need loot too.&#10;&#10;In this game you destroy a human city by removing tiles, one at a time around the table to score as much points as possible. You will need to collect as many different colors as possible and as many of one color as possible to score most points.&#10;The tiles eligible are limited every round so you need to choose what gives you most points, both in scoring and set collection for the end game score. Some buildings also have loot, gems or gold, powerful magic artifacts that you can use and if you silence the bell tower, you can make another swift attack.&#10;&#10;In each game the city will be built differently, so good variaton to the set up.&#10;Simple game play with good tactical depth makes it quick, easy and fun to play.&#10;&#10;The game also includes a mode for solo play where you can play to beat &quot;Drako&quot; (the cute dragon from @bgwniramas) or your own personal high score.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Eldril Sidewinder has played Blood Bowl as long as most can remember, partly due to the incredibly long life span of his race, but mainly thanks to his sheer skill on the pitch. The secret of his success (and longevity) lies in his belonging to a singular class within Wood Elf and Sea Elf society &ndash; the Wardancers. These warriors combine athleticism and deadly skill, and are capable of dashing through a melee, weaving and leaping about their opponents while transfixing them with their grace such that foes are unable to react or even to think clearly. So beguiling are the movements of a skilled Wardancer that some claim it to be some manner of boon from the dark gods, a misconception that Sidewinder is ever keen to refute.&#10;&#10;Should you be looking high and low for a Star Player for your Dark Elf, Wood Elf, High Elf or Elven Union Blood Bowl team &ndash; you can stop looking because here, in the lithe shape of Eldril Sidewinder, is one! Bemohawked and lightly armoured &ndash; clad in a leather harness and shoulder protector, gauntlets, pants and running shoes (with some pretty hefty studs in the soles, no doubt ready to splinter the shins of all who stand before him), Edril is a prime example of the sort of cheekbones and jawline you only get from Elves. His rules are available in Blood Bowl Death Zone Season One.&#10;&#10;This resin kit is supplied with a 32mm Blood Bowl base.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

And the fans love it, especially the cruel-hearted Dark Elves and other, equally mean-spirited types. Some however claim that Roxanna uses her status and role as a means of retaining her youthful features and soft, pale skin, and indeed several cosmetics brands have sought to sponsor her in order to be associated with such a starkly beautiful player. Others whisper that as a Witch Elf, Roxanna is compelled to bathe in the blood of her enemies lest she age and wither into a stooped crone &ndash; none to have voiced such a suspicion, however, have lived to repeat it.&#10;&#10;This multipart resin kit contains the component necessary to assemble Roxanna Darknail, a Star Player for use in Dark Elf and Amazon Blood Bowl teams. She&rsquo;s very much the archetypal Witch Elf &ndash; minimal armour, an enormous headdress, incredibly long hair (whose weighty plaits are not something you&rsquo;d want to be whipped by&hellip;) She can be modelled either running with a ball, or with a spiked fist on her left hand.&#10;&#10;description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The Dark Elves revel in this aspect of their society and take a perverse pride in the elegant manner by which progress is driven forwards.&#10;&#10;A great many assassins are attracted to Blood Bowl, and their skills are in high demand as the sudden removal from this mortal coil of a troublesome opposition player is always welcome with the players, whilst the fans are ever delighted to see a firm crowd favourite expire unexpectedly in a shower of arterial blood.&#10;&#10;This multi-part resin kit contains the components necessary to assemble 2 Dark Elf Assassins, for use in your Dark Elf Blood Bowl team. Both models are clad in the swishing finery assassins tend to gravitate toward &ndash; 1 is almost completely obscured by the cloak, hood and facemask atop their light armour, the other a little freer and looser, their cape billowing out behind them and their face visible beneath a metal helm.

    "Description": "Power in the Underhive is more than a gun in a ganger&rsquo;s hand. It is reputation, it is coin, and it is the worth of the ground you can call your own. For gangs that wish for more than bloodshed, that wish not just for infamy, but to rise from the ashes and ruins to something greater, dominion over the soul and iron of the hive is everything.&#10;&#10;The Necromunda Dominion campaign system is based around gangs fighting battles for control of territory. Possession of territories grants boons &ndash; income, special tactics, equipment or even recruits &ndash; to your gang. This set of cards describes 26 available territories, as outlined in Gang War 4, detailing their special rules and boons granted during games:&#10;&#10;&#10;     3 Van Saar territories&#10;     3 Escher territories&#10;     3 Cawdor territories&#10;     3 Orlock territories&#10;     3 Goliath territories&#10;     3 Delaque territories&#10;     8 territories equally usable by any gang. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "City of Thieves (Tyvenes By) is a semi-casual game for 4 players. It incorporates aspects from both sides of the spectrum - from advanced to easy and family friendly.&#10;&#10;You control a gang of thieves in a medieval city. Your thieves are represented with cards, reaching from 1 to 4 in experience. 4 being the best.&#10;&#10;The city consists of 4 shops and the kings castle. The butcher, blacksmith, the market and the bank are all available targets to rob each round and hold a fixed amount of gold coins.&#10;&#10;The goal is to steal these coins, which all four gangs compete about - or sometimes have to split. The core elements are bluff, strategy and luck, as you put down your theif-cards face down, and mix their experience with dice rolls. The dice are put on top of the cards, showing only the half truth of what you are up against.&#10;&#10;In the beginning of each round a &quot;day card&quot; is drawn and read aloud. This will have an effect on the city or a specific shop. The same thing happens at the end of a round with a &quot;night card&quot;. These two random effects often lead to fun combinations.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, the underground auction house opens, allowing you to spend your coin on new thieves for your gang.&#10;&#10;Ultimately your goal is to grow your gang big enough to steal the kings crown jewels from the castle - in a similar way to how you steal from the city shops.&#10;&#10;",

If the Round Card is on the top of the deck, you put it back on the bottom and then ask the second question, and so on until 6 rounds have been played. On the question cards there are also commands, recognizable because the icon box is blank. These commands are on the lines of &quot;Change a Souvenir to a different colour, Lose a souvenir, and so on.&#10;&#10;The Question reader is the player to the left of the player whose turn it is. If the question is answered correctly, the player receives a souvenir in the same category of the question. If the player answers incorrectly then that player must lose a souvenir (if he has one) in that category. The question card is then placed on the bottom of the stack and the turn passes to the next player in a clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;Maximum number Souvenirs&#10;The number of souvenirs that a player may have in a category is a a maximum of '2 players - 3', '3 or 4 players - 2'..

At the end of your turn you can exchange any 2 matching souvenir cards for one in any other category.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to get souvenirs in all 5 categories&#10;&#10;",

Many great mountaineers have been defeated by the peak. Are you ready for this challenge?&#10;K2: Lhotse&nbsp;is an expansion of&nbsp;K2&nbsp;in which the players' task is to lead the team of two climbers as close as possible to the summit. The expansion includes an alternative, two-sided board and new weather tiles.&nbsp;K2: Lhotse&nbsp;also introduces a completely new mechanics - fixed rope tokens which allow you to set your own routes.&#10;Each side of the board offers a different scenario and a different challenge.&#10;The first scenario is a demanding and strategic fight against time and weather. The board showing the southern wall is divided not only by height, but also into three vertical sectors, dividing it into the eastern, central and western parts. The new set of weather tiles will show a different aura depending on the sector. The player's toolkit has been enriched with fixed rope tokens thanks to which players will be able to set up new routes between the already known ones. These ropes will allow for more efficient escape from bad weather or deadly landslides.&#10;The second scenario is a fast race to the top of Lhotse from the safer side, the southern pass, which is also the easiest way to Mount Everest. Players will have fewer cards to use, as they will have to discard 3 of them at the very beginning. However the better cards they discard, the more extra victory points they receive at the end of the game! Additionally in this scenario the time becomes even more important: the climb will last only 15 days, so players will have to hurry up their way to the top.&#10;You need a copy of&nbsp;K2&nbsp;in order to play&nbsp;K2: Lhotse.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bloody Sails is a management/strategy board game, inspired by the 4X genre. It's set in a fictional X/XI century Scandinavia, in which Norse kingdoms compete for power, while threatening the nearby foreign kingdoms with raids and pillages.&#10;&#10;The player takes the role of one of the Norse monarchs in the game, each with unique objectives, heroes, blessings and development trees, and leads his/her kingdom in a timespan of 20 to 40 years. Each year constitutes a game round, divided in 4 seasons, in which players may take action. Players will have to gather resources, improve their cities and tribe, explore the seas, build armies and fight against other Viking and Christian empires, to ultimately reach their fate and triumph over their opponents.&#10;&#10;Battles are based on hero, unit and combat cards. Units and modifiers enhance the strength of combat cards, that are then played from the hand in succession until a contender wins. Heroes serve as generals, giving the owner unique skills and better combat cards. Fighting is a key point in the game, since it leads to conquest, plunder and glory.&#10;&#10;Starting from a small coastal village, players will create great overseas domains and lead their people to greatness, developing their nation with the riches their raids and trades will provide.  They will command great armies and famed heroes, proving their worth on the battlefield and earning the favor of the gods. They will have to outshine every opponent and take their place in the sagas.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This game follows the theory proposed by Japanese historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, who wrote that it was the Soviet declaration of war, and not the atomic bomb, what finally led the Japanese to surrender. August Storm plays with the what-if possibility that the Japanese government delayed for a few weeks the decision to surrender because the military believed that they could successfully defend the Kuril and Hokkaido with the resources at hand, and because the Soviets lacked the experience and equipment needed for launching such a complex operation as an amphibious landing. In fact, the dismal performance of the Soviet amphibious attack against Shumshu Island seemed to confirm the idea that they could resist a Soviet amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Command Magazine Japan #142 in August 2018.&#10;&#10;",

She is of middle eastern origins and like the story teller of the same name in the Arabian book 'One Thousand and One Nights', she has a story for every person she has killed. &#10;Sheherazade is very quick and lethal. She specializes in taking actions out of turn. At close quarters she attacks with her sword and can keep combo attacking even when it is not her turn. She can also support other agents during their turns by throwing her deadly knives to debuff enemies. But her greatest powers are that she can teleport close to her victim or become invisible with a smokescreen to finish her work.&#10;&#10;Oni, a.k.a. Masamune Senichi, is the son of a Japanese businessman who shamed his family by entering the world of organized crime. Apalled that is boss was taking orders from the LEGION's Ministry of Greed, Senichi donned a demon's mask (Oni-Mask) and began a silent hunt to eradicate Greed's organization. The Oni-Mask stem from Japanese folklore and are worn to protection against evil spirits and yokai (ogres).&#10;Oni carries a silenced pistol and through stealth is a lethal killing machine. His attacks panick surrounding enemies and his fear aura lowers their attack and defense abilities. The more he attacks, the more his fear aura grows. This makes him a great support member, since his aura makes it easier for his team members to attack and survive damage.&#10;&#10;Kingpin, aka Pierce Washington, is the current leader of the Vice Kings. Pierce had successfully unified all of the gangs of Stilwater under one Vice King flag, which gave him and his lieutenants a united front to defend themselves against LEGION'S Ministry of Gluttony. He then was recruited into MAYHEM as an integral member of the Fire Squad.&#10;Kingpin carries an SMG that spews out damage, a flare gun that has an explosive area of effect, or a plasma thrower that he can charge-up and debuff enemies with. For defense, he not only relies on his speed, but also on the chest armor that he always wears. But Kingpin is not all about violence. He is a chess aficionado, loves people, and is friendly with just about everybody - kind of like a... social butterfly. (Just don't call him this to his face!) Well known for his party dance mixes, he can lay down a mean beat  during battle that will stun enemies that are in range!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But her parents had to go into hiding after LEGION targeted her father's work, which drove Cosima to join MAYHEM.&#10;Joule can deplay a Turret which attacks LEGION to draw their fire away from her. Her main Beam Weapon can either damage LEGION troopers or heal her Turret.&#10;&#10;Red Card, aka Ingo Rotkapp, made it his job to be the #1 Ultra-Fan for German soccer club FC R&uuml;desheim. By the time LEGION had started targeting sporting events, Ingo had earned his notoriety as a brutal hooligan. After inciting a riot against LEGION during a championship game, MAYHEM decided that even a loose cannon like him could be the perfect weapon at the right time.&#10;Red Card is a tank on legs, that just charges into battle. He has a harness that releases an explosion damaging nearby enemies. The longer he waits, the more powerful the explosion, but the more susceptible he becomes to enemy attacks!&#10;&#10;Rama, aka Pranati Malhotra, is a distinguished immunologist that fought to contain a Dark Matter Plague that spread like wildfire across her country. Now she pursues a cure for the disease and vengeance upon those who unleashed it.&#10;Rama fires an Energy BOW. The longer she charges a shot, the more damage the strike inflicts. Rama also has a special Mayhem ability that allows her to fire a shot that is tainted with a modified dark matter plague. A hit enemy is infected, suffering Damage over Time.

    "Description": "The expansion adds 3 new characters to play as for the Mayhem player.&#10;&#10;After saving the world in Saints Row IV: Gat Out of Hell, Johnny Gat is back for more action and incredible campaign story lines! He is joined by friends:&#10;&#10;Lazarus, aka, Dynamo, aka, Fatima Daoud&#10;A MAYHEM scount known as Dynamo, was sent to look for city survivors after LEGION's world wide attack on Devil's Night. She was ambushed and cornered in Nano-Gen, an advanced Nanite Particle research facility. A dark matter grenade blew up next to her critically wounding her. As she lay dying on the cold floor, LEGION's mad agent Ariadne injected her with experimental nanites. The nanites rebuilt Dynamo into a merging of woman and machine, the next step along the evolutionary ladder. Presumed dead, she was renamed Lazarus when she returned to MAYHEM.&#10;Lazarus can throw nanite clusters at her foes. These clusters stick to her targets and slowly drain the life from them over time!&#10;&#10;Safeword, aka Kinzie Kensington&#10;Kinzie was a most wanted hacker that infiltrated and corrupted the Stock Exchange, CIA bank accounts, and FBI passwords by the age of 14. She was caught, but instead of being imprisoned she agreed to work for the FBI. Kinzie came to the attention of MAYHEM who immediately recruited her.&#10;Kinzie fires off a narrow energy wall that travels quickly in a straight line and passes through walls and cover. Enemies hit by the wall take damage and are stunned, immobilized, or blinded for a turn. She is a perfect weapon on any team of Agents!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game consists of a web printed on a turntable, 20 wood &quot;insects&quot; in four colors, a black wood spider, 30 spider cards, a wood die, and a wood dice cup.&#10;&#10;There are two games described in the rules.&#10;&#10;The basic game has players trying to move their pieces (insects) from starting positions around the web to the other side, always moving along a line of the web.  An insect will move either one, two, three, or four spaces (nodes) according to a die roll.  The first player to get all five insects across the board into opposite spaces is the winner.  Sometimes a spider comes up on the die; when this happens, the player draws a card and rotates the web according to the card's instructions.  Therefore the players face a changing board as they try to get across the web.&#10;&#10;The advanced game is more interesting:  one player takes the role of spider in a contest between a single spider and up to four other players.  The players still try to get their insects across the board, and the board will still rotate now and then.  A player wins when just three insects make it to the opposite side.  The spider can jump around the outside of the board, or can also generate a web rotation, always looking to get close enough to the insects to devour one.  The spider has to capture three insects of the same color to win.&#10;&#10;The die is six-sided with opposite faces:  1-spider, 2-spider, 3-4.  There are 10 cards which indicate a spin of 1 space, 10 with a spin of 2 spaces, and 10 with a spin of 3 spaces.  Half the cards indicate a clockwise direction, and half indicate a counter-clockwise direction (distributed evenly amongst the spin amounts).&#10;&#10;",

Rules for Delusion Shichinarabe, Delusion Daifugo, and Delusion Chinese Poker are introduced in this package, but more games can be played with it.&#10;&#10;When you play a card, you just name a card out loud. While playing, each player holds a suit-and-rank matrix, and mark what that player has played. Judging from your matrix and your memory, when you think another player has just made an illegal play (playing the same card twice, 5th card of the same rank, and so on), you may challenge that player.
