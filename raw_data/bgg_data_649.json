    "Description": "User Summary: &#10;Fan-generated card game inspired by the True Blood books/HBO series.  Players work to control a number of different characters (human, vampire, werewolf, etc.) and use those characters' special abilities to control others and gain Blood Tokens.  Whomever collects the most Blood Tokens by the end of the game, wins!&#10;&#10;(Note: The game cards contain Season 3 spoilers, so play at your own risk.  Furthermore, there are some limited references to sex and drug dealers, so this is not a game for younger kids)&#10;&#10;TURN SEQUENCE&#10;Each turn has 9 Phases: &#10;1. Influence Phase&#10;2. Initiative Phase&#10;3. Plotting Phase&#10;4. Recruitment Phase&#10;5. Event Phase&#10;6. Action Phase&#10;7. Capture Phase&#10;8. Recovery Phase&#10;9. End Phase&#10;&#10;The game uses two custom card decks.  The Character Deck consists of the various characters, groups and locations from the show.  5 characters are placed face up, and players pay Blook Tokens to recruit them, with bonuses/penalties to to cost of recruitment depending on where the Character is on the Recruitment Track.  Once a Character is recruited, the remaining Characters on the Recruitment Track slide down, and a new Character Card is added to the beginning of the Track.&#10;&#10;The Event Deck is drawn from by each turn by each player in the Plotting Phase to give them special actions that they can use later in the Event Phase.  In addition, each controlled Character has one or more special Actions that players may use in the Action Phase to attack, capture, or control Characters from other players.&#10;&#10;Bidding is used to control the order of players turns.&#10;&#10;",

Well's The Land Ironclads, our Steam and Steel depicts armoured units and infantry in the field fighting the massive land battleships with the assistance of mechanized carriers and an array of support weapons.&#10;&#10;Using a IGOUGO move structure but with a reaction phase built-in that allows a half move or attack. Scenarios are based on specific objectives and opposing forces are 'bought' using a points system. The action take place either in wide open spaces - great for armoured clashes, or in more closed terrain that relies on ambush and utilization of cover. The infantry have a variety of support weapons available that enhance their firepower and the ability to use 'dummy' units to create a 'fog of war', The armoured vehicles are powerful but are not essential to victory - us usual the PBI are the game winners. The emphasis is on fun and playability rather than absolute accuracy and detailed mechanics. A true players game.&#10;&#10;admin comment&#10;this game has been cancelled and will not be published&#10;&#10;",

Knights and &quot;Knights the first&quot; must be always completely surrounded by its own soldiers. Knights and &quot;K.t.f&quot; move from square to square, soldiers move from intersection to intersection. Players use a 4-side dice to move Knights and &quot;K.t.f&quot;and a 6-side dice to move soldiers. Players can move more Knights to run out the score of a dice and so for soldiers.&#10;&#10;Important:&#10;&#10;     players must fully deplete the score of the 4-sided dice but do not necessarily of the 6-sided dice &#10;     players at the end of their turn must have all his/her own knights completely surrounded by their own soldiers.&#10;&#10;&#10;Attack and capture of a knights (or &quot; k.t.f&quot;):&#10;&#10;     player must bring his/her knight(or &quot; k.t.f&quot;) on a triangular square with a common vertex with a triangular square occupied by an enemy knight(or &quot; k.t.f&quot;), then player turns the soldier placed on the common vertex, Soldier thus changes its color and owner.&#10;     the attacked knight now has only two soldiers of its color in the two vertex of its triangular square and the third soldier of the opposite color, so it must run away.&#10;     a player must use the 4-side dice to escape his/her knight(or &quot; k.t.f&quot;) and must use all of the score of the dice to move that knight.&#10;     a knight on the run must finish the move in a triangular square where are three soldiers of its color on the vertices or two soldiers of its color on vertices and a soldier of the opposite color on the third vertex, otherwise the knight is captured.   &#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Knight the first&quot; can attack two knights at the same time.&#10;&#10;Objective of the game is to conquer opponent's home-base.

The Irish Republican Army is controlled by the IRA Player and the British Army and Irish Free State Army by the Government Player. In both games the IRA Player seizes strategic buildings across Dublin and must hold them as long as possible despite being outnumbered 10-1. The Government Player must use his superior forces to retake the city block by block, helped by artillery, bombers, gunboats, tanks and armoured cars. But the IRA is barricaded in thick-walled buildings where a few men can hold up an entire battalion and the centre of Dublin was reduced to rubble before they surrendered. Each side earns victory points during the game and while the IRA Player is unlikely to win the battle he may earn enough VPs to win the game.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;Map (33 x 22 inches)&#10;&#10;Countersheet with 280 &frac12; inch counters&#10;&#10;Rules Booklet&#10;&#10;",

From the bowling deck a number of individual bowler piles are created (i.e., 5 piles if 5 bowlers are indicated by the defensive player). The batting cards are then shuffled and split into 2 piles (1 for each batsman), then the 1st batsman flips a card from his pile.  If a 2, 4, or 6 is played, the score is recorded and the 1st batsman continues play.  If a 1 or 3 is played, the score is recorded and the play moves to the 2nd batsman.  If a &quot;How&rsquo;s That&quot; card is played, the defensive player flip the top card from the &quot;active bowler&quot; pile (i.e., the pile designated as the bowler for the current over) and scores the result (i.e., run out, stumped, Not out, Leg-bye, etc.).  Batting cards are reshuffled every three overs; bowling cards are reshuffled every five overs.&#10;&#10;The game flow and rules closely follows the real game of cricket -  an over consists of 6 bowled balls (cards) plus extras, batsman change sides after each over, 10 wickets taken constitute an inning, etc.  As with the real cricket, the goal of the game is to outscore your opponent over two innings.&#10;&#10;(description based on text included in the rule book)&#10;&#10;",

Players have three rolls to catch a fish by rolling a head, a tail (worth 10 points together), and various sized bodies that add to the score of the fish.  The goal is to catch and score the largest fish possible.  Players have to choose which dice to keep and which dice to re-roll on their second and third rolls. One side of the dice contains a small panfish, which is worth only one point, and cannot be re-rolled.  However, if a player manages to roll all 5 panfish, the player proclaims a FISHFRY! and the other players have to &quot;FRY-UP&quot; their fish. Players often have the choice to push their luck, and try for larger fish.  &#10;   The game plays well as a quick pass-time or as a gambling game with a little more strategy than other simple gambling dice games.  Included are rules for one-round games, as well as multiple round fishing tournaments.&#10;&#10;",

He is the frozen death that splits bone; he is the frostbite that corrupts flesh. Rukar is followed by the insane Gruggar who revels in reckless bloodshed, and the wily Bragg who uses magic trickery to destroy his foes. With them come hordes of fleet-footed Chargers, and the cunning magician-warriors known as Thwarters. Onward these proud reavers march across frozen wastelands, hastening to Grognack and the promise of bloody war.&#10;&#10;But the marchers have not gone undetected! From the depths of his volcanic fortress, Prince Elien of the Phoenix Elves reveals weapons previously kept hidden. From the heights of the greatest volcano comes Rahlee, swooping down on the enemy with her giant eagle. The fire mage Laleya blasts attackers from afar, and the much-feared Holleas summons frightening Fire Beasts from what some claim are the depths of the Hells themselves. These terrible beasts have no qualms about destroying themselves in blasts of superheated plasma if it destroys their opponents. And joining them is a legion of Fencers, elegant warriors who dance into battle using martial skills from a past age.&#10;&#10;But even these forces aren&acute;t alone! Rukar&acute;s Power sees the addition of Magos, the mercenary champion. This enigmatic wizard gives his employer more power while bombarding the enemy with long-ranged attacks. In addition are the Spear Grounders - mercenaries from the bizarre city of Heap who can attack from any direction.&#10;&#10;This reinforcement pack is the perfect addition to your Phoenix Elves vs. Tundra Orcs starter set, allowing you to bring new troops to the War for Itharia, and experience the excitement of deck construction.&#10;&#10;",

He is always eager to rush into battle, and he has brought with him the priest Tordok who uses defensive runes to protect his fellow Dwarves. Joining them is the vicious fighter Halvor, who would gladly sacrifice himself to land a killing blow on an enemy soldier. These mighty champions are followed by the stoutest of Dwarf warriors known as Guardsmen, whose armor lets them shrug off blows that would fell ordinary folk. And the Dwarves have not stopped there - joining the fray are ancient siege weapons. Dwarven Ballistas are stronger than those employed by other folk - they fire bolts that can punch straight through solid stone!&#10;&#10;But the Cave Goblin Sneeks has not been idle. He too has drafted new troops to his cause including the opportunistic champions Reeker and Krag, and the frighteningly strange shaman known as Scagg. Strange cries fill the air as Beast Riders swarm from their mountain dens. These Goblins ride strange creatures into battle, quickly overrunning the enemy. Goblin Climbers appear at the highest mountain ridges, firing their bows as they advance. These warriors care little for fortifications, scaling the strongest of walls with ease.&#10;&#10;And as the Dwarves and Goblins prepare to escalate their ancient war, even stranger warriors appear on the field of battle! The mercenary champion Malevolence offers her magic blade to the highest bidder, and the plague-ridden Vermin will fight for any army that will brave their diseased presence.&#10;&#10;This reinforcement pack is the perfect addition to your Guild Dwarves vs. Cave Goblins starter set, allowing you to bring new troops to the War for Itharia, and experience the excitement of deck construction.&#10;&#10;&#10;Grungor&acute;s Charge Includes: - 32 Cards&#10;&#10;Guild Dwarves&#10;&bull;1 Grungor - Champion&#10;&bull;1 Halvor - Champion&#10;&bull;1 Tordok - Champion&#10;&bull;5 Guardsmen - Common&#10;&bull;5 Ballistas - Common&#10;&#10;Cave Goblins&#10;&bull;1 Reeker - Champion&#10;&bull;1 Krag - Champion&#10;&bull;1 Scagg - Champion&#10;&bull;5 Beast Riders - Common&#10;&bull;5 Climbers - Common&#10;&#10;Mercenaries&#10;&bull;1 Malevolence - Champion&#10;&bull;5 Vermin - Common&#10;&#10;",

The farmer may move vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.  The dogs and sheep move only vertical or horizontal.  The farmer moves the total of the throw of three dice and can divide his movement between himself and the two dogs.  The sheep use one die, and cannot move next to the farmer or dogs or through natural obstacles.   When the farmer or dogs move next to a sheep it forces the sheep to move away.  The farmer also has additional fences that he place to block movement.&#10;&#10;Although components are not included, complete rules were published in Games and Puzzles Magazine no. 5.

Being skilled natural engineers, and determined to reclaim their lands, the Maoris constructed forts called 'pahs' (or pas) on disputed territory and dared white men (pakehas) to attack. The British and Colonial troops seemed only too happy to oblige and, when enough losses had been inflicted to satisfy utu ('revenge' or 'payment'), the Maoris simply evacuated their trenches and rifle-pits. The conflict was also marked (later) by some guerrilla fighting, but its main feature was the defence and reduction of these ingenious native forts.&quot;&#10;&#10;Essentially, the game is organized as a skirmish around the taking/defending of a &quot;native&quot; fort of the defending player's design. System uses d6 and d12 for various checks.&#10;&#10;Each figure represents one man. Rules were written to support 25mm figures, but can be adapted to different scales.&#10;&#10;This simple system does include rules for Morale.&#10;&#10;Rules set appear in Wargames Illustrated #63 (December 1992)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Grasshopper is a Backgammon variant invented by Matt Crispin and its most significant feature, compared to the classic Backgammon, is that there are no dice and no luck factor at all. The game strategy fully depends on player's skills.&quot;&#10;&#10;My brief description of how the game is played and the goal:&#10;&#10;During the game, players attempt to race their 14 pieces around the Backgammon board, counter-clockwise, blocking their opponent's pieces along the way by occupying a point (a single piece on a point cannot be captured in this variant, in fact, there is no capturing at all) or by building a &quot;wall&quot; (two stacked pieces on a point make a wall) that no piece, friendly or otherwise, can pass over.  Movement, in this game, is only from quadrant to quadrant, each quadrant consisting of 6 points (1 thru 6, 7 thru 12, 13 thru 18, 19 thru 24).  The second piece on the wall has special ability of jumping over any wall that might be in the way to land in the next quadrant (hense the name &quot;Grasshopper&quot;).  Walls can only be built by moving a piece from the previous quadrant that is exactly 6 points away to a point that has one piece on it.  Once the players get their pieces to the 4th quadrant, they must build walls on the quadrant.  These walls (two piece stacks) can be borne off the board as a unit for the players turn.  The winner is the first player to bear off two walls consecutively, but not necessarily in two consecutive turns.&#10;&#10;",

Your aim is to reach the end, at the Acropolis, and be crowned the winner!&quot; (Source: Back of the box)&#10;&#10;&quot;This game consists of a series of 63 squares.  Each player chooses an owl-shaped pawn.  The owl was the symbol of Athena, patron goddess of the city of Athens.  All players in turn roll the dice.  The player with the highest score goes first.  The rest follow in turn.  When a player falls on a square depicting an owl, he has the opportunity of moving his pawn a second time, for the same number of squares.  If a player throws 9 (with a 6 and a 3) he moves to square 26 whereas if he brings 9 (with a 4 and a 5) he moves to square 53.  The player to reach square 63 first, is the winner.  But beware!

    "Description": "&quot;Advance the Flag is a set of rules designed for medium to large scale wargames set in the American Civil War. It is intended to be suitable for refighting actual battles as well as for hypothetical scenarios, one-of, equal-strength competition style games, and free form campaigns in which the tabletop encounters arise from strategic decisions made by the players. It is worth pointing out here that although some purists regard the last three options as somehow inferior to the historical refight, they generally present players with more challenging situations and allow them more opportunity to exercise their tactical skills, without the benefit of hindsight. Such games can be just as faithful to the &quot;spirit&quot; of the period as a slavish reconstruction, and are often more fun. These rules are intended to give the players an enjoyable and fast moving experience, while at the same time reflecting - as far as is possible with what is essentially a form of entertainment - the conditions of the real conflict. A game involving several hundred figures a side can easily be complete in an evening. After a few attempts you will probably be able to remember most of the rules which you will need, and so will be able to keep things moving without constantly referring to the book. This leaves you free to enjoy the game and admire your carefully painted figures - which is what it is about, after all.&quot; &#10;From the Authors Introduction&#10;&#10;",

Set to this background the players represent members of the royal family and try to locate good sites for new oil wells, find and deliver the different oil qualities and ship them to their base camps.&#10;&#10;However, the oil field is so huge that the players have to memorize where which oil quality is to be found. Moreover, the competing players are likely to interefere with the player's intentions.&#10;&#10;To win the game, it is mandatory to collect oil qualities of different kinds, always keeping an eye on the ever changing prices. Balancing this will help !&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Boardgame News annoucement.&#10;&#10;As for the game play, Ghawar is a pick-up-and-deliver game with a roll-and-move mechanism on top of a memory element. On a 13x13 game board, 36 oil platforms are laid out in a 6x6 square with one empty space between each pair of platforms. Players seed these platforms with 36 coloured &quot;oil stones&quot; with nine cubes in each of four colors.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling two dice and placing one of their five oil wells on the unoccupied platform at this location in the grid; if a player rolls 2-5, for example, she can choose row 2, column 5 or the other way around. Once all the oil rigs are placed, the second half of the game begins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either rolls a die to move the truck, train or both vehicles a number of spaces equal to the die roll or moves one of the oil rigs to an adjacent location, most likely covering an oil stone previously exposed.&#10;&#10;If a player's truck starts or ends its movement by an oil rig and doesn't already have a load, the truck's owner can lift the oil rig and buy the oil stone underneath it, paying the rig's owner the current value of the oil.&#10;&#10;You can't purchase oil stones that aren't covered as there must be a well in place to bring the oil to the surface. You must bring the oil to your side of the board to deliver it before you can pick up another oil stone with the truck.&#10;&#10;When your train ends its movement by an empty platform the train picks up the platform so that you can carry it back to your camp. At the end of the game, players lose points based on their relative standings in the number of platforms collected.&#10;&#10;The game ends once all the oil stones have been delivered. If any player has failed to collect at least one of each type of stone, that player loses the game. Players still in the game score points for each oil stone they possess, for having more of their favored type of oil than anyone else, for collecting barrels, and for having lots of money due to sales. If you have the fewest stones of a type, less money than anyone else, and fewer platforms than someone else, you'll lose points. The player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;This is a Fast WW2 Grand Strategic game with a card driven system with very few Military Operational Forces (Mof's represented by wooden tokens) on a 22 inches X 18 inches strategic Map board for a 2 player game in less than 90 minutes. The World map is divided into multiple territories connected by land or sea. All Seven Major Powers with many Neutral Countries are included; all theaters of War involved from fall 1939 through 1945 including Research up to the Atomic Bomb. This game is fast and at most there will be less than 6 Mof&rsquo;s per Major Power on the board at any time.&#10;&#10;Each player takes control of the Axis or the Allies. Each Major Power when it enters the WAR gets its own specific Operational deck of cards that the player can draw from during each round or season to form his hand. The number of cards is determined by the control of key territories and conquered Neutral countries. These cards represent Military forces and Supplies. With these in hand, the player may now create Mof&rsquo;s, move Mof&rsquo;s and initiate land, sea and air combat along with Warfare and research. He may play some, all or no card at all during any turn that is part of a round until each player passes in succession. The game lasts 20 rounds or seasons. Although this game is card driven, a player is never restricted to any territory and may operate any Mof anywhere on the map board.&#10;&#10;The Axis win as soon as they control at least 2 Allied Major Powers.&#10;The Allies win as soon as they control Berlin and Tokyo.&#10;Any other result at the end of winter 1945 is an Axis win.&#10;&#10;This game tries to capture the WW2 strategies and tactics and tries to recreate the feel and excitement of a complete global conflict in less than 90 minutes. Did we succeed? You have the answer.&#10;&#10; &#10; ",

    "Description": "Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...&#10;&#10;Once again, unsuspecting vacationers begin disappearing in the waters off the small resort of Amity, and also further up the sun-drenched coast. Only a few people know the truth.&#10;&#10;Each player takes on the role of a desperate mayor, managing a small seaside town in the midst of a blood-soaked crisis, fending off an unknown number of Great White sharks.&#10;&#10;Jaws: Deep Red Sea is a fast-playing, non-authorised, non-profit, and non-collectable card game based on the films: Jaws, Jaws II, Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge. For 2-6 players, this game is a shark-filled, blood pumping experience, where all players draw from the same central deck. Each player manages their hand of cards - to defend their beaches with Fend off with High-pitched Screams, Brody's Service Revolver, Improvised Explosives, Rifle and Gas Cannister Ploy, Crushed Beer Cans, Kick feet desperately, while shrieking, The Orca, and Undersea Power Cable Trick, etc, as well as play scarily large Great White Sharks against their opponent's swimwear-clad vacationers.&#10;&#10;Each player may also recruit grizzled experts from around the world to safeguard their beaches from closure. Such shark hunters include Quint, Matt Hooper, Philip FitzRoyce, Hoagie Newcombe, and Chief Brody.&#10;&#10;The mayors can also utilise, to save themselves from monstrous fish, some of the following example cards: &quot;Sh-sh-sh-shaaaRRRRKKKKK!&quot; and Eat Screaming Woman - Brandishing a Flare gun while soaked in petrol and Moonlit feed, and the strutting Adonis, Shelby Overman, and Eat Powerboat Water-skier, and &quot;That's some bad hat, Harry,&quot; and Eat Diving School and &quot;Overman was killed inside the park. The baby was caught inside the park. Its mother is inside the park,&quot; and &quot;Love to prove that, wouldn't ya? Get your name into the National Geographic,&quot; and Consume Rescue Helicopter and Pilot, and &quot;You tell Shelby Overman for me he can take a flyin' leap in a rollin' doughnut on a gravel driveway, you hear?&quot; and &quot;Don't be silly. That would indicate a shark of some 35 feet in length,&quot; and Bite off leg, and &quot;Lens my ass!&quot; and &quot;Karateing the Picket Fences,&quot; and &quot;I don't believe it! Two barrels, and he's going down again!&quot; and &quot;Bad fish. Not like going down the pond chasin' bluegills and tommycods. This shark, swallow you whole,&quot; and The Indianapolis Yarn, and &quot;This was no boat accident!&quot; and &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat,&quot; and lastly &quot;What d'ya have there - a portable shower or a monkey cage?&quot;&#10;&#10;Money is spent in the game buying Shark Hunters and equipment. Players can also, at any time, spend cash to alter Shark Attack dice rolls, setting the situations up whereby opponents' bathers may be devoured by monstrous Great Whites. Also, some cards, like &quot;Beach Closed,&quot; cost the target mayor cash, from revenues lost, forcing them to buy less Anti-shark gear. Money is generally in short supply. Steal or swindle it from other mayors if you can.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10 vacationers and $10,000.&#10;&#10;Last mayor with his beach still full of bathers wins.&#10;&#10;NOTE: There is no player elimination. When a mayor has run out of holidaymakers, all his cards and poker chips are removed, and then he can only play Shark Attack cards on the players remaining - attacking the mayor with the most vacationers left in play (he's got the most bathers in the sea). If there is a tie, the player playing the Shark Attack card decides who to devour.&#10;&#10;",

A game of Ki cannot end in a draw.&#10;&#10;Ki is played with standard Go equipment on any odd sized square board. 11x11 is a good size to start on.&#10;&#10;The objective of Ki is to have more stones on the board when the board is full.

A player must have at least 2 stones orthogonally adjacent to a space in order to control it. A player controls a space when he owns a majority of the stones orthogonally adjacent to the space. If the space is occupied by his opponent, the enemy stone is removed from play. If a space is surrounded by an equal number of stones of both colors, it is a legal placement for either player. It is forbidden for a player to place a stone on a space controlled by his opponent, even to make a capture. If a player has no legal move on his turn he must pass. Passing is otherwise not permitted.&#10;&#10;",

There are 4 forwards in RuckBowl, and each forward represents 2 real forwards. The n&deg;10 in RuckBowl represents the real fly-half and the real scrum-half. So the 10 pawns in RuckBowl represent 15 real players. Why 10 pawns? Because it is easier to manipulate 10 pawns than 15 pawns. The game becomes quicker and more nervous with 10 pawns.&#10;RuckBowl uses a square-grid board: 15 columns by 28 lines : almost the BloodBowl pitch...&#10;&#10;The game is played taking turns: each turn is divided in two segments: Segment I for placing players and launching play, and Segment II for the current play.&#10;&#10;What happens in the Segment I :&#10;Kick-off, Re-start Kick, 22 m drop out, Scrum, Lineout, Penalty kick.&#10;&#10;There is several options in the Segment II: &#10;Option 1. The coach moves his players, passes the ball, kicks the ball, attempt crash charges or tackles, or attempt a drop-goal, &#10;Option 2 or 3. The coach declares a Ruck or a Maul. &#10;Option 4. The coach declares a Mark.&#10;&#10;Some actions need dice rolls: tackle, crash charge, kick, Ruck, Maul, Scrum, etc. A bad die roll can lead to a Scrum, a penalty, or a turn-over, etc. The opposition can react by: intercepting the ball, tackling the ball carrier, catching a kicked ball, etc... Each team can score with Try, Drop Goal, and Penalty Kick. And don&rsquo;t forget: passing the ball to a team mate in front of you is totally forbidden !&#10;&#10;RuckBowl is a game where you must make the good decision all the time : what can I make ? pass the ball, kick, kicking in touch, move the ball carrier, declare a ruck ?&#10;&#10;In order to customize your team, you can use Team cards.&#10;&#10;Each player has his own profile :&#10;Move (for...movements).&#10;Power (for melees : scrum, ruck, maul).&#10;Catch (for catching the free ball, after a kick or a bounce).&#10;Impact (for tackles).&#10;Pass (for passes).&#10;Kick (when the ball is kicked).&#10;&#10;RuckBowl is a complex game, for 14 year old (or more).&#10;&#10;",

As players gain followers, they are granted prayers and miracles that help them overcome the ever-present temptation of sin.&#10;&#10;Although Faith and Redemption represents a fallen world, redemption is always possible and forgiveness is never more than a prayer away.&#10;&#10;Faith and Redemption is a multi-part roll-and-move Christian game that differs from the traditional approach towards religious games. Most other Christian games are either trivia or simply Bible versions of existing games. Faith and Redemption strives to create a unique experience based on the teachings of the Christian Bible.&#10;&#10;Players begin first by collecting animals before the Great Flood destroys all mankind. The number of matching animal pairs they collect are then traded in for prayers, which are used to combat sin throughout the rest of the game. Players then embark on the journey of a lifetime; trying to navigate their way through the trials and tribulations of both the Old and New Testaments.&#10;&#10;Along the way, the players gain followers and grow in spiritual power, fighting valiantly against sins such as temptation, greed, and vanity. As the power and influence of the Devil grow, so too does the power of God, resulting in the triumphant coming of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. In the end, the player with the fewest amount of sin conquers Satan and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Facing a sudden cataclysmic event on a distant planet, survivors from a remote military research outpost manage to transport themselves onto an ancient alien ship.  Earth appears to be the destination, but the ship is also making regular stops automatically along the way, giving the stowaways a chance to learn about alien worlds and scavenge for supplies.  The ancient ship contains both valuable scientific knowledge and exotic weapons technology.  The Military and the Civilian Scientist survivors both believe that if they outperform the other, they will be granted access to the ship when it reaches Earth.  But first they must survive...&#10;&#10;Players will move about the ship and through the transporter gate exploring and finding much needed supplies and scientific knowledge.  Each player will have their own agendas.  The Civilian Scientists want to learn as much as they can about the worlds they are stopping at as well as the alien ship.  The Military player's duty is to keep the crew supplied and protect the civilians.  Each side will also need to deal with Threats as well as not let the other player get the upper hand with too much respect with the big wigs back on Earth.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play consists of placing and responding to ship layout tiles (modular board) as well as responding to draw from a Gate Mission deck of mission cards with worker placement as well as cards drawn from a Results deck of cards.&#10;Turn Sequence&#10;&#10;1.

    "Description": "From the Publisher&#10;&#10;[ Do you dare to dream? ]&#10;&#10;The American Dream (The Illegal Game), is a family game, a tribute to immigrants from all over the world, live their adventures, laugh with them, earn money, work two jobs, go to school, learn English and Spanish while you play, get marry travel through Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, be an immigrant for two hours, a hilarious experience that will take you a long time to forget. Buy for your friends, for your boss, for your grandparents so they'll remember the good old days. Family entertainment for ages 10 to adult.   BE AN IMMIGRANT FOR A DAY AND SEE WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM YOUR OWN.&#10;&#10;The game is presented in a way that is easy to understand and execute, meaning that by playing it you may only spend your time going through these situations whereas in real life you may lose your dignity.&#10;&#10;The Illegal Game is a bilingual board game (English and Spanish for now) that allows you to experience what we have just discussed, that&rsquo;s right, as soon as you arrive at JFK you are thrown into a series of circumstances that are part of the daily lives of illegal aliens just as we described above, you&rsquo;ll understand what it feels to be cheated, scared, insecure, happy, struggle, etc., the game itself takes a couple of hours to play but will allow you to experience first hand, albeit on a small scale, what real people go through to survive in New York.  Play it to the end until you are able to retire and enjoy the American dream.&#10;&#10;To start the game you need a minimum of two (2) players and a maximum of twelve (12), the more players in the game, the better the game runs, between seven and ten players would be ideal, although the game&rsquo;s dynamics allows other players to join in at any time, even after the game has already started, as long as they start up from the square marked as &lsquo;Start&rsquo;. Any of the players can also double up as a the Bank and all players get a &lsquo;Profession&rsquo; card and 5.000 (five thousand) game dollars to start.&#10;&#10;Put the two sets of cards on their appropriate location on the board, that is, the cards that say 'Professions' on the space marked 'Professions' and the 'Main Board' cards on the spot next to them, you pick up a &lsquo;Main Board&rsquo; card every time the board instructs you to pick up a card and follow its instructions.&#10;&#10;The game is uni-directional.   Use one die, this will tell you the number of squares that you have to move your token.  Follow the instructions of the square where you land. If you have to go back any space(s) then follow the instructions for that square also.  Except for the Professions cards, all other cards go back to the bottom of the pile.  If you get deported you must start again from the beginning (JFK).   Lose a day is the same as miss a turn.   You can be married in your country and still get married in this game. (This is just a game)&#10;&#10;Profession:   The Professions card, stays with you while you are playing, since it indicates the salary your are to collect every week.    If you get another profession card,  you can keep it if you wish hold two or three jobs at the same time. You can hold up to three jobs.&#10;&#10;Money:   Follow the instructions on the game board only when you land on them, not as you pass. (Except when it comes to 'Pay day', every time you pass Pay Day you get pay, even if you don't land exactly on it).  That is collect your salary as you pass.  This is the only exception, you are entitle to your salary as you pass, you don't need to have an exact landing, but if you land right on the Pay day square, collect twice your salary.  All bills have the value of an imaginary game dollar, whether Euro, Liras, Sucres, Pesos, Franks, etc., so 1000 liras is the same as 1000 dollars or 1000 Pesos, for the purposes of the game.&#10;&#10;End of game: All players that retire win.   To retire, only a perfect landing on the final square is allowed.   At the end of the game, if you have 6 or less spaces to go, you need that exact number to come out on the die in order to beat the game, if you get more on the die than what you need,  wait for your next turn before trying again.   Your game ends on the square that reads: Retire happy, where the retired players can walk into the Sunshine scenery area, to wait for the rest of the players (Imagine that!) Retire back to your country, move to Florida or Hawaii, whatever your dream might be.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User Summary: What originally was intended to be just a bad joke and a infamous critique against the chaotic situation of violence caused by the continued struggle for power between the government and the several organized crime groups in the city of Rio de Janeiro can become the first wargame situated in an authentic Brazilian context... if it would ever come to be published!&#10;&#10;War in Rio is a politically incorrect wargame based in the traditional Risk. The main rules and mechanics from the classic wargame remain all the same, but the original board is replaced by one depicting the city of Rio de Janeiro. This new board is divided in 42 &quot;favelas&quot; - how the slums and shanty towns are called in Brazil -, which are arranged in six different sections, following the geopolitical areas of the city of Rio de Janeiro.&#10;&#10;In addition, the colored armies now represent the different groups struggling to control the &quot;wonderful city&quot;. Two colors represent the government forces: black is the &quot;BOPE&quot; (Special Police Operations Battalion) and blue is the &quot;Pol&iacute;cia Militar&quot; (Military Police). Three colors represent the major criminal organizations in Rio: red for &quot;Comando Vermelho&quot;, green for &quot;Terceiro Comando&quot; and yellow for &quot;Amigos dos Amigos&quot;. The white pieces represent the several other militias &quot;Mil&iacute;cias&quot; that also play a role in the urban war.&#10;&#10;Fabio Lopez, the Brazilian designer who created the game, has already informed that he didn't intend to publish the game or even share it for free. His purpose with War in Rio was solely &quot;to generate a discussion through a shameless invitation to enjoyment.&quot; However, such an original idea could not be ignored by Brazilian players and several anonymous fans soon joined forces to recreate the map and the cards based in the original photos posted by Lopez in his blog.&#10;&#10;Given the subversive status of this idea, this game probably will never be officially published.&#10;&#10;",

In this reality, corporations maintain vast data fortresses that act as their servers and storefronts in cyberspace. Users of cyberspace plug their minds into this world wide reality to work, be entertained, or socialize. While the daily use of cyberspace holds the world's attention, beneath the surface rests the world of hackers and those who stand against them.&#10;&#10;In Data Fortress, two players pit themselves against each other in an attempt to either crash a company's data fortress or to defend it. One player takes control of the Hacker, entering the area through the use of hidden Jack Points while the other player sets up the defensive protocols of his company's data fortress. The Hacker initializes and maneuvers his programs through cyberspace attempting to crash the defensive programs on his way to destroying all protection the Central unit has over its data. Meanwhile, the Admin brings his own programs to the fray as he holds off the Hacker until the rest of the Sys-Admins can log into the network. A truly skilled Admin can even trace the Hacker back to his actual Jack Point and crash the connection.&#10;&#10;The game uses 54 tiles that represent programs, computer network and Jack Points. During a player's turn, he will be able to move a tile and play a tile in either order. Results of program-on-program interaction is based on the strength of all tiles that form a solid line to the interaction. The Hacker and Admin utilize different programs that have their own movement and abilities in this asymmetrical tile maneuvering game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The game is an association game. You have 100 different cards with pictures on them. You draw one card and have a short time to think of different things that you can relate to that picture. After this you draw three new cards and then you should make links between the first picture and one of your choices. An link between to pictures can be something like this: Drill-something the dentist have-chair at the dentist something you lie in-lie you do in bed-pillow you have in bed-head on pillow-hat on head--the other picture.&#10;As the trail of relations can be a bit vague, the other players have the choice to say that they don't agree with the thought-trail and if majority of players agree you lose this round, and the turn goes to the next player.&#10;The first player with 5 wins, win the game.&#10;&#10;A good party game with a lot of laughter&rsquo;s. Goes quite well with children as they catch the rules quickly.&#10;&#10;[The name in Swedish means I don't understand anything]&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Boxxy is a bit like Boggle, but for starters it's much more compact. The letter dice and sand timer are all enclosed in a plastic box. Shake the box, set it down, and then find as many words as you can. The time limit is strict, you have only sixty seconds. Furthermore, only words that contain at least 3 letters as shown on the letter dice count!&#10;&#10;",
