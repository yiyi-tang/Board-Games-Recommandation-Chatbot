    "Description": "This is an interesting cooperative play game with play as a solo game or a coop game of two people.&#10;&#10;There are 2 corkscrew sticks which you connect together and a propeller spinner that falls down this corkscrew.  You can adjust the fan blades to adjust the speed of the propeller as it &quot;falls&quot; down the corkscrew sticks. (Basically you are adjusting how much resistance the air is making against the blades.)&#10;&#10;The game is played by not letting the propeller fall off the end of a stick; as the propeller goes from one stick to another, the top stick is moved to become the new bottom stick.  When playing with two people, one person is responsible for moving the stick, while the other is responsible for the stability of the stick the propeller fan is currently on. If you are playing solo, you have to try and do both of these functions, which would be very difficult.&#10;&#10;",

If a single dog appears in a roll, the player loses all points accumulated in that turn so far and the turn ends. If both dice show dirty dogs, then the player's turn is over but the player gets to mark off any one total (usually the highest remaining one). The first player to mark off all their numbers is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It will stretch your mind as you look for circles among the triangles.&#10;&#10;Circle Out! game is one of the great modern classics. It calls upon parts of your brain that rarely get much exposure. For this reason, little children can often gain an advantage over adults who are just beginning to learn the game. Playing the game is an excellent visual memory exercise. Circle Out is filled with strategy &ndash; and winning is never a simple matter of chance.&#10;&#10;Instructions:&#10;&#10;To play the game shuffle the deck and lay out 12 - 16 cards on the table. All players must race to find the most circles of the largest size.&#10;&#10;Players should not touch the cards until a circle has been found. When you find one, say &quot;Circle!&quot; and then you may take the cards that form your circle.&#10;&#10;One predetermined player will lay out additional cards to replace the ones that have been taken. Continue to play until all of the cards are gone. Two decks may be combined to lengthen the game.&#10;&#10;What? Circles? All I can see are triangles! Think of each card as a link that belongs to a chain. A circle happens when the ends of your chain come (link) together.&#10;&#10;Just remember that same colors link together and that triangles on the top may only link to triangles on the bottom and vice versa. For example, a blue triangle at the bottom right corner of a card will link to any blue triangle at the top left corner of another card.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;&#10;Circles of three are worth 1 point, circles of four are worth 2 points, circles of five are worth 3 points, circles of six are worth 4 points and circles of seven cards are worth 5 points.&#10;&#10;Or just subtract 2 from the total number of cards in your circle and that is how many points it is worth. For example, a five-card circle is worth 3 points (5 - 2 = 3).&#10;&#10;There can be up to seven cards per circle only because there are only seven colors. Each color may only be represented once in each circle by one top triangle and one bottom triangle.&#10;&#10;",

A fisherman can move forward or back according to a die roll, but never to a building that is more than one rank better than the one that his wife is currently in. Moving the wife forward can only be achieved by a kind of lottery, in which you draw wooden sticks from a bag. The more green ones, the better the result. If you fail to reach the number of green sticks determined by the square you are on, both the fisherman and his wife move back to their lowly hut and start again. &#10;There is a &quot;magic fish&quot; which determines the end of the game. It consists of three jigsaw puzzle pieces, and any player who rolls a fish symbol can either add one piece of the fish or move 1-4 squares (to extend the game).&#10;&#10;",

But, this time the Soviet is the attacker in the early 1942 Russian counter-offensive in front of Moscow that almost destroyed Army Group Center. Can you as the Soviet player complete the destruction or can you as the German player survive the Soviet onslaught.&#10;&#10;Red Typhoon is a two player game following an IGO-UGO turn sequence with activation points controlling the movement and attack of each of your formations. This means that some units will not move or attack, some will just move or just attack and some will both move and attack. The players choices of how to use his activations is the most important decision in the game. Combat is fairly traditional with the additions that units are retreated by the attacking player and that retreated units are disrupted. Players able to take advantage of these two factors will be successful.&#10;&#10;The game starts with several large Soviet breakthroughs that the German player must skillfully plug and in certain situations counterattack. There are special rules for German panzers, Soviet Airborne and Partisans.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: Not Listed&#10;Hex: 9.3 miles / 15 kilometers&#10;Units: Division to Army&#10;&#10;&#10;Updated and translated in English as Red Typhoon: The Soviet Winter Counter-Offensive, 1942.&#10;&#10;",

To do this, the players move the playing pieces the number of spaces as rolled on the die. Players can move on any route, but in a single turn can only move in one direction.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is that the player would get the most amount of points. For the points to be valid, the player needs to get to the space where there is pictured a little paw, next to the space where there is food. He takes the piece from the game board and starts on the way back. If the player safely succeeds to return to the hole, he keeps the piece and can leave for the next one. Depending on where the food piece was on the board, it can have various amounts of points (the amount of points is given on each piece next to the picture with the food). Three pieces (with the navy blue background) have the greatest punctual value (6 points), but when carrying it, the player moves one space less then what was rolled on the die. The collected points are added together. The game ends after a player gets the amount of points that was determined upon earlier, or after there are no more food pieces on the game board (the total amounts to 72 points).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the Publishers website:&#10;&#10;Championship Boxing is intended to be a realistic simulation of top-class boxing producing accurate results and incorporating all the relevant factors such as boxing skill, punching power, stamina etc. Considerable thought has been given to a system of play that captures some of the 'feel' of boxing, while still playing quickly. Once the play mechanics have been thoroughly grasped each round takes only on to two minutes to play and each bout can be set up and the Scorecard prepared in about five minutes. It is thus feasible to fight a whole series of bouts in an evening's play, quickly building up statistics and rankings for all weight divisions.&#10;&#10;The ratings will, of course be contentious. Everyone has their own opinion about the qualities of their own favourite fighter. All I can say is that each rating has been carefully researched, contemporary fight reports have been studied where possible, different opinions have been carefully weighed and several sources have been examined in arriving at the final figures. If you disagree with any rating try to clear your mind of bias and prejudice an if you still disagree, change it! As the purchaser the game is presented entirely for your pleasure, don't let my opinions spoil it for you!&#10;&#10;On the subject of alteration of ratings the game does have another function beyond the mere replay angle. It can be used to answer some otherwise unanswerable questions. Not just, 'Who was the best, Marciano or Ali? But questions like, 'How good could Henry Cooper have been if he had not been so vulnerable to cutting around the eyes?. Would Sugar Ray Leonard have been the world's greatest ever welterweight if he had had the hitting power of Thomas Hearns? Would Floyd Paterson have been a great champion if he had had a sounder chin? The answers are there for you to  explore, just change those rating! While you are about it, why not conjure up your own personal ratings and step into the ring with Frank Bruno, Sugar Ray Robinson or Barry McGuigan.&#10;&#10;LET'S RUMBLE&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A (very) quick playing real-time rummy style game the aim in Pest Control is to clear your hand of pests (cards) before the other players.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of 7 cards, which they play down by making nests (melds) of 3 or more cards either of the same type or in sequential order, i.e. a run. Cards may also be added to nests played by any player. On their turn players either pick up a card off the draw deck or the entire discard pile, they then discard a card. However cards may be played down by any player at any time during their turn or other players turns,in other words the game can end at any point, meaning you have to keep a close eye on what the other players are doing and how many cards they have left. Cards left in the hand score negative points, the person with the lowest points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Pest Control is a print &amp; play game which can be tried out first with an ordinary pack of cards if you are only playing 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;The decks can be easily printed at Artscow:&#10;&#10;Pest Control Creepies Deck&#10;http://www.artscow.com/share/r9a406xevpm3&#10;&#10;Pest Control Creepies Deck Crawlies Deck&#10;http://www.artscow.com/share/7ys9l128kc5s&#10;&#10;If you are only planning on playing 2-4 players you can print and play with either deck, if you plan on playing with 5-8 players you will need both.&#10;&#10;",

Situated probably atop Mont Auxois, above modern Alise-Sainte-Reine in France, but this location does not fit Caesar's description of the battle. A number of alternatives have been proposed over time, among which Chaux-des-Crotenay (in Jura in modern France) only remains as challenger today. This battle was fought by the army of the Roman Republic commanded by Julius Caesar, aided by cavalry commanders Mark Antony, Titus Labienus and Gaius Trebonius, against a confederation of Gallic tribes united under the leadership of Vercingetorix of the Averni.&#10;Alesia was the last major engagement between Gauls and Romans, and marked the turning point of the Gallic Wars in favour of Rome. The siege of Alesia is considered one of Caesar's greatest military achievements, and is still one of the classic examples of siege warfare and circumvallation.&#10;Now, in this game free to download and play, as Caesar, You will defend a system of ramparts, forts and awesome fortifications with units representing legion cohorts, leaders, archers, Germanic cavalry and, as Vergingetorix, you will assault the Roman besiegers with infantry and cavalry units from 46 Gallic tribes.

(1 is a knockout on 8) If it's 2 steps higher it's a knock and if they are equal it's a clinch. When there is no knockout, knock or clinch each player puts down a marker at that number on the scoreboard. After a knockout the victim must remove all markers in that row, after a knock you don't put down a marker and if there is a clinch no player marks. It is also possible to win if you successfully ask for a knockout before the numbers are revealed. If it's not a knockout then that player that asked looses. You can't ask for a knockout if any player only has 1 or 2 markers left. When any player is out of markers the game ends and points are counted, highest wins of course.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Playable using Othello and Go pieces, Gothello involves capturing tiles but plays uniquely.&#10;&#10;The game is set up by placing 16 reversible tiles on an 8x8 board to form 8 separated pairs - each pair containing one white and one black tile.&#10;&#10;The first player places a stone of their colour on any free space and players then take turns to either place two stones or remove one enemy stone in any location. You may not undo the previous move (i.e. may not remove a stone placed in the previous turn or replace a stone removed in the previous turn).&#10;&#10;The reversible tiles are flipped over if entirely surrounded by the opposite colour horizontally and vertically. Two tiles can be flipped by using only one stone, others using 2, most need 3.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when all but one square is filled by either reversible tiles or stones OR when all but one pair of tiles has been claimed.&#10;&#10;The winner is the person who claimed the most pairs of tiles.&#10;&#10;",
