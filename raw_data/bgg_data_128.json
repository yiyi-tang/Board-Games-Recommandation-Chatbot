    "Description": "Air &amp; Armor: Wurzburg, Tactical Armored Warfare in Europe, Designer Signature Edition marks the return of one of the most realistic wargames on modern warfare ever published. Air &amp; Armor is a grand tactical simulation of a hypothetical Soviet attack on West Germany in the mid-1980s. It depicts the collision of the Soviet 8th Guards Army with elements of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division and the West German 12th Panzer Division in ferocious battles around the German city of Wu&#204;&#136;rzburg. This new edition is lovingly recreated with an updated order of battle, new map artwork, new unit counters, revised rules, and new scenarios.&#10;&#10;Air &amp; Armor employs a highly interactive game system with asymmetric rules modeling the different command &amp; control capabilities of each alliance. The game simulates all major aspects of modern warfare, including reconnaissance, combined arms operations, air, helicopter, and artillery strikes, chemical and electronic warfare, and combat engineering. Multiple levels of hidden intelligence produce a true &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; providing plenty of opportunities for deception, surprise, traps, and ambushes. Play this game to experience what it would have been like to command a division in battle if the Cold War had gone hot.&#10;&#10;Air &amp; Armor features twelve different scenarios, each a complete game by itself. Each scenario covers a different battlefield operation, including a meeting engagement, a delaying action, a frontal assault, an attack on a fortified line, an attack on a flank, a major river crossing operation, a NATO counterattack, an envelopment operation, and a breakout from a pocket.  Extensive Scenario, Player, and Designer Notes provide advice on play and historical detail.&#10;&#10;Air &amp; Armor is ideal for solitaire play.  The hidden intelligence system provides a high level of tension during solitaire play because, even though a solo player is commanding both sides, he never knows what he will hit when he conducts an operation.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;Complexity:  High&#10;Time Scale: 1 Turn = 2 Hours&#10;Map Scale: 1 Mile/Hex&#10;Unit Scale: Companies to Regiments&#10;Players: 1-7 Players&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Playing Time: 3 to 12 hours based on Scenario&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After the stunning Union defeat at Second Manassas, Robert E. Lee maneuvered his victorious Confederate Army across the Potomac River and into the state of Maryland. George B. McClellan was put back in command of Union forces, being tasked with repulsing the bold Rebel invasion of the North. The uncharacteristically sudden approach of Union troops put the Confederates on the defensive at South Mountain, a site that was considered perhaps the most rugged battlefield of the entire American Civil War (ACW). As the two sides engaged, much more was at stake other than just a victory or defeat; in addition to protecting their vital lines-of-communication, the Confederates had to keep the larger Union Army at bay so that Stonewall Jackson&rsquo;s Corps could force the surrender of more than 12,000 Federals under siege at nearby Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.&#10;&#10;A Greater Victory is a Tactical level wargame covering the key encounter at South Mountain on September 14th, 1862. It has been designed to be an historical yet readily playable regimental-scaled simulation of the twin conflict at Fox&rsquo;s and Turner&rsquo;s Gap. With two smaller, quick-play scenarios plus a comprehensive scenario covering the full day of action, the design offers flexible and tense situations for both players (also excellent for solitaire play). The Order-of-Battle has been researched to account for items like Confederate stragglers, offering a fresh perspective on the battle.&#10;&#10;This is the seventh release in Revolution Games&rsquo; popular Blinds Swords series which features a chit-pull system covering the most interesting and important engagements of the ACW. New features debuting here include Brigade Activation cards so that each side can more easily gauge the status of their formations, along with a customized Fog-of-War table assigned to each scenario for an enhanced historical narrative. The series rules have also been adjusted at certain junctions to better reflect the extreme harshness of the terrain that soldiers on both sides had to contend with.&#10;&#10;More than just a prelude to the famous Battle of Antietam that was fought just three days later on September 17th, 1862, South Mountain set the stage for that epic engagement. Will Confederate General D. H. Hill be able to hold his scattered and understrength formations together until desperately needed reinforcements arrive, along with Generals Lee and Longstreet? Will Union Generals like Jacob Cox (see side-box image) and George Meade be able to coordinate their brigades into effective attacks, fighting the unforgiving terrain as much as their dreaded enemy? If the Confederates cannot hold, and part of their army is either captured or decisively routed at South Mountain, the subsequent results at Antietam could have been drastically altered, thus changing the course of history.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;352 5/8&quot; Counters&#10;22 x 34 inch Map&#10;Exclusive Rulebook&#10;Series Rulebook&#10;2 Event Description Cards&#10;2 Combat Results Table Cards&#10;1 General Records Track&#10;2 Player Reference Cards&#10;2 Brigade Activations Cards&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(Not to be confused with the Twilight Imperium: Twilight Armada accessory)&#10;&#10;The galaxy is engulfed in terrible conflict. Fleets of havoc are patrolling ancient borders in space and impressive armadas, bent on destruction, are penetrating deep into enemy systems. It is a time of skill and cunning, a time of tactics and planning, it is a time of war. Armada is set in the rich and popular Twilight Imperium universe where players take control of one of the four major races of the crumbled empire, and must battle for glory and survival. Filled to the brim with ships of war, personnel, and technologies, Armada is a customizable game of strategic resource allocation and tactical space warfare.&#10;&#10;Take control of the unique capabilities of each race's fleet:&#10;&#10;Federation of Sol&#10;Sardakk N'orr&#10;Barony of Letnev&#10;Emirates of Hacan&#10;&#10;Each ship is a die-cut counter that you move by &quot;flipping&quot; (Diskwars or Range Wars players will be familiar with this system). Each ship has their stats clearly printed on the tile so there are no sheets to cross reference. Combat is resolved by tossing Hit Counters to see how much damage you do. If the damage penetrates the opponent's shields, they must check for Critical Hits. This is an exciting alternative to dice rolling.&#10;&#10;Overall a very fun and simple space combat game, not to mention an inexpensive alternative to miniatures.&#10;&#10;Another note of interest, when the Star Trek Red Alert! game went out of print Fantasy Flight Games continued the game in their Twilight Imperium universe. The two games are compatible but the big difference is that Armada doesn't have cloaking technology but does have Squadrons. Squadrons are comprised of Fighters or Bombers and both are extremely nasty. If you play against an opponent with a Carrier, you're a sitting duck unless you include some fighters of your own.&#10;&#10;The Twilight Imperium: Armada &#226;&#128;&#147; Stellar Matter pack is the ultimate terrain expansion, with all the asteroids, mine fields, planets, space docks, and planetary defense systems you'll ever need. The Twilight Imperium: Armada &#226;&#128;&#147; Incursion introduces several new elements to the game, such as missiles, new squadron types, new technology, new ships, and new crew.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Armada &#226;&#128;&#147; Stellar Matter&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Armada &#226;&#128;&#147; Incursion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each side has some HQ actions they may use to increase their options to achieve victory. Everytime a 6 is rolled when a unit fires or tries a refit action the time advances 30 minutes, nearing the time when one side will withdraw from the battlefield.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Black Sea * Black Death is a simulation-game for 2 to 4 players of the Soviet amphibious operations conducted in early February of 1943 as a part of Operation Gory/Morsky (Mountains/Sea).&#10;&#10;The objective of Operation Morsky was to surround and take the port city of Novorossisk, opening the way to a drive on Anapa which cut the main supply line keeping the German 17th Army alive in the Kuban-Taman area.&#10;&#10;The game covers a battle of 9 1/2 days on a scale of one half mile per hex (800 meters) and one turn per day. Fighting takes place on beaches, in mountains, in an industrial city and in the air overhead, with the units involved being mostly of battalion or company size (roughly 100 men per strength point), with naval units representing one ship or two boats, and air units each representing ten aircraft.&#10;&#10;There are some unusual concepts in the game system, as well as a considerable amount of detail.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day&#10;Hex: 880 yards / 804 meters&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (1 combat, 1 markers - 600 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 40-page Black Sea - Black Death rules booklet&#10;Two Player Aid cards (in rules booklet)&#10;One 4-page Charts &amp; Tables booklet (in rule booklet)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 hours&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "April 14, 1912, 11:40 p.m.: In the dark, cold waters of the Atlantic ocean, the transatlantic RSM Titanic, during its first journey, sinks after a crash against an iceberg. The block of ice opens a hole in the right side of the hull and after two hours and forty minutes the Titanic is doomed.&#10;&#10;One hundred years after those happenings, Sir Chester Cobblepot offers a refined board game that celebrates the unforgettable heroism and determination of the passengers on that English transatlantic. More specifically, our main characters are the survivors of the last lifeboat lowered into the water, the collapsible D.&#10;&#10;The idea for Collapsible D: The Final Minutes of the Titanic comes from the mind of the Italian author Gianluca Santopietro. In this game the players are on board the Titanic during the night of April 14, 1912, starting at 11:40 p.m. when the ship collides with an iceberg; each turn represents ten minutes in real time. Each player controls a passenger of each Class and a member of the Crew. Each character has a different starting point, an attempt to recreate the exact location where they were on the ship, thanks to historical research led by the author in cooperation with history experts on the Titanic, such as Claudio Bossi. Thanks to an intuitive movement system, players will move their passengers through the ship, trying to reach the lifeboats on the dock.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the water floods in quickly and the risk of drowning is very high. Each saved passenger grants victory points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "To set up Findevier, lay out the ten double-sided animal discs in a circle. Shuffle the deck of cards, place them in the circle, then reveal the top card, thereby showing the animal that players will search for in the first round. Place 1-4 tokens in the circle to account for the animals of this type that aren't visible. (Two cards show woodland elves instead of an animal, and the player who draws this card chooses which animal players will search for.)&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player flips over one of the discs to reveal the animal shown on the other side. If the player reveals the target animal, she earns one token from the circle; if the player reveals the fourth animal of this type, the player takes the final token, along with the animal card. Once all four animals of the desired type are visible, reveal the next card. Once all twelve cards have been used, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. Each token and animal card is worth one point, while the two elf cards are worth two points each.&#10;&#10;Game play in Taiga is nearly identical to that of Findevier, with the differences being (1) that the game has only ten animal cards and no elf cards; (2) that a player who reveals an incorrect animal must return a token to the bank; and (3) that each token is worth one point and each animal card is worth two points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Contrast is a light party game in which players score points by characterizing objects the same way.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of the same six cards, and each card has either opposite characteristics (short/long, round/square, etc.) or a pair of colors (red/yellow, blue/green). In each round, players simultaneously reveal one of the four cards they have in hand &mdash; as the other two cards are in front of them and cannot be used &mdash; with that card matching the top picture of the picture card deck in some way. The image might show a red balloon in the sky, for example, so do you reveal red, round, blue, or something else?&#10;&#10;Everyone simultaneously reveals their chosen card. If a player has voted with the majority, they take a picture card from the deck to keep track of their points. Then everyone refreshes their hand by picking up their left-most card and putting down their played card on the right. Then, another round begins.&#10;&#10;After the picture deck runs out, whoever has the most picture cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Age of Muskets is a rule set that covers the campaigns from the late XVII century to the first half of the XIX. It emphasizes Command and Control as well as the uncertainty and friction of any military operation. Players take command of an army of the period, represented by their headquarters, and control their attached units, their men and equipment. The purpose is to re-create all the relevant factors of war at the operational level in the pre-industrial age.&#10;The game is played as a sequence of &ldquo;game turns&rdquo;, each made up of several actions performed by the forces of all sides present on the game board. The diverse scenarios that can be played have a limited number of game turns, once finished players check which side has won. Many of these scenarios can be played by just 2 players. However, the longest and largest are designed for team play, ideally by 4 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;I) Game scales. &#10;1 Combat point = 1.000 men (or approximately 8-12 artillery pieces).&#10;1 Turn = 1 month (or a fortnight)&#10;Game board = variable, mostly 1:1.250.000 (1 cm=12,5 Km)&#10;Unit size = Divisions &amp; brigades (in addition to counters representing Headquarters).&#10;&#10;Age of Muskets Volume I: Tomb for an Empire.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tomb for an Empire&quot; simulates the conflict that took place in the Iberian Peninsula from 1808 to 1814. It was a complex war that involved diverse interests and troops from many nations. Great Britain sent her troops to defend Portugal, within the context of the European Coalitions against France.  In Spain proper the war, which presented certain aspects of a civil war, saw an uneasy alliance of reformists and traditionalists under the name of &quot;Patriots&quot; facing the puppet King Jose I Bonaparte and the occupation army; composed mainly of French but also of Italians, Neapolitans, Poles, Germans, Swiss, Dutch and even Spaniards (known as &quot;Juramentados&quot;).&#10;&#10;Spaniards, British and Portuguese form the Allied side while France and her allies and satellites form the Imperial side. A player (or team) control each side. The game allows to play the war beginning on July 1808 to April 1814, or on several later dates - November 1808,  May 1809, January 1810, January 1811 or February 1812. It is also possible to play only certain parts (e.g. The War in Levante 1809 - 1813),  individual campaigns (Napoleon's 1809) or just battles (Salamanca, Vitoria ...)&#10;&#10;&quot;Tomb for an Empire&quot; is not just a game it's a whole gaming experience that includes 6 introductory battle scenarios and 18 campaign scenarios of increasing complexity, from Bailen (lasting less than one full turn) to the full campaign starting any year of the war (scenarios 14 to 18).&#10;&#10;El juego est&aacute; en ingl&eacute;s pero encontrar&aacute;s en esta p&aacute;gina (Apoyo al Jugador) los archivos en espa&ntilde;ol necesarios para jugar &ndash;Hojas de Ayuda, Reglas y Escenarios.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Thornwatch is a graphic novel adventure game for 2-5 players and a Judge. Players are manifestations of the Thornwatch: scarred veterans of the Eyrewood who now live as spirits summoned by the ancient ritual of tying a knot of thorns around a birch tree. The Thornwatch summoned to a particular tree do not necessarily know each other or the true nature of the problem they've been called to resolve; all they know is that they've answered the call, and they're bound to see it through.&#10;&#10;Thornwatch bestows upon one player the role of the Judge, who enacts the will of the Judging Wood. Each other player plays a Thornwatch character: the Blade, Briarlock, Greenheart, Guard, Sage, or Warden. The game begins with the Judge selecting a storyboard in which the Thornwatch manifest before a tree adorned with a knot of thorny brambles, surrounded by conflict. If the players overcome this first challenge, the Judge offers choices that lead to new storyboards and further adventure.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on one of many maps that display forests, swamps, and villages of the Eyrewood. The pawns lay flat, as if the heroes, enemies, and denizens of the forest are characters in a set of comic book panels.&#10;&#10;The core engine is the momentum system. This system tracks turn order and monster health, encourages teamwork, and creates dynamic combat with priorities that change turn-by-turn and round-by-round.&#10;&#10;The Thornwatch players each have decks of cards which give them skills and actions, as well as playmats and trait cards to show their unique outlook on the world. They roll custom dice including hero dice gained by manifesting their traits. Each session Thornwatch players have an opportunity to gain knots, which grant their wearer a bonus, regardless of which Thornwatch they choose to manifest in a particular session.&#10;&#10;",

The dice have 1-3 stars on three of the sides and the numbers 4-6 on the other three sides. Each other player then secretly selects a color, whether the color they think you'll choose or the color they themselves are interested in. You then name one of the colors, and if anyone else has selected that color, they reveal this information. If the matching die shows stars, they move their seer figure on the scoring track this many spaces, and if it shows a number, they take a card of this color. You either take the die (if it shows stars) or the card, placing this object in your &quot;area of uncertainty&quot;. You then continue your turn by naming another color or end your turn.&#10;&#10;If no one choose your named color, then you pick either the die or card of this color, placing the object in your area of uncertainty. If you took a card when the die showed stars or took a die with a number, then you must continue your turn; otherwise, you can choose to continue or end your turn.&#10;&#10;If all other players have revealed their color choices, then you lose everything in your area of uncertainty, receiving only a bowl card as consolation. If you end your turn &mdash; whether voluntarily or after successfully choosing four of the five colors &mdash; then you move all the cards to your oracle board and advance your seer a number of spaces equal to the sum of all the dice.&#10;&#10;Players take turns in this manner until the first player reaches 30 VPs. Only then are the victory points on the cards counted as well &mdash; but the player who has collected the fewest cards of any particular sort won't get to count the neighboring kind of cards at all. If you have the fewest herbs, for example, then your amulets are worth nothing. Ties are broken in favor of whoever has the most bowl cards. Once you've determined which cards (if any) you must lose, you sum the value of your remaining cards and advance your seer. All players who reach the Cloud Castle of Wisdom on space 75 win; otherwise, whoever has advanced the farthest wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Kharkov Battles uses the Fall Blau basic rules to cover the Second &amp; Third Battles of Kharkov.&#10;&#10;Basics of the system are:&#10;Stacking is 3 units per hex and combat out of a hex is restricted. Large units (mainly German divisions and Soviet corps) have Combat Ratings which pull a strength chit for combat. Typically only one unit with a strength chit may combat out of a hex along with all smaller units. Movement and Combat phases with Mobile Assaults for mechanized units during certain situations of movement. CRT for combats keys off the defender's terrain and uses column shifts for extras like air support, combined arms, fortifications, etc. Combat results have some mandatory step losses, but the rest a player's choice on taking step loss or retreating. Advances after combat are along the Path of Retreat for non-mech units, but mech or cav units may deviate. Support Points are used to allow German supply to reach units for mechanized movement and attacks during turn. Support (for Axis attacks) is traced simply a number of hexes to a HQ and then a number of hexes to a road which leads to the source. Supply is just a general trace to a source.&#10;&#10;Given the nature of the covered battles, this game has a shorter playtime and smaller space requirements making it an easier intro into the system used by Fall Blau. Included is a revised Terrain Effects Chart which should ease reference fatigue for either game. An additional map is included which is made to mate with the Fall Blau maps, allowing players to combine the two games into one &quot;Grand Campaign&quot; to be played into March 1943. Also included are extra counters and reinforcement charts to allow for this possibility. There are four scenarios within the game: three independent and one which requires Fall Blau to play.&#10;&#10;Independent Scenarios:&#10;&#10;        Second Kharkov (K)(Six Turns/Avg Time 90-120 min)- Soviet attack and German Operation Fridericus to reduce the Izyum Salient from 12-28 May 1942.&#10;        Third Kharkov (L)(Six Turns/Avg Time 90-120 min)- German drive to retake Kharkov in March 1943.&#10;        Operation Star Scenario (Sixteen Turns/Avg Time 8 hrs)- Soviet drive for Kharkov and the Dnepr crossings from 2 February to 21 March 1943.&#10;&#10;&#10;Fall Blau Scenarios:&#10;&#10;        January Campaign (J)(14 Turns/Avg Time 10 hrs)- Maps A &amp; B - Soviet &ldquo;Little Saturn&rdquo; Operation has reached its high water mark and Popov&rsquo;s 5th Tank Army is about to launch attacks of its own.

You conduct breakneck advances into the heart of enemy territory, seize critical objectives and, just as important, return to home base.&#10;&#10;The game includes two decks of cards. The Mission Cards provide scenario objectives and the resources with which task forces are assembled. Missions include everything from hostage rescue to tracking down Cuban cadre. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including jeep-mounted commandos, light armor, sappers, air support, paratroopers and many others.&#10;&#10;Congo Merc is part of the Commando mini-game Series. Once a task force is organized, you maneuver it into the Congo. The map covers the entire country, and when a force enters certain points an Event Card is picked. Events can include anything from UN intervention to ambushes by enemy fighters. There&rsquo;s a range of foes, from Simba rebels to Cubans dispatched by Fidel Castro. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts. There are special rules for CIA reinforcements, air transport and leaders.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Simple but fun game based on playing from a hand of cards representing robots. Each has special powers and affects the stack (stak) in different ways, making it more tactical than a simple rock-paper-scissors exercise.&#10;&#10;The game functions by giving each player a stack of cards as well as a hand.  Each turn, players take a new card from the shared draw pile and may add a face-up card to the stack, trash a card from the stack or from their hand.  When a card is played, it will have &quot;entry effect&quot; that may operate on the stack ordering of the player or opponent.&#10;&#10;Once all playing/trashing is finished for a turn, the player may attack the card on top of an opponent's stack with the top card of their own.  The battle itself is quite simple and just a matter of comparing power, although assuming your bot survives its first battle, it can go on to attack the newly revealed card underneath.  The real tactical consideration goes into the pre-attack stack manipulation phase.&#10;&#10;There is an open turn structure which allows players to carry out actions in any order and any number of times. This means they can react to the often unpredictable results of long entry effect chains, or to cards that their opponents play defensively during your turn.&#10;&#10;The game is also customisable: you can adjust the complexity or game length by adding more Staks for each player or by changing basic game mechanics.&#10;&#10;",

Europe was an armed camp with mass armies formed by conscription and national reserves. Antagonism, fear, and suspicion drove nations into a lacework of alliances. Sarajevo provided the spark that set it off, and in a matter of days the continent was at war, with empires in the balance.&#10;&#10;The map covers the entire war zone in Europe (36 miles per hex) and the Middle East (at a slightly larger scale). Terrain includes key cities, certain cultural and religious sites, primary railroads, and sea zones connecting it all. Counters represent field armies, with some specialized corps and a few markers. Six month turns keep the game playable, while multiple movement and attack phases allow for operational nuance.&#10;&#10;Mobilization Points are used to build new units, absorb combat losses, and purchase campaign markers allowing additional activity in chosen sectors. They are always in short supply, increasingly so as economies shrink over the course of the war. Neutrals, wooed by diplomacy, may bring fresh strength to bear.&#10;&#10;The main scenario covers the entire war from 1914-1918 in ten turns, while short scenarios handle the opening phase of the war (two turns) and the final great battles (four turns). Options include free setup in 1914 and an extension of the war into 1919. Victory comes from wearing down an opponent, either by capturing essential places or by exhausting mobilization points. In the game as in the war, battle is sometimes necessary for its own sak&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "GAME OVERVIEW&#10;Space Movers is a cooperative sci-fi adventure set in the year 2201. In this game you play the role of one of the crew members on board the space ship Liberty. Your job as a Mover is to jump from planet to planet in the system picking up and delivering cargo. Movers specialize in getting cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible. As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.&#10;&#10;Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UO&rsquo;s power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)&#10;&#10;- Unique Dice-Rolling Mechanic&#10;How the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a player&rsquo;s last attempt to change any previous die results.&#10;&#10;- Comic Book Included&#10;The story begins in the Comic book &ldquo;Finding Liberty&rdquo; that will be included with the game. Objective cards that match the Comic continue the story as you play the game.&#10;&#10;- Game Soundtrack &#10;Listen to the official game soundtrack on your computer or smart phone.&#10;&#10;",

Especially in demand were seats in the section next to Caesar&rsquo;s box, offering the best view. But these seats were not cheap to obtain and could only be bought by knowing the right people. The black market boomed!&#10;&#10;Each of the 3-5 players is leader of a gang of black market traders, who try to get the best tickets themselves so that they can make a hefty profit hawking them to wealthy tourists and senators. But each of the other gangs wants to enlarge its piece of the black market and supplant its rivals. Who can find the right tactics to make the most cash for the least effort?&#10;The players send their traders to Caesar&rsquo;s villa to obtain favors. Afterwards they try to buy the most lucrative tickets at the Forum Romanum. And finally, the traders race to the three venues to sell their tickets to the wealthiest visitor. After 3 days of events, the player with the most coins wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The 2 maps use hexagons to regulate placement and movement of units, and have overlays for the hills creating a 3D effect. The smaller map represents the area around the Golan Heights: the frontier region between Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The Jordan River crosses the map from north to south, with the Galilean Sea in the middle. The big map represents the Sinai, focused on the area around the Suez Canal.&#10;&#10;The basic game is only played on the Sinai map. Each turn corresponds to 2 days and is subdivided into 10 phases. The Egyptian player goes first, taking 4 phases. Then the Israeli player takes 6 phases. During each phase players can move their units. Combat takes place, using a calculation based on the number of units a player has.&#10;&#10;The advanced game is played on both maps by 2, 3, or 4 players. The aircraft combat rules are introduced. The aircraft are divided into 3 categories: bombers, interceptors, and fighter-bombers. Each turn is divided into 9 phases. Arabian player turn has 4 phases and the Israeli 5.&#10;&#10;Victory is calculated by comparing victory points:&#10;- for Israel, 20 points if Damascus is occupied, 5 points for any other Syrian city occupied, 2 points for each intact bunker, 1 point for each reduced bunker, 5 points for each unit standing west of the Canal, 2 points for each Egyptian bridge destroyed.&#10;- for the Arabs, 10 points for each Israeli city occupied, 2 points if the Syrian bunker remains intact, 10 points for each controlled pass, 1 point for each unit exiting along the coast road to Israel, 1 point for each Israeli unit eliminated. If less than 16 units are standing east of the Canal, the player has to remove (16 - number of unit) to the score.&#10;&#10;",

When the board is full (after each player has placed 18 counters), the majorities are checked for each tile. The player who has the majority of corners of a tile receives the books inside as points. A mouse is worth -1pt because it eats a book. In case of total control of the tile, the points received or lost are increased by 1.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Interceptor Ace, Volume 2: Last Days of the Luftwaffe, 1944-1945, designed by Fernando Sola Ramos, is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a German day fighter during the last days of World War II. This is the sequel to the popular, action-packed Interceptor Ace 1943-44, designed by Gregory M. Smith, and picks up the action where Interceptor Ace 1943-44 left off. Each turn consists of several days, during which a combat mission will be flown from one of many bases in Europe, attempting to intercept incoming American Bombers and defend from their escorts. There is a strong narrative around the pilot, as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion and receive awards.&#10;&#10;Interceptor Ace, Volume 2: Last Days fo the Luftwaffe, 1944-45 not only is a standalone game, but fans of Interceptor Ace 1943-44 will enjoy having the capability to easily combine both games to span all the career of a German pilot from 1943 until 1945.&#10;While the objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a German interceptor pilot and rack up kills, players will find it extremely challenging to survive the entire war, and will experience the brutal nature of the air war over Germany in 1944-45. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request a transfer to other fighter bases in an attempt to get &ldquo;closer to the action, request a newer type of fighter or even become an elite jet fighter pilot. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player&rsquo;s eventual goal &ndash; to become one of the Top Guns of the Luftwaffe and survive the war.&#10;&#10;The system is packed with rich technical detail but without the complexity to capture the key historical facets of the day bombing campaign over Germany. In terms of fighters alone, there are 38 aircraft models available to pilot. The families of fighters include:&#10;&bull; Bf 109 (19 aircraft)&#10;&bull; Bf 110 (2 aircraft)&#10;&bull; Me 410 (1 aircraft)&#10;&bull; Ju 88 (1 aircraft)&#10;&bull; FW 190 (9 aircraft)&#10;&bull; Me 163 (1 aircraft)&#10;&bull; Me 262 (2 aircraft)&#10;&bull; Do 335 (1 aircraft)&#10;&bull; He 162 (1 aircraft)&#10;&bull; Go 229 (1 aircraft)&#10;For each interceptor, you will be using the date of availability, speed, area of operations based on originating base, individual weapon systems, damage, and crew status.&#10;&#10;Fighters can be assigned to one of eight possible major geographic base &ldquo;groups&rdquo; as follows:&#10;&bull; Dutch: Deelen, Volkel, Woensdrecht, Schiphol, Venlo&#10;&bull; Bremen: Husum, Jever, Oldenburg, Schwerin-Gorries, Stade, Salzwedel, Nordholz, Westerland, Langenhagen, Fassberg, Wunstorf, Hildesheim&#10;&bull; French: Beaumont-le-Roger, Poix-Nord, Vannes, Tille, St. Trond&#10;&bull; Ruhr: Monchen-Gladbach, Kirchhellen, Krefeld, Dusseldorf, Bonn&#10;&bull; Munich: Neubiberg, Lechfeld, Ingosltadt&#10;&bull; Munster: Rheine, Handorf&#10;&bull; Frankfurt: K&ouml;nigsberg, Wiesbaden, Frankfurt, Trier, Ansbach&#10;&bull; Berlin: Brandis, Brandenburg-Briest, Rechlin, Parchim, Oranienburg&#10;&#10;Besides the focus on hardware, the soft aspects of the war are also faithfully rendered for each pilot and crew. For example, air crew is characterized by various parameters, including numerous Pilot skills, Wingman skills, Bordschuetze (Rear Gunner) skills, and Prestige Level. The emphasis on various skills and benefits to gaining experience creates a strong narrative, in the same fashion as in Interceptor Ace 1943-44, which helps weave a tense and dramatic narrative during play. One major change in Interceptor Ace, Volume 2: Last Days of the Luftwaffe, 1944-1945 over Interceptor Ace 1943-44 is that enemy fighter kills are now accounted for final victory, making dogfighting skills particularly important. As in InterceptorAce 1943-44, you have the ability to to choose your crew improvements instead of randomly rolling for them. As these greatly impact on your combat capability (and survival), it is a major decision you must make. Another major characteristic in the system is the wingman concept, who can possibly pull you out of a bad situation if he is still flying.&#10;&#10;Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot and crew along with your fighter assignment, play proceeds by checking for base weather and incoming raid information prior to take off. Following successful take off, play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the Americans, trying to avoid marauding Allied fighters while doing so. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a new fighter, or request a change of base. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until the war ends, should you make it through unscathed.&#10;This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters, Nightfighter Ace, or Interceptor Ace 1943-44, all designed by Gregory M. Smith. The game system lends itself very well to capturing the tense air defense over Germany. WhileInterceptor Ace, Volume 2: Last Days of the Luftwaffe, 1944-1945 is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to become the Top Ace of the Luftwaffe while flying the advanced Me 262 jet fighter, the futuristic Go 229 Flying Wing or the dreaded Me 163 Komet rocket fighter?&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;        Complexity: Medium&#10;        Time Scale: 3-4 days per turn&#10;        Map Scale: abstract&#10;        Unit Scale: individual aircraft, weapon systems, crew members, ammo rounds&#10;        Players: 1 (with option for 2 or more)&#10;       Solitaire: High&#10;       Playing Time: 2-3 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;  &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        1.5 Countersheets of 9/16&Prime; unit-counters (342 counters)&#10;        38 Aircraft Display Mats (double-sided, 19 total)&#10;        4 Player Aid Cards&#10;        1 Combat Display Mat&#10;        2 Bomber Target Mats&#10;        1 Pilot Awards Display Mat&#10;        1 Air Operations Display Mat 11&Prime; x 17&Prime;&#10;        60 Combat Cards&#10;        8 Ace Pilot Cards&#10;        1 Sortie logsheet&#10;        1 Rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In SCRAP, you take on the role of an &quot;Intelligence&quot;, a collective of Bots who have just become truly intelligent following an event known only as &quot;The Singularity&quot;, which unleashed the mysterious &quot;Celestium&quot; into the galaxy. Travelling to planet Seratus, you must lead your Bots to find out the truth behind &quot;The Singularity&quot;.&#10;&#10;SCRAP is an area control game featuring lots of &quot;Bots on a Map&quot;. Its major mechanical features are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Action Queue Programming: You'll plan your moves in advance by placing &quot;Functions&quot; into an queue. Each turn, you'll resolve the Function at the front of your queue and place a new Function at the back of it. &#10;     Hand Building: Throughout the game, you'll acquire new Functions to increase your options when programming. Each card has two major purposes; one, to serve as a unique option for your Bots (no two action cards are the same), and also as fuel for other powers; whenever you reveal a Function on your turn, you can discard a Function of a matching colour to gain powerful bonus effects!&#10;     Hand Management: Your Functions will need time to refresh in between uses, and you must plan a Reboot turn in advance (even Robots need a break!). Spend too many cards too quickly and you'll find yourself rebooting much more frequently.&#10;     Hidden Bidding Combat: Assign your Bots orders in a unique and thematic combat system with no dice or cards; YOU choose what your Bots will do. Probe your opponent to gain additional data or weapons for the future, snipe their Bots before they can strike, brace for impact, and then get ready to brawl! Plus, get data whenever you destroy something!&#10;     Asymmetric Factions: Play as one of six unique &quot;Intelligences&quot; (factions) featuring a unique hand of functions (5 cores similar to other players and one wholly unique ability) and unique upgrades. Crush the competition with Vulkanos, study your enemies as Cerebrum, or manipulate the space-time continuum with Tachyon.&#10;&#10;&#10;SCRAP draws inspiration from a range of games, including Cthulhu Wars, Inis, Scythe, Concordia, Rising Sun, Cry Havoc, Blood Rage, Mage Knight, and Spirit Island.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "17 October 1903: The Esperanza ends up in a terrible storm and loses its battle against the elements. 163 people lose their lives, but a small group survives this disaster and washes ashore on the isle Juan Ansidad. For weeks they wait, hoping to be rescued, but they slowly run out of food. They come to realize that if they ever want to get home again, they will have to take matters into their own hands. A raft is carefully put together and with a small ration four brave survivors try their luck on the Pacific, looking for salvation. You have found the logbook in which the four survivors wrote down their adventures &mdash; their story, which lasted 21 days.&#10;&#10;In the dice-driven survival board game 21 Days, you relive the events of 21 days recorded in this recovered logbook. The purpose of the game is to have (at least) one of the survivors rescued by the rescue ship on the 21st day. You do this by following the events described in the logbook and having the survivors, represented by two stacked dice per survivor, choose and perform actions on the various locations on the game board by using their placement dice.&#10;&#10;Don't lose too many planks of the raft or else you will lose some of your survivors as well! In 21 Days, the four survivors are stuck together on a raft made out of six planks that are held loosely together. Some events during the 21 days may cause some planks to drift off. There are ways to prevent this, like saving up hope tokens or picking the right bottle cards. When the rescue ship enters the final spot on the rescue track and there are still survivors left on the raft, you will be saved and win the game.&#10;&#10;21 Days is a dice-driven, Ameritrashy, game, so a lot depends on how you will roll the dice! However, there are ways to alter the dice, plan ahead, and make use of your survivor's special skills.&#10;&#10;www.21daysboardgame.com&#10;&#10;",

Charlemagne's grandchildren are already competing for the throne, pushing their father aside. Strife and rebellion abound&mdash;the once stable kingdom is on the verge of war. Is there still hope for peace?&#10;&#10;In Carolingi, the players assume the roles of the grandchildren of Charlemagne; they are the &quot;Carolingi&quot;, who must live through the difficulties and central aspects of early medieval rule. The &quot;Carolingi&quot; have to wield their power by fealty of the nobility. The nobility, in turn, expect to be rewarded with vast estates, so the Carolingi have to seek more and more land and resources, but as the power base of one Carolingian gets stronger, so does the envy and greed of his royal siblings. There's need for action for the Carolingi, but not everything can be done at a time. Only prudent action will bring peace and stability to the realm.&#10;&#10;The board shows the countries and regions of Carolingian times, and the game features an innovative system of action that guarantees an exciting, effortless gaming experience. Each game year consists of four quarters; in each quarter the players add two of their (wooden) action tiles to a bag, from which they are later drawn one at a time. This results in unpredictability (true to its time).&#10;&#10;The game includes a competitive version and a semi-cooperative version.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player manages to declare peace successfully.

    "Description": "On June 28th, 1942 the German High Command launched its summer offensive (Case Blue) against the southern lines of the Soviet Union. 2 Army Groups of 10 Armies-nearly 35 Divisions and 2 full Air Corps, were unleashed against the Soviet lines. It involved a two-pronged attack. One along the Axis right flank driving to the Caucasus and the vital oil fields of Baku, and the other against the left flank in the direction of Stalingrad and the Volga River. The battle would rage for 2 months over several hundred square kilometers that would take the German Army to the gates of Stalingrad itself.&#10;&#10;Heroes Road to Stalingrad is a new East Front module for the Lock 'n Load Tactical series. It features a fluid, impulse-based turns, squad-level, and individual heroics, plus lots of armor and special rules to bring the fight for the southern steppes of Russia to life. German Landser, Mechanized, and Armored formations clash with Soviet Line, Guards, and NKVD Divisions. New units never before seen in the Lock 'n Load Tactical series are introduced. The German Pz IV F and G along with the Marder II and StuG IIIF join the battlefield as well as the Soviet Tachanka MG wagon, NKVD troops, and the IL2 Sturmovik. We also introduce a new leader type-the Incompetent Leader. The scenarios range from the city of Voronezh and through Rostov, as far south as the Caucasus Mountains. Into the footsteps of the Silk Road at Khulkhuta, up and into the outskirts of Stalingrad itself. &#10;&#10;&#10;The steppes of southern Russia await you!&#10;&#10;",

Will you play prince or brigand?&#10;&#10;Brigands is an asymetrical game of deduction and trickery that pits a prince against rival bands of brigands. The prince must protect the coffers of the city against brigands. If no brigand succeeds in stealing 50 Ducats from the kingdom at the end of the 6 game turns, the prince is victorious! Otherwise, the richest bandit wins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player will send their 3 crew members to the districts of their choice. The choice is secret and simultaneous. When everyone has set their mind, it's time to reveal choices and place every crew member in the city. If a prince's crew is on the same district as a brigand's crew, thieves are arrested before they could hope to get richer. Otherwise, they will be able to plunder the district. Each district allows looting the treasure in a unique way. Be careful, if someone has played an action token on the district in the beginning of their turn, they will be able to steal or push other player's crew, or maybe to run to another district at the last minute. Once in jail, thieves can choose to await trial or attempt to escape.&#10;&#10;The prince player will improve their skills during the game to better recover their treasure or better trap brigands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

One player takes the role of the Alien Queen and other players play as colonial marines (Vasquez, Hicks, Gorman and Hudson), the civilian Ripley and Bishop the android. The humans collect data discs which they bring to computers in order to learn their mission objectives. Once a pre-determined number of those is completed, the Alien Queen is defeated and the team must escape from the base. Every turn the Alien player spawns a die-roll worth of aliens and tries to stop the humans from succeeding. Players can use equipment like rifles, flame throwers, grenades, explosions and many others to fight with hordes of aliens. They even have access to the APC, if they can fuel it. The mechanic is easy (four page manual). The game bears some resemblance to Space Hulk. &#10;The Box includes:&#10;&#10;- gameboard&#10;- 6 character cards&#10;- 7 paper figures&#10;- 72 counters of aliens&#10;- 74 counters of equipment&#10;- 16 black counters&#10;- 1 blue counter&#10;- 20 card with tasks&#10;- fight result table&#10;- legend&#10;- dice&#10;- manual&#10;&#10;There was expansion made by fans, called Predator.

Each player has his own gameboard and a set of tiles with tracks. In every round, you draw one tile, place it in your play area and move all trains that are connected to the new track. Be careful not to crash them! You score 1 point for every tile crossed by each train, and looping through tiles multiple times can help your score. Additionally, the farthest stations are the most valuable--until the first trains arrive.  Each delivery decreases the value of a station, so you may have to change your plans in the middle of your journey if an opponent reaches your initial destination first!&#10;&#10;",

To increase the pressure on Paris and Normandy, Henry IV lays siege to Evreux as well. The Duke of Mayenne, lieutenant general of the kingdom of France for the League, decides to go meet the Royalist army. &#10;The clash occurs on the great prairie of Ivry where the king makes his famous speech about his white panache during the charge against Egmont&rsquo;s Spanish lancers.&#10;&#10;- Marc&rsquo;hallac&rsquo;h 1591&#10;After the entry into the League of the governor of Brittany, Philippe de Merc&oelig;ur, Henry IV replaces him with the Prince of Dombes.

Things seemed to change with the arrival of 7000 Spaniards for the League and 2400 British for the Royalists.

The purpose of this game is to achieve one of the multiple presented city planning cards. What you can do on your turn is simple: take a budget card or a construction card, or construct a building. You'll need cunning to figure out what to do, manage your money, read your opponent's plans, and get cards ahead of time. Also, even if the city plan is achieved, there is no peace of mind. Eventually you have to use up all the cards in your hand. Lean management makes the difference between victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;Building cards have effects, which can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the situation. Let's create a bustling city by managing your hand and card effects well!&#10;&#10;",

It typically uses four or five regular poker decks including the jokers.  Each player starts with two piles of eleven cards.  One pile is their hand, the other, their foot.  The players draw two cards a turn, playing some if they choose and then discarding one at the end of each of their turns, except if they want to go out, when they will have to play every card.  Once a player has played all the cards in their hand they will pick up their foot.  Sets are comprised of 7 cards of the same number.  Sets may have wild cards in them, jokers and twos, but then the set is no longer clean, it would then be considered dirty.  A team needs two clean sets and two or three dirty sets to go out.&#10;&#10;Hand and Foot is also commonly known as clean and dirty.&#10;&#10;",

Each player or team uses its own set of drawings, and the goal is to find as much stuff as possible in the drawing being used by each player &mdash; but first you need to know which stuff to find!&#10;&#10;The game includes rules for three levels of players, depending on their ages. In level one, players look for items in one of thirteen categories, with the category being chosen by the spinner included in the game. Sample categories include something edible, something made of wood, something fragile, and something round. One player flips the sand timer, then everyone tries to find matching items in the drawing, covering those items with colored tokens. After time runs out, everyone reveals their answers, and for each correct answer, the player places one of her tokens in the center of the table. Players then choose a new drawing, each using the same one, and start a new round. The first player to get rid of all of her tokens wins.&#10;&#10;In level two, players use the letters on the spinner (instead of the categories) and now look for items that start with the chosen letter. Otherwise gameplay is the same, with players trying to rid themselves of tokens.&#10;&#10;In level three, players choose a letter, then write down answers that they find in the drawing. Each player scores one point for an answer that someone else also found and three points for an answer found only by her. Whoever has the most points after five rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

One of the tools that he uses for exploring ancient battles is simulation.&#10;&#10;In this 298 page book, Sabin guides us through the creation of a system for simulating pitched battles in the ancient period, and then applies the system to 35 historical battles. Scenario setups are shown on color plates.&#10;&#10;The rules for the system are approximately 16 pages long, and can be used with either miniatures or counters. (Counters are available for free download from the author's Web site.) Armies have roughly 20 units, which are graded into Veteran, Average, and Levy training levels. Battlefields are divided into a rectangular grid 5 areas wide by 4 areas deep.  Each turn, players throw a single die to determine command points, which allows units to move and fight between areas.  Veteran units require few points to command.  Unit states are very simple:  fresh, spent, and shattered (eliminated).&#10;&#10;The book contains extensive references to both primary and secondary sources.&#10;&#10;Fifth Column Games version is found at Lost Battles.&#10;&#10;",

Each card bears one of six symbols, and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&#10;&#10;In the &quot;Second Escape&quot;, called &quot;Follow the Captain&quot;, you get to place a captain hat on one of your pirates and use the powers of this leader. In the &quot;Third Escape&quot;, &quot;Risky Rafts&quot;, you can take a chance to escape the fortress more quickly on a leaky raft &mdash; and risk sinking in the attempt. By combining the Second and Third Escapes, you have the &quot;Fourth Escape&quot; &mdash; &quot;All Together Now!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Around the world, heroes entered dangerous dungeons in search of fame and fortune. Your job is to nurse and make better all of these heroes from injuries, sickness, and curses of underworld.

Stealth and cunning are your greatest allies as only agents who remain hidden in the shadows will survive the hunt.

If the card is a match, you eliminate that safe house. Otherwise your opponent reveals whether your card is higher or lower than the hidden card in the safe house but does not reveal the numeral on that card.&#10;&#10;When you switch agents, you replace a face-down card from one of your safe houses with a card in your hand, possibly the same card. You can take this action at most five times during the game.&#10;&#10;When you attack from your safe house, you reveal one of your face-down safe house cards, then reveal an opponent's safe house. If the numbers match, your opponent's safe house is eliminated; otherwise your safe house is eliminated.&#10;&#10;Players keep swapping turns until all three of a player's safe houses are eliminated.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Republic's Struggle is a thematic game with card engine for 2 players, set during the historical events that took place in Spain after the resignation to the throne of King Alfonso XIII, and the proclamation of the II Spanish Republic, in 1931. With the creation of the new regime, the struggle for power between the different social, political and ideological sectors increased, which gave rise to continuous changes of political power, alterations of the public order, armed uprisings and violent acts, carried out by the numerous ideological factions of the moment; which culminated in 1936, in a failed military uprising. The failure of this coup d'&eacute;tat originated the Spanish Civil War.&#10;&#10;The game represents all the events of this turbulent period in the history of Spain, which led to a bloody civil war and the destiny of the nation. Spain was not isolated from the rest of the world and especially from the old Europe, so it was a victim of the tensions of the so-called interwar period. During the development of a game, one player on the Republican side, and another on the National side, will be able to recreate events of the period to increase their popularity in the localities by carrying out political propaganda, recruiting troops or militias, generating revolts or assaults, establishing diplomatic relations or carrying out bloody bombardments. All this will be done by playing their hand of cards in an alternative way, either by increasing the events or by playing the action points or icons to perform any of the other actions available to the players.&#10;&#10;But both factions will not only seek to control the country, but will also look abroad through diplomatic relations for international support. In the interior, localities of great importance are the localities of barracks, air bases and naval bases. Their control will give important advantages to the player faction for the control of the different fronts. But although Republic Struggle may be inspired by the famous Twilight Struggle, it is not a copy of this game but has its own independent spirit and enough differences and adaptations to the conflict it represents to make it an essential piece that cannot be missing in your toy library. The role of armies and armed roadblocks that can prevent political propaganda from spreading makes it all very interesting. In addition, armies can move from one front to another and defeating enemy armies will help you take control of certain regions even if the politically full people support your rival. And don't forget that it is possible to bombard your opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Combinations!&#10;&#10;Knights roam the night, seeking someone to save, but Miss Sparkle*Kitty aims to misbehave. The princesses are gone and now the Knights find themselves locked in the tower! Players are Knights on Team Naughty or Team Nice - or maybe the Dragon! Find your teammates while casting saucy, twisted spells that are as mature as you make 'em to escape your tower. Spells are cast via card play into a spellbook just like the original game. Wild new abilities and sneaky enchantments are now in play as Knights work to free themselves and their teammates.&#10;&#10;The first team to escape their towers by removing all tower sections win - unless the dragon is in the game and frees themselves and an unsuspecting Knight's last tower card to snatch victory. Tower sections are removed in a variety of ways including: playing the last card from your hand, matching a word in play (out of turn play), and playing special spell cards.&#10;&#10;Into the crazy mix of silly word spell casting, Sparkle*Kitty Nights adds bluffing and cooperative team play. Players now may choose to remove tower sections from other players they believe are on their team - but were they mislead? Did they just free the Dragon? The dragon is used when there is an odd number of players, but commands special powers, such as being able to expose themselves at any time to become immune to certain effects.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For that, they need to be tested at all the stages in the manufacturing process of Portuguese tiles, starting from clay modelling up to order delivery.&#10;The one who has the best performance in all these areas (more victory points) will get the much desired promotion.&#10;The production level a player can achieve in the various stages of tile creation is very important.&#10;Players have to play cards in order to:&#10;&#10;     Manage resources&#10;     Model clay&#10;     Glaze tiles&#10;     Draw tiles&#10;     Paint tiles&#10;     Fulfill orders&#10;&#10;&#10;Players should never neglect the oldest employees in the factory.
