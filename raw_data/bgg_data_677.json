It is allowed to place any white tile adjacent to any other tile, but coloured tiles must not be adjacent to other coloured ones. Aim of the game is to create as many &quot;perfect Rosettas&quot; as possible: groups of seven tiles, with a tile of your colour as the centre and 6 white tiles with the other six numbers surrounding it, which is 10 points worth in the final score. If one or more tiles of 7 tiles show the same number, the &quot;doubles&quot; are subtracted from the 10 points. Rose-tiles are &quot;jokers&quot; and stand for any number a scoring player wants.&#10;The game ends, when all tiles are placed, or all coloured tiles are surrounded.&#10;&#10;",

Deeds come in four categories (preach, heal, exorcise a demon, or show compassion), and the cost of performing a Deed increases with each Deed performed in that category.  But players can call on Jesus to perform a Deed, which resets that category's cost track and awards players present in the area with Gospel tokens.  Most of the Deeds also result in consequences on one or more of the political tracks, representing the crowds, the Pharisees, or Rome.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when the Rome track reaches its end (indicating that Jesus and the Disciples have attracted too much attention and Rome decides to intervene), or when the player who was dealt the Judas card elects to end the game, and receives the payout indicated on the Pharisees track.&#10;&#10;The players' score is comprised of victory points received from the Deeds they performed, the Gospel tokens they accumulated, and the conditions described on their secret Goal cards that they received at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nines is a simple game that uses two decks of standard cards with jokers included, and is based almost entirely on luck.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt nine cards each, and they proceed to line them up into three vertical columns (3 cards per column). They each then turn over two cards that are in different columns.&#10;&#10;The goal of Nines is to have the fewest points at game end by getting columns with matching cards (e.g. three 4's in one column). Matching cards in a column essentially &quot;cancels out&quot; that column and the total value of those three cards is zero.&#10;&#10;After all cards are dealt, a single card is flipped over from the top of the draw pile. Starting to the left of dealer, a player's turn consists of drawing a single card either from the discard pile or the draw deck. If the player takes a card from the draw deck, they may look at it and either discard it or replace one of the cards in their current play area (can replace either face up or face down). If they choose to replace a card, they have to discard the one they replaced. Taking a card from the discard pile means they have to replace one of their cards, and then discard the one they replaced.&#10;&#10;The game end is triggered when one person has all of their cards turned face up. Then, every other person gets one more turn. On this final turn, players do get the option of turning one of their own cards over.&#10;&#10;After the game is over, the players turn over any face down cards. If a face down card matches the face up cards in its column, that column of cards counts as zero points. All points are then tallied.&#10;&#10;The cards all have different values. Jokers are worth negative three points, aces and kings are both worth zero points, jacks and queens are ten points each, and the numbered cards have point values equal to the number on the card.&#10;&#10;",

When a player bids for an Asset, he selects one card from his holding. All bids are simultaneous. You don't have to bid if you do not want to. Bids are revealed and the highest acquires the Asset and all Bid Cards used go out of the game. Selling Assets is done in the same way but now the owner definitely won't bid but will collect the winning bid in cash. Again, all Bids made go out of the game.&#10;&#10;Movement across the board requires no dice, you just move one Asset space to another each turn. You must follow the 'flight paths' of the planes printed on the board.&#10;&#10;The objective is to collect Assets in the same group (Example: Group: Energy; Assets needed Nuclear, Gas and Coal). When you have a set of three Assets, you may declare it and claim a Blue Chip for that set. A Blue Chip holding doubles the value of a set. When 10 Blue Chips have been declared, the game ends. Players announce the value of their Assets, add in their cash, and thge highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the box:&#10;Contents: 4 boards with perforations, 126 banknotes, 10 fixed cards, 4 insurance policies, 80 random cards, 80 pegs, 1 die.&#10;The purpose of the game is to trade goods in such a way that you can keep your business going, avoid bankruptcy, if possible make a profit and become the foremost firm on the market. Each player has a business, in other words a board with columns for 6 kinds of goods, and a starting capital of $100,000. Each player buys one kind of goods. There are 6 different kinds of goods with various prices. Before a player can buy one kind of goods he must throw a certain number on the dice. When he does so, he can go ahead and buy a maximum of three units of the chosen kind of goods. If the player throws a smaller number, he must then take a card from the pack of random cards and follow the instructions. These can be helpful or unhelpful. Once a player has several kinds of goods he can start selling and by doing so try to make a profit. However, he can sell only goods of one kind each time, and only - as with buying - when he throws the right number on the dice. Once he has thrown this number the bank gives him  the specified selling price which contains a certain profit margin. If the player throws a smaller number, he may not sell and must draw a random card whose instructions he must follow.&#10;What makes the game exciting is that all the players have the chance to bid for goods being bought or sold. In other words, when goods are being bought each player can make his own bid and acquire the goods. The same applies to selling. The specified selling price can be undercut, giving the player an opportunity to find a buyer for his goods. But remember: the purpose is still to make a profit in the end.&#10;The winner is the player who reaches the topmost square with his goods. The other players then count up their capital (goods and money) and work out their relative positions on the market.&#10;&#10;",

Divide the equipment tiles into three piles based on color/symbol, shuffle them, and set them down as piles from which players can draw during the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has four action points to spend; actions consist of moving to a new room, searching for equipment, trading equipment with other players, making noise, and using equipment. When players search or make noise, they attract zombies in the mansion toward that room.

    "Description": "A cycling game. 2 to 6 players. Copyright 1984 Peter English. Materials: black and white laminated board featuring a course and cartoon graphics, spinner (you can use a 6 sided die, 34 bonus tabs, 7 cutout figures for bunch and riders, 6 rider cards (Bernard, Eddy, Fausto, Jacques, Sean, Tom - functionally identical). &#10;Riders can be either in &quot;the bunch&quot; or making a break out in front or left behind. When in the bunch the rider figure remains on your card where you also place bonus tabs that are accumulated by reaching certain points in the race first and also when rolling on your turn a 4 or 5 if in the bunch, or 6. Main mechanism is roll and move along a track that includes squares for gaining bonus tabs and penalties that can move you back. The race takes the riders past fans, through an avalanche, past a protest, into a thunderstorm, up the Kremmelburg climb, across cobbles and up the Poggio climb before the finish. Each turn, each player spins the spinner (rolls the die), moves individually or stays in the bunch and and after all players the bunch moves. The bunch always moves three spaces. To break away from the bunch you must roll a 4 or more. A minimum of one rider must remain in the bunch. Generally there can only be up to 2 riders per square (1 on the Kobbleburg climb) and the bunch will swallow you back up if it catches you or leave you off the back if it passes you. Players use their bonus tabs to increase their movement rate or to increase the speed of the bunch when the bunch moves.&#10;The strategy revolves around collecting bonus tabs and deciding when and at which part of the course to make an individual break. The winner is the first rider past the finishing post.&#10;&#10;",

These are collected in the Regional exhibition rooms of the museums and organised on the basis of the continent of origin.&#10;&#10;In the course of the game you will also host Special Exhibitions such as 'The Relics of Peking Man' or 'the Lost Glory of Carthage' which will require collecting specific sets of exhibits. You also will be on the lookout for clues that will enable you to collect one or two main attractions for your museum &ndash; an artefact of global significance such as the Complete Works of Shakespeare or the Sword of Julius Caesar. (Clues can also help with expeditions.)&#10;&#10;All of these activities bring your museum value to set it above the rest. In an effort to achieve victory you will fund expeditions around the world, competing with the other players as to which to support and to what extent. You will buy and sell artefacts on the world market, auction them off and you may be tempted to risk the black market. (Just don't get caught or it will look bad for your museum.) You will also invest in action cards which can give you the edge in various aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;Four times in the game there is an Exhibition Phase. During this phase you calculate the score of your museum, which is gained from the stars on each tile you own in Regional Halls with bonuses for larger collections. Completed Special exhibitions (active and old) also contribute to your score as do some action cards and the Main Attractions. A museum score is used to calculate how much prestige your Museum gained from that Exhibition Phase as well as how much income it receives for the next turn.&#10;&#10;The best managed museum will gain the most Prestige and will win the game. Will yours be the great museum?&#10;&#10;",

It was the Magic The Gathering of its day.&#10;&#10;The game is played solitaire but can be played by any number &quot;For Progressive Parties&quot;, so says the publisher.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 5 x 5 grid. The dealer deals himself 25 playing cards, face-down. If it is being played by more than one, then everyone must have their own pack of cards but they do not deal themselves 25 cards from it. The dealer takes the first card from his stack and announces it to the other players. They then find the declared card in their deck. Now all players simultaneously add it to their own grid. Once one card has been played there are limitations on where the next card can go. The second card must be placed adjacent to the one card already in the grid, vertically, horizentally or diagonall. The third card must be so placed but this will have a little more choice because there is a block of two cards which you can adjoin. And so the game goes on until everyone has a block of 5 x 5 cards, 25 in total.&#10;&#10;The scoring is now counted. Remember, everyone had the same cards, but it is very unlikely that more than one player will have the same grid. The object is to score points by building up Poker hands, 10 in total, 5 across and 5 down.&#10;The scores are;&#10;One Pair 1 point&#10;Two Pairs 3 pts.&#10;Flush 5 pts.&#10;Three of a king 6 pts.&#10;Full Hand 10 pts (Nowadays we would call this a Full House)&#10;Straight 12 pts.&#10;Four of a Kind 16 pts.&#10;Straight Flush 30 pts.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the book:&#10;&#10;For centuries, the merchant-princes of the Lyran Commonwealth  survived as much through economic might as by the cloak and dagger, steadily growing in strength until their influence could be felt across the Inner Sphere. Now emerging from the ruins of a short-lived alliance and a bloody civil war, a bold new identity has taken hold of the people united under the mighty fist of House Steiner.&#10;&#10;Kicking off a new series, Handbook: House Steiner brings the essential history, politics and culture of one of the Inner Sphere's most powerful nations to life for a new generation of Classic BattleTech players. More than a mere sourcebook, Handbook: House Steiner provides rules for both Classic BattleTech and Classic BattleTech RPG campaigns, including new personal equipment, creatures, life paths, and more - all tailored for players and campaigns based on the Lyran state!&#10;&#10;User comment:&#10;&#10;The first of the new Handbook series produced by FanPro, this book is both an update to the earlier House Steiner: The Lyran Commonwealth and a companion volume to the Field Manual: Lyran Alliance. Where the Field Manual concentrates on the Lyran military, Handbook: House Steiner gives much more detail about the social structure of the Lyran Alliance, together with additional paths and options for BattleTech roleplaying game characters who hail from the Alliance/Commonwealth. The Handbook also includes some new rules and terrain types for BattleTech, as well as a sprinkling of new units.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "200 years ago, the world of Cosmo was shocked by the appearance of a gigantic continent off Shores, south of the Ocean Sea. The Shores native embarked on the conquest of this continent to exploit its resources, including the &quot;Loom&quot;, and trace routes of exploration.&#10; To this end they created guilds, companies specialized in adventurous war, politics, knowledge and &quot;loom&quot;, led by the Guild Masters .&#10;Today, competition is raging on the continent and guilds vie for profit from lands unknown.&#10;&#10;Every player is a master of Guild. The goal is to double his personal treasure of 10 Guilders (game currency), that is to say, come to possess 20 Guilders in his personal treasure.&#10;There are 6 houses, so there are 6 types of different basic games (one per house), each player choosing one of the houses to play.&#10;Early in the game, each player has 15 guilders: 10 in his personal treasure and 5 in the bank.&#10;&#10;There are several types of cards:&#10;1. Territories (Land and premises)&#10;These maps provide resources: The Loom (magic), War, Politics and Knowledge. Each card provides 1 or 2 resources, each being either red or green, or white (neutral). Resources are used to bring into play other cards.&#10;2. The Auguries&#10;These are cards that are played at the beginning of the round (during the Winter phase) They have an effect that extends to all Guild Masters. These are external events.&#10;3. The Machinations which include:&#10;&bull; Troops: armies belonging to various houses.&#10;&bull; Creatures: the troops who live on the Continent.&#10;&bull; Actions: they have off effects in the game&#10;&bull; Reactions: they can be played anytime.&#10;&bull; The Locus: magical places situated on the Continent.&#10;&bull; Constructions: linked to Territories.&#10;&bull; Equipment: benefit the troops and creatures.&#10;&#10;Round :&#10; It is divided into four phases: winter, spring, summer and autumn&#10;&#10;Winter: passive phase where one put in place guidelines for the round of play&#10; Spring: territories, settlement construction.&#10; Summer: is the phase during which the fighting takes place.&#10; Autumn: crop production, collapse and discovery phase.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns playing their cards, with the value of the card determining how far they may move a pawn. Certain cards have special possibilities (a King or an Ace may be played to get a new pawn into play, while a four moves you back instead of forward). A few spaces on the board have special properties as well, requiring certain cards to be played to enter or leave them. If more than two players are playing, they play in teams, devils vs. angels. When you have brought all your own pawns to your safety zone, you must move your partner's pawns (without conferring with each other).&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     game board&#10;     32 playing pieces (marbles)&#10;     requires deck of cards to play (not included)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players alternate playing cards and moving pieces. The game sequence is very interactive, with NO down time waiting for the other player to take his turn. The combat system has both players rolling dice in each combat.&#10;&#10;In this two player game each player starts the campaign game and 1914 scenario with cards that also represent the prewar stocks of ammunition, reserves and planning that allows the war to start off with a large bang. After players expend this allotment of cards, they must purchase more cards along with new units. Each player's resources are limited, so players often will not be able to launch large offensives every turn. They'll need to husband their resources. This represents the preparation for the next &quot;Big Push.&quot; All of this leads to difficult game decisions all the way through the game.&#10;&#10;There are scenarios for each year of the war from 1914 to 1917, along with a hypothetical 1918 scenario. Also included are the many war plans conceived prior to the war and their appropriate set-ups.&#10;&#10;Rules include: Great Offensives, Stosstruppen, tanks, gas attacks, cavalry, huge dogfights, reserves, siege guns, forts, events on other fronts, and much more.&#10;&#10;",

You start on the outer track and when you age a little, you move on to the inner track.Dice are used for moving on either track.&#10;When you land on squares, you must follow the instructions, Example: A Blank Square - you can buy a bed and place it in the square. Anyone now landing on you bed, loses one item of clothing.&#10;Players can play with cards that resemble clothes so that if they have to lose apparel, they can lose a card instead.&#10;&#10;",

All games begin with the spiders lighting up solid red near the center nest.  If this center spider is not stomped in time, it will turn off and one of the spiders on the mat's outside edges will blink red.  If this outside spider turns off before being stomped, the spider has escaped off the mat, and you will hear it bite you.&#10;&#10;Just like Spider-Man, your spidey senses will be tingling when you play the Electronic Spider Stompin' Game--a squishy, battery-powered (three AAA, not included) test of reaction time for one or two players. The arachnid amusement begins when you unroll the three-dimensional, vinyl floormat portraying a colorful array of 10 soft-bodied, pop-up spiders that blink red at random intervals--depending on which of five game speeds you've selected from the push-button controls on the center nest. Players score points by stomping their feet on the blinking beast before it escapes off the mat, all the while enduring smart-aleck cobweb comments like &quot;Ha Ha, ya missed me!&quot; or sound effects like a satisfied &quot;Chomp!&quot; after a successful escape. Add to the mix a razzle-dazzle underscore of silly music during each round of play, and the Electronic Spider Stompin' Game provides more than an itsy-bitsy bit of fast family fun.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Blizword - for 1-4 players&#10;A simple card game of wordforming.&#10;components: 52 cards + 2 cards of rules&#10;&#10;Shuffle the cards and deal a 3x3 grid of letters face up between players. The remaining cards form the draw deck. In turn players remove letters from the grid that can form a complete word or the start of one. All letter tiles must be adjacent to one another in order: up, down, left, right or diagonally. 2, 3, 4 or more letters can be used.&#10;&#10;To score a word, square the number of letters (for instance):&#10;S  T  O  R  A  = storage = 5 letters = 5x5 = 25 points&#10;&#10;Players should keep their letters in word stacks in front of them in separate piles for easy scoring.&#10;&#10;The current player then replaces the removed cards in the grid with new cards from the draw deck. Play until the 3x3 grid cannot be completely re-filled from the draw deck. Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Variations&#10;&#10;Orientation Blizword: The orientation of the letters is important. You can only form a word and remove letters if the letters are in the same orientation. The letters H I N O S X and Z are the only valid in either orientation.&#10;&#10;Solitaire Blizword: Beat your personal high score, removing sets of letters and replacing them as you go. Play until the 3x3 grid cannot be completely re-filled from the draw deck.&#10;&#10;Advanced Blizword: You can only remove letters ONLY if they form the START of a word.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "from the author's website:&#10;&#10;The World Peace Game is a hands-on political simulation that gives players the opportunity to explore the connectedness of the global community through the lens of the economic, social, and environmental crises and the imminent threat of war. The goal of the game is to extricate each country from dangerous circumstances and achieve global prosperity with the least amount of military intervention. As &ldquo;nation teams,&rdquo; students will gain greater understanding of the critical impact of information and how it is used.&#10;&#10;As their teams venture further into this interactive social setting laced with highly charged philosophical issues, the skills needed to identify ambiguity and bias in the information they receive will be enhanced and more specifically they will rapidly perceive that reactive behavior not only provokes antagonism, it can leave them alone and isolated in the face of powerful enemies. Beliefs and values will evolve or completely unravel as they begin to experience the positive impact and windows of opportunity that emerge through effective collaboration and refined communication.&#10;&#10;In essence, as meaning is constructed out of chaos and new creative solutions are proposed, the World Peace Game players will learn to live and work comfortably at the frontiers of the unknown.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Board game in which each player has three tanks which attempt to get to the opponent's home base.  Movement is by dice, but in order to be permitted to move or to make an attack, a nifty resolution mechanism is used.  2 batteries power a bulb and this is reflected by turning knobs controlled by the players. Essentially the two players each secretly pick one of red, green or yellow (colours which are also marked on the tanks), and then a fire button is pressed to illuminate the lights.  Whether the action succeeds or not depends on whether the lights match or not.&#10;&#10;",

The rule book outlines a detailed scenario in which a murder has taken place and one of six infamous criminals must be to blame.  The players are detectives and move around a map of Britain and in various towns get to look at one of the cards which may help provide an alibi for one of the suspects, advance the investigation further or merely cause a delay.  When enough information has been gathered a player can race back to the town the murderer is in and arrest him to win.  Nice system which ensures it plays differently each time.

If a set of related stalls are bought then the admission goes up, and advertising chips can be bought to further increase admission costs.  The Fair Manager's Office replaces Jail and so on.  All the money is in small numbers of &pound; and p with realistic card coins and paper notes, making it a useful game to teach children to deal with money too.&#10;&#10;",
