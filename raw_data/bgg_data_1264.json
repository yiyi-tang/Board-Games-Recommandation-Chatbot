Put the meeple back into your supply. Your protected meeple on the right stays on the tile and scores 2 points.&#10;The revolt is over. The blue meeple has not been affected. Now, place the land tile according to the usual rules and continue your turn.&#10;The peasant revolt moves on to the next player&#10;&#10;If you do not have to return a meeple to your supply, because none of your meeples are standing on affected features or because all of your meeples, on affected features, are protected, the peasant revolt moves on and hits the player to your left. They also check, in the same way as described before, whether or not the revolt affects them and if they score points for protected meeples. If they, also are not affected by the peasant revolt, it moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;This continues until a player has to return at least 1 meeple to their supply, or none of the players have been affected. Now, place the land tile according to the usual rules and continue your turn.&#10;&#10;Note! Only players, who have to check their meeples during the peasant revolt, score points for their protected meeples. Players who are not hit by the peasant revolt cannot score any points for protected meeples.&#10;&#10;Example 2: You draw a land tile with the peasant revolt symbol for cities (symbol enlarged in this example). All of your meeples in cities are protected and you score 4 points.&#10;The peasant revolt moves on to Blue. Blue is sitting to your left, and continues to check, if and how the peasant revolt affects them. Blue has 1 protected meeple in the city on the left, which scores 2 points. The unprotected meeples have to be returned into Blue&rsquo;s supply. That is how the revolt ends and you place the land tile according to the usual rules and continue your turn.&#10;2. Placing a meeple&#10;Protecting a meeple from a peasant revolt&#10;&#10;If you place a meeple on the tile just placed, you may also protect this very meeple, for the cost of 4 points. To do so, move your meeple on the score board back by 4 spaces. It is possible to score negative points. Next, &ldquo;lay down&rdquo; this meeple. This meeple has now joined the farmers. [2]&#10;&#10;Example: Protecting a meeple&#10;Each time you do not place a meeple on the tile you just have placed, [3] you may protect one of your meeples standing on tiles for the cost of 2 points.&#10;&#10;Farmers cannot be protected. They are never affected by peasant revolts.&#10;&#10;A meeple &ldquo;lying down&rdquo; is protected from a peasant revolt. In case the revolt affects you, you score 2 points for each protected meeple in an affected feature (see 1. Placing a tile).&#10;&#10;3. Scoring a feature&#10;When scoring a feature, a protected meeple is treated like a normal meeple. It is returned into your supply after the feature has been scored. After that, it loses its protection from peasant revolts. This means, that if you place that meeple again, it is unprotected once again.&#10;&#10;Example: The city has been completed. You have the majority of meeples (2 in this case) and score 10 points.&#10;Blue does not score any points. Return all meeples from the city back into your supplies and place them upright. They are now unprotected once more.&#10;Final scoring&#10;Final scoring is performed according to use usual rules. When scoring a feature, a protected meeple is treated like a normal meeple.&#10;&#10;",

Eventually, as spaces get quarantined, players are forced into the Bunker for the Lockdown Round.&#10;&#10;At any point in the game if any one player dies from too much virus the game ends. You have to work together to stay alive, while also trying to get the most resources. Once the game ends players count their resources to win &quot;Trophies.&quot; Trophies can be won for things like holding the most stock, the most toilet paper, AND (of course) a &quot;Participation Trophy&quot; for the individual who loses so - trophies for everyone!&#10;&#10;The player with the most trophies wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This is the only reliable way to keep getting cards.&#10;&#10;All cards have their own unique stats and a variety of Effects, which twist the rules and vary wildly in power &amp; utility.&#10;&#10;Because of the sheer number of cards in this first Deck, you may very well play half a dozen games of BBT before you see all of the unique, comical, and wonderfully surreal characters that we've packed into this first installment.&#10;&#10;- The Details -&#10;&#10;Recommended game size: 2-6 players&#10;BBT is really designed for groups of 3 or more players, but does work with two players. More than 6 players can play BBT at a time, but game time will be longer as a result.&#10;&#10;Avg. Game Length: 5-20 minutes&#10;&#10;Ages 12+&#10;&#10;- The Makers -&#10;&#10;BBT is a labor-of-love project by Clown Car Entertainment, a small group of artists and creators centered in Pittsburgh, PA.&#10;&#10;The game was first created in fall of 2016 when the makers were in college, and quickly won the hearts of their peers who played it between classes and during get-togethers. We're eternally grateful for all of the support they gave us; it helped us turn sketches on index cards into a fully fledged game project that anyone can play.&#10;&#10;",

You can read (relive) people's stories , record their abilities, and find out  enemy weaknesses.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is focused on strategic, ability based combat and exploring. Each ability belongs to a particular weapon master and class, with specific actions. This gives you a wide range of opportunities to create a character with the desired synergy. Part of our game art is shown in a comic book called the Memory Book. It charters the history of important characters in an uncensored,,18+ comic book format.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;If you take our game monsters and bosses lightly, you are likely to get killed mercilessly. Exploit their weaknesses as this will help you win. At the beginning of the game, each player names their Knight and chooses 5 starting abilities. Before entering battle, select 3 of the 5 ability cards and utilize them to transform your Damned Sword.  With up to 20+ sub-action cards, you can flexibly tailor your attacks to deal with your immediate foes!. Explore our dark fantasy world and encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviors. Killing monsters grants you the game's currency, Karma. Karma can be used to record abilities, purchase items, and level up characters. Leveling up your characters gives them more capacity to record abilities and creates more synergies with your ability cards.&#10;&#10;Plot&#10;Fallen Knights were created by the Gods to acquire and relive lost memories, though the Gods decided where they went and what they did. The lost memories recovered by the Fallen Knights never lasted long since every time they returned them to the Gods, they were reborn with no memories. This was a never-ending nightmare, a hellish cycle with no escape..&#10;Now, the Gods are gone, the curse is broken, and every memory is available to Fallen Knights.. However, the memories are vague and unclear - like bad dreams - so it&rsquo;s time to set out. Fallen Knights must forge their own path!&#10;&#10;What about the Damned Sword of Fallen Knights?&#10;If the corpse of a vanquished foe contains blood and flesh, the Damned Sword can be used directly to read memories. If the foe is long dead, and only the skeleton remains, then a sacred fire is required to harvest memories. Further still, players can use various abilities to turn their Damned Sword into weapons such as a bow, dagger, and even a Great Sword!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Tierra Feudal (Feudal Land) is a card game where we represent the leader of a noble house from medieval Europe. We are on a mission to develop our fiefdom better than anyone else through the recruitment of new vassals, the construction of buildings, the establishment of production improvements and, of course, the growth of our military defenses.&#10;&#10;Starting from a few cards, we will have to manage the production of resources to be able to get better characters, buildings and nobles from the market that allow us to make more efficient and productive combinations of cards. We will have to carefully plan our acquisitions since the lack of chance in the game will place almost all the responsibility of defeat or victory on our decisions.&#10;&#10;After the construction of a certain amount of buildings the game will end. The military and economic power, the productive capacities, the power of the church and the nobles under our vassalage will determine the victory points that we get and the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each perforated plate has nine holes so that you can see whether a hole in the game board is filled with a marble, but only one or two holes per plate are large enough for a marble to pass through. (These holes are marked as such on the plates.)&#10;&#10;On a turn, you push the fifth plate onto the game board, displacing one of the plates already there, then you insert one of your marbles into an unoccupied hollow of the game board. Players alternate turns until one of them forms a row of four marbles and wins. Note that if you cannot insert a marble into an empty space on the game board, you lose instantly.&#10;&#10;",

B is alarmed, even more so by A's calm response.&#10;&#10;During the game, the players converse, trying to get information to undercover the truth. The game has three main endings that can be reached, but the players each have secrets (hidden through QR codes), so the players cannot be sure how the game will end. This gives the game much replay ability, even if they do reach an ending.&#10;&#10;Players get information from cards in the game, dependent on where they are in the room, or from keywords appearing in the talking. The players are allowed to reveal information, or hide, or even lie if they wish. The game may unfold as the players wish, or they be disturbed by the secrets revealed (the game is aimed at older players). Playing out the roles in different ways may make the endings change too.&#10;&#10;Players will need access to some digital device to examine the QR codes in the game.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The game title translates more literally as Theory Of The Moving Heavens. Geocentric Theory (often simplified as Ptolemaic Theory) puts the Earth at the centre of the Universe.&#10;&#10;The players sail their ships on the oceans, searching for the treasure island of the Pirate King. But if they sail too close to the edge of the world, over they go!&#10;&#10;The game includes an Armillary sphere to help the players navigate. There is a day phase and  a night phase. During the day, the navigator reads the winds and the waves, and at night, the stars. When an undiscovered island is found, players can search for clues to the location of the gold and silver treasures.&#10;&#10;As well as the 20cm tall sphere, the game also has the sea in a box. When it is not their turn, a player moves the box around to bring the sound of the sea alive.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Oddia is a contraction for &quot;Odd and Diagonal.&quot;  It means that when a player gets an odd number, they should move their token diagonally (except when the token in in a corner square.)&#10;&#10;The object of Oddia is to gain the highest points by moving the tokens to reach the Target.  Each token reaching the target will get one point.&#10;&#10;Game Setup&#10;The game board consists of 36 squares along the sides of the board making up the game zone.  The middle part of the board with diagonal lines (squares) only function as a passage and tokens cannot stop on it.  Start is on one corner and 19 which is the Target is on the opposite corner.&#10;&#10;Players take multiple sets of 10 tokens in their color depending on how many players are playing (2 players = 6 sets, 3 players = 4 sets, 4 players 3 sets.)  The tokens are numbered 1-10 in each set.&#10;&#10;The game starts with setting up the board for the first 12 turns.  Players take turns putting their &quot;1&quot; tokens on start, rolling one die (for the 1st 6 turns, 2 dice after that) and moving forward.  Play moves counter-clockwise around the board.  When moving diagonal, play moves clockwise.&#10;&#10;If they land on another player the player sitting on that square is bumped diagonally across the board. If a player lands on a player in corner square, the player sitting in that corner square is bumped on backward.  As more tokens are placed on the board multiple chain-reactions can take place, bumping multiple players to new spaces.  After 12 &quot;1&quot; tokens have been played on the board the game is ready to start.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;During game play only 12 tokens are allowed on the board.  Tokens can be replaced with higher numbered tokens.&#10;&#10;During game play you choose which one token you wish to move.  Once a token reaches the Target (19 space) they replace their token with the next higher number token which gets placed on start and if the dice number is higher than the number needed to reach the Target then the upgraded token moves the additional spaces from the Start space.&#10;&#10;The game continues until on person reaches the target with their number 10 token.  Their points for that token will be 11.  All players then count the number of all their tokens on the board and the player with the highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;",

Waking nightmares spread across every land, promising a deathly face or the terror of oblivion. Traders and explorers carried ominous accounts through Realmgates only to find those on the other side bore disturbing stories of their own. This period became known as the Time of Tribulation, and it was well-named.&#10;&#10;Malign Portents is an 80-page hardback book containing background and rules which catapult the mortal realms into a time of grim uncertainty, as Nagash begins an aeons-long grand plan to assert his power over the dead, spreading the necrotic influence of Shyish over every realm. Of course, the visions of disaster this plan is causing have not gone unnoticed &ndash; Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, Slaanesh, the Horned Rat and Sigmar himself are affected by these portents, and every faction in the mortal realms is moving against the undead hordes of Nagash.&#10;&#10;",
