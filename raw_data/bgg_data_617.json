    "Description": "There&rsquo;s a new mayor in town! And he&rsquo;s here to change things!&#10;On the order of the day: Privatise transports.&#10;He put together a team to redesign the city&rsquo;s main lanes, and he now needs enterprising volunteers to achieve it. &#10;And they only got 4 years to do it!&#10;&#10;Each player will represent the CEO of a Private Mass Transport company, trying to achieve high value for their shares in the stock market, and a healthy bank account. The City needs a new transport grid, either with Bus or Metro Lines.&#10;The players will achieve that by building segments of Transport Lines connecting the objectives as dictated by public surveys. Also, the City Hall will come up with special projects, which will be bided by the players.&#10;The game turns are split into Quarters (3 months), in which everyone does their actions. After all players had a turn, the Quarter advances, players receive profit (or not!), and the first player of the Quarter changes (so that everyone can have a quarter in which they are the first to build).&#10;After all Quarters are done, the Year advances and players tally up their accomplishments that year, which will directly impact their Stock Market EOY results.&#10;By the end of the fourth year, the city should be fully networked, and we&rsquo;ll have a happy Mayor, ready to win the next elections. The player that had the most impact (somehow measured by the value of the shares), will be given the key to the city!&#10;&#10;That easy?&#10;Not really. Not everything goes as planned, strange events occur, people lie, politicians cheat&hellip;. &#10;At the beginning of every quarter something will happen that can change a smile into a frown. Or the other way around&hellip; &#10;And there&rsquo;s also the Influence that such powerful transport tycoons (the players) will have on politics!&#10;&#10;Who knows, sometime in four years, you might be the one smiling in front of the cameras holding a golden key to the city!&#10;Or you could be the one already planning for revenge&hellip;&#10;&#10;Either way, fun is coming your way!&#10;&#10;",

This could lead to surprising events : try to imagine a morning activity involving &quot;Foam Bath&quot; AND &quot;Practical Joke&quot; AND &quot;Shared Secret&quot;&hellip;&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the other players can play &quot;Awful Time&quot; cards to spoil their opponent's good time, as long as they manage to have it make sense with the story. The active player may then defend himself with a special card (&quot;Magical Moment&quot;, &quot;Wish Come True&quot; or &quot;Heroic Action&quot;), or even deflect the trouble back with &quot;Revenge&quot;.&#10;&#10;And if you can't live awesome times on your own, you can always crash other players' events !&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player who plays a set of cards for each of the 4 times of the day : morning, afternoon, evening and night.&#10;&#10;The game contains 65 &quot;Awesome Times&quot;, 18 &quot;Aweful Times&quot;, 6 different &quot;Magical Times&quot; and a few special cards.&#10;&#10;(Translations of card names in this description are not official)&#10;&#10;",

The value of each attribute is randomly determined by rolling a die at the start of the game, with each civilization receiving a second cumulative die roll for a specified attribute in which that civilization excelled.&#10;&#10;The gameplay involves drawing and trading cards in order to play melds. Playing a meld adds to a player's victory point total and increases the value of an attribute of the player's civilization. Playing a meld also conveys a specific bonus (such as stealing cards or victory points from other players) depending on the type of meld played. The winner is the player with the most victory points after twelve rounds have been played.&#10;&#10;This free, online rules set describes the components that you will need to create in order to play. The components include a custom card deck made up of twelve types of cards with nine copies of each card. Six-sided dice are also required for play.&#10;&#10;",

The players build rail connections by drawing lines between the cities. Building rail lines is one of the means of acquiring Victory Points. Additional Victory Points are scored when the player duplicates the circuit covered by historical rail lines.&#10;&#10;The game adds additional flavor to this basic framework through the Income, Research, and Stock Points tracked for each player's railway. A series of Events can affect these point values as well, based on historical events that influenced nineteenth rail travel in the United States.&#10;&#10;The Income, Research, and Stock Point values also serve to increase a player's Victory Point total. Victory Points can also be scored based on the type of commodities produced in the cities connected to a player's rail lines.&#10;&#10;Materials required for play: Two pens with different colored ink, a coin, a printout of the game map, and a copy of the scoring tables.&#10;&#10;",

All pieces must move and/or capture following the pattern on the board.&#10;&#10;Board&#10;The expanded Alquerque board consist of an Alquerque board and a triangular patterned board attached on one of its side. The sheeps or goats can also win the game by occupying every spaces on this triangle.&#10;There are different triangular patterned board designs attached to the Alquerque board, and therefore Komikan has several variants. The standard triangular board has one horizontal line across the breadth of the triangle, and one vertical line along the length of the triangle.&#10;&#10;According to Wikipedia, &quot;Komikan may actually be the same game as Adugo.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Please note how the persons and bikes are introduced on the box lid. (K&auml;rnan is however the manufacturer of the game.) In the years between 1945 and around 1960 (when the automobile become common) the moped and bicycle markets in Sweden was heated with fierce competition between Monark, Nymans, Husqvarna and other manufacturers. Monark would eventually &quot;win the race&quot; and swallow the closest competitors, first Nymans and then in 1962 Husqvarna's divisions for bicycles, mopeds and boat engines.&#10;&#10;",

A player in his turn takes any face-down card from the square, adds it to his hand, and fill the gap with any card from his hand face up.&#10;&#10;When all the cards in the square are face up, the value of the square counted according to the Poker combinations in the rows and columns. Then each player chooses five cards from his hand; the player with the best Poker combination scores twice the value of the square, the player with the worst Poker combination scores the value of the square.&#10;&#10;",

In Phase 1 you both try to improve your hands by bidding for new cards from the stock. When none remain in stock, you score for any melds (card combinations) contained in your revised hands. This phase is rather like Gops.&#10;&#10;2. Tricks. In Phase 2 you play out your revised hands to 13 tricks, aiming especially to win an odd number of tricks (1, 3, 5 etc). This phase is rather like Piquet.&#10;&#10;3. Play-off. Finally, you each pick up as a new hand the 13 cards you used for bidding in the first phase, and aim to be the first to play out all the cards from your hand. This phase is rather like Arsehole / President / Trouduc.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played against a backdrop of unknown political and military events over which the players have no control, but to which they must react. Players maneuver their divisions, brigade and regiments across a map with 15 kms per hex during turns representing 48 hour. An innovative game system represents each subordinate commander's headquarters and support assets.

Acquire wealth, speculating on Semuta Drug and Pundi Rice prices in the CHOAM. Plan hostile actions against rivals, under the limitations of the Great Convention.&quot;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&quot;The game is conducted on 3 boards: on the LANDSRAAD board you can plan political actions; on the CHOAM board you can trade resources for SOLARI (the Imperium currency); on the KANLY board you can plan assassinations, sabotage actions, or even full-scale wars.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tokens represent commodities (SPICE MELANGE, HAGAL QUARTZ, etc.), or SOLARI (the Imperium currency). Also, there are tokens to represent three NOBLES for each Noble House, and for their soldiers (TROOPERS, SABOTEURS and ASSASSINS). Also there are tokens to represent the special ADVISORS (Mentat or Bene Gesserit) which you could be provided if you met the Emperor's favour.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Cards represent useful situations which could help you during your quest for power. The most powerful ones are you cannot obtain by chance: they are PETITIONS to the Padishah Emperor which he has graciously agreed to concede (or, sometimes, not to concede). Less powerful situations are just acts of FATE.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gameplay summary:&#10;&#10;&quot;Each player will represent a Noble House and will be given three NOBLE tokens: he will use those tokens to attempt actions in each turn. Actions could be political (LANDSRAAD board), trade (CHOAM board) or hostile (KANLY board): to represent that a player is attempting an action, he will put one of his NOBLE in the appropriate slot on the appropriate board. The number of action a player could do in a turn will be therefore generally limited by the NOBLE tokens he has, even if it will be possible to increase it by mean of ADVISORS.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Each turn is divided in three phases: LANDSRAAD, CHOAM and KANLY; each to be played on the appropriate board.&quot;&#10;&#10;Victory:&#10;&#10;&quot;When a player will draw the End Game Fate Card, he will immediately show it, and the game will end.

Want to Create an Evil Empire, bringing Chaos, Death and Destruction? Want to Bash pitiful, useless Heroes? Welcome to the Unofficial Dungeon Keeper Card Game.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You've got lands (Rooms). You've got Creatures. You've got 20 LifePoints. Just like in magic. Different Rooms are needed to Summon more Creatures, or to research Spells or to build Artifacts, and in general to be more Powerful.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But there's come the fun part. Creatures can't be anywhere: they must be In a Room. To represent this, you need to put your Creatures near the Rooms they're in. A creature in a Room can defend it, but cannot defend a different Room . . . So be wary not to expand your Dungeon too much, or you will be unable to defend it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A Creature in a Room can also use the Room. So, for example, your Warlock in your Library will be able to research a Spell (or to defend the Library). If you want him to defend the Lair, instead, you can move him in the Lair (in the appropriate Turn Phase), but then he will be unable to research a Spell (as he need to be in the Library to do so).&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You can win in two ways: 1) Kill the Avatar when he's attacking your Dungeon (The World Will Be Mine! Victory), 2) Kill the other Dark Lord (BWHAHA ! Victory).&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to amass the greatest wealth through property ownership. Players first compete in an auction to purchase options on the various properties. An option gives a player the right to purchase a property, if they can mameuver the token around the board to their property. Since all players maneuver the same token, each player can try to prevent the other players from exercising their options. A player receives from the bank when he moves the token over one of their own properties, and receives from the other players when they move the token over one of his properties. At the end of the game, the player with the greatest amount of money plus property value is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last option is exercised. Any player may exercise the last option, regardless of who holds the option.&#10;&#10;",
