The Technoids, as suggested by their name, use technology, while the Warlocks use magic.&#10;&#10;The basic system is not especially complicated but there is a fair amount of chrome. For example, the Warlock player receives magic points which can be used to build new units and create effects (such as moving a star system). The Technoid player can't create new units but can scavenge the wrecks of old ones.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the Warlock player chooses an alien race to play (some of which have special powers) and chooses a home system and colonies, along with a decoy race; all of this information is kept secret. The object of the game for the Technoid player is to find and destroy the Warlocks' systems.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Warriors of the Dark Star: The Age of the Neutron Wars.&#10;&#10;",

Most often, they will place both in an empty space on the board, subject only to the restriction that they may not create a connected region of a single color containing two or more tiles showing the same number.  Alternatively, a player may remove one color chip from the game, and place their number tile face down on an empty space, preventing it from being part of any colored region.  At the end of the game, every connected region has at most one number tile correctly describing the number of color chips composing that region:  the owner of each such number tile scores its face value in points.&#10;&#10;(description provided by designer)&#10;&#10;",

Corners count as part of both edges. Each player's objective is to connect their two goal edges with an unbroken chain of their stones. White (O) stones may use both orthogonal and diagonal connections to complete their chain, while black (+) stones may only use orthogonal connections. However, black places three stones on each of their turns, while white places only two.  White moves first, then turns alternate. If there are not enough spaces remaining to place all of a player's stones for their turn, place as many as possible. Play ends when the victorious player completes a valid connection.  Draws should not occur.&#10;&#10;Any serious two-player abstract requires a great many playtests before being deemed 'unbreakable', so I consider this to be a beta version.  Though its name (and possibly some minor points of the rules) are still subject to change, please feel free to implement it for online/AI play (given proper attribution).&#10;&#10;",

For reasons better explained in the movie, you have been ordered to conquer the people of the planet Earth. As Supreme Commander of the Terrestrial Invasion Forces, can YOU conquer the capitals of EARTH and return to your Homeworld in VICTORY?&#10;&#10;Alien: Invasion Risk (AIR) is a print-and-play solitaire game that began as a set of &quot;variant&quot; rules designed to be used with components from the board game Risk. AIR now has its own set of custom print-and-play components and fully-revised rules, transforming it from a variant to a stand-alone game.&#10;&#10;Excerpt from the PDF rules:&#10;&#10;Be warned &ndash; this is &quot;thematic&quot; solo gaming. Expect to plot your strategy, roll lots of dice, and ride the wave of your luck only to be ripped from the jaws of victory in the most sudden, arbitrary and unexpected way &ndash; all in furtherance of the epic unfolding story of an oddball alien race.&#10;&#10;If you enjoy a game that focuses on the narrative and takes you on an interesting ride, then AIR is for you. On the other hand, if you prefer a solo game that will always reward your perfect &quot;armchair general&quot; strategy - you&rsquo;ll just have to cheat!&#10;&#10;",

Count Dracula, lord of corruption, master of the undead, and monarch of all vampires, is about to act on his long-contemplated plan for world domination.&#10;&#10;Abraham Van Helsing, and his loyal vampire hunter companions, must battle against all manner of horror to save the people of Klausenberg and march upon Castle Dracula. Once inside, can they fend off the three bloodthirsty Brides, in order to infiltrate Dracula's secret tomb, deep within the walls of the ancient castle, and ultimately defeat the dreaded Prince of Darkness?&#10;&#10;Consisting of one 90-card deck, the game pits four to eight players against each other. One team takes on the role of Van Helsing, assorted pitchfork-waving villagers, god-fearing priests, and various stalwart companions, and the other team assumes control of Dracula, the Brides, the Hound of Dracula, and numerous hissing, bloodsucking vampires. Each player must manage his hand of cards effectively to win. Gameplay is swift and slaughterous, with vampires staked, maidens drained, holy water administered, vampiric teeth exposed, and crucifixes brandished, frequently.&#10;&#10;",

It relies on extensive consumer research, and gives Players a good idea of how specific groups of Americans react to Critical Decisions. This is the informational Version of the game.&#10;&#10;B)The second Version, Version B, can also be played by 2 or more Players. It asks particular players how they would react to Critical Decisions. It provides a friendly opportunity to explore the philosophies of your friends and acquaintances. This Version is played best with people who already know each other, or who want to know each other better. It's the personal Version of the game.&#10;&#10;C) The third Version, Version C, is complicated analysis of group reactions. It should only be played by odd numbers of people. For those seeking just a little relaxation and interaction, it's a headache. For the hardcore cerebral types, it presents an unusual challenge.&#10;&#10;",

They were here when our mighty forces came, this planet that was ours by right. They fought us till they were no more, ground to dust by our stark fists of destiny. We remember though, we remember them by playing this simple game. We remember how cheaply they sold their last moments, how easily they were led to the slaughter with mere promises. We remember the last of them, the very last, for that was our promise....that the last sneak standing would find a place in our history. So now remember...&quot;&#10;&#10;The Battle Of The Stark Fist on July 5th  was brutal, short and final. What remained of Humanity was marched off to a barren expanse of wreckage known as Camp Apocalypse.  As the leader of one of the last remaining factions your goal is to keep your people alive as long as you can how ever you can in hope that something or someone might come along to save you from total destruction.&#10;&#10;Your first job is to secure your followers a place to survive. With limited space you plot and plan with the other faction leaders to carve out your new home.&#10;&#10;Your next job is to survive each day. The one certainty is that  when the sun sets another part of Camp Apocalypse will be destroyed by the malevolent Stark Fist. In the morning will need to bargain with what resources you have, including the lives your your followers, to find out what part of the Camp is going to be destroyed. The afternoon is spent moving your followers around the Camp to avoid the coming nights destruction, hopefully with the knowledge of  where the destruction is going to happen. After the bombs fall you will need to spend the evening hours caring for those who survived. If you can not supply them with food and shelter they will perish in the harsh night.&#10;&#10;Each day goes as the one before and and your goal becomes ever more important...to have your faction be the last of Humanity.&#10;&#10;Game Flow&#10;-Setup Up Phase- Camp Apocalypse&#10;-Main Phase - It Was The Best Of Times It Was The Last Of Times&#10;--- 1.

Players assume the role of alien species competing to abduct and control Earthlings. Cards represent Earthlings (human and otherwise). Cards in a player's hand are Earthlings that have been previously abducted, and can now be activated by their alien overlords to do nefarious tasks - most frequently abducting more Earthlings. Cards face-down at various locations on the table represent Earthlings to be abducted. The face-down stacks at each location are built up by players during the course of the game; thus each player potentially has some knowledge about what types of Earthlings are at each location, which is where memory becomes involved.&#10;&#10;Players move their spaceship tokens from location to location, abducting Earthlings (moving some of the face-down cards away from the location), and then fly back to their homeworlds to score them. Some Earthlings cause trouble when they are abducted (damaging the spaceship), while other may offer benefits while they are aboard. Players can also directly and indirectly attack other players' spaceships, to either prevent them from completing their abduction goals or sometimes to steal dangerous Earthlings without suffering the consequences.&#10;&#10;Players win by successfully abducting 10 Earthlings and returning them to their homeworld. Each player also has a secret objective which allows them to win with a smaller number of Earthlings, such as six of the same species or 7 of the same gender.&#10;&#10;Earthling Abductor: Deluxe Edition contains 68 Earthling cards, 7 Alien races, and 6 plastic space-ships. It supports 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;Earthling Abductor also comes in a non-Deluxe edition, in a smaller box containing 44 Earthling cards, 4 Alien races, and 4 plastic space-ships. It supports 2 players. The two versions are otherwise identical.&#10;&#10;",

Matches are then played out with two dice rolls per team per half, making it easy to generate half time scores for the full week&rsquo;s fixture list before progressing to the second half of each match, if you wish.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Championship Rugby&rdquo; generates a statistically accurate campaign, whilst still maintaining that unpredictable aspect of sport.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "They said hello by destroying the moon. Tides ceased to exists and wave after wave of dead fish washed up on shores the world over. You will never know the pleasure of walking in the surf during a lazy summer vacation, bug. I'm so sorry for that. &#10;&#10;In the midst of the panic over the moon they appeared. We tried to fight back but they destroyed our biggest weapons in their silos. Governments and world leaders responded in different ways. Some gave up instantly, and others resisted. The beach, bug, remember what I told you about that? It used to be a lot farther away, but that was before they made an example of it. All in all, it was a hell of a way to find out that we were not alone.&#10;&#10;That was about 15 years ago. Since then, we've had some victories, but far too many failures. The biggest op your daddy was involved in was faking the crash on Mars a few years back. See, bug, we WANTED that ship to take heavy fire and crash, right where it did. There were enough diggers aboard to set up the underground Mars base. Last time daddy was there he got to see a new weapon, based on their tech. Hopefully we can have it ready soon.&#10;&#10;This is why I have to go, bug. Mars needs people like me to sneak in, hide in the Moon belt, deliver supplies and workers, and get back home without being seen. And I promise you that one day I will take you to see the rings of Saturn, when we can fly throughout the system safely and freely. It'll be just you and me. I should be back soon. I will miss my little bug, bunches and bunches! Daddy will always l-&#10;&#10;END TRANSMISSION&#10;&#10;In SNEAK, players take on the role of heroic smugglers looking to transport supplies up to the secret Resistance base on Mars.  On each turn, you will have an amount of energy (action points) that you can use to maneuver and move your ship around the board.  However, any leftover energy is converted in cargo cards, that you draw into hand.  Asteroids will then semi-randomly move around the board, blocking your way or revealing your hiding space.  Then, the aliens will move and attempt to destroy you.  Each time you get hit by an alien you will have to lose cargo cards- or else you will have to start your smuggling run again.  Upon a successful run, you will score notoriety points based on the cargo you brought and can spend it to increase your maximum energy, maximum cargo (hand size), and number of special powers (mods), or to buy new mods.&#10;The most notorious smuggler at the end of 10 rounds is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Psephology uses compilations of precinct voting returns for elections going back some years, public opinion polls, campaign finance information and similar statistical data.

In Britain the term occasionally appears in scholarly literature.&#10;&#10;The game has 625 cards containing 2500 questions and answers, Power Politics cards, game pieces, dice, a game board and vote cards.&#10;&#10;Roll the dice, decide how to move your marker, read the vote bonus/penalty on the board and then attempt to correctly answer a political question to win votes.&#10;&#10;Includes rules for 7-12 players and classroom team play, including a timed version.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Triplets is a game where players attempt to form patterns using the symbols on hexagonal tiles.&#10;&#10;Each tile has one, two, or three symbols in one of three different colors and one of three different shapes.  A triplet is formed with three tiles where each attribute is either all the same or all different.&#10;&#10;The tiles must be played in a way that forms a honeycomb lattice of overlapping rings.  To score a triplet, the three tiles must be on a single ring of hexagons, and each triplet is scored by placing a marker in the open center of the ring.  Multiple triplets can be formed on a single ring, and each tile is part of three rings, allowing for multiple scoring opportunities on each turn.  The player scoring the most triplets wins the game.&#10;&#10;Triplets is a game that will twist your brain, but stretch your visual perception and pattern matching skills at the same time.&#10;&#10;Triplets won the 2010 KublaCon Game Design Contest.&#10;&#10;",

The most unusual element of the game is that it takes place on two maps, a small map for campaign operations and a large map showing just the fortifications around Vicksburg. Units are presumably supposed to move between the two, but the rules are not entirely clear.&#10;&#10;",

The Macedonial cavalry and phalanx crossed the river under Persian arrows and made the Persian king and all his army flee.&#10;&#10;This game is for 2-6 players. The enemy armies led by the players meet near the bay of Issa, in the valley of the Pinar river.
