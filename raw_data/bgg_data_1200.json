The game is quick to learn, a blend of strategy and hand management, and it all fits in one little box.&#10;&#10;Each copy of Fray comes with:&#10;&#10;30 playable cards&mdash;featuring the Dwarvish, Duanine, and Bjorn suits.&#10;8 instructional cards&mdash;a set for each player.&#10;1 placement card&mdash;to establish the 3x3 grid battlefield before the game begins.&#10;&#10;When playing, unit placement is one of the most important aspects in a game of Fray. Consider not just which unit card you'll play, but also where on the battlefield you&rsquo;ll place it! You have a limited number of units and if you&rsquo;re not careful, your opponent may be able to turn your units against you. Luckily, you can do the same to them!&#10;&#10;Rounds take on average just 5-10 minutes once you've learned the rules, and the game is easy to both set up and pack away.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These are randomly generated prior to the game and come complete with twists and turns to make every gaming experience unique.  In addition, the rules have campaign rules for linking game results together into a larger campaign.&#10;&#10;Rampant Swords is ideal for experienced gamers and new players getting their feet wet.  Speed and ease of play were the priorities in the design process without sacrificing decision making.  &#10;In Rampant Swords models do not always perform exactly as intended so the &quot;Friction of War&quot; will force players to react accordingly.&#10;&#10;Enjoy your Fantasy adventures with Rampant Swords!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Twilight of the Soldier Kings rules is a set designed to fight large historical battles on a reasonable sized table and with a reasonable number of figures in the era of Fredereick the Great (1730 to 1770). The player is the army commander seeking to marshal the full forces that their historical counterpart had to achieve victory and not some colonel or brigadier controlling a few battalions or squadrons in the fight for some sector of a battlefield. The concentration is on the 'big picture' rather on relatively unimportant details. The rules reward historic tactics and practices while making typical 'gamer' tactics obsolete. So, players will want their forces to be in at least two lines with a reserve and not strung out in a line as is commonly done in other rules.&#10;&#10;The system is intuitive and easy to pick up. The units are around 2,500 infantry, around 1,200 cavalry and 12 to 20 guns and so the units are often a brigade of around 4 infantry battalions or 8 to 12 cavalry squadrons. The scale is flexible with all distances, ranges, movements based on half of the frontage of the units you use. For example, if your units have a frontage of perhaps 100mm (4 inches) the standard measurement unit in the game will be 50mm (2 inches). There is no figure removal so you can base you units as you wish, with any number or size of figures on a base, etc. As long as the units are the same frontage it does not matter and indeed neither does it if the armies involved are based differently.&#10;&#10;While any unit size can be used if the frontage of a unit is in the region of 120mm then most battles can be fought on a table 1.8m by 1.2m (6 feet by 4 feet) or similar. Most standard battles should be playable in a typical afternoon or evening playing session. It is possible to play 'Manoeuvre' battles in which the attacker has extra options to attack but will usually require a larger table. In a standard battle the armies are on table in their half of the table and generally facing up to each other. While in a manoeuvre battle the defending army is in active and placed in the centre of the table with a wide area empty of troops around them. The attacking army can then attempt to march around the defending army to attack from one or more different directions. Alternatively the attacking army can arrive on table in sections from all edges of the table in a converging attack. Of course these manoeuvres might not work or can be delayed or the inactive defenders can activate and react to the situation.&#10;&#10;The rules include scenarios for the battles of Mollwitz (1741), Kolin (1757), Krefeld (1758) and a generic Manoeuvre battle based on the battles of Hochkirch and Zorndorf (both 1758).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

More than three hundred years after the dust of battle has settled, once again the New Model Army faces Newcastle's Whitecoats across a low  valley.

Gruff is a tactical combat card game where players duel to the death with custom teams of Mutated Monster Goats! Gruff features unique positional and timing mechanics that create a constant state of attack and counter-play.&#10;&#10;Gruff: Whispers of Madness is a stand-alone game that is fully compatible with the Gruff rules system and other Gruff games. Whispers of Madness provides the same visceral competitive experience as Gruff, but adds a new mechanic to the game, Sanity and Madness!&#10;&#10;A Brutally Competitive Game- Whispers of Madness' combat mechanics create a constant state of counter-play. When an enemy attacks, you have your entire turn to dodge out of the way, mount your defenses, and launch a counterattack before the attack connects!&#10;&#10;A Challenging Single Player Game- In Whispers of Madness you will be able to battle solo against the trolls that we unlock as stretch-goals in the campaign. Each troll is a distinct challenge ranging from fairly simple to extremely challenging!&#10;&#10;An Awesome Co-Op Game- Players can collaborate with each other to take down the trolls that we unlock during the campaign!  Play cards to support your teammate on their turn so that you both can taste the sweetness of victory together!&#10;&#10;A Fantastic Multiplayer Game- Whispers of Madness can support a four-player tournament out of a single box! It also allows for three- and four-player free-for-all matches and a two-vs.-two mode!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Several bases would make up a regiment unit depending on the regiments size. Base Widths (BW) are used also in the game for movement and range distances. Where players wish to use figures instead of the bases. If that is the case, then for distances use an inch instead of a base width. Calculate dice on number of figures in the front rank instead of the number of bases. For 15mm a base would be around 40mm and in 25/28mm a base width would be around 60mm.&#10;&#10;To play the games all you need are six-sided dice (D6), your own models based in a common way between the two forces, terrain to represent the landscape of your battlefield and a ruler.&#10;&#10;",

Each player with their Knights must perform actions with them depending on the resources obtained in their resource pool (in this case called energies that can be of 4 types: Combat, Diplomacy, Exploration and Teson) that are going to determine what types of actions you can Perform each turn. The actions available are numerous: battle enemies, explore places, enliven diplomatic relations, rescue ladies, participate in tournaments, all this to be the player with the most Honor (PV) that he obtains at the end of the game. But all this in addition cooperating with the opponents so that the enemies of the kingdom do not destroy it using a Damage Table that if it reaches the maximum all players will lose, thus adding a little cooperation to the competition.&#10;Unfold your board and create your deck.

    "Description": "A Hot Dry Season: Operation Attleboro in War Zone C (AHDS) is an operational-level game dealing with the National Liberation Front (NLF) Dry Season Offensive in the III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ) in November 1966 and the subsequent counterattack by forces under the command of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV).  From the designer&rsquo;s website:&#10;&#10;&quot;To Military Assistance Command-Vietnam (MACV), Operation Attleboro was a meeting engagement in War Zone C that grew into the largest operation involving US Forces conducted in South Vietnam at that time.  To the Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN), Operation Attleboro was unexpected early contact by a force attempting to conduct an offensive that snowballed into a desperate defense and fighting withdrawal to protect precious logistic and command capabilities essential to their future operations in III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ).&#10;&#10;MACV grossly underestimated the National Liberation Front&rsquo;s (NLF) capability to supply their own forces, tactically maneuver them, and evade detection in order to threaten US/Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) infrastructure and units when operating in close proximity to Peoples&rsquo; Liberation Forces of South Vietnam (PLAF &ndash; what are popularly known as &ldquo;Viet Cong Main Force&rdquo;) base areas in Cambodia.  COSVN grossly underestimated the US&rsquo;s capability to rapidly reinforce an area of operations using strategic mobility and rapidly employ such reinforcements almost immediately in the field.&#10;&#10;MACV underestimated the proclivity of COSVN to use PLAF forces confront and destroy threats to its logistics and supply system.  COSVN erroneously expected US Forces to respond to tactical and operational dilemmas like the ARVN.  To wit, responding to &ldquo;Ambush and Bait&rdquo; with dispersed pursuits of the ambushers on multiple axis, thus leaving some pursuing units vulnerable to destruction via &ldquo;One Slow, Four Quick&rdquo;.  Both sides were unaware of flaws and gaps in their respective intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, and the murky picture of active operations that would result from a clash of this magnitude, in the trying terrain of War Zone C.  Neither side gained any lasting advantage from Operation Attleboro, though both sides missed opportunities to secure them.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s scale is Company as the primary unit size, day turns and a mile per hex.  AHDS uses a concealed information/movement mechanism for NLF units and a limited information availability mechanism for both sides, and heavily emphasizes Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and their impact on revealing concealed/limited information units.  The game uses a movement point system and combat result table mechanisms fires, air defense fire and ground combat.  AHDS has an asymmetric component to its turns, as an Initiative player determines the order of resolution of Fires attacks and missions and then Operations (movement and combat).  Within Operations, interactivity and reactions to phasing player action; reaction moves and hasty attacks may be performed by the non-phasing player as the phasing player&rsquo;s turn is resolved.  Uncertainty is added to victory and even game end in the campaign by the use of Operational Guidance chits which are selected before set up &ndash; neither side may be exactly certain what the other&rsquo;s priorities are, which impacts victory conditions and player strategy as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;AHDS contains 7 scenarios: Introductory, Basic, and Intermediate, ranging from 3 to 10 game turns. The campaign is 25 turns long, but may, through Operational Guidance chit play referred to above, last 30 turns.&#10;&#10;AHDS is the first entry in a new series, Campaigns in Vietnam, which features a &ldquo;Ground-Up Build&rdquo; system.  While sharing core concepts and &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; in resolution of play and movement/combat mechanisms, each title is built from the &ldquo;Ground-Up&rdquo; allowing specific tailoring of concepts and rules mechanisms in an attempt to accurately evoke the very different Campaigns fought during the Vietnam War from 1965-1975 and faithfully incorporate the dynamic changes in force structure and composition, weapons and ISR capabilities, specific operational goals and difficulties, and terrain and regional variances unique to Vietnam and the Vietnam War.&#10;&#10;Basic Information&#10;Map Scale: 1 mile per Hex&#10;Unit Size: Companies&#10;Time Scale: One day per Turn.&#10;Players: 2&#10;Complexity: Medium-High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Play by Email Components: Vassal Module completed, available upon game release.&#10;&#10;Game Components and Specifications&#10;Game Map: 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;    &#10;Game Counters: 840 each .5&rdquo; Counters (Three Countersheets)&#10;Rulebook: 50 Pages (Color)&#10;Playbook: 50 Pages; contains Scenarios and Campaign, Examples of Play, Designers' Notes, Historical Notes and Tips on Play and Strategy (Color).&#10;Player Aids and Charts: 6 x Double-Sided (Color), 4 x Single Sided (color)&#10;Scenarios and Campaign: Seven Introductory, Basic and Intermediate Scenarios; One Campaign.&#10;Dice: One Ten-Sided Die and Two Six-Sided Dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Bagration - The Death of Army Group Center June-July 1944.&#10;&#10;From the back of the game:&#10;The Minsk-Moscow Highway, Belorussia, 23 June 1944:&#10;The 16th Guards Rifle Division was one of three heavily reinforced infantry divisions that were to create holes in the German lines and allow tank forces of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps of the 5th Tank Army to make rapid and deep penetrations along the Moscow-Minsk Highway. The zone of the 16th was south of the highway, and along the Smolensk-Minsk Railroad. They were reinforced with the following units: 148th Tank Regiment (PT mineroller tanks), 63rd Guards Heavy Tank Regiment (KVs), 517th Tank Regiment (FT tanks), elements of several Self-Propelled Artillery Regiments, 2nd Guards Assault Engineer-Sapper Brigade, as well as numerous towed artillery units. The Soviet forces trained as a combined arms team prior to the attack, and were well prepared. In most sectors of Army Group Center, the Germans had relatively thin lines, and most armor and heavy artillery was stripped to defend expected areas of attack. The area of the highway had seen much heavy fighting in the winter of 1943-44, and the Germans expected an attack to come in this direction. When German intelligence detected the buildup of artillery and armored forces, as well as the movement of ammunition, their reaction was to ensure forces in this area retained significant combat strength. The 78th Sturm Division, already the most powerful &lsquo;infantry&lsquo; division in Army Group Center, maintained its structure which included the 189th Assault Gun Battalion (StuG), a Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion (PzJgIII/IVs), 5th Nebelwerfer Battalion (120mm Mortars), and Army Antiaircraft Battalion 293 (mix of 88s/20s). These forces defended from probably the most dense network of mines, trenches, and bunkers in Army Group Center, including special rotating bunkers housing machine-guns.&#10;&#10;Onslaught to Orsha Contents:&#10;&#10;     32 scenarios&#10;     1 Campaign Game&#10;     2 SASL (Solitaire ASL) scenarios&#10;     370 full color 1/2&quot; counters&#10;     384 full color 5/8&quot; counters&#10;     3 HASL Mapsheets (2-22&quot;x27&quot;, 1-28&quot;x27&quot;) which combine to form a historical map of the Orsha Plain.&#10;     2 16&quot;x22&quot; doublewide mapboards DW-8, DW-9&#10;     Rules describing the aircraft, vehicles, guns, map terrain, and campaign game rules.&#10;     Player aids &#10;&#10;&#10;This expansion does not come in a box, the coversheets, maps, countersheets, and rules are packaged together in shrinkwrap.&#10;&#10;Ownership of the following is required to play all of the included scenarios:&#10;&#10;     BPF: Crucible of Steel, Into the Rubble 2, Poland in Flames&#10;     MMP: Beyond Valor, Solitaire ASL&#10;     Boards: 1,4,5,6,6a,8,9b,11,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,32,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,49,57,69,70,BFP A,BFP L,BFP P,BFP Q,BFP R.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

To play it is necessary to own a basic game. It is issued in the form of &ldquo;print and play&rdquo;, so you have to print and cut it first.&#10;&#10;The script is original, not an adaptation of a book, film, or comic. This is an amateur act, which is reflected primarily in the graphic aspect of the game, but it is comparable with similar acts published here on the site.&#10;&#10;The scenario is rather relaxed, you will not have to solve challenging and lengthy puzzles, which does not mean that it is a linear adventure without thinking. At almost any point in time, you will have to make decisions, some of which can be fatal and have a major impact on your group's fate. In addition, there is not only one path leading to the goal, and not all paths lead to the goal.&#10;&#10;The scenario will guide you through the preparation and subsequent participation in an expedition to find and kill Basilisk. It contains some non-standard elements (&ldquo;minilocations&rdquo;, special status tokens directly printed on the cards) that enrich the basic game principle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The inspirational sentences appearing on the journal cards are taken from Mengoni's songs and enrich the poetic journey of this game.&#10;&#10;Description by the designer; edited by Markus from Florence&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the role of Cybermancers, masters of digital combat, who summon virtual avatars to fight for them in the Virtual Arena.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a 30 card Summoning Deck, containing the warriors he will summon to the battlefield. Both players draw 7 cards from their Summoning Deck, then draw 5 cards each from the CPU and RAM Power Deck, which will be used to pay the summoning costs of each warrior. Cybermancy uses a unique dual-track power system, in which players decide each round whether to increase the amount of CPU or RAM available for summoning. This allows unlimited flexibility in designing each deck, as well as important tactical choices every round.&#10;&#10;Players can attack their opponent's warriors or the enemy avatar itself. When either Cybermancer's health is reduced to zero, the game is over and the surviving Cybermancer wins!&#10;&#10;The base game includes complete decks of cards for both the Human and Undead factions. Unlike collectible card games, Cybermancy provides all of the cards right out of the box, and even allows for players to mix and match warriors from different factions. Future expansions will include warrior tribes such as Robots, Aliens, Celestials, Demons, Dinosaurs and more!&#10;&#10;",

UQ Hockey also features an individual goalie modification for even more realism.&#10;&#10;With UQ Hockey, you'll be able to track not only Team wins and losses, but league leaders for Goals scored, assists and GAA.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Deadly Desserts is a trick-taking card game. If you've never played a trick-taking game before, Deadly Desserts is the perfect game to start with! The game is played in a series of tricks, in which players play one card each. The winner of each trick takes the cards, most of which deal damage. Thus, your objective is to avoid winning tricks! It's a very fun gameplay style because you win by not winning.&#10;&#10;If you're familiar with trick-taking games, Deadly Desserts builds off of classics (e.g. Hearts, Euchre, Bridge) and adds exciting gameplay features, such as Gourmayhem Cards to double cards' values or being able to play 2-10 players rather than 3-4.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As a secret agent, you've been assigned to catch an elusive spy before they get away. Search for clues and find evidence while you track the spy, but watch out for dangerous explosives!&#10;&#10;To Catch a Spy is a 1-2 player game of espionage. To set up, place nine location cards in a 3x3 grid, then place discovery cards under each location. Place three file cards near the locations, then place case cards under each file. Place decks for arrow cards and additional discovery cards nearby, along with two agent tool cards. The spy and agent cards start in different locations.&#10;&#10;In the solo game, you are the agent and go first, moving to an adjacent location and revealing a discovery card, which could be an item, clue, or bomb; item and clue cards go in hand, while bombs force you to discard. You can use a location's special ability and clues to reveal case cards under files. You might be able to place a tracking bug on the spy.&#10;&#10;For the spy's turn, the arrow cards move the spy to an adjacent location, where a new discovery card is placed at random. If the spy moves to your location, discard a card. If you can't discard a card or discover you've discarded an item matching a case card, you lose immediately.&#10;&#10;When the discovery deck is empty, the spy attempts to escape. You must have placed a tracking bug on the spy, have the three item cards in hand matching the case cards, and make it to the spy's current location before the spy escapes.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game, one player is the spy while the other is the agent. At the start of a round, each player chooses and reveals an arrow card, then the agent takes their turn, followed by the spy. Gameplay takes place as described above, with the spy needing to place all cards in the discovery deck before trying to escape, while the agent needs to collect the three items matching the case, bug the spy, then reach the spy's location.&#10;&#10;Awards:&#10;&#10;From the 2020 54-Card Game Design Contest.&#10;-Best Solo Game: 1st place!&#10;-Best Overall Game: 2nd place!&#10;-Best 2 Player Game: 2nd place!&#10;-Best Graphic Design: 3rd place!&#10;&#10;",
