    "Description": "A card game for 2-4 players themed around the adventures of the demigod Hercules.  Each player tries to complete the most labours and adventures.&#10;&#10;The board is a circular track divided into 12 spaces representing 12 countries or locations visited by Hercules. Each space has a specific set of instructions such as draw 1 card or take the top card of discard, draw two cards, next turn roll 2 dice to move and pick 1 etc.&#10;&#10;There are 3 common decks of cards:&#10;&#10;     The Labours deck has 12 cards representing the 12 labours of Hercules. Each has 3 to 6 requirements needed to complete it. The deck is constructed so that the easier labours come into play before the more difficult ones. Only four labours are revealed at a time &ndash; every time a labour is completed the next card in the deck is flipped over as a replacement.&#10;     The Adventure deck is similar to the Labours deck but easier. Each adventure only needs 1 or 2 requirements to complete it. The Adventure deck is kept face-up. &#10;     The Hero Deck - each card provides 1 or 2 of the requirements needed to complete labours and adventures. &#10;&#10;&#10;Players start with 2 hero cards and take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:&#10;&#10;Move Phase&#10;&#10;     Roll 1D6 and move that many spaces in either direction. If you land on an opposing player steal 1 random Hero card from his hand and skip the action and labour phases. &#10;&#10;&#10;Action Phase&#10;&#10;     If you did not land on another player, follow the instructions on the board space you entered. If you land on the Mediterranean you may complete the top face up Adventure card by discarding Hero cards with the necessary requirements. If completed, place the Adventure card in your Victory Pile. &#10;&#10;&#10;Labour Phase&#10;&#10;     You may complete a revealed labour by discarding Hero cards with the &#10;&#10;&#10;necessary requirements. When completed place the labour card in your Victory Pile. &#10;Each Labour can only be completed if your pawn is in a specific space on the track (e.g. the Lion of Nemea can only be conducted in Greece, the Wild Mares of Diomedes in Thrace, the Golden Apples of Hesperides in Africa etc&hellip;)&#10;&#10;     Once one player has completed a Labour it is finished and is no longer available to other players to complete.  &#10;&#10;&#10;End Phase&#10;&#10;     Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when all 12 labours have been completed. The player with the most labour points, gained by completing labours and adventures, wins.&#10;&#10;",

Defences are set up in a hurry to protect agriculture and ensure the supply of the warriors. But the enemy is also armed.&#10;&#10;Only 12 cards form the landscape, on which the enemy troops stand in the form of dice. &#10;In his turn, each player has three opportunities. He is allowed to recruit up to 3 new warriors in his own capital, he can build (or destroy) defences in occupied areas - for this, the corresponding card is reversed and 2 warriors are reduced to pawns &ndash; and, of course, he can move the troops and attack the enemy.&#10;&#10;The game principle is straightforward and intuitive and also suitable for casual players as an entry-level tactics game.&#10;&#10;",

Players chose from a variety of dinosaur species and move around an island gathering goods in order to produce eggs...the first to produce 6 eggs in their nest wins the game! On your turn you'll roll a bunch of giant dice to populate the island with resources like insects, ferns, ginko, meat, and fish. Then you'll move around the island (possibly using your dino's unique ability) and gather up those resources to feed and grow your broods to produce more eggs. As you nest fills up, you'll gain new and enhanced skills to help you on your journey. But be careful when you gather goods from the dangerous areas of the island, as the volcano might erupt laying waste to valuable goods and scaring you back to safety.&#10;&#10;Double-sided components are designed to enable competitive play between gamers and non/early-gamers at the same time and let young kids grow into the game by watching and learning from older players.&#10;&#10;",

Each player begins with a YES and a NO card. The first player draws a card from the QUESTIONS deck and reads it out loud. All other players vote silently on the question by placing the corresponding answer card face down on the table. The first player now guesses if the majority voted yes, no or if there was a tie (if mathematically possible). If they guessed correctly, they keep the question card as a point. The turn moves clockwise to the next player. First to 5 points wins.&#10;&#10;PRIVILEGE cards add a strategic element to the game. Use them to steal points, steal a turn, challenge someone to a staring contest or force someone to give you a compliment.&#10;&#10;Triggers forges an environment of fun and open exchange of ideas.

In 1790 a small force of militia and US Regulars under General Harmer were soundly defeated by the Miami at the Maumee River near their main settlement of Kekionga. Alarmed, the US Congress and President Washington authorized the mobilization of an even larger force, this time to be led by the Territory&rsquo;s first Governor and General of the Army, Arthur St. Clair. This would be the first full scale conflict waged by the new nation, and President Washington was very much concerned about the risks such an undertaking involved.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well, or better?&#10;&#10;",

This system is singular in that it can work with or without the game&rsquo;s board.&#10;&#10;Players will use their formidable flying sail-ships and fearsome meeple armies to capture settlements and earn money to buy more powerful ships that will allow them to defeat their rivals and fully control the trade and resources of the islands.

The Game is designed with simple rules and a surplus of cards to allow players to customize the deck to their preferred play style. Whether passive or aggressive, chaotic or ordered Vektor offers the quick spontaneous action of a filler game while offering the flexibility of game modes to increase replay value.&#10;&#10;Vector is a vibrant, colorful game that mixes fun clever interactions while not being overwhelming for new players. To put it simply, Vektor is a spell slinger wearing a Skip-Bo / Uno mask.&#10;&#10;The game functions best with 3-5 players and takes 5-15 minutes to play.&#10;The game comes with conditional rules for more silly and chaotic games, and also comes with &#10;A deck of attack order cards for players that may be scared of mercilessly destroying your significant other in a card game. The idea is that the simple mechanics of the game allow freedom of format on how you want to play. Be creative, add or subtract cards, use the blank cards to add your own unique experience!&#10;&#10;More games modes are currently in development:&#10;-Sword and Shield (2v2 Co-Op)&#10;-Center of Attention (King of the hill)&#10;&#10;",

She moves closer to them as she learns about things such as their ability to cook, the amount of dowry they&rsquo;ll bring in and whether or not they have &ldquo;child bearing hips&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The girls spend their time coming up with creative ways to avoid getting hitched by the aunty. They can do so by talking about having a career, gaining weight, being seen in the mall with boys, or several other things that every other society would consider normal, but are seen as disgraceful in South Asian culture. &#10;Occasionally, they might find out things about the aunty, such as the fact that she has a 23 year old unmarried daughter, and use that to blackmail her into moving away from them.&#10;&#10;At some point during the game, the Aunty comes across the Golden Boy. The green-eyed, light skinned, CEO of a business with a foreign passport. This is when the entire game dynamic switches around, as it turns into a rat race to get married to the dreamy Mr. Right. &#10;The girls then start to make their way towards the aunty by flaunting their talents, such as the fact that they pray 5 times a day, or only have female friends.&#10;&#10;Only one girl makes it in time to marry this Golden Boy, and the rest are hitched off to the mama&rsquo;s boys and womanisers who believe that they&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s gift to humanity.&#10;&#10;",

Players are trying to locate the &quot;Lost Gemma&quot; (Latin for &quot;jewel&quot;) which is hidden among the growing ruins.  The game consists primarily of two phases:  Investigation and Search.&#10;&#10;During the Investigation Phase, players decide whether to place their starting point card or draw and play something from their hand.  The former action can only be carried out once, while the latter forms the bulk of the phase.  With a few exceptions, cards played are added to the 5 x 5 grid that forms the ruins.  When players can no longer complete either of the main actions, play moves onto the Search Phase.&#10;&#10;Players are hot on the trail of the &quot;Lost Gemma&quot; during the Search Phase.  The player holding the card with the lowest search value goes first and then turns continue in ascending value order.  Each player begins at their starting point card, chooses a direction, and then follows the path until they either locate the &quot;Lost Gemma&quot; or face failure (via a &quot;Dead End&quot; or by leaving the ruins).&#10;&#10;The first player to uncover the &quot;Lost Gemma&quot; wins.  However, if all searches end in failure, the game ends in a draw.&#10;&#10;The game was published for the Tokyo Game Market Autumn 2015 show, and features the characters from the Game Market catalogue.&#10;&#10;",

There is only one problem: the threads are hidden in your rival&rsquo;s homeland!&#10;&#10;Players take turns sending plush stuffed-animal &ldquo;Velvets&rdquo; into their opponent&rsquo;s homeland: seeking out their Threads of Destiny.&#10;&#10;Each set of Velvet contains 2 lots of 12 cards (8 Velvet stuffed animals, 3 Obstacles, and 1 Threads of Destiny). Each player takes 1 lot of 12 and uses the included stickers to customise the look, stats and abilities of their Velvet plushies over the course of three games, to form the most powerful party of adventurers that the Plush Homelands have ever seen!&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may Invade, Retreat, Scout or Explore your opponent's hand. The order of a player's hand cannot be changed once the game begins, and once a player reveals and Explores their opponent's &quot;Threads of Destiny&quot;, they win!&#10;&#10;A micro-Legacy game designed to be played in convention lines, Velvet is part Battleship, part dungeon crawler.&#10;&#10;",

As one of the competing mages, you use your share of eighty custom dice as seeds to hold semi-transparent cards that represent fences of bamboo, lightning, thorns, and water. Use these fences to capture magical beasts: chimeras, unicorns, basilisks, and centaurs. The magician who has the most points for capturing beasts and building fences wins the tournament and becomes the Champion of Magic thanks to Merlin's Beast Hunt!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The object of Scrabble Twist is to form words using the five random letters displayed on the electronic game unit. Players tap in the letters and then twist the unit to bank each word. The more words a player can find, the higher his score. Scoring ranges from three points (for three-letter words) to seven points (for five-letter words).&#10;&#10;The game features three difficulty levels and three different game modes. Party mode is a knockout round in which each player gets 15 seconds to bank a word before passing the game unit to the next player. Turbo mode offers a head-to-head challenge for two to eight players: Each player must bank words to score as many points as possible in 60 seconds. In Solo mode, a single player can practice his word-spotting skills in a 60-second time frame.&#10;&#10;",

As old as time itself, he slumbers in the Void, dreaming worlds into existence and crushing entire realities with his nightmares. On rare occasion, The Ancient One will stir in his timeless sleep, manifesting himself in a physical form that can hold shape in our world. Tearing a hole in time and space, he emerges from the Void, bringing Ancient Doom and despair to all those who lay eyes upon his hideous and twisting visage.&#10;&#10;The Ancient One is a massive XXL Enemy that rivals Beli&rsquo;al, both in size and theme! He is a terrifying foe to behold that can alter reality out from under the Heroes - shifting time, re-writing history, and breaking open portals to other dimensions during the fight. Sweeping his monstrous Sword of Felg&rsquo;nar with every attack, The Ancient One can easily slash through entire groups of Heroes in one fell strike. He also comes with a deck of Ancient Doom cards that give him a motivation for why he has emerged from the Void to crush the Heroes. One of these cards is drawn whenever The Ancient One enters play, and gives a thematic reasoning for his attack, a special bonus to The Ancient One himself, and alters the &lsquo;End of Mission&rsquo; Failure and Rewards for the current Mission being played.&#10;&#10;",

You are finally old enough to participate and anxious to prove yourself to the other children. You will need to carefully scout the area for the biggest fish, cleverly maneuver across the crowded ice, and strategically manage your limited supply of lures if you hope to out-fish the competition. Do you have what it takes?&#10;&#10;Eskimo Fishes is a competitive tile placement game in which players use an assortment of colored lure tiles to influence (and hopefully catch!) fish scattered throughout a modular lake map.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, ice tiles are shuffled and laid face-up in a grid to form the frozen lake and colored fish tokens representing holes in the ice are placed on each of the tiles.  Players&rsquo; turns consist of two phases: movement and fishing.  During the movement phase, players must move their Eskimeeple to a new unoccupied ice tile.  During the fishing phase, players manipulate a rondel on their player board to select a lure tile that must then be placed adjacent to their Eskimeeple.  After a set number of rounds, each fish is caught by the player with the highest sum of like-colored lures placed around it.  The player who catches the highest total value of fish is the winner!&#10;&#10;",
