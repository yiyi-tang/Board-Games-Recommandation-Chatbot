In this game, the first player to kill Smaug the Dragon wins.&#10;&#10;",

Pieces are captured by jumping over them, checkers style, and placing them in a special zone on the board.  These pieces can be rescued by an uncaptured piece moving through the capture zone.  The piece which freed the others is then crowned.  This offers the piece more options for movement while at the same time making it vulnerable to elimination, as the crowned pieces are removed from the board if an opponent jumps them.&#10;&#10;The first player to capture or eliminate all opposing pieces wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was developed in 1997 by the Lockheed Martin Ethics Awareness Training Development Task Force in cooperation with United Featured Syndicate.  The game is a component of employee ethics training.&#10;&#10;The game uses a game board, character figures based on the Dilbert comic strip and a team guidebook.&#10;&#10;Players are divided into 2 to 6 teams of 3 to 7 people and are led through a series of ethical case studies.  A simple ethical situation is presented along with 4 possible responses.  The teams must decide which is the correct response and present it to the group.  Answers provide that team with movement points between 0 and 5 -- better answers grant more points.  The teams then use their points to move their figure around the board an collect reward tokens.  After 5 cases are answered, the game is over and the winner is the team with the most tokens.&#10;&#10;The real objective is &quot;to stimulate thought, discussion, and analysis of the issues that we all must deal with in our work.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The ethiopist Richard Pankhurst learned the same game in 1971 from Abba Pawlos Tzadua of Serae, Abba Zacharias of Akala Guzay, Michael Yacob of Akala Guzay and Gabra Sellas&eacute; Gabra Amlak of Serae. All these players were Christians who either served at the Catholic Cathedral of Addis Abbaba or were students at the Haile Seilassie I University. (...) [It] is played by males and females, usually in holes in the ground, particularly in the period of marriages largely after the harvest season from November to January.&quot;&#10;&#10;The first move is played simultaneously in a racing manner until both players have reached an empty hole.&#10;&#10;Rules of play and demeanor can be found on the aforementioned site.&#10;&#10;",

As long as it matches exactly. If possible you can also play your second penguin card.&#10;Then you always play a floe card on either side of the line. So even if you can't play any penguin card you still add floes to the line to hopefully collect in your next turn (if they aren't scooped up by the other players).&#10;The last thing you do is fill up your hand so that you again have 2 penguin cards and 3 floe cards.&#10;&#10;The game continues until either the penguins are all played or until it's no longer possible to play the remaining penguins.&#10;At that point all the numbers on the penguin cards are added up.

This was when no lights could be showing so that night - time bombers would not see any targets.&#10;&#10;The back of the board is completely back with a label with the name of the game and a silhouette image of the city of London. The playing side of the board is marked out with a street map with each corner named marble Arch, Holborn, Hyde Park Corner and Charring Cross.

    "Description": "Panzertales: World Tank Division II (WTD II) is the sequel to WTD I.  Published in Japan and written in Japanese, it is an area movement wargame focused on armored combat in 1944-45.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three maps (two sheets printed front and back), cardboard counters, a rulebook and four unpainted PVC tanks (Tiger II, Panther, Hetzer and StuG IIIG).  The maps depict the Normandy beaches, Remagen and Budapest.  Counters depict armored vehicles for Germany, U.K., U.S.A., and U.S.S.R.&#10;&#10;The game is a light wargame centered around the abstract depiction of armored combat in Europe late in the war.  Obviously the intent of the game designers is for the players to equip themselves with World Tank Museum forces to use on the maps; the first four vehicles (all German) are a means to jump-start these forces.  As these are generally insufficient, the included cardboard counters, which carry the attack strength, defense strength, movement value, etc., for the forces, can be used.&#10;&#10;WTD II is a successor to WTD I, but is not exactly an expansion.  Some minor changes to the forces have been made- e.g., point values for the units (which are used to build armies in design-your-own scenarios) have been adjusted.  However, several new factors are introduced, such as the inclusion of infantry, anti-tank guns, armored personnel carriers, and rules for indirect fire/air strikes.&#10;&#10;",

(1) Each player uses a colored disk to represent his car. (2) All cars go from START by spins of the dial. (3) Each space or picture on the road counts one space. (4) When a car stops on a picture, the driver must obey the sign found there. (5) After passing the School, when one player's car stops on the same space (not picture) as an opponent's, the player's car moves AHEAD to the next picture and the opponent's car goes BACK to the picture just passed. (See rule 4.) (6) The last space, the one across the railroad track, must be reached by an exact spin. (7) The player whose car reaches this space first WINS THE GAME.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Their warring has not gone unnoticed.&#10;&#10;20 new alien cultures are now racing towards the site of the conflict. They each want to carve out their own piece of the galaxy for themselves. The aliens may be familiar to some of you (reprints of past favorites), or are aliens no one has ever seen before. The first on our list is a blast from the past; the Sniveler!&#10;&#10;In addition, this expansion includes additions to the Cosmic Encounter universe. From the game-changing Cosmic Quakes to the bounties held within the Reward deck, these additions are sure to spice up your quest for galactic dominance.&#10;&#10;Every game has seen five races converge to do battle for control of an empire. Now, the galaxy gets crowded. A sixth race appears to do battle, and the sixth member of your play group is able to join you. Cosmic Incursion allows a sixth player to get in on the fun.&#10;&#10;Cosmic Encounter puts you in charge of the fate of an alien race. Each flavor of extraterrestrial strives to be the first to conquer five enemy colonies and establish themselves as the dominant life form. Every faction has a unique power, a power they intend to use to crush their enemies. With over 50 aliens to choose from no two games will be the same.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, you draw two cards from a common draw pile, and use these cards to form and assist your gang members. If you draw a gang member, you can add him to your gang (but have to pay him money each turn). If you draw a special ability (like drug king) or a racket (selling stolen cars, owning an illegal gaming club) you can attach it to any of your gang members. You can also happen to draw crack cards (alcoholic, drug addict, rat) that you have to attach to any of your members.&#10;&#10;&quot;Smugglings&quot; and &quot;heists&quot; usually require more gang members than you have in your gang. Team up with another gang, decide on how to split the loot, roll the die to determine success. If the hit/smuggling failed, all participants must roll the die to see if they were caught (in which case the gang members are lost). If it succeeds, all gangs involved secretly choose the card &quot;deal&quot; or &quot;you're fucked&quot; and show it to the others simultaneously. If all shows &quot;deal&quot;, the loot is split according to the deal. If one of the gangs shows &quot;you're fucked&quot; he takes the lot. If two or more shows &quot;you're fucked&quot;, there is a shootout, the police arrives, and no one gets anything.&#10;&#10;There is also the option to use your gang members to kill off your opponents cronies in order to take command of their rackets or to steal their money.&#10;&#10;The game is language level 2 or 3 borderline case.&#10;&#10;",

Because loops come in a wide range of sizes and shapes, and have many degrees of freedom, the game has rich tactics and strategy.&#10;&#10;Small loops threats force players to focus on local battles while large loop threats force them to think globally, and to consider how the local battles fit into the global war. Wise stone placements can contribute to the creation of multiple loops or to defense against multiple loops, leading to layered, multi-dimensional consequences for each turn.&#10;&#10;See the rules of Coil here&#10;&#10;",
