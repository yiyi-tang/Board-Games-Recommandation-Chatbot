    "Description": "According to a legend in 1471 by order of Henry IV King of Castille, called the Impotent, set out one expedition to Africa, beyond the land of the Moors.&#10;The secret aim of this expedition was to hunt a unicorn, since it was assumed that the horn of this mythological creature could increase the virility of the king.&#10;In 1946 the results of the exhumation of the corpse of Henry IV  alongside the king's mummified remains found a gray spindle object, which was proved to be a fragment of African rhino horn.&#10;&#10;So begins and ends the novel &quot;In Search of the Unicorn&quot; by Juan Eslava Galan awarderd Planeta Prize in 1987, being the original idea for this game. Each player leads an expedition sent to hunt the unicorn, but in the way they could get other valuable things like gold, trading on the Silk Road and to evangelize people in the name of his master Henry IV of Castille. All this if the expeditioners survived the attacks of nomade tribes with whom they have to fight. Many dangers and soldiers will die during the way and what is worse, maybe you the leader will also fall before reaching your goal ... who will get the horn and gets the grace of the king?&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;En 1471 por orden de Enrique IV de Castilla, llamado el Impotente, parte una expedici&oacute;n desde Segovia con destino los pastizales de Africa, m&aacute;s all&aacute; de la tierra de los moros.&#10;El objetivo secreto de esta expedici&oacute;n era cazar un unicornio, ya que se supon&iacute;a que su cuerno pod&iacute;a aumentar la virilidad del rey.&#10;Seg&uacute;n reza el Acta de la Exhumaci&oacute;n del cad&aacute;ver de Enrique IV de 1946, junto a los restos momificados del rey se encontr&oacute; un objeto fusiforme gris, que una vez identificado por el C.S.I.C. result&oacute; ser un fragmento de cuerno de rinoceronte africano.&#10;&#10;As&iacute; comienza y termina la novela &ldquo;En busca del unicornio&rdquo; de Juan Eslava Gal&aacute;n  que fue Premio Planeta en 1987, y  que sirve como idea para este juego. Cada jugador dirige una expedici&oacute;n para cazar el unicornio, pero por el camino podr&aacute; conseguir oro, comerciar en la ruta de la seda y hasta evangelizar pueblos para ensalzar la figura de su se&ntilde;or Enrique IV de Castilla. Todo esto si sobrevive a los ataques de los pueblos n&oacute;madas con los que tendr&aacute; que luchar. A lo largo de la expedici&oacute;n es posible que tus compa&ntilde;eros pierdan la vida y lo que es peor, a lo mejor tu tambi&eacute;n caes&hellip;&iquest;ser&aacute;s tu quien gane el favor del rey?&#10;&#10;",

You can taste the satisfaction of forcing your opponents to pay too much for their modest properties, or jump at the opportunity of stealing a legitimate good deal by being shrewd and cunning.  If you like fast paced competitive fun that keeps the chance factor to a minimum, try Bid$, the game where you do control your own destiny.&quot;&#10;&#10;Object of the game (2-6 players) - To make as much money as possible by buying stores and eventually towers.  Each player picks a marker and starts at &quot;receive $1500&quot; (you do not collect the money until you have gone around the board once).  All players play around the outside edge (lower level) and can only move into the upper level (inside edge) with a bank payment of $15,000.  The players begin by rolling the dice, and the player with with the highest number starts first.  The rest of the order is determined by going clockwise.  When play begins, if a player rolls doubles, he/she is allowed to go again.  The player keeps rolling until he/she stops getting doubles (property that you hit along the way must be bid on or if it is owned the owner must be paid).  Each player is given $21,000 at the start of the game.  When a property is landed on, the bidding starts.&#10;&#10;",

Combat in both World Wars rapidly became a series of vicious, small unit actions, a classic confrontation at close quarters with no holds barred. As in most wars, the dirty business of winning battles fell to the infantryman. Despite the vast array of sophisticated and deadly weapons available to all sides, success or failure ultimately depended upon the ability of the foot soldier to take or hold ground.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "As day breaks upon Sekigahara pass, two armies stand ready to lay claim to the future of Japan. Two years before, Toyotomi Hideyoshi died leaving a son too young to rule. The council of regents sworn to defend his son split into two factions intent upon seizing power for themselves. As the fog lifts from the mountain pass, each faction stands poised for battle. Only the victor will witness the beginning of a new era in the history of Japan.&#10;&#10;Akebono, the Japanese word meaning both &ldquo;daybreak&rdquo; and &ldquo;beginning&rdquo;, summarizes the tension and anticipation in the Sekigahara mountain pass, scene of the decisive battle of 1600 that would usher in the Edo period of Japanese history.&#10;&#10;Akebono is a tactical dice driven game in which each player must present multiple flanks to ensure that at least some of the attacking troops will push forward. Units must be moved into a position to attack when their defeat is less likely.&#10;&#10;In the end, the winner will be the player who best balances his aggressive and defensive tactics on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;",

When one of his legs is broken, he moves fully on to the space for the remaining leg, leaving an open space.&#10;&#10;When both of his legs are broken, he is discarded and gives an apple to the active player (this reward is an artifact).  An apple is good for the body and it&rsquo;s full of pectin, but it can spoil!  During his Yang Phase, the player can discard the apple to return any Taoist (including himself) to 3 QI.

The top recipe card is turned over and then players draw cards to improve their ingredients to match the recipe.  If a card is kept, another card is discarded, so that players only have five cards at a time.  Players may draw from the discard pile as well.  The first player to match the exact number of ingredients to the recipe shouts &quot;Guacamole!&quot; and then wins that recipe card.  The game continues until one player has won one each of the Mild, Medium and Spicy recipe cards.  The game can either be played by turns or by &quot;scramble&quot; (where all players draw and discard as fast as they can at the same time).&#10;&#10;There are three special cards to spice things up: Limes - all players pass a card to their left; Salsa Bowl - all players pass a card to their right; Sombrero - all players get up and move one chair to the left, taking over another player's hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "MelodieXpress - is it music poured into a game? ... or is it a game filled with music? It&rsquo;s so hard to know!&#10;&#10;Theme&#10;&#10;At its heart MelodieXpress is a game about music. Actually it&rsquo;s a whole lot of games about music. MelodieXpress uses a series of card games to teach the elements of music theory, and to teach the players the skills of sight-reading and composing music.&#10;&#10;The pack includes playing cards based around music notation -  notes, clefs, key signatures, and accidental notes - as the basis for games and activities. While the overall intention it to foster musical knowledge and skills, the focus within the games is upon fun and enjoyment.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;The Note Reading pack is the first of the MelodieXpress sets. It includes 104 cards including the treble, alto and base clefs, and 52 crotchet notes - 4 cards for each of 13 notes.&#10;&#10;There are rules for 12 games included within the pack, and players are free to develop further games and activities utilising the flexibility of the cards. The guidebook introduces the basics of music notation and theory then leads on to the rules of the games.&#10;&#10;The Basic Games&#10;&#10;The 5 basic games introduce the notes and their naming to the point where players can instantly recognise and name the specific notes from the cards. These games utilise the crotchet notes and the clefs.&#10;&#10;These basic games are designed to so that they can initially be played using a subset of 4 notes (16 cards). This allows players to become familiar with the notes and their names, then expanding to include additional notes. A clef is used next to the game board to define the specific notes (so with the treble clef play starts with middle C, D, E and F, while with the alto clef the same cards would be E, F, G and A). As players become confident and adept at naming the notes additional cards are introduced to expand the games and add complexity.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Introducing the Notes&rsquo; and &lsquo;Flash Cards&rsquo; are the initial games and provide a first experience of notes and naming. They are followed by the classic &lsquo;Snap&rsquo; and &lsquo;Memory&rsquo; games adapted to be played using the music cards. While the players compete to win the games, the focus is upon ready recognition and matching of the notes on the cards. The final basic game - &lsquo;Making Melodies&rsquo;  encourages players to construct combinations of notes. It is also an opportunity to play the music from the cards for those players who are learning an instrument.&#10;&#10;The basic games are fun and enjoyable in their own right, but also provide a platform for building an understanding of musical concepts and notation.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Games&#10;&#10;The 7 advanced games build upon the recognition and understanding of notes gained in the basic games. They focus upon sequences and progressions of notes and introduce the next level of sight reading. The later games also introduce the use of key signatures and accidental notes (sharps, flats and naturals) to further extend the game-play and learning.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Row&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reach for the Stars&rsquo; are played by combining cards onto sequences of notes. Players place cards from their hands to build sequences of notes, either individually or in common. &lsquo;Scale the Mountain&rsquo; extends on this by introducing key signatures, and requiring players to build sequences to complete the major scales. As play moves around the table individual players take turns to build upon the scale, or to introduce a new key signature and rearrange the sequence to match the new scale.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Chord you do it?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chords Aplenty&rsquo; focus upon players building three note sequences of chords to score points. Game-play is dynamic and can involve the trading or transfer of cards between players.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Rows and Scales&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rows and Scales Advanced&rsquo; round out the advanced games, providing interactive games of sequencing and matching cards.

    "Description": "The MelodieXpress Composing Music Pack takes up where the MelodieXpress Note Reading Pack leaves off. Composing Music adds more and cards and more games to extend the fun and increase the learning.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;&#10;At its heart MelodieXpress is a collection of games about music. The packs include playing cards based around music notation - notes, clefs, key signatures and more. MelodieXpress uses a series of card games to teach the elements of music theory, and to teach the players the skills of sight-reading and composing music.&#10;&#10;The Composing Music Pack brings further cards, along with its own guide book. New notes include semi breves, minims and quavers, and more accidental notes (sharps, flats and naturals). It also introduces time signatures - 2:4, 3:4, 4:4 and 6:8 time - plus bar lines and the key signatures for the Alto clef - (C major, G major, D major, A major, F major, B flat major and E flat major).&#10;&#10;The focus is still on fun, but the additional cards in the Composing Music pack provide the basis for new games as well. The cards are combined with those from the Note Reading Pack to provide the expanded deck used in the new games.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;The Guide Book provides some additional definitions and an introduction to the required music theory. It also presents 13 new games. Depending upon the game playing time can run from 5 to 30 minutes. The majority of the games cater for 2-6 players, though some can extend to include more if needed.&#10;&#10;The early games build upon the skills developed in the Note Reading Pack, with games based around the key signatures, scales and chords. The later games make use of the new cards to introduce rhythm and melody.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Rhythm&rsquo; is a game for 2-6 players and introduces the use of key signatures and time signatures. Players progressively play cards from their hands to build up sequences of music. The grouping of notes must be consistent with the time signatures which start each sequence. As the game progresses players may add cards to their own or others sequences, aiming to build tunes of at least 18 notes.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Sure Time&rsquo; starts with a time signature and a sequence of 10 notes. Each player in turn chooses bar line and rest cards to introduce into the sequence and marks out each of the bars within the sequence of notes. Points are scored for correctly sequencing the cards. Each player faces a different combination of cards and time signatures as play progresses around the table.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Beat the Bar Line&rsquo; allows players to compose their own music. Each player progressively weaves together a communal collection of note cards with bar lines, rests and time signatures from their individual hands to build a growing composition. The game also introduces repeat bar lines and double bar lines with special rules for their play.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Composing Music&rsquo; adds additional challenges for those players who are learning an instrument or are taking choral lessons. Play starts with a player building a 3 bar segment of music built from the game cards. Points are scored based upon the composition. The following player in the sequence may then gain bonus points by correctly playing the piece. They then add a bar to the piece of music. Play continues with players alternately attempting to play the developing composition and then adding bars until all of the cards set out for that session have been used. Variations to the game allow for the substitution of different key signatures as the game progresses, as well as the use of accidental notes.&#10;&#10;Taking it Further&#10;&#10;Together the Note Reading and Composing Music Packs are intended to provide a fun series of games and activities which introduce the basics of sight reading and music notation. Additional packs and resources extend the system still further.&#10;&#10;The game system is designed to be flexible and open ended. The variety of cards allows players and teachers to develop their own games and activities beyond those provided in the pack. &#10;Additional games will also be published on the MelodieXpress website, sharing new games and activities as they are developed.&#10;&#10;The MelodieXpress System&#10; MelodieXpress is a fun, educational and easy way to learn to read music. Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory. This step-by-step approach allows you to learn at your own pace, while the games provide an enjoyable way to learn and consolidate your knowledge of music.&#10;&#10;MelodieXpress Composing Music is not a complete game. Ownership of MelodieXpress Note Reading is required.&#10;&#10;ISBN 978-0-9807592-1-1&#10;Patent Pending&#10;&#10;[Publisher's Information]&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From Designer: Two teams of Dwarves battle it out for control of areas. Players can use special cards that invoke the ability of the gods to attempt to gain the upper hand, but be warned! Each team has a limited supply of troops and once that supply is gone you will have no more reinforcements.&#10;&#10;Players will engage each other in skirmish like battles to gain control over 6-7 locations. Locations are worth additional points if controlled by it's matching teams, thus the players must strategically place their units and decide when and where to attack.&#10;&#10;To add variety there are are 30+ community cards which each player draws from to attempt to gain an advantage.&#10;&#10;During the 8 rounds of the game players will place their units, use power ups, and attack each other. Movement of the units once placed is very limited so it is important to place the units in regard to where the player wants them to end up.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 54 cards, instructions, and 2 dice. The game has been designed so that it is not required to reshuffle the cards except between games, ensuring that downtime is at a minimum.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Entry for the Chessex Tribute competition.&#10;&#10;Game Overview&#10;The object of the game is to capture your opponents&rsquo; dice by either trapping them with a die on two opposing sides (performing a pincer movement) or by dropping a die of the same number on top of it.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;. Game board (15 x 15 squares)&#10;. 36 dice x number of players (72 for 2 player, 108 for 3 player, 144 for 4 players) &ndash; each player should have a different colour of dice&#10;. These Rules&#10;. Diagonal Arrow Tiles x 30 (Optional)&#10;&#10;Set Up&#10;. - If using arrow tiles, place them 3 at a time (alternating who puts them down) on the board wherever you like.&#10;. - Players roll their dice 6 at a time and place them on their side of the board. Alternate putting dice on the board. You can place them within the five rows closest to them on the board (exactly where is generally irrelevant, but can ultimately be used as some sort of strategy depending on how you put them down). Keep doing this until each player has at least 30 dice on the board.&#10;.... - You may opt to hold 6 dice in reserve so you can place them in game at a later time.&#10;.... - When you play these reserves you can put any number of them on the board at a time, so long as they are on your own side of the board. Remember to roll them first to determine which side is facing up.&#10;. - Starting a die on the board so that it pincers an opponent&rsquo;s die does not count as a capture.&#10;. - Designate starting player.&#10;&#10;Arrow Tiles&#10;. Landing on an arrow tile grants you an additional direction to move in - always a diagonal. If the arrow points up and to the left, then you may move up, down, left, right, or up-left.&#10;&#10;Rules for Play&#10;. - Players alternate moving one die each turn.&#10;. - If you drop one of your dice on another one of your dice, the die at the bottom is removed and can be replayed on a later turn with a different number on its face.&#10;. - Any dice captured by your opponent are removed from the game. You don&rsquo;t get them back during this game.&#10;. - A die can jump in any of the four directions provided they a) stay on the board, and b) don&rsquo;t land on an enemy die with a number different to the die you are moving. You can drop any of your dice on top of any of your own dice, provided they are in range.&#10;. - You can only move your pieces in a straight line.&#10;. - If you jump your dice between two enemy dice, you don&rsquo;t lose that die. The opponent must manoeuvre into a position where they jump beside you.&#10;&#10;Reinforcements&#10;You can play any number of reinforcements in your home zone (the first five lines on your side of the board) on your turn instead of moving one of your dice.&#10;If you place a reinforcement next to an opponent&rsquo;s die that already has one of your dice on an opposing side, it does not count as a capture.&#10;&#10;Buffer&#10;One line of squares running from corner to corner of the board should act as a buffer if you intend to have more than 2 people playing a game. I.e. during initial deployment, you cannot place one of your own dice next to an opponent&rsquo;s dice.&#10;&#10;Dice Rules&#10;. - Number 1 Dice: can move one square, capture enemy Number 1 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.&#10;. - Number 2 Dice: can move 2 squares, capture enemy Number 2 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.&#10;. - Number 3 Dice: can move 3 squares, capture enemy Number 3 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.&#10;. - Number 4 Dice: can move 4 squares, capture enemy Number 4 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.&#10;. - Number 5 Dice: can move 5 squares, capture enemy Number 5 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.&#10;. - Number 6 Dice: can move 6 squares, capture enemy Number 6 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.&#10;- Capture: Jumping on an enemy die with the same number on its face. Moving your dice into position so that there is one of your dice on either side (left and right or front and back) of a die with any number on its face.&#10;&#10;Board Shape&#10;It was recently brought to my attention that the game can be played on grids that aren't necessarily square. To play on a triangular board, your pieces can move normally in all 6 directions, thus rendering the need for the arrow toils null.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;. Players who have less than 6 dice left on the board (with no reserves) lose. A player may concede defeat any time after they are reduced to ten dice less than their opponent (e.g. if they have 15 dice and their opponent has 25 dice, they can concede defeat).&#10;&#10;",

Mastering the game requires a sense of balance, spatial reasoning and sustained focus.&#10;&#10;How does this game differ from the classic earlier game Hex?&#10;1. In Diamond Bridge, a player has only 16 pieces, and once a player has placed all their pieces, they then move an already-placed piece on their turn.&#10;2. Diamond Bridge has no swap rule, so there is a significant first player advantage.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this Decktet trick-taking game, you're a hermit who tries to avoid having people follow you home. So are all of your opponents.&#10;&#10;The daily life of the hermits is represented by tricks of cards, and there will typically be more than one trick in play at a time. The goal is to avoid taking tricks with personality cards in them. Tricks that don't have personalities in them don't matter one way or the other.&#10;&#10;The above description is from the Decktet Book, where the game first appeared.&#10;&#10;Hermit is a game akin to Hearts where players are attempting to avoid taking cards that are worth points. Rather than a single suit being avoided, Hermit requires that you do not win tricks which contain &quot;personality&quot; cards, one of the three sub-types of cards in the Decktet, which represent a person following you home and thus ruining your perfect life of solitude.&#10;&#10;Regardless of the number of players, tricks are played open to the table. On a player's turn they must add a card from their hand to a trick with the requirement that the card being played shares at least one suit with the last played card on that trick. If they cannot meet that requirement they must use a card to start a new trick. If the card they play is the highest rank in the trick the entire trick moves in front of them. Thus any new tricks always start in front of the player opening them.&#10;&#10;When a fourth card is added to a trick it is &quot;closed&quot; and the cards are captured by whomever the trick is in front of. If on a player's turn there are no available tricks, including the first turn of the game, each player simultaneously starts a new trick and that player then takes their turn, in effect allowing them to play two cards in a row. When the last player places their last card any unclosed tricks are discarded and each personality card taken counts its rank for scoring with Crowns being rank 10.&#10;&#10;When one player reaches a predetermined score, typically 66 or 100, or a certain number of deals are completed the game is over and the player with the fewest points is the loneliest and thus the winner.&#10;&#10;Special rules exist regarding Aces and Crowns as well as a Shoot the Moons/Suns variant, a &quot;House Party&quot; variant, and rules for 2-player Hermit games which incorporates a &quot;Cottage&quot; and laying off throughout the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This game was initially intended to be an expansion to Avalon Hill's Caesar's Legions. It has turned into much more than that. It has so many distinct features to it, the only recognizable part that remains are the counters. Caesar's Legions was a captivating game and pretty successful for Avalon Hill. It broke the mold of their traditional WWII games and the traditional combat chart that they used. There were two short comings with the game - there were only five scenarios, and there was no campaign game.&#10;&#10;Caesar in Gaul covers a much shorter time period, which makes a campaign game more adaptable. At present it has nine historical scenarios. The rules are more complex as is the combat system, but it remains an intermediate level game, and is highly suited for solitaire play. It has become the sequel game that Caesar's Legions players have always wanted.&#10;&#10;The second Edition rules are released and address all of the criticisms presented to date. They are a free download PDF as well as other charts used in the game.&#10;&#10;A computer game for the 4th scenario - Crassus in Aquitania is also available. It gives players a feel for the game mechanics. Useful to play before diving into the scenarios or campaign game.&#10;&#10;Some players have mentioned their hesitance to purchase a board game with a lot of cards in it. The 78 tribal cards are for player reference. It makes locating the various tribes on the board easier, gets you more familiar with the strange tribal names, and instantly identifies resources and leaders available for that tribe. Also useful for random selections when called for, and organizing initial tribal morale in the campaign game set up.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Notre Dame Express is a PnP dice game based on the Notre Dame Boardgame by Stefan Feld.&#10;&#10;I wanted to give something back to the PnP Express community in here because I have had fun building versions of everyone's great games. My goal for this express version design was to condense set up and playtime while distilling all the things i really liked about Notre Dame down and still providing some good strategic decisions and player choices.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;The goal of the game is the same as in Notre Dame, to have as many prestige points after the end of six rounds. This game can be played with 2-5 players. I think 3 is optimal for playtime.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;Each of the six rounds is divided into 4 phases, and is played by rolling dice.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: the Plague die is rolled to determine the plague count&#10;&#10;Phase 2: three Action dice are rolled to determine actions for the phase (similar to the choosing and passing of cards in the boardgame version). Actions performed are similar to the boardgame and marked on a player card. Of the three dice rolled, one is chosen, one is passed to the next player and one is discarded.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: one of three Person dice (depending on the period) is rolled and the player may choose to hire that person for the round performing that ability.&#10;&#10;Phase 4: the plague check is determined for all players and the Notre Dame bonus is taken.&#10;&#10;Files:&#10;Downloadable files include artwork for all dice faces, player cards and instructions for play. Everything is sized for 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper. You will need nine 1&quot; wooden cubes for the dice which can be readily found at craft stores.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the Trenches: Through Mud and Blood is the third game of the In the Trenches series. Designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulsed-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspire historically accurate play without forcing decisions.&#10;&#10;In the Trenches: Through Mud and Blood includes seven operations. &quot;Balkan Brawl&quot; takes place in Macedonia, &quot;Schneiders at Juvincourt&quot; pits French tanks against German infantry, &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; and &quot;Go to Hell!&quot; depict the battles of the 308th US Infantry Battalion in the Charlevaux Valley, &quot;War of Machines&quot; and &quot;Combined Arms&quot; involves British and German tanks on the Western Front, and &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; depicts trench fighting between the British and Germans during the last German offensive of the First World War.&#10;&#10;Included in In the Trenches: Through Mud and Blood are five 11.5&quot; x 8&quot; maps, 264 die-cut counters, one rulebook, guides for all seven operations, one reference card, and two D6s.&#10;&#10;(source: Grenier Games website)&#10;&#10;&#10;Maps:&#10;&#10;Maps are single-sheet 11.5&quot; x 8&quot; and printed on stiff, glossy cardstock.&#10;&#10;The featured five maps are:&#10;&quot;Hill 06&quot; covers a piece of territory near Lake Doiran in Macedonia&#10;&quot;Juvincourt&quot; features the village of that name, and the nearby countryside &#10;&quot;Charlevaux Valley&quot; contains the battlefield of the Lost Battalion, &#10;&quot;Open Ground&quot; leaves a clean playing field for the tanks (and perfect for make-your-own battles),&#10;&quot;Racecourse Redoubt&quot; features a network of trenches on the Western Front.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;Balkan Brawl&#10;To break the stalemate at Salonika, the Allies planned to strike the Bulgarian centre. As part of a larger effort, the 11th Worcestershire Battalion, 78th Brigade, 22nd Division aimed to capture &quot;06&quot;, a strongpoint of the Bulgarian 9th Division on &quot;Pip Ridge&quot; just east of Lake Doiran in Macedonia. At 2145, after days of intermittent shelling, the preparatory barrage ceased and the officers' shrill whistles rose from the din. British troops filtered down into Hana Ravine just before bounding up the slope to &quot;06&quot;.&#10;&#10;Schneiders at Juvincourt&#10;As part of the Nivelle Offensive, Commandant Louis Bossut led five &quot;Special Artillery&quot; groups of 16 Schneider tanks each into German lines near Berry-Au-Bac at 0600. Groupment Bossut crossed the first German trench line with infantry against light resistance. But nagging artillery fires and mechanical failures began to nibble away at his force. Four kilometers later, Bossut swung northward to cross the second German trench line with his 60 remaining tanks and the 151st Infantry Regiment. After crossing around 0900, Bossut split his force sending two groups north toward Juvincourt, two more west toward Mauchamp and one south toward the Aisne.&#10;&#10;The Lost Battalion&#10;On 2 October 1918, elements of the U.S. 77th &quot;Liberty&quot; Division from New York attacked north into the Argonne Forest. Major Whittlesey's force of two battalions from the 308th Infantry and two platoons of the 306th Machine Gun outpaced neighboring American units by penetrating a full kilometer into German lines. At dusk, Whittlesey's men dug in along the north slope of a valley between a road at the top and a stream at the bottom. Company K of the 307th joined the following morning. Seeing that this force had outpaced its flank protection, the Germans slowly encircled the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot;, in a pocket about 500 meters east of Moulin de Charlevaux. At 3 PM on October 3, the Germans launched their first attack.&#10;&#10;Go to Hell!&#10;After 5 days of siege, the Lost Battalion was out of bandages, drinking from the Charlevaux Brook, and coughing on the stench of the rotting corpses that surrounded them. the Germans sent an American POW back to his comrades with a letter offering to accept an American surrender. According to legend, Major Whittlesey spat back, &quot;Go to Hell!&quot;&#10;&#10;Kaiserschlacht&#10;The Kaiser's Battle began at 0435 with an unprecedented artillery bombardment of gas, smoke and high explosive rounds. About 9,955 tubes of all sizes rained over 1,100,000 shells across 40 miles of frontage. At 0940 the firing stopped; Stosstruppen immediately sprang from their shell holes as German regulars emerged from trenches close behind. Near Grugies not far from St. Quentin, Germany's 238th division slammed into Britain's 36th Ulster amid dense fog and lingering smoke. The recently arrived Ulster men had just taken over French positions and had yet to fully implement the new defense in depth doctrine.&#10;&#10;War of Machines&#10;During the Second Battle of Cambrai, British troops of Byng's third Army broke through the Hindenburg Line to &quot;the green fields beyond.&quot; Leading the way, tanks of the 12th Battalion helped XVII Corps capture Niergnies. Just east of the town, Captain Roe's tank, L16, paused at Mont Neuve Farm. there he spotted four MIVs coming his way from the east. C Company - he thought.&#10;&#10;Combined Arms&#10;After Ludendorff's Operation Georgette bogged down in the north, he made a thrust for Amiens. At dawn on April 24th, thirteen German tanks lumbered forward over a gloomy moonscape with infantry close behind. After plowing through Britain's 173rd Brigade, they covered 4,000 yards to reach the Cachy Switch Line, a stitch work arrangement of incomplete trenches between Villers Bretonneux and Cachy.
