    "Description": "Pletore is a drawless territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsTwo stones, or a stone and an empty point, see each other if they lie on the same row or column and there are no other stones between them along that line.&#10;&#10;You pinch a point if it sees stones of your color in at least one horizontal direction and one vertical direction.&#10;&#10;You control a point if you pinch it while your opponent does not.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pass, provided that there are no empty points or every empty point is controlled by some player.&#10;     Place a stone of your color on an empty point not controlled by your opponent.&#10;     Remove an enemy stone from a point you control and place a stone of your color on that point.&#10;&#10;&#10;On even-sized boards only, to prevent mirror play, the position after White's first move must be such that swapping the two stones on the board is not equivalent to rotating the board by 180&ordm;.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. Your score is the number of stones of your color on the board, plus the number of empty points you control, plus komi in the case of White. The button is used to avoid ties.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Komi and buttonKomi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as compensation for going second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.&#10;&#10;The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. It is only used when komi and the board size have the same parity (i.e. they are both odd or both even). On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button.&#10;&#10;Pletore was inspired by Micha&#197;&#130; Zapa&#197;&#130;a's Tumbleweed.&#10;&#10;",

Players flick their monsters onto Satan's castle, trying to earn enough reward to gather three 'heroes'. The first player to recruit three heroes, such as Dracula, Succubus, Vorpal Bunny, or Hanako in the toilet, is the winner.&#10;&#10;One player acts as Satan and defends a large castle, made from staggered boxes as a dias, with a throne at the top. The other players have a Demon King, one of eight such as Lucifer, Cthulhu, or Nurarihyon. Each Demon King starts with special abilities to help the player.&#10;&#10;The game uses highly decorated plastic cards. The player takes their plastic Demon King card and inserts it vertical into a base card. This creates a flicking device. By holding the base down, and bending the card back, a player can flick their small foam creatures up onto the castle levels. Satan can defend the castle platform with its own cards, or use whatever toys or plushies a player has to hand.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, the attackers try to steal money from the castle, and use this to recruit 'heroes' to their side. These heroes bring more powers and abilities to the cause, and strengthen the attack in different ways. For example, the Vorpal Bunny increases the attack magnification to the throne by 100 times and exerts super high firepower, but Hanako in the toilet nullifies the attack on the throne. Getting Hanako-san from the toilet keeps the player with Vorpal Bunny in check. Players can choose to work together, and a player might even be better off attacking themselves. The game system is very open and fluid in the way the characters' abilities work.&#10;&#10;The first player to gain three heroes to their side is the winner.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Momokubari in the east to Fuwa no Seki in the west, from Mt. Sasao in the north to Mt. Matsuo in the south. The victory condition includes the element of &quot;betrayal&quot; that is indispensable for the battle of Sekigahara, and players can enjoy purely clashes between units.&#10;In order to create the atmosphere of the battle at that time, the battle logic is extremely deformed for a simulation game of this scale. In other words, the front side of the piece expresses the ability as a unit, but when it is damaged and becomes the back side, it expresses the ability of the individual military commander. In terms of wargames, the front side is the operational level and the back side is the tactical level. If the soldiers are lost due to damage, the military commander will fight directly.&#10;There is also a twist on the victory conditions. The point is that &quot;when the military commander retreats, Kobayakawa's heart shakes.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The Eastern Army is controlled by the game system and attacks / counterattacks according to the rules. This system is partly based on the system of VPG's The Barbarossa Campaign.&#10;It is said that the Battle of Sekigahara was won by the betrayal of Kobayakawa Hideaki and others of the Western Army. Therefore, when making a game, the elements of the politicking for the army of Kobayakawa Hideaki and others are usually included. However, this was an element that was prone to system problems, such as complicating the game system and allowing players who know the historical facts of betrayal to take measures against betrayal in advance.&#10;Therefore, this game focused on &quot;the salvo of guns on Mt. Matsuo by the Ieyasu main corps&quot; that triggered Kobayakawa Hideaki to finally implement the betrayal. The game defines that Ieyasu gets impatient and starts advancing = betrayal = defeat of the Western Army, and sets the victory condition that the Western Army is defeated if the victory or defeat is not decided &quot;until the Ieyasu main corps starts advancing&quot;.&#10;This is a fairly high hurdle for the Western Army, but it is a victory condition unique to solitaire that you can challenge as many times as you want without having to secure an opponent. Try to challenge the if of history.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Winds of Caribbean is a naval battle-themed game of sailing ships during the Age of Discovery, based on the system of the masterpiece Wings of War: Dawn of War. Players control sailboats, shoot cannons, and sometimes come alongside to fight and aim for victory.&#10;The big difference between Wings of War and Winds of Caribbean is that the former has the same direction of movement and attack, while the later has different directions of movement and attack. The theory of naval battles during the age of sail was to face the enemy on the side where the cannons were lined up, and this game also reproduced that. You can experience a different battle from the air battle, such as how to switch between movement and attack. In addition, the cannon reflects the performance of the time, it requires loading of bullets for each attack and the rapid fire does not work, and if the ship moves violently, the hit rate will drop or it will not be possible to load. It also includes the element that if a fire breaks out due to being hit, the fire must be extinguished. When ships collide with each other, side-to-side battle (aboldage) also occurs. Some ships are better at this, so pirate style is also possible.&#10;The feature of the component is that the display such as loading of bullets and decrease of hit rate is set to &quot;character + lines&quot;. It is also an expression that the commander's ability and command occupy a large weight in the naval battle at that time.&#10;There are three types of ships: caravel, carrack, and small galleon.&#10;&#10;",

This PR plan includes making subordinates public relations idols, and it is important for players how to make their idols active.&#10;&#10;The outcome of the game is determined by the total number of PR points earned at the end of the game.

There are 24 types of projects, and the points and contents are different, but a &quot;budget&quot; is required to compete for these, and the speed at which these budgets can be recovered depends on the abilities of each idol. If you spend a lot of time collecting your budget, no matter how big a project you get, you may lose to another company that has more projects.&#10;&#10;In addition, some projects may have synergistic effects with other projects, and some may affect subsequent activities. For example, the &quot;manner training&quot; card has 0 PR points, but it has the effect of improving the &quot;social&quot; ability.

Each cat has a score, and the player who collects a certain number of points wins the game.

However, happenings such as stray cats and crows may appear, so it does not go exactly as planned.

Players will fight in the position of commander of the Japanese task force centered on the aircraft carriers Zuikaku and Shokaku, or the commander of the US task force centered on the aircraft carriers Lexington and Yorktown.&#10;&#10;Battles between aircraft carriers include elements such as searching for enemy locations, air defense plans, and the formation and rotation of attack units. While covering these elements, I tried to reproduce the air and naval battle at that time with a system that was as simple as possible like a card game. The game also includes the presence of friendly forces, geographical advantages, and technical differences such as radar.&#10;Especially the search for enemy is the heart of this game. By repeating the search for enemy, the location of the enemy will gradually be narrowed down, but it is the same for the opponent. It's better to find the enemy early, but you also have to think about defense. You will feel the excitement because you do not know the movement of the opponent.&#10;&#10;",

You can enjoy the trade-in that suits your style.&#10;&#10;The starting line at the start of the game is the same for all players. The number of territories, economic power, and human assets are the same. From there, players will continue to prosper their country while acquiring cards for their policies and territories. You may focus on industrial development such as &quot;hydraulic control&quot; and &quot;land survey&quot;, or you may focus on commercial promotion such as &quot;free trade&quot; and &quot;money casting&quot;. Of course, you may expand your territory and make your country bigger by the battle unique to the Sengoku period. Ultimately, who enriched the country the most is determined by the total number of victory points on those cards, so it's completely up to you what direction you're aiming for.&#10;&#10;Of course, among the routes mentioned above, the expansion of the territory has a great deal of economic gain, which greatly contributes to victory. However, the act of relying on force is not unrelated to the interference of other countries. In addition, events such as storms and floods and riots occur suddenly, so territorial management does not go as planned. Sometimes it will be necessary to make bold use of human resources during the Sengoku period.&#10;&#10;Is it possible to outsmart the speculation of other countries and build the richest country in Japan?&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to transform your neighborhood from a late-stage capitalist hellscape into a slacker Marxist utopia.&#10;&#10;The game is turn-based.  At the beginning of every round new Narratives and Aktions are drawn and voted on, and the police and the Medic will take their turns. There are no discreet game stages, but the early game will likely be focused mainly on looting and burning, which builds up your characters and the POZ.  The Police are quite tough, and players are unlikely to be able to defeat them early on.&#10;&#10;When space for building has been cleared out and players have amassed a large enough arsenal, it will be time to bring the fight to the Man.  The police work on a simple AI (similar to Space Hulk).  They will be relatively passive early on but their aggressiveness will increase as the POZ grows.&#10;&#10;POZ is semi-cooperative, and there are two conditions for winning:&#10;&#10;a) The POZ must be built up, the police must be defeated, and the courthouse must be occupied.  This is a group effort which benefits all players.&#10;&#10;b) Once the courthouse is occupied, however, only the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Great Battles of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine is the sixth expansion to Amabel Holland's Table Battles, taking as its subject the not-exactly illustrious career of its namesake. Oh, the six battles in this set are &quot;great&quot; battles, including some of the most famous engagements of the eighteenth century. But they're not famous because of Charles, who is widely regarded as one of the worst commanders in history. They're famous because of guys like Frederick the Great and Maurice de Saxe, who ran circles around our boy Chuck, inflicting one humiliating defeat after another. Of course, the battles didn't have to end the way they did, and perhaps with your skill and a little luck, the outcomes might be very different!&#10;&#10;This builds on some of the layers added in the last two expansions, and adds some new wrinkles of its own! Linked formations support one another, and tactical victory conditions allow you to win by attrition when a more decisive outcome is out of your grasp. Cards are demarcated as Infantry or Cavalry formations (with illustrations!), and the new Shift mechanic allows you to move forces of a certain type from one card to another. This not only can shore up places where your lines are weak, but if you concentrate enough force in one area, the resulting Oblique Attack can inflict heavier casualties on the enemy.&#10;&#10;",

Specific units and their strengths are hidden from your opponent as you perform a tense dance of cat-and-mouse maneuvers. This is especially important when modeling George McClellan&rsquo;s ill-fated Peninsula Campaign, where doubts about enemy numbers and positions exacerbated the extreme caution that saw the promise of &ldquo;the young Napoleon&rdquo; give way over the course of these operations to his reputation as a passive, bewildered commander who was hopelessly outmatched by his Confederate counterparts. If they want to succeed, the Union Player will need to be bolder and more decisive than Mac; the Confederate Player, for their part, must use a skillful mix of maneuver, bluff, and nerve to stymie the enemy&rsquo;s advance on Richmond. Knowing when to attack and when to hold back, when to run and when to make a stand, are paramount, and as ever, subject to the fortunes of war.&#10;&#10;",

Different players have different Victory Objectives. Government and Rebel players are trying to eliminate each other and be the last player on the board.

The game ends when a player meets their Victory Objective, OR if 10 turns have progressed without anyone winning outright.&#10;&#10;Proxy War is made up of 10 turns, with each turn having 3 phases: Collection, Negotiation, Action. During the Collection phase, Government and Rebel players collect Resources cards from the tiles they control. In the Negotiation phase, players trade Resources and Equipment, discuss building Factories together, and coordinating their actions for the Action phase. During the Action Phase, players will have a menu of actions but they can only choose three actions per Action phase (Build, Move, Support, Bombard).&#10;&#10;",

Frogs are at war, and both armies face off in a battle.&#10;&#10;Both players draw from a single deck, which has only 16 cards, and play (summon) frog cards face-down or face-up on their playmat. The frogs have values for attack and defence, and if an attacking frog has a higher attack than the opponent's defence value, it wins.&#10;&#10;Cards are either played up as attack cards, and immediately attack, or sideways as defence cards. Cards played face down do not have to be revealed until attacked.&#10;&#10;Some of the frogs have special abilities, which are triggered immediately they make an attack. For example, a Knight can switch the mode of one of the opponent's summoned Frogs from ATTACK to DEFENSE, and vice versa.&#10;&#10;Each player has ten hit points at the start, and if an attack penetrates the defence, the player loses hit points. Crucially, if the deck is exhausted, the player with the fewest hit points wins. But if the deck is still in play, the player at zero hit points first loses.&#10;&#10;The game is published in a Black edition and a White edition, with different frog armies with different strengths and special abilities.&#10;&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It has been a long time since Cherry &ldquo;the Good Magician&rdquo; lost her grandfather in the great magical battle that would change the world of Kawarando forever. Since then, the young magician has been taking care of the Magical Forest with the help of her inseparable friend Ito, a brave and crazy character from the culopochos village. Together they take care of the crops in the garden where the best obakameshi (consciously evolved foods) fruits and vegetables grow, and that's not an easy task. When the harvesting season arrives, they must face the so-called Bad Roots, who will not hesitate to bite the harvesters and try to eat the other obakameshi roots.&#10;&#10;In this game there are 3 types of root cards: radishes, turnips and carrots. Although the 3 are differentiated by the back side of the cards, they are shuffled together to form an unique playing deck. After this, the first 3 cards are placed face down on the table, and the active player will choose which root shoot to draw (reveal). The obtained roots will be placed on the table from left to right, forming rows of each type of root. If a Bad Root appears, it should be placed to the left of the row of cards of its root type. If the player doesn't do anything to remove the Bad Root it will eat one root of its type at the end of every turn.If a second Bad Root (no matter what class it is) appears on the same player's table, they will both devour each other. A misterious character named Tomatenstein will also appears on the cards. When it shows up it will take all the Bad Roots that are in play directly to the discard area.&#10;&#10;In addition, each player will have 4 Ito action cards from the beginning of the game. With them they can send the Bad Roots to other players' zones, eliminate them, or cancel the last revealed card.&#10;&#10;Each root collected has a score. When the cards in the game deck are gone, the game will be over. The player with the most root points will be the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Then Darwin Awards party card game is for you!&#10;&#10;Darwin Awards is comprised of 4 different decks of cards; there are Location, Action, Object, and Death cards. For advanced gameplay, you can add a 5th deck, Announcement cards.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 2 of each type of card. One player starts off as the Judge. Starting with the player to the Judge&rsquo;s left, the players will use the cards in their hand to make up a story. The story will be how someone dies by the Death card at the location stated in the Location card by doing an action from the Action card with an object from the Object card. Example: Location Card &ndash; Windsor Castle, Action Card &ndash; Doing the Chicken Dance, Object Card &ndash; Moon Shoes, Death Card &ndash; Choked on a bottle cap&#10;&#10;Once each player has told their story, the Judge then chooses the story they liked best. The winning player will keep the Death card to track how many rounds won and all used cards are set off to the side. The player to the Judge&rsquo;s left will be the next Judge and deals a fresh set of cards to each player and new stories are told. The first player to collect 3 (or as many as the group wants to play) Death cards is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",
