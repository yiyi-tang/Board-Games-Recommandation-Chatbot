It's based on the Confederacy's program of long-distance commerce raiding, with action taking place around the globe. Famous raiders like the Alabama, Florida and Shenandoah take to the high seas in search of fat Yankee merchantmen, while the U.S. Navy upholds its proud tradition of protecting the nation at any cost.&#10;&#10;The map covers the entire world, as Confederate raiders attempt to ruin Yankee commerce, while the Union strangles the Confederacy's cotton-based economy with a tight blockade. While the search procedure is very different from Hearts of Iron, given the vastly different map scales, combat is resolved in exactly the same fashion.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;44 1.3&quot; x 2/3&quot; long counters; 88 2/3&quot; square counters&#10; 1 34&quot; x 22&quot; strategic map; 1 25&quot; x 24&quot; tactical map&#10; 1 16 page rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Tune in &#10;next Time Their Ideas) is a card game for 2-5 players for an hour or so, where players are the managers of new soap operas during a trial period: the player whose show draws the highest audience (as determined by what events occur on their soap opera and which characters each involves) will go on to the main season!  Just like real soap operas, the twists and turns of the plots in the game can be unbelievable, outlandish, tragic or funny.&#10;&#10;There are two main decks in the game: Events and Characters. Every Event lists what types of characters can be involved and have a point value. Every Character has a sex, a sexual orientation, a point value, and a typecast (a special rule that applies to that character). The strategy lies in developing your soap opera to allow more exciting events as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;Soaps is not a spoof on any particular show: it mocks all TV drama. No specific knowledge is required.&#10;&#10;The game is quite simple: an 8-year-old could PLAY it, but a parent might not be pleased if the child's show were to feature adultery, homosexuality, murder, etc.&#10;&#10;",

Expenses are both fixed (for insurance, etc) and determined by random card draw. For example, a card may say, &quot;You have a child go to college, pay $50 a month for the next 16 months.&quot; Players are also allowed to take loans, which of course increases monthly expenses.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 24 months. The player with the highest Net Worth is the winner.

However three shorter scenarios are provided which can be completed relatively quickly: Italy, Spain and Africa. Unlike several other games on the topic this one highlights the overwhelming Roman advantages: better troops, control of the sea, massive manpower, loyal colonies, the Fabian strategy and, eventually, better generals. Disunity in Carthage is also featured. RAC is a boxed game consisting of map, 420 mounted (but not die-cut) counters, a 24 page rules manual and a play sheet containing the game&rsquo;s charts and tables. 6-sided dice are required for play but not provided.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The concept of the game is to translate the abstract number range of 1-10 into a number landscape, where children can grasp and comprehend numbers as something concrete. The Numberland (Zahlenland) concept has been developed continuously since the 1950&rsquo;s &ndash; notably by one of the designers,Dr. Gerhard Friedrich. The basic idea for this game is taken from the German bestseller &ldquo;Komm mit ins Zahlenland&rdquo; (&ldquo;Come with me to Numberland&rdquo;) by Friedrich de Galg&oacute;czy. The game can be used for as preparation for school and as a learning companion during the first school year. The following mathematical concepts and skills are addressed in gameplay:&#10;&#10;Cardinal number aspect (quantity aspect): Numbers are used to indicate the number or cardinality of the elements of a set (e.g. 6&#10;apples, 3 pine cones).&#10;&#10;Ordinal number aspect (order aspect): Numbers are used to indicate position in an ordered set (e.g. first, third etc.).&#10;&#10;Arithmetic aspect: Numbers indicate the result of an arithmetic operation, e.g. an addition (e.g. 5 = 3 + 2)&#10;&#10;Geometric number aspect: Numbers are used to identify geometric shapes (e.g. pentagon, triangle).&#10;&#10;Numeric image: Numbers are represented with the aid of numeral and dice images.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Numberland consists of 10 number houses, in each of which a number lives. Numberland has to be constructed correctly. But the number goblin, Jumble, is on his way from Mistake Forest to bring disorder to Numberland. Can the players stop him and build Numberland? Luckily they have the Number Fairy to help them. The players roll a die and if they roll a Numberland symbol they can construct on one of the buildings (which are completed in numerical order). If the players roll the Number Goblin their constrcutions will be mixed up and remain so until someone roll the Number Fairy, then the mix up can be corrected. Once all houses are finished we will see if Numberland is still jumbled or correct!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "War Game Rules for Conducting Eighteenth Century Battles&#10;&#10;From Wikipedia&#10;The rules in Grosstaktik govern weapon fire and melee. The results of weapon fire are decided by casting a six-sided die and adding modifiers to account for factors such as distance. The types of weapon fire, in increasing order of deadliness, are carbines, solid shot batteries, muskets, rifles, and grape shot batteries.&#10;&#10;When enemy troops encounter each other, they cannot fire and must engage in melee. Each side rolls a six-sided die, multiplies the result by the number of units in action, and then adds modifiers to account for the quality and morale of the troops. The ratio of the higher and the lower number is then computed, and this ratio determines whether the side with the lower number stands fast, retires, is routed, or surrenders. Surrendering is the best result from the point of view of the victor, and occurs when the ratio is 2.5 to 1 or higher.&#10;&#10;Grosstaktik is appropriate for re-enacting battles from the War of the League of Augsburg, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the War of American Independence. The booklet includes short descriptions of each of these conflicts.&#10;&#10;Note:  Publisher not list.  Game is listed on back page along with other games from Guidon Games. Red Cover.&#10;&#10;",

The roll determines your fate:  a 6 causes your Marker to be born and gives you an extra roll.  If your opponent lands on a square occupied by one of your Markers, it's back to Bornless for you.  If Lady Luck is on your side you can protect your Markers by placing two in a square to form a Bar and block your opponents.  The path to Heaven is rife with exciting twists of fate.&#10;&#10;In all variations of play, the first player to get all his or her Markers into Heaven wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Furoticon is an adults-only anthro novelty card game, focusing on strategy and artwork. The cards are available for purchase online, or at furry conventions, such as Anthrocon and Further Confusion.&#10;&#10;In Furoticon, you play as an Owner of your harem, pitting your Furres (characters) against theirs, where they will use their wit and sexual prowess to break through the opposing harems and bring their owners to orgasm. The last Owner to remain without climax is the winner!&#10;&#10;Each player in the game typically uses a 40-card deck, known as a Black Book. There is a shorter variant of the game where a 20-card deck is used, and each player starts with half Stamina Points (life).&#10;&#10;The cards are meant to be traded amongst players and collectors. Decks can be customized and improved with cards that the player owns. Cards from any of the five sets can be used interchangeably.&#10;&#10;One of the main purposes of Furoticon is to introduce players and collectors to artists that they may not have known about before. Artist credit, as well as a URL to their site, is found at the bottom of every card to encourage people to explore the artists of Furoticon.&#10;&#10;Harem members move from the Owners' Haven to the Scene, where the players can then enter Bed with their furres, and attempt to climax the other furres. Each card has a number of traits that affect gameplay, including Gender, Species, Pleasure Experience, Skills, and more. In addition to Furre cards, there are also Treats and Actions, which act as items and instant effects in the game to add a bit more depth and strategy.&#10;&#10;There are five sets so far, each with its own theme:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Vanilla: Also known as &quot;1st Vanilla&quot;, the Vanilla set was the original Furoticon set to be produced. With 179 playable cards, it provided the foundation upon which the rest of the game was built. There was no overall theme with this set, focusing instead on developing strategies and gender characteristics, as well as providing appealing artwork. 1st Vanilla boosters are no longer available on the Furoticon store, but the original Herm and Otherkin starters are still available for purchase.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Triskelion: Triskelion is Furoticon's premier BDSM set, focusing on masters and slaves, and bondage and pain play. Gameplay heavily focuses on adding &quot;pain counters&quot; to furres, which alter the Pleasure Experience (attack) values in either a positive or negative manner. Additionally, Alteration treats are prominant in this set, providing boosts to the Furres they're attached to, symbolizing bondage gear. Triskelion boosters are no longer available for purchase, but the two Starters (Male/Herm and Female/Otherkin) still are available on their website.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Second Vanilla: Second Vanilla focuses on college life, and showing the life and sexual adventures of such characters as Boy Toy and Lily Tyla. The set has no real gimmick, instead focusing on expanding the underlying foundation of the game. Second Vanilla boosters are running very low (as of December 8, 2013), and will soon be out of stock. There were no Second Vanilla starter decks.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tribes of Tanglebrook: Tribes of Tanglebrook focused on a Tribal setting, with transformation and tribal markings being the prominent theme. Each Tribe in the set has a specific gameplay focus, from Wolves and their ability to intimidate furres from entering bed, to Dragons and their slow, but extremely powerful abilities. Tribes of Tanglebrook is still available in the Furoticon store, both with Boosters and with the three Starter Decks (Otters, Wolves, and Dragons).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Third Vanilla: Strawberry:  Third Vanilla: Strawberry (Or just &quot;Strawberry&quot;) continues the college setting introduced in Second Vanilla. This set introduced Owners with special stats that alter the core rules of the game. The set did not introduce many new mechanics, instead focusing on developing the group play dynamic of the game further, and making the game easier for beginners to get into. Boosters for this set include 15 cards instead of the previous 10, and while there are no starter decks, there are two &quot;starter boxes&quot;, which come with four &quot;mini-decks&quot;, made up of 20 cards each, and designed to be used out of the box with up to 3 other players.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Di'Ahla's Awakening: Di'Ahla's Awakening is the second BDSM themed set in the Furoticon lineup. Apparently taking place before and after the events of &quot;Triskelion&quot;, It serves as an addition to the gameplay elements introduced there. Pain counters and the &quot;Masochist&quot; and &quot;Sadist&quot; abilities reign dominant in this edition just as in &quot;Triskelion&quot;. Overall simply an expansion to the overall theme and gameplay alterations made by &quot;Triskelion&quot;. There is also a BDSM Starter Set for sale which includes both of the two-player deckboxes from the &quot;Di'Ahla's Awakening&quot; edition as well as two starter decks from the &quot;Triskelion&quot; edition.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is another set planned to be released by July 2014:Fortune at Vell's End.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to XXXenophile.&#10;&#10;",

It is the culmination of a vision for a fantasy setting that avoids the normal races derived from the works of Tolkien and the ever-applicable excuse that 'a Wizard did it'. Twilight has a deep and complex history in which creatures and cultures have evolved, each in their own way. The game of Twilight explores this world, beginning in the settlements of the Empire, under constant attack from the vicious Devanu tribes that scrape a living by preying on livestock or unwary travellers. However, this is just the beginning and there is much more to be uncovered, as the world of the Fubarnii themselves is on the brink of change.&#10;&#10;",
