    "Description": "This Accursed Civil War is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the First English Civil War: 1642-1646. It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.&#10;&#10;The battles included in this game are:&#10;&#10;Edgehill, 23 October 1642&#10;    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.&#10;&#10;First Newbury, 20 September 1643&#10;    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.&#10;&#10;Marston Moor, 2 July 1644&#10;    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.&#10;&#10;Second Newbury, 27 October 1644&#10;    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.&#10;&#10;Naseby, 14 June 1645&#10;    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.&#10;&#10;2nd Printing Note: This reprint version will include an updated series rulebook and playbook and an Edgehill variant scenario, as well as numerous updates to the counters. Certainly we'll update any other errata as we find it for the new version, but it is otherwise unchanged from the original edition.&#10;&#10;COUNTERS: 635 full-color die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;MAP: Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color back-printed mapsheets&#10;&#10;OTHER: &#10;&#10;    One 10-sided dice&#10;    16-page Rulebook&#10;    24-page Playbook&#10;    2 11x17 Player Aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ben Hull&#10;DEVELOPER: Marty Arsndorf&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

    "Description": "An Emperor's life is stressful and full of tough decisions. He absolutely needs a place of solace where he can relax and recover. A beautiful garden filled with paths, statues, and flora is just what he needs.&#10;&#10;In Zen Garden, the players assume the role of architects working to build the most beautiful garden for the Emperor. To do this, they need to pay careful attention to the Emperor's preferences, while trying to stay one step ahead of the competition.&#10;&#10;A turn in Zen Garden is simple: The first player selects one tile from the selection board, pays its cost, then adds it to their garden adjacent to a previously placed tile. Each player does this, then the board is refilled and a new starting player begins the next turn.&#10;&#10;Zen Garden comes with five preference boards that determine which features of the garden score in that game. The boards selected (and their number) will greatly change the objectives players will strive for in that game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bitter Woods is a mid-complexity wargame on the last great German offensive in Dec 1944, commonly known as the &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;. The map depicts the area of operations, the Ardennes area at the borders of Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxemburg. Prominent features like roads, rivers and cities are depicted. A hexagonal grid is superimposed over the map to regulate game play. Each hexagon is 2 miles across, unit size is brigade and regiments. Each turn represents 12 hours of real time.&#10;&#10;Game features include morale, prominent leaders, blitzkrieg tactics, German army boundaries, initial surprise, Allied air power and much more.&#10;&#10;This is the Deluxe Edition, an entirely new version (fourth edition) of the game.&#10;&#10;First off, the map is printed on heavy cardstock to avoid the problems with paper mapsheets. Improved &amp; updated the graphics for everything all around, and increased the size of the game counters to 5/8&quot;. Enhanced the Rulebook with new scenarios, additional variants, rule updates &amp; clarifications, included a Players Handbook, updated the designer's notes, and much more! There are full COLOR player aid cards, Random Events are introduced, they've updated the cartography (the map graphics), provided an updated Order of Battle, the hexes have been enlarged to contain the larger game counters, and variant counters are also introduced.&#10;&#10;For those of you with distinguishing tastes in their choice of wargames, this has also been acclaimed by the noted designer and expert on the subject, Danny S. Parker. The beautifully rendered tank graphics, especially for the Germans in their Autumn camo-pattern, is superb to say the least.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 12 hours&#10;Hex: 2 miles / 3.5 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 30 x 44&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (384 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page rulebook&#10;One 28-page Players' Handbook&#10;Two Players' Aid Cards (TEC &amp; CRT)&#10;One German Order of Appearance Card&#10;One American Order of Appearance Card&#10;Two Variant Scenario Cards&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "North Africa &lsquo;41 covers the campaign in North Africa from Rommel&rsquo;s first offensive in late March 1941 through the end of December 1941. During that period Rommel&rsquo;s forces dashed across Cyrenaica and made it to the Egyptian frontier. However, he was not able to take the critical port of Tobruk defended by the stubborn Australians. With superior tanks, combined arms doctrine, and 88mm Flak guns (used as anti-tank weapons) the Axis forces successfully fought off two counterattacks from the east&mdash;the Allied operations called Brevity and Battleaxe. Later in the year, before Rommel could make his planned assault against Tobruk, the Allies launched Operation Crusader and drove the Axis forces back to their original starting positions at El Agheila.&#10;&#10;North Africa &rsquo;41 allows players to study the campaign and refight it with their own strategies. The game includes a detailed map of the Western Desert and a meticulously researched order of battle.&#10;&#10;The game uses the simple Move-Fight-Supply game system developed in Normandy &rsquo;44 and Holland &rsquo;44. Important elements like supply, troop quality, tank quality, artillery support, and command and control are all reflected in the game.&#10;&#10;Game Scale&#10;1 hex = 8 miles&#10;1 game turn = half a month = 2-3 impulses of 3-8 days each&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Components&#10;2 maps -  One 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; mapsheet and one 22&rdquo; x 28&rdquo; mapsheet (total area 22&quot; x 61.75&quot;)&#10;2 counter sheets (9/16&rdquo; counters)&#10;2 setup and reinforcement cards&#10;2 identical CRT/TEC player aid cards&#10;1 rule book&#10;1 play book with extended example of play, design notes, and historical notes&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;&bull; Enter Rommel: March-June 1941 (7 turns, both maps)&#10;&bull; Campaign Game: March-December 1941 (19 turns, both maps)&#10;&bull; Crusader: November-December 1941 (3 turns, both maps)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The players decide whether they want to play the standard four-quarters football game or one of three scenarios. The scenarios put the offensive player in an on-field situation. When the offensive player scores or is forced to surrender the ball after failing to score, the players exchange roles and the new offensive player plays under identical conditions.&#10;&#10;Play action begins with the defensive player secretly chooses a die. The color of the die determines the defensive stand: against the running play, a short pass or a long pass. The offensive player then announces which of the three plays will be enacted. Defense rolls the die. Offense rolls three dice. Each player checks the appropriate table for results. The higher the number rolled by the players, the more effective their choices were, generally.&#10;&#10;Pizza Box Football is shaped like a pizza box... and it opens up into a head-to-head football strategy game designed to offer all the intensity of real football in every play. Players unfold the game board (the field) and lay it inside the unfolded pizza box. The cards guide the players as they play and show the players which dice to roll.&#10;&#10;Players must apply football strategy in order to win (when to run, when to short pass, when to long pass and when to try to fool the other team). Also available are additional plays from the expansion (sold separately) that extend the offensive strategy to include draws, screen passes and play-action passes and add run blitzes, route jumps and QB blitzes for the defense.  These plays work with the existing PBF game.  (The full expansion features 32 teams with different strengths on offense and on defense.)&#10;&#10;Pizza Box Football lets players feel like a coach, a player and a fan all at once. Its robust, statistically accurate play satisfies even the most demanding football fanatic while remaining accessible enough for the younger or casual fan. Four game options let opponents play for 5 minutes or an hour, they decide.&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 game board, 5 play cards, 13 color pegs, 13 dice, 1 expansion game preview card, 1 instruction booklet, 1 stat sheet tablet. For 1 or 2 players (solitaire rules available at www.PizzaBoxFootball.com). Made in the USA, this game's clever design allows it to pack up into its pizza box, and yet it is sturdy enough for play anywhere.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Pizza Box Football Expansion&#10;    Pizza Box Football 2006 Expansion&#10;    Pizza Box Football 2007 Expansion&#10;    Pizza Box Football 2008 Expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Who will be the best dog?&#10;&#10;In the trick-taking game HUND, which was first released as ebbes, players try to collect as many points as possible, but initially no one knows which suit will generate positive or negative points! To start a round, shuffle the deck of cards, which has five suits, and deal players their hand. Next, reveal a number designation card from a separate deck. Let's say it's 3.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to traditional trick-taking games. The lead player for a trick plays one card, and the other players must follow suit if possible, while throwing any other card if they can't. The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless one or more trump cards were played, in which case the highest trump wins the trick &mdash; but at the start of the round, trump is undetermined! The first time a 3 is played, the color of that card becomes trump for the rest of the round. What's more...&#10;&#10;&#10;     The color of the second 3 played determines which color is worth 1 point per card at the end of the round.&#10;     The color of the third 3 determines the &quot;hund&quot; color; at round's end, the player(s) who don't have the most or fewest cards of this color each earn 3 points.&#10;     The color of the fourth 3 determines which color is worth -1 point per card.&#10;     The color of the fifth 3, which is evident as soon as the fourth 3 is played, allows the player who collects the most of these cards to determine the start player of the subsequent round after cards for that round have been dealt.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game includes color markers to track this information.

    "Description": "To survive the long and terrible winter approaching, the dwarves need to prepare. It&rsquo;s time to collect gems, build castles and stock up enough food. The fire dragons are sleeping. The giants of winter, lurking. The fall is precious and is vital to plan your actions wisely.&#10;&#10;Dwar7s Fall is a game about collecting gems in order to trade it for food. In the meantime you also will need to build your dwarf kingdom and slay some monsters. In this game you have multiple paths to win by choosing carefully your actions.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to perform their actions. Each turn you can do 3 actions (place a realm tile or place one dwarf in a tile or move one dwarf by one tile).&#10;&#10;Each tile has a pre-requisite of how many dwarfs of one player are needed to perform one kind of action. For example: emerald mines have always three slots, but you will need only two dwarfs to take one emerald. When this task is done (collect one emerald) your two dwarfs will return to your pool.&#10;&#10;When a player completes three goals (both open and secret goals are taken into account), the endgame begins. Players who had not played this round make their last turn and, then, the game ends. The points are calculated and wins the match who has more points.&#10;&#10;",

Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Harry Potter 2-Pack is a standalone game that includes the characters Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy.

To win, you need to earn more &quot;star bucks&quot; than anyone else, and you earn those by completing contracts, upgrading vehicles, finding alien technologies and having resources on hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Upgrading your UMVee also provides it with special abilities that can come in handy throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Undermining is a highly interactive game, with player actions sometimes benefiting and sometimes impacting the future actions of others. Competition for resources is important, of course, but using open tunnel spaces to get where you need to go&mdash;and blocking those spaces from opponents&mdash;is also key. Players can still move through other UMVees, but doing so costs battery power, and managing your batteries&mdash;which allow extra actions&mdash;is another important aspect of playing well.&#10;&#10;Undermining comes with a double-sided game board, with player interaction being significantly different from one side to the other. With a random layout of resources, UMVee upgrades, contract variability, and one-off special bonuses from the finding of alien technology, no two games of Undermining are ever the same.&#10;&#10;",

This universal contest is presented through a dramatic history of the siege of a Greek Holy City (Messolonghi) by Ottoman forces during the Greek War of Independence.&#10;&#10;The battle takes place in two maps: one showing the actual city and the forces involved in the siege, and one with the surrounding areas, highlighting the support that each of them provides to both players.&#10;&#10;This game features asymmetrical play. The goal of the invading forces is to manage to get inside the city before the end of the game or force the citizens to abandon the cause by dropping their morale to zero. The defenders, on the other hand, try to withstand the siege and protect the city long enough for the invaders to abandon their attempt either by deciding to leave on their own or by having their morale dropped to zero. The actions of the players are driven by the cards in their hands, which highlight actual events and personalities of that time, while the combat is dice-driven to allow for quick and exciting game-play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Theme&#10;The theme of this game is similar to the original Three Dragon Ante. You are sitting in a bar in a fantasy world, playing cards for gold. The setting is a typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons style bar and the game may be played as a sub-plot of a D&amp;D game if desired.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal is to have the most gold at the point where the first player runs out of gold. In a two player game, you just have to bankrupt your opponent, but in a larger game, you may have to prop up another player until you become the richest.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;A game is played over a series of hands until the end-condition is reached (above). A hand typically consists of playing one of your cards into the centre as an 'Ante' card, then three rounds of card-playing, attempting to play the best set (or 'Flight') of cards. The highest value Ante card determines the amount of gold that every player must contribute to the pot this round. The player who played the highest value Ante card starts the first round. Subsequent rounds are started by the player who played the highest value card in the previous round. Each card has both a numerical value and a power (or ability). However, the power is only triggered if the card has a lower or equal value to the card just played.&#10;&#10;The game is a balance between playing high cards to win the pot of gold in the Ante and playing lower cards to trigger their abilities and improve your hand for a later round.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by itself, or in combination with the original Three-Dragon Ante card set.&#10;&#10;From WoTC site:&#10;This fun card game updates the popular Three-Dragon Ante card game, adding new cards and new ways to foil your opponents! Designed for 2&ndash;6 players, Three-Dragon Ante: Emperor&rsquo;s Gambit showcases dragons and iconic character archetypes from the D&amp;D world. Easy to learn and play, this game is great for everyone, from dedicated D&amp;D gamers to poker fans to casual card players. D&amp;D characters can also play Three-Dragon Ante: Emperor&rsquo;s Gambit within the context of any D&amp;D campaign.&#10;&#10;In addition to the added cards and rules, this game also contains complete rules for the original Three-Dragon Ante card game.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Three-Dragon Ante.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each family has several eligible roosters eager to jump into the world of politics, getting rich and creating a legacy by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;Roosters gain renown for their families by occupying various political offices. Low-ranking officers don't yield much fame, but they hold both the purse strings and the power of the sword. A few roosters in the lower offices of Aedile and Praetor, together with the votes of a few well-paid (and temporary) allies, can clear a path to the luxury and recognition that come with the titles of Censor, Consul, and even Caesar.&#10;&#10;Being Caesar isn't easy, though: fail to bribe and bargain to ensure the welfare of the whole coop and today's Caesar is tomorrow's Coq au Vin. Dead roosters don't earn any more points, but they do offer opportunities for their surviving relatives to exaggerate their accomplishments. All that matters, in the end, is history's judgment, and history can be rewritten.&#10;&#10;Mechanically, players gain and maintain areas of influence through negotiation and voting. The game features a Suffragium marker that players pass after voting to either promote a Rooster to a higher office, or throw him to the fox. Players can also strategically demand bribes for their votes or even refuse to vote (pass) to gain a later advantage.&#10;&#10;Murder, betrayal, votes for cash, fragile alliances, and bloody vendettas will separate the legendary families from the forgotten ones in the struggle to become &ndash; and remain &ndash; Chicken Caesar!&#10;&#10;",

In either case, draw a random polyomino from the box and place it where the crystal started this turn.&#10;&#10;Instead of moving the crystal, you can choose a prophecy token from the main board and add it to a side of your player board. Each player board has four different colors around the four edges, e.g., blue, orange, black, and teal.&#10;&#10;When you fill all the spaces of a level on your player board, take the largest level token from the main board.

    "Description": "&ldquo;The story, of Rome is the most splendid romance in all history...&rdquo;&#10;-F. Marion Crawford, Ave Roma Immortalis, II, IS&#10;&#10;Seven centuries of history are contained in this box.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II is the game of the Roman Empire -the greatest and most glorious empire the world has ever known. The rules book describes the intricacies of Roman political, economic, and military conflict. The game-map portrays the whole Roman world, from Britannia to Parthia, in exacting detail, and the 800 game counters depict individual legions, fleets, and auxiliary units. The thirty-five scenarios examine every major Roman war, civil and external, through 700 years that shaped the Western World. &#10;Many games claim historical accuracy; players will be astonished at the wealth of historical detail in this one. Many games claim to be playable; players will be very pleased at how elegantly Imperium Romanum II joins scholarly historical concern to an eminently playable game system. In short, Imperium Romanum II is the definitive game of the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II is based on West End Games classic Imperium Romanum. More accurate, informative and attractive maps, an increase in the number of unit colors and types, rules substantially revised with an eye to readability, clarity, and historical accuracy, and the addition of new scenarios (and the elimination of some older ones) are just some of the improvements players will find in this thorough revision.&#10;&#10;What You Will Do In Imperium Romanum II &#10;Storm the walls of Rome; plunder provinces; reconquer the Empire; strive for the Imperial purple; war against the Parthians; fight great battles at sea; fight barbarian invasions; mass barbarian hordes to plunder the West; conquer Gaul; cross the Rubicon. &#10;Fight against aristocratic oppression, or for aristocratic stability. Strive to become Rome's absolute ruler, or to defend the republic. &#10;Take the role of Caesar, Pompey, Octavian, Marc Antony, Vespasian, Diocletian, Constantine, Theodosius, Theodoric, Justinian, or Attila the Hun. &#10;&bull; Lead legions, cavalry, horse archers, auxiliaries, and r fleets; distribute donatives to your troops; watch your troops defect because of low morale. &#10;Conspire with other players, and betray them to their foes. &#10;Experience the glory and grandeur that was Rome.&#10;&#10;Suitable for solitaire play. &#10;Some of the 35 scenarios provided can be played to completion in 4 hours or less; others could take as long as 100 hours. &#10;Some scenarios permit as many as 6 players; others as few as 2.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II includes: &#10;&bull; Two full-color maps, total area 22&quot; x 51&quot;, portraying the entirety of the Roman world at 50 miles per hex. &#10;&bull; 800 full-color counters depicting individual legions, auxiliary units, and leaders. &#10;&bull; One 28-page rule book. &#10;&bull; Two 8-page chart booklets. &#10;&bull; One 48-page scenario book including thirty-five scenarios. &#10;&bull; Dice and counter-tray with lock-on lid.&#10;&#10;Design: Albert A.

The more identical symbols are grouped, the more points can be scored. The game is as simple as Sudoku and can also be played alone.&#10;How it is played:&#10;2 dice are rolled and each player has to draw these symbols into their sheet following very simple rules:&#10;- the two symbols have to be drawn in orthogonally adjacent fields. (Single fields previously surrounded with symbols will never be filled.)&#10;- as long as there are adjacent spaces, the symbols must be entered.&#10;The game ends when the sheets are filled or there are no legal adjacent spaces left. Each row and column are scored separately: 2, 3, 4 or 5 adjacent symbols of the same type score 2, 3, 4, 5 points PLUS 4/5 bonus points for 4/5 symbols.&#10;&#10;The Grail Games edition of Criss Cross also includes &quot;Advanced&quot; rules which add a layer of complexity to the base game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Brazen Chariots  is a Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP) game that chronicles fighting in the North African desert towards the end of 1941. Once Axis forces under Rommel had laid siege to Tobruk, they then set about trying to take it. Meanwhile, Commonwealth forces pushed back to the Egyptian border launched several attempts to break into and relieve the fortress. Two of these efforts, BREVITY and BATTLEAXE, lacked the depth needed to accomplish this goal and were utter failures. The third, CRUSADER, was a massive undertaking that successfully opened communications to Tobruk and proved to the British 8th Army that Rommel could be beaten. It also set the stage for Rommel's Gazala offensive in 1942.&#10;&#10;Brazen Chariots is the third game in the Battalion Combat Series, which took players by storm with its blockbuster initial release Last Blitzkrieg: Wacht am Rhein, The Battle of the Bulge and follow-up fast playing game Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine. In Brazen Chariots, the wide-open desert, the limited number of Formations, and numerous shorter scenarios provide players with both a rapid and fun introduction to this highly acclaimed new series. The masterful order of battle research by Carl Fung showcases the forces involved with finer detail than ever before.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     BCS v1.2 rulebook (full color)&#10;     two v1.2 BCS Charts and Tables (full color)&#10;     BCS v1.2 Crib Notes Booklet&#10;     Brazen Chariots game specific rulebook&#10;     three full color 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; maps&#10;     four countersheets (1,120 counters)&#10;     12 scenarios:&#10;        Easter Battle, 1 map, 5 turns&#10;        Battle for the Salient, 1 map, 5 turns&#10;        Operation Brevity, 1 map, 2 turns&#10;        Operation Skorpion, 1 map, 2 turns&#10;        Operation Battleaxe, 1 map, 3 turns&#10;        Operation Battleaxe: Mini-Crusader, 3 maps, 10 turns&#10;        Operation Crusader (Campaign), 3 maps, 21 turns&#10;        Two Map Crusader, 2 maps, 21 turns&#10;        Operation Crusader: Clash of Armor, 3 maps, 19 turns&#10;        Totensonntag, 2 maps, 3 turns&#10;        Operation Crusader: Dash to the Wire, 3 maps, 15 turns&#10;        Operation Crusader: Victory by Logistics, 3 maps, 11 turns&#10;    &#10;     box and dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(description from MMP website)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Latice is a strategy game where you match tiles by color and shape. The game comes with a game board, stones, and acrylic tiles. Most of the tiles contain one of six images (e.g., turtle, leaf, lizard, dolphin) in one of six colors. There are also a few special wind tiles. The game is for 2-4 players, who will evenly split the tiles. You win by being the first player to play all of your tiles.&#10;&#10;The first player selects one tile from their rack and places it in the center square on the board. The next player, and then each in turn, can add one tile to the board, but that tile must be set adjacent to one or more existing tiles, and it must match each adjacent tile based on either color or shape. If you match more than one tile, or you place your tile on one of the sun squares on the board, you get stones that can be traded in for extra moves, allowing you to get rid of your tiles faster. You can also use the special wind tiles to move a tile already on the board over by one square.&#10;&#10;As you play Latice, you&rsquo;ll learn to plan your turns and extra moves ahead of time. You&rsquo;ll strategically use wind tiles to alter the layout of the board, and play both offensively and defensively based on your knowledge of the remaining tiles. Latice has no language, culture, age or gender barriers and can be played by just about anyone. It offers strategic gameplay for adults while still being simple enough for younger players.&#10;&#10;The DELUXE editions come with nice acrylic tiles instead of simple cardboard pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you &quot;buy&quot; a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis. The game has a unique layout and a brightly-colored Egyptian pharaoh look.

    "Description": "The Blitzkrieg Legend simulates Case Yellow, the German offensive in May of 1940 that shocked the world. In less than a month's time it made quick work of Belgium and Holland, shattered the armies of France, and pushed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into the sea at Dunkirk. This twelfth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing and departs from its established norms in using a ground scale of 3 miles per hex and a time scale of two-day turns, and as such is similar to Sicily. The chosen scale lets this lightning campaign unfold a bit more slowly, and gives the densely-packed armies more room to maneuver.&#10;&#10;Case Yellow achieved the largest pocket ever to be created in the war, with the largest number of captured soldiers as well. This result is sometimes looked upon by gamers and historians alike as a foregone conclusion, but Manstein's daring strike through the Ardennes was a gamble that might easily have gone awry. Hindsight suggests the fighting could have gone much differently.&#10;&#10;A range of historical problems confront the player directing the Allies in this game. His French, Belgian, Dutch, and BEF combat units have not yet mastered the faster pace of action in WWII, and therefore are slow and don't fight at full Action Rating when in Move Mode. The Allies are also forced to adopt the historical Dyle Plan (when not playing the what-if version of the campaign), which leaves the French with inadequate reserves behind the Ardennes and too many of their best forces committed to shielding Antwerp and Brussels. Because history tells us the headlong rush into Belgium was primary cause of the quick Allied defeat, an &quot;If I Was in Charge...&quot; version of the campaign is presented to allow both sides to explore some different initial deployments.&#10;&#10;A simple set of campaign objectives are presented, with Victory Point awards centered on the following:&#10;&#10;&bull; The French must vigilantly protect Paris, which is the ultimate German objective. Two more cities along the map's south edge, Verdun and Metz, are also worth points (so the French cannot just abandon the Maginot Line).&#10;&#10;&bull; The possible surrender of Holland is triggered by German armor moving adjacent to any of the three Dutch major cities. Surrender chances are modified if the French and BEF are supporting Holland (which is why French 7th Army initially moved north of Antwerp).&#10;&#10;&bull; The possible surrender of Belgium and BEF Evacuation are triggered when the Germans drive a wedge between the Belgian coast and Paris. Surrender chances are modified, however, if the French and BEF are supporting Belgium (another nod toward the historical rationale of the Dyle Plan).&#10;&#10;&bull; The Germans also win points for battering the BEF, so the Allies are encouraged to keep this force intact.&#10;&#10;The game's special rules are judiciously chosen to evoke the full flavor of the campaign. For instance, the Maginot Line is given its historical due, shown as a strong right shield that can unfortunately be outflanked through the Ardennes. Rules for special operations are something new to OCS, and these can capture enemy bridges and forts (but just on 10 May unless playing an optional rule). As mentioned above, the BEF can get isolated or mauled as part of the victory conditions, and if this happens a ragtag assemblage rides to the rescue: RN Destroyers, special Evacuation Ports, elite Irish and Welsh battalions, and even some Spitfires finally appear to provide some top-cover. Mix in the occasional Pause &mdash; an event that tugs sharply on the panzers' leash &mdash; and you've the kind of chrome that make The Blitzkrieg Legend a tremendous tool for historical study and an exciting source of gaming  pleasure.&#10;&#10;The Blitzkrieg Legend is also a game with tremendous replay value. Presented are 7 scenarios and 3 campaigns. The longest is just 13 turns; the largest fits on a standard 4' x 6' table.  Series veterans know the depth of the model can lead to some long and complex turns, but here at last we have an entire campaign that can easily be played to the finish!&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;&#10;1. South.  The first 4 turns on the southern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Sedan as well as the crossings of the Meuse further downstream by 6th and 8th Panzer.&#10;   2. Center. The first 4 turns on the northern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Gembloux Gap as well as the crossings of the Meuse by 5th and 7th Panzer.&#10;   3. North. The first 4 turns on Map C. Covers the air landings and surrender of Holland.&#10;   4. Mini-Campaign. Links the first three scenarios into a short campaign using two maps.&#10;   5. Sedan. Lasts just 2 turns and uses just a small portion of Map B. Covers the French counterattack and German breakout.&#10;   6. Arras. Lasts just 1 player turn. A teaching scenario covering the Allied counterattack.&#10;   7. Dynamo. Lasts 8 turns. Plays like a campaign game, using just Map A to cover the important events during the last half of the campaign.&#10;&#10;Campaigns&#10;&#10;1. &quot;No Holland&quot; Version. Doesn't include the fighting in Holland, which is &quot;automatic&quot; and not under player control. Uses two maps, the full 13 turns.&#10;   2. &quot;With Holland&quot; Version. Uses all three maps, the full 13 turns.&#10;   3. &quot;If I Was in Charge...&quot;  Several variations on either of the two campaigns are offered.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     OCS Series Rulebook&#10;     TBL Game Specific Rulebook&#10;     Two Charts and Tables Booklets&#10;     Full Color Game Map (two 22x34, one 28x15)&#10;     1,960 Counters (7 counter sheets)&#10;     One 8.5x11 Play Aid&#10;     10 Scenarios (3 of them are Campaign Scenarios)&#10;     Box and Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A mysterious building rise over the hill, bathed with a crepuscular light. Astonished by the strange aura of the Pagoda, you decide to investigate it. Suddenly, a laugh, a shadow which is not yours and an eye with ominous pretensions turns alive. You have broken the peace of ten powerful Japanese spirits (called Yokai) who rested there! Will you find a way to calm their wrath?&#10;&#10;A game of Yokai Pagoda is played through 3 rounds, playing always one card per turn, until someone ends the current round. To play a game, you shuffle the 100 number cards (divided by 10 kinds of Yokai, numbered from 1 to 10), lay out two cards face-up to start the two discard piles, then deal seven cards to each player.  Place the rest as the Pagoda deck, between the discard piles.&#10;&#10;When you play card, deal with one of the following effects:&#10;&#10;     Playing the same Yokai or the same number allows you to give someone one card from your hand.&#10;     With a different Yokai and a higher number you can take one random card from the deck -or- the first face-up card from the opposite dicard pile.&#10;     With a different Yokai and a lower number you can go on with the round as nothing happened -or- end the current round, but only if you have a total amount of three or less points in your hands. But... you must take only into account the lowest card of each kind of Yokai you have!&#10;&#10;&#10;At that moment, everyone keeps the cards from their hand into a personal reserve. After 3 rounds, the one with less points in their reserve wins but... again you must take only into account the lowest card of each kind of Yokai you have.&#10;&#10;Try to match the balance between lose cards or keep the exact amount you need to reduce your score when other player ends the round. In Yokai Pagoda, knowing when to give a card, keep playing or end the round makes the difference!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Doodle City is a quick family game of city building. By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &mdash; all while avoiding pollution.&#10;&#10;Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.&#10;&#10;A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution. Final scores are for connected taxis and for having least/most pollution.&#10;&#10;",

Players play towers to attack hordes, using polyomino tiles to cover monsters until all monsters in a horde are covered, destroying it. Players will earn crystals and gold which can be spent on buying new towers or Tower Modifications to improve and customize their existing towers.&#10;&#10;Monsters come with a range of special abilities that players will have to plan around, passing towers between each other, and positioning attacks to get around magic shields and monster powers. The heroes will also be confronted with game-changing events and elemental disruptions such as volcanoes and cyclones.&#10;&#10;The game is scenario-based and can be played as individual replayable scenarios or as a steadily evolving campaign leading up to big boss fights, hero challenges, and more.&#10;&#10;Kingdom Rush offers simple to learn rules with a high level of tactics for experienced gamers. Upon starting each scenario, players will be able to choose from a range of difficulty levels or even take on the dreaded Iron Challenges which require near-perfect strategies to overcome.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fire in the East covers the war in the Soviet Union from the start of the Barbarossa invasion in June 1941 through the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942. It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.&#10;&#10;Fire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.&#10;There are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.&#10;&#10;The rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.&#10;&#10;Fire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    six 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps (1B, 2A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6A)&#10;    over 2880 die-cut counters (Europa 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42)&#10;    a complete set of rules&#10;    a complete set of charts&#10;    two dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(source: back of the box and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Conquest and Consequence brings the Triumph &amp; Tragedy system to the Pacific/East Asia theater during the same 1936-1945 time period. Like T&amp;T, it is designed for three players, maintaining the three-sided dynamic that adds so much variety and intrigue to the system. Those three sides are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Militarist Japan, the first Asian power to modernize, which seeks to replace the European colonial empires in East Asia with a true &quot;all-Asian&quot; empire, with itself as the natural leader.&#10;    The Communist Soviet faction, which is comprised of the Siberian USSR and the Red Chinese revolutionaries.&#10;    The Capitalist USA faction, which consists of the United States, the British Empire, and the struggling regime of Nationalist China.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game begins in 1936 with the Militarists in control of Japan and expansion on the agenda. Its [war] industry is well-developed, but it is weak in population and particularly resources. Its battle-hardened army has easily overrun resource-rich Manchuria, and a weak China awaits. Japan (like Germany in T&amp;T) has the early initiative due to its well-prepared military. Will it:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move south into China?&#10;    Take the &quot;Northern Road&quot; into resource-rich east Siberia (as favored by the army)?&#10;    Pursue the &quot;Southern Road&quot; to the oil-rich Dutch East Indies advocated by its navy?&#10;    Or bide its time, seeking a better position via diplomatic arrangements with neutrals including independent Chinese warlord states?&#10;&#10;&#10;Japanese aggression in China will likely irritate the sleeping giant that is the USA, but it is far away across the wide Pacific, and Japan has special naval abilities that allow it to compete at sea.&#10;&#10;The Red Chinese have just completed their Long March and re-established their base in inland Shaansi, far from areas of Japanese (or Capitalist) interest. The Red Chinese are very weak militarily but have a secret weapon: Partisans. These are non-military &quot;political&quot; organizations (represented on-map with cardboard counters) that are difficult to eradicate, multiply if ignored, and can be converted into military units when desired (this being ill-advised without sufficient concentration). The Soviet Union, also acutely aware of Japanese expansionism, is desperately fortifying eastern Siberia, which is otherwise thinly defended. Nationalist China is aware of the Japanese threat but must also deal with the internal Communist threat. The United States is disarmed, disinterested, and distracted by the Great Depression. The British Empire is woefully under-defended and overconfident. The USA alliance must build up its economy while somehow improving the military capabilities of the British Empire, Nationalist China, and itself.&#10; The game combines the Pacific naval war and the land war in Asia (including the Chinese Civil War), both equally weighing upon victory. The naval war is dramatic, featuring short, decisive battles and expanded roles for airpower and island bases. In the tradition of Triumph &amp; Tragedy, the three-sided aspect features negotiation, diplomacy, and subterfuge within a multitude of strategic possibilities. Like T&amp;T, the game allows players freedom to diverge from the inclinations and policies of the historical actors and plays in 4-6 hours of constant tension and involvement.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The lock. A simple mechanism meant to protect whatever is on the other side, a means to keep out undesirables, and a symbol for all that is off-limits for the downtrodden and oppressed of New London. It&rsquo;s no wonder, then, that the citizens of this corrupt and diseased city spend their days learning to open locks by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;Four residents of New London have caught the attention of a mysterious figure interested in their unique lock-picking talents. An unusual summons has been issued to each by way of a strange lock box with no more than a time and location inscribed on the bottom. For these four, it&rsquo;s clear a larger game is afoot.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Triplock, a simple, yet not-so-simple abstract challenge of skill and memory from Chip Theory Games. Choose to play solo as you work with the stranger to delve deeper into the unknown secrets of the Royal Company, or hone your skills even further against another master lock breaker while you wait for the right moment to act. Either way, you&rsquo;ll be wracking your brain to solve locks amidst a corrupt world full of intrigue and mystery.&#10;&#10;A game Triplock can be played in 15 minutes or less. Choose your characters, set up your Lock, and draw a diagram. Diagrams give you insight into the Lock&rsquo;s composition and each one you complete brings you closer to solving the lock.&#10;&#10;Using two Action dice and your Character&rsquo;s unique lockpicking Skill, you must discover the mechanisms hidden behind failsafes, working to align them to match your chosen diagram orientation. Simple enough, if it weren&rsquo;t for your opponent's traps and countermeasures!&#10;&#10;Solo play is no less riveting as you select your team and follow the stranger into the bowels of the Station, protected and patrolled by Royal Company. Each character is compelled by their own motivations and unique talents, but their fates are intertwined by criss-crossing paths and the mysterious figure&rsquo;s proposal.&#10;&#10;",

Senior citizens aren't going far, so you score them immediately instead of placing them on the bus.&#10;&#10;To drop off, choose a group of passengers on your bus that match one of the available destination cards &mdash; for example, all men, all girls, or one passenger of each color &mdash; then remove these passengers from your bus and place them under the card. You score points for each card depending on how many people you delivered at once, so aim for large groups. Whenever a player drops off, everyone else can make one of their matching passengers skedaddle, removing them from the bus and placing them in a personal scoring pile with their senior citizens.&#10;&#10;When the bus stop can't be refilled with passengers or only a certain number of destination cards remain, the game ends. Tally your score, earning 1 point for each single card and the listed points for each destination card. If your bus is empty, congratulations! You earn a depot bonus for not stranding passengers on your bus. They will thank you for not doing that...&#10;&#10;",

The 2 campaigns cover the Solomon Islands campaign that lasted from late 1942 to early 1944.&#10;&#10;Also, the aircraft under your command center on the Corsair, but you also get to decide if you want to include Dauntlesses, B-25s, and B-17s as part of your group. Each aircraft has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, the B-17s carry a lot of bombs and are hard to shoot down, but they are terrible versus naval targets and only moderately accurate against all but the largest of land targets.&#10;&#10;The game also goes more in-depth on the tactical options you have while over target. Each turn, each aircraft can become &quot;Offensive&quot; which gives it an attack bonus, but also makes it easier to be attacked when it gets shot at. Likewise, aircraft can be &quot;Defensive&quot; which penalizes their own attacks and makes them harder to hit. &quot;Slow&quot; pilots can &quot;Rush&quot; their attack at a penalty and attack during the Fast pilot step, and &quot;Fast&quot; pilots can Wait and get a bonus if they attack during the Slow pilot step.&#10;&#10;Like the other games in the &quot;Leader&quot; series, Corsair Leader is a solitaire game.&#10;&#10;The game is published in both PDF and Vassal versions.&#10;&#10;Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen&#10;&#10;",

A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &quot;Line-Up&quot; from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five cards to choose from each turn, so every turn there are new options and new surprises.&#10;&#10;When a player has amassed enough Power, he may attempt to defeat the current Stage Boss. When a Stage Boss is attacked, it retaliates against the attacker! With Street Fighter, the action is often one-on-one. Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Chun-Li's Bracelets and Electric Thunder. Each player also has access to a special Ultra card that is one of his character's signature maneuvers.

    "Description": "Tuscany, 1259. As wealth from crafts and foreign trade elevated northern Italy&rsquo;s urban families above the landed lords, rivalries within and among their cities hardened into conflict between two great parties. The Ghibellines aligned with the Hohenstaufen emperors who ostensibly ruled Italy, while the Guelphs backed rival imperial claimants and the greatest challenger to the Emperor&rsquo;s authority, the Pope. Should any faction gain advantage, others coalesced to resist.&#10;&#10;The comuni (republics) of Firenze (Florence) and Siena dominated inland Tuscany at the head of competing alliances. As Guelphs sealed their control of the more populous Firenze, Ghibelline Siena turned to the Hohenstaufen King Manfredi of Naples for help. Local rebellions and reprisals escalated on each side, as political exiles stirred the pot. After Manfredi dispatched German knights to protect his loyal Tuscans, Firenze mustered its people and allies to march on Siena, which responded with its own great army. Pisa and Lucca, Lombardia and Umbria joined in. Guelph and Ghibelline faced off en masse at Montaperti in September 1260, in what turned out a bloody Florentine defeat. As Ghibelline exiles returned to grip Firenze, its Guelphs rallied to Lucca and Arezzo, portending an eternal inferno of fighting.&#10;&#10;Inferno&mdash;the third volume in Volko Ruhnke&rsquo;s Levy &amp; Campaign Series&mdash;visits the conflagration that was 13th-Century Tuscan warfare, factional conflict fueled by the money and burgeoning population of the region&rsquo;s well-to-do cities and mountain valleys. Veteran Italian wargame designer Enrico Acerbi applies his deep knowledge of the age to bring it to life within Volko&rsquo;s accessible medieval-operational system.

    "Description": "In Classic Art, first released as Members Only, players attempt to predict how many works of art will be present in five exhibitions. The riskier your predictions in a season, the more you score &mdash; but only if you're correct, of course!&#10;&#10;The game consists of 65 cards, with 13 cards in each of five categories; eleven of the cards are &quot;positive&quot; and two are &quot;negative&quot;. At the start of each season, players get a hand of cards (7-11 depending on the player count) and two cards are placed face up from the deck in their respective exhibitions.&#10;&#10;In the first round of the season, players may predict how many works of art will be in an exhibition at the end of the current season by placing 1-2 tokens (along with their high risk token) on a prediction space. Each exhibition allows you to bet on whether the art will be rare (bet spaces 1-4) or plentiful (bet spaces 5-8). In each subsequent round, a player must place two cards from their hand in the appropriate exhibitions, then they may place a prediction. They may place only one &quot;double token&quot; prediction in a season, and predicting is optional. When all players have only three cards in hand, they each discard one face down, then place the other two cards in exhibitions. Whenever a negative card and positive card appear in an exhibition, remove them.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, players score for correct predictions. If art in an exhibition is &quot;rare&quot;, i.e., four or fewer works, then all plentiful bets fail, and vice versa. What's more, a rare bet succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or fewer than the bet, e.g., if you bet 3, then you succeed only if three or fewer works of art are present. A plentiful bid succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or more than the bet. The riskier the bet, the higher the payout per token in that successful bet, with players recording points separately for each exhibition.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, tokens on failed bets (other than the high risk ones) are removed from play, while tokens on successful bids are returned to players. If a player has zero or one tokens at the end of a season, all of their tokens are returned to them.&#10;&#10;A player can score at most 10 points in an exhibition. Continue playing seasons until at the end of a season, each exhibition has at least one player who has scored 5 points in it. The game ends at the point, and players tally their scores &mdash; but tokens in the 0-4 range in an exhibition are worthless. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;In Members Only players bet on odd things like how many royal scandals will happen in a month, and in Glenn's Gallery, another version of this design, players bet on the number of customers who will show up to look at types of art, but otherwise gameplay is nearly identical to Classic Art. The only difference is that each player has a dedicated &quot;double bid&quot; token instead of being allowed to bid two tokens once per season.&#10;&#10;Classic Art includes a two-player variant that can be used in prior releases. After dealing eleven cards to each player, set up a ten-card &quot;house&quot; deck. On each player's turn, they play the top card of the house in addition to two cards from their hand. In the last round, play the final two cards from the house along with the chosen two cards from both players.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In 1837, Queen Victoria begins her long reign over the United Kingdom, a country split between Liberals and Conservatives. Liberals strive for social progress, including repeal of the Corn Laws to help feed the working classes, expansion of the electorate to create a real democracy, and Home Rule for Ireland. Conservatives want to slow the pace of change, while advancing their own agenda to maintain order, protect traditional values, and secure the Empire. Her Majesty occasionally interferes in politics, but it&rsquo;s the Prime Minister who really governs the country and sets the political agenda. Ten different Prime Ministers served during Victoria&rsquo;s reign, with varying degrees of success. Now it&rsquo;s your turn to experience Victorian political life, taking on the role of a historical politician. Will you make your mark as a Backbencher? Stir up trouble as a wily Opposition Leader? Or successfully govern the world&rsquo;s greatest empire as Prime Minister?&#10;&#10;In Prime Minister, 1 to 4 players vie for political power and prestige by campaigning for public support, selecting and debating bills, pursuing official appointments, recruiting influential Victorians as supporters, garnering favor with the Queen, and, when the time is right, challenging other players for their leadership roles. Gameplay is partly cooperative with shifting alliances, but only one player can win by holding the Prime Minister&rsquo;s seat at the game&rsquo;s end.&#10;&#10;In addition to the standard multiplayer game, Prime Minister includes a dozen scenarios of varying length and a &ldquo;Clockwork&quot; system featuring automated opponents for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

It takes less than a minute to learn and 20&ndash;30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Whenever you close your eyes, you fall into the dream realm: a world of vivid hallucinations and dark monsters. You must use your wits to draw power from the dream realm and break its hold on you, before the monsters can track you down and consume you!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you randomly draw a number of dice from a shared bag. This represents the dreams you will encounter this turn. Return two to the bag to represent your chosen path through the dream realm and roll the remainder. After you have suffered the effects of your roll, you must choose whether to rest (and clear your card of one or two dreams) or press on and try your luck on another turn &ndash; going deeper and rolling more dice every time you do so.&#10;&#10;You win by collecting 15 power symbols on your rolled dice &ndash; freeing yourself from the dream world's grasp. But if you collect too many of the wrong symbols, you may find yourself twisted and turned by the monsters, until you too become a dreaded Nightmare. Or something's dinner.&#10;&#10;Should you become a Nightmare, your game completely changes. You can still win, but only by consuming the dreams of the remaining Dreamers, or sending minions after them to prevent them from becoming more powerful than you. If nobody has escaped by the end of the game, the most powerful Nightmare is the victor.&#10;&#10;Without dreams, you cannot win. But without control, you risk becoming that which you fear most.&#10;&#10;Or maybe that was your plan all along.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Nothing Gained But Glory will be the fifth volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series. It features several pivotal battles in Baltic region of the late 17th century - a period where rulers struggled to centralize power in their realms and to introduce permanent standing armies instead of expensive mercenary forces. It shows the highly trained and well led army of Sweden struggling to defend its massive gains from the Thirty Years War and the Northern Wars of 1655-1661 against the forces of Denmark and Brandenburg, reinforced by contingents from Austria, the United Provinces, M&uuml;nster, Hesse-Kassel and Poland.&#10;&#10;The personalities in the game include the great Swedish warrior king Carl XI, Brandenburg&acute;s Frederick William (the Great Elector), and King Christian V of Denmark-Norway. Never before have so many monarchs been in one M&amp;P box!&#10;&#10;Nearly all the scenarios in this module are smaller than the typical Musket &amp; Pike scenarios, and thus take less time and space to play. For the same reasons it is a great introductory game to the series.&#10;&#10;The Historical Background&#10;&#10;The Scanian War was prompted by the Franco-Dutch War of 1672-1678. Sweden had allied with France against several European countries, and was eventually forced to fulfill her treaty obligations to France by invading Brandenburg. This invasion was an attempt to force Brandenburg to withdraw from the fighting against France, but the invasion was conducted without the usual energy and force of previous Swedish offensives. When the Brandenburg Army returned home much faster than anticipated the Swedes started to withdraw, but were caught by the Brandenburgers and defeated at the battle of Fehrbellin on June 28th 1675. The previously &quot;unbeatable&quot; Swedish Army had lost a battle, and this key event soon persuaded others to join the war.&#10;&#10;Most notable of these was Denmark, which saw its chance to regain the Scanian lands lost in the Northern Wars. (Scania is the southern tip of Sweden, just across the Oeresund, the Sound, from Denmark.) After mopping up the Swedish possessions of Wismar and Bremen, the Danish Army landed in Scania on June 29, 1676. Danish King Christian V led 15,000 troops against a defending Swedish Army of 5,000 men that were spread out over the province. Initially the operation was a great success. Large parts of the local peasantry sided with Denmark and the outnumbered Swedish troops were in bad shape. Town after town fell into the hands of the Danes and the Swedes had to retreat north to Sweden proper. After a month only the fortified town of Malm&ouml; remained under Swedish control. At sea the situation wasn&acute;t any better for the Swedes, as their navy lost several battles against the combined Danish- Dutch Navy, and left the command of the sea in the hands of the allies.&#10;&#10;Two factors helped to save Sweden from ruin: the splendid courage of their young king who resolutely and successfully kept the Danish invaders at bay, and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, the French king.&#10;&#10;The first ray of light for the Swedish cause came with the battle of Halmstad in August 1675 when the king succeeded in outmaneuvering and destroying a small Danish force sent north to take Halmstad and link up with the forces operating out from Norway. As the Swedish Army slowly grew larger it became possible to meet the Danish main army head on, and the Swedes were victorious at the battles of Lund in December 1676 and Landskrona in June 1677. These battles caused the fighting to stalemate on the Scanian front, as the Danish could supply and reinforce their coastal fortresses by sea, but didn&acute;t dare venture inland to meet the Swedish Army in a field battle again.&#10;&#10;The focus of the war therefore shifted to the German front once again, where the Brandenburg Army was slowly conquering the Swedish fortresses and fortified cities one by one. The Danish Army sent an expeditionary force to the island of R&uuml;gen and captured it, but lost it again in January 1678 after a winter of horrid attrition, when the Swedes returned to the island once more and defeated them in the battle of Warksow. Later in 1678 the Allies would take R&uuml;gen once more, and eventually all the Swedish possessions in Germany were lost.&#10;&#10;Events in Western Europe would once again have far reaching effects on the Baltic as the end of the Franco-Dutch war in 1678 gave France the power to force an end to the Scanian War and dictate the peace treaties of Fontainebleau. These treaties restored almost all the Swedish possessions lost during the war, and so the end result was truly &ldquo;Nothing Gained but Glory.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The 7 battles included in Nothing Gained but Glory are:&#10;&#10;Nyborg, November 14, 1659 - (While not part of the Scanian War, this bonus battle from the Northern War of 1655-1660 features many of the same participants.) The Swedes had occupied the Danish island of F&uuml;nen, but following the landings of two Allied forces and their subsequent combination the Swedes had to fight to win time for an evacuation from the island. With no more room to retreat and the port town of Nyborg&acute;s fortifications in a sorry state, the 7,000 strong Swedish Army positioned itself in good defensive terrain between a lake and a forest. While command difficulties in the 11,000 strong Allied Army almost cost them the battle, the Allies eventually prevailed, forcing the Swedish Army to flee to Nyborg, where it surrendered the next day.&#10;&#10;Fehrbellin, June 28, 1675 - Returning from fighting against France to face the Swedish invasion, the highly mobile Brandenburg Army of 5,600 cavalry and 13 guns faced a retreating Swedish Army of 7,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 7 guns outside the town of Fehrbellin. A poor deployment of the Swedish Army combined with aggressive handling of the Brandenburg cavalry forced the Swedes from the field. Although the losses in the battle were about equal, the Swedish Army was severely reduced by the subsequent pursuit, raiding peasant guerilla, desertion, and starvation. While only of minor importance militarily, the victory had an enormous psychological impact: the Swedes, long considered &quot;unbeatable&quot;, had been bested. With the myth of Swedish invincibility broken, Denmark decided the time was right to settle its scores with Sweden and entered the war. Frederick William henceforth was known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot; and the army that he and Derfflinger had led to victory became the core of the future famous Prussian Army.&#10;&#10;Halmstad, August 17, 1676 - After the initial great successes for the Danish forces following the landings in Scania in late June 1676, a small Danish force of 3,500 men under Jacob Duncan was detached from the main army and ordered to advance north to take the town of Halmstad and if possible link up with the Norwegian forces under General Gyldenl&oslash;ve. Sensing the possibility of destroying the unsupported Danish detachment, the Swedish king reacted and by heavy force marching succeeded in cutting off Duncan from his line of communications, forcing him to fight his way back. Duncan moved against the Swedes, but then went on the defensive. The Swedes took the initiative, collapsed both of the Danish flanks, and then overwhelmed the center, forcing the army to surrender. This battle ended the Danish plans of linking up with the Norwegians, and provided a much-needed boost to Swedish morale.&#10;&#10;Lund, December 4, 1676 - This was the bloodiest battle in the history of Scandinavia, with almost 9,000 killed (out of 12,000 Danes and 8,000 Swedes) after an intense day-long battle fought in the chilling cold of the Scandinavian winter. After a cross-river standoff that lasted for a month, the Swedes attacked when the river froze. The Swedes initially had the advantage, and their right wing (along with the king) routed the Danish left and pursued it off the field. The rest of the Swedish Army was then outnumbered, and just as they were about to succumb, the king and part of his wing showed up in the Danish rear, saving the battle for the Swedes.&#10;&#10;Malm&ouml;, June 25-26, 1677 - Malm&ouml;, the regional capital of Scania, was the only major town that didn&acute;t fall during the 1676 Danish offensive, and had been a thorn in the Danish side ever since. In June 1677 the Danes decided to take the town by besieging it.&#10;When news arrived that the Swedish Navy had set sail to break the blockade of the town and that the Swedish Army was moving to relieve the town, the Danes decided to force the issue and storm the town, even though the siege hadn&acute;t progressed very far. On the Swedish side, the town commander Fabian Fersen prepared his 2,300 strong garrison well, and they fought with desperate courage as they knew it was victory or death. While the Danes were able to scale the wall and break into the city, a determined Swedish counterattack destroyed them before they could open the gates for more Danish troops.&#10;(This is a medium sized battle on a half map with various special rules to reflect the many special circumstances of storming a fortified town at night.)&#10;&#10;Landskrona, July 14, 1677 - After the defeat of the Danish Army at Malm&ouml;, the Swedish king decided the time was right to attack them before they could be reinforced by their German and Austrian allies. He thus moved his 10,000 regulars and 4,000 peasant militia towards the Danish Army located at Landskrona. However, the Danes had received their reinforcements that replenished their numbers to 14,000, and the Danish king felt confident about fighting a field battle. This was a hard-fought battle which saw both armies experimenting with combined arms wings and the personal involvement of the monarchs of both armies.&#10;&#10;Warksow, January 18, 1678 - As the war had reached a stalemate on the Scanian front the Danish forces invaded the island of R&uuml;gen in the fall of 1677. They quickly conquered most of the island except for a small Swedish fortified bridgehead. As supplies ran low and attrition ravaged the army, large parts of the Danish expedition were withdrawn from the island, leaving just under 5,000 men. This allowed the Swedes to transfer 3,500 men from their field army in Germany to the remaining bridgehead in early January 1678 and try to take back the island. The armies met at Warksow, where a Swedish cannonade killed the commander of the Danish Army, paralyzing it. Most of the Danish expeditionary force was captured during the battle or in the aftermath as the Swedes quickly cleared R&uuml;gen.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;1 series rulebook&#10;1 playbook&#10;3 countersheets&#10;2 2.5 map sheets, 2 of which are backprinted&#10;1 10-sided die&#10;3 Player Aid Cards&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After an everlasting period of wars, it&rsquo;s finally time to collect the spoils.  The King has named the feudal lords who will bring glory and prosperity to the conquered lands.  To that end, the nobles will have to hire workers and master craftsmen to make their feuds grow as well as helping in the construction of a glorious cathedral, a symbol of the King&rsquo;s proximity to God.&#10;&#10;Feudalia is a deck-building and resource management game for 1-4 players, who will take the roles of the feudal lords of the new lands.  Each player will rule three feuds, and all the vassals living in them, who will work those lands to improve their territories, all of it while trumping your opponent&rsquo;s progress with military incursions into their territories.  But the King wants his share too, and the tax collector will appear frequently, taking part of the resources stored by the players.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first player to earn 10 points.  Players earn points by building, either developing their own feuds or helping in the different phases of the construction of the cathedral.  During a turn, each player plays their vassals from their hand to gather money and resources, to further invest in new workers or new buildings.  Resources can be saved, but be careful! the tax collector will show at your door when you least expect him, and he&rsquo;ll take half your resources from each feud.&#10;&#10;Manage your vassals wisely, hire the best master craftsmen, spend your resources in the cathedral before the tax collector arrives, and become the most prosperous feudal lord in Feudalia!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Not designed as a detailed simulation, this fun and challenging game illustrates the general strategic course of the 1982 Falklands War between Britain and Argentina, and highlights important historical themes.&#10;&#10;It is two games in one: a naval/air game (whose mechanics are based on the author's &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot; system, but using ships and aircraft instead of armies!) in which the British Player fights against the game system's Argentine &quot;A.I.&quot; to establish control of the skies; and a ground game (modeled after the game system featured in the author's &quot;Mound Builders&quot; and &quot;The First Jihad&quot;) in which the British Player takes advantage of his air superiority to fight and 'yomp' his ground troops across East Falkland to final victory -- or defeat -- in the hills around Stanley.&#10;&#10;The game features all the historical chrome for which this design team is so well known, including Exocet missiles, Falkland Islander civilian resistance, diplomatic shuttles, covert Soviet aid, SAS guerilla missions, Chilean intervention, US assistance, the Gurkhas, helicopters, &quot;ace&quot; pilots, and even the Pope!&#10;&#10;",

The winning bidder places their winning bid (in energy stones) on the acquired spell card; this card will remain in play for a length of time related to the number of energy stones placed on it. Each turn energy stones are removed from the spell cards, and these energy stones are then available again for future bidding (so these energy stones are recycled throughout the game). The spell cards give each player some resource production (four different kinds of metals) and usually a special ability that can be used in the game. With the metal resources, the jewels are auctioned off on the main board and are acquired by the players in their quest to complete their amulet.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by&#10;&#10;&#10;    Wizard's Brew&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Thinking that the battle was over, they pursued the retreating French. However, when General Desaix arrived with reinforcements in the late afternoon, the French started a defiant counterattack and turned the Battle of Marengo into a glorious triumph.&#10;&#10;This game recreates that dramatic battle. One player takes the role of Bonaparte whose troops are scattered at the beginning, while the other attacks with the Austrians. He has to defeat the French, before they can strike back with their reinforcements. Triomphe &agrave; Marengo is fast playing. Departing from almost all wargame conventions, it brings the look of the 19th century linear warfare onto the table.&#10;&#10;Based on the award winning Bonaparte at Marengo and improving it in many aspects, Triomphe &agrave; Marengo offers a unique game experience: The redesigned map gives you wide open spaces for clever manoeuvres; the modified combat system is full of drama; and the novel locale-based morale system is nothing but thrill and tension. Since fights are resolved without dice, it's not Dame Fortune who will decide defeat or victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to A World at War, an immersive exploration of the grand strategies of the Second World War. With roots tracing back to the classic Third Reich, and its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War pushes this gaming system even further, expanding on the detail and choices of what was already a fine family of wargames.&#10;&#10;&#10;A World at War--the game that brings you everything in one meaty box, a far-ranging battlefield where marines and paratroopers slog it out with infantry and armor; where carriers and submarines spar with cruisers and battlewagons; where army planes and carrier planes crisscross the skies with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide what to build, and you decide where to deploy it. Will this corps storm across Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes patrol The Steppes, or hunt the shores of the Med? Choose carefully--for in A World at War, the deployment of troops is crucial. But don't go thinking armaments comprise the only battlefield. The struggle extends deep into other arenas, like into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy, and into your skunk works, through research, and behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not just in drop tanks and detonators, but also in spy rings and wool parkas. Most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you'll tend to obsess over mistakes, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk. But now isn't the time for recriminations--now is the time for action! Will you gamble and surge-research the atomic bomb? Or will you take the exigency--less glitzy and less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? Whatever you decide, decide carefully, for this is bare-knuckled warfare not only across land, sea, and air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on lab benches and in diplomatic pouches. With so many elements in play, can winning strategies ever be more than a cobble or winning choices ever more than an anguish? It's a question only you can answer. But whatever your approach, if you hang on long enough to unleash your final hoard of weapons in one last grand assault, you just may earn that rare chance to annihilate armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the multiplayer card-driven, city-building strategy game Forged in Steel, players take on the role of a prominent family in a burgeoning Colorado county in 1900 as turbulent social and technological changes are about to reshape the way all Americans live. Each family seeks to control one of four sectors (mining, industry, city, or commercial) while also striving to be Mayor to control the appointment of other players to offices.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over three eras (turns/decades), each with multiple phases in which players are dealt eight cards &mdash; all with historic black-and-white photos from Colorado &mdash; and must discard one and bank two for their final turn. Cards are used to either play Municipal Muscle points to build, buy, or seize structures, or used for the &quot;event&quot; listed on every card. Cards can also be used to set yearly &quot;Headlines&quot; or &quot;Themes&quot; which evoke a movement in American society or technology and change VP awards or other variables in the game. Structures are scored by multiplying the amount the sector tracks have advanced by the number of buildings owned. Different tracks progress differently.&#10;&#10;Finally, players can build parks, civic buildings, hospitals, and police stations. These buildings in turn affect further play and cause neighborhoods to have more political votes at turn's end, increase VPs for proximity, or protect against certain negative cards.&#10;&#10;Forged in Steel is an organic building game in that all builds change the landscape and players may build only adjacent to where others have built &quot;the grid/network&quot;. At turn's end, the game decides how many immigrants come seeking jobs based on how many factories and commercial buildings were built that turn. Too many? Unrest grows and there could be a riot, undermining all of your recent city-building efforts. The National Guard will step in to help you, of course, but they are usually outnumbered, and there's often fighting in the streets, so be wary of not contributing to the &quot;Unrest Track&quot;.&#10;&#10;Can your family negotiate the turbulent changes of the early 1900s and become the local political and economic powerhouse? From the New Deal, Women's Suffrage, City Beautiful and Spanish Flu, to sidewalks and paved streets, all aspects of a 1900s western American city are incorporated, and players will learn about the rise of those developments that changed cities, labor, industry, and society forever.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The classic wargame Risk has been updated and revised for 2008. The graphics and components are brand new. Major and minor objectives have been added, along with cities and capitals, plus rewards for completing objectives.&#10;&#10;The new version has a drastically changed victory condition: complete three objectives while controlling your capital. This shortens the game playing time to around 90 minutes.&#10;&#10;There are three rule sets: Basic Training, Command Room and World Conquest. Basic Training is an introduction to the new Risk rules and includes a pre-existing setup for 3, 4 or 5 players. Command Room adds a randomized setup and rewards for achieving objectives. Both Basic Training and Command Room end when a player controls three objectives. World Conquest is an updated version of the classic Risk game of Global Domination: play continues&#10;&#10;",
