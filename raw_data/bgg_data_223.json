    "Description": "Stratego Pirates is an exciting game for two brave pirate captains!&#10;&#10;Can you lead your pirates to victory? The aim of the game is to conquer the flag by boarding your enemy's ship.&#10;&#10;By cunningly flipping the action cards, you can influence whether you get to board, fire the cannon, fight or feed one of your opponents to the sharks.&#10;&#10;Will you be the first to capture your opponent's flag? If so, you win the game!&#10;&#10;For 2 players and ages 5+.&#10;&#10;The difference between Stratego and Pirates! Stratego is the use of the canon and the use of the action tiles. This makes it a much more luck based game and more suitable for little children.&#10;&#10;",

The player who finishes the game with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Everyone has two choices in their turn: either recruit safe-crackers or attempt to crack a safe. One of these two must be chosen every turn.&#10;&#10;The first choice is to take one of your own safe-crackers and put him on any of another player. Put this safe-cracker in that team before you. This way you can build safe-cracker teams in addition to individual safe-crackers. The piece lying on top shows who has the safe-cracking team under their control.&#10;&#10;The second choice is to crack the safe. First a gaze at the safe cards: On each safe card, a value that this safe contains is printed - the loot. Simultaneously it also portrays how large the safe-cracking team must be in order to crack this safe; the team may also be bigger. Place the team on the desired safe, dismantle it and share the loot.&#10;The card with the cracked safe is set aside and a new safe card is uncovered.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the safes are cracked. The player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Buccaneer&#10;&#10;&#10;",

As a result, Ligretto Junior allows for up to five players in a game instead of only four; what's more, while Ligretto Junior cannot be combined with other Ligretto games in order to allow for more players to compete at the same time, it can be combined with different versions of itself, which are often themed with a different series of cartoon characters.&#10;&#10;",

Face down a barrage of threats, and try not to end up as a pile of moondust. You&rsquo;ll need to know when to whip out the blasters, and when to turn tail and flee: because fortune favours the brave, but there&rsquo;s also no point in grabbing the best bounty if you&rsquo;re too dead to enjoy it.&#10;&#10;Space Race is a fast, fun card-drafting game in which 2&ndash;4 players upgrade spaceships, collect sets and bid against one another. The player with the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 108 cards and is played with three types of cards: Parts you build your ship with, dangers you need to fight or flee from, and cards that damage your ship.&#10;&#10;First, each player chooses a cockpit and an engine to build their ship, which they will upgrade during the game.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to score points during the game. For example, you can collect Robot Parts. You receive 2VP for each Robot Part in your ship. Cards of the same type in your ship are stacked.&#10;&#10;You also receive an additional 3VP for each complete robot that you assemble.&#10;&#10;Some cards only award points while others have benefits: a Scanner, for example, lets you look at dangers ahead, giving you an advantage.&#10;&#10;Players begin with six Space cards, and each turn you keep one card and pass along the remaining hand.&#10;&#10;After all three rounds have been played, players&rsquo; scores are calculated. Some cards are worth VP on their own and some cards award extra VP if the card condition is fulfilled. Players also receive negative VP for every Damage card in their ship.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to any other points, you score three times the value of the letter used, plus 5 points. (If you used an opponent's die to create the kwan, that opponent doesn't score for the die.)

Once on the green, there are two methods provided to resolve putting: an actual indoor putting cup (!) or putting dice.  The dice show the ball in the cup or outside of it, requiring a re-roll.  The red die is for long putts, and the green for short putts.&#10;&#10;An eighteen-hole course is provided, nine on each side of the colorful board.

All players also receive 6 action cards. The remaining cards form the action card draw pile.&#10;&#10;All target cards of despots that are not in play must be removed from the target card pile. Then one target card from each despot is turned face up. The remaining target cards are shuffled and form the target card draw pile.&#10;&#10;TheAggrometer is placed in the center of the table and the Aggromarker is placed on the starting postiion of the player's number.&#10;&#10;The game&#10;Nukular is played in two phases. The first phase we call the Cold War, the second phase we call Nuclear War.&#10;&#10;There are four different types of action cards. The organic and black action cards can be played during your turn in the Cold War. Green action cards can be played outside of your turn in the cold war. Red action cards, on the other hand, may only be played during the nuclear war.&#10;&#10;Cold War&#10;&#10;In his turn, a player may play as many orange action cards as he wishes.&#10;&#10;After that, he may program an atomic bomb if he has one in his hand. To program a nuclear bomb, the player places a target card under it and lays the bomb out in front of him.&#10;&#10;Depending on the type of bomb, the selector can choose the target card from the display, draw from the draw pile, or choose from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;After programming, the aggrometer must be advanced one space.&#10;&#10;When the aggrometer reaches the last space, the player triggers the nuclear war with it and shifts into the role of escalator.&#10;&#10;The player completes his turn by drawing 2 action cards and discarding hand cards, if necessary, so that he does not exceed the limit of 8 cards.&#10;&#10;Nuclear War&#10;After triggering the nuclear war, all players, except the escalator, may program one nuclear bomb again in turn.&#10;&#10;After that, each despot may play one red card per turn. The escalator begins.  He may, for example, use a defensive missile to immediately shoot down and dispose of another bomb. Or lay out a nuclear bunker in hopes of protecting it from an enemy bomb.&#10;&#10;There are so many rounds until no one wants to play red cards. If you pass, you don't get to play later.&#10;&#10;Big Badabumm&#10;When no one wants to play any more red cards, the big bang follows. Starting with the escalator, one target at a time is revealed under a nuke.&#10;&#10;If no bunker is available, the affected despot dies and turns over his character card.&#10;&#10;A bunker protects only one bomb at a time and is disposed of afterwards.&#10;&#10;The nuclear bombs of despots who have already died are still launched.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last target card under a nuke is revealed. All despots who are still alive are the winners of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The only hope is to get a dog on board to keep thing in order. Players will have to demonstrate their cunning and a good memory to transport their animals and cabbage to the island.&#10;&#10;Each player receives the same set of cargo cards with wolf, goat and cabbage. Each round a player draws a ship card which will tell him where she can place one of his cards (out of 6 ships available). Everybody needs to remember what is on each ship already, because when the ship gets 3 cards it arrives on the island. But then the rules of food chain apply, so the goat eats the cabbage and wolf eats all goat on the boat. So not everybody will actually reach the island. The goal is to deliver the most cargo cards.&#10;&#10;Players have also 3 special cards which they may use at any moment during their round. Those cards allow them to sink one boat or to make the wind push the boat to the island before it gets full. The animals on the selected boat can also get seasick and return to their players hands.&#10;&#10;",

All the German attempts were &#10;in vain.&#10;&#10;Attacks and counterattacks were continuous and the casualties for both sides were very high.

The result was more mosaic than map.&#10;&#10;After a couple of years, Chancellorsville was dropped from the The Avalon Hill Game Co line. In 1974, The Avalon Hill Game Co released Randall Reed&#039;s revision of the game.

    "Description": "The Battle of Champion Hill game uses the Blue &amp; Gray system.  It was included in the Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine Issue #103.&#10;&#10;The May 16, 1863 Battle of Champion Hill was the largest, bloodiest, and most significant action of Grant&rsquo;s Vicksburg Campaign. 32,000 advancing Union soldiers met 23,000 Confederates in a fierce struggle for a vital crossroads roughly halfway between Vicksburg and Jackson, Mississippi. The field was dominated by bald Champion Hill, from which Confederate artillery opened fire on the Union army at 9:45 A.M. The first Federal assault on the hill drove the Southerners back with bayonets and clubbed muskets. As the Union soldiers tried to reform and consolidate their gains, they were swept away by a counterattack led by John Bowen&rsquo;s Missourians and Arkansans. Ulysses S. Grant ordered more men towards the hill and Bowen&rsquo;s Confederates were themselves driven off, compelling a general retreat. Southern Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman was killed while directing a desperate rearguard action that enabled most of the Confederate army to escape towards Vicksburg. The decisive Union victory at Champion Hill was instrumental in forcing the Confederates out of the open field and into a doomed position inside the walls of Vicksburg.&#10;&#10;Brief summary of rules:&#10;Stacking:&#10;&bull; Up to 2 units may stack, unless optional stacking rule is used, which allows 5 units in one hex, as long as only one is of brigade level or higher.&#10;&bull; Units in a stack must attack the same target.  If desired, one unit of the stack may be withheld from attacks.&#10;&#10;Zone Of Combat/Enemy Zone Of Combat:&#10;&bull; ZOC extends into all 6 adjacent hexes.  ZOCs do not extend across river/creek hexsides, except at a ford or bridge.  ZOC does extend across streams.&#10;&bull; Units entering EZOC must stop moving.&#10;&bull; No unit may voluntarily leave an EZOC except by combat results&#10;&#10;Combat Restrictions:&#10;&bull; Units may only attack or be attacked once per phase.&#10;&bull; Units may not split up their strength points to attack into separate adjacent hexes.&#10;&bull; Units may attack all adjacent units of a group if desired.&#10;&bull; Before rolling  the die, the attacker may choose to reduce the combat odds (e.g., use the 2:1 table when attacking at 3:1).&#10;&bull; Cavalry units attacked only by infantry may retreat 2 hexes before combat is resolved (opt.).  The attacking units may enter the cavalry unit&rsquo;s vacated hex, but they may not select an alternate target.&#10;&#10;Attacker Effectiveness (&ldquo;Ar&rdquo; results):&#10;&bull; Attackers forced to retreat are flipped to their ineffective side.  Attackers remain ineffective until a night turn.  (Retreating defenders remain effective.)&#10;&bull; Ineffective units may not attack, i.e., they may not enter EZOC.  Ineffective units that begin their side&rsquo;s combat phase in an EZOC must retreat.&#10;&#10;Retreats/Advances:&#10;&bull; Units may not retreat off the map or through EZOC.&#10;&bull; One unit of a stack may retreat one hex to make room for another unit retreating into its hex (displacement)&#10;&bull; Any unit that cannot retreat is eliminated.&#10;&bull; A unit that participates in an attack/defense resulting in a hex being cleared of enemy units (i.e., the enemy retreated or was eliminated) may advance into that hex.&#10;&bull; Artillery may not advance after combat.&#10;&#10;Artillery Range Fire:&#10;&bull; Artillery may attack units within 3 hexes.  It may only do so if there is no adjacent enemy target.&#10;&bull; Artillery ranged attacks must be made at odds &ge; 1:3.&#10;&bull; Artillery units may never suffer adverse combat results when engaging in ranged fire.&#10;&#10;Night:&#10;&bull; No combat phase.&#10;&bull; Units adjacent to enemies may not move.&#10;&bull; Units may move, but may not enter EZOC.&#10;&#10;",

Full of confidence in the power of dice, every player tries to collect exactly those symbols which are required to defeat pupils, masters and grand masters &mdash; but this can be done only with a bit of luck and a good memory.&#10;&#10;Players  in W&uuml;rfel Kung Fu must challenge to a fight as many hidden Kung Fu fighters as possible by rolling the dice and putting down the right symbols. But victory points go only to the player who has also memorized under which card each player is hiding. The stronger a fighter is (student, master or grandmaster), the more winning points a player can score, but the harder it is to beat him. To come off as the winner of a fight, players also have to memorize which opponent is hiding under which card. The object of this game is to have the most points at the end.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Dragonball Ball Z CCG was created by Score and had a good number of expansions or sets before finally dying.&#10;&#10;All players start the game with a character from the series, called the main personality. Each main personality character usually has three levels, to a maximum of five. Throughout the game, the main personality can get stronger via gaining anger, replacing the previous version played.&#10;&#10;Decks are divided into seven different styles: Blue, Red, Orange, Black, Saiyan, Namekian and Free-Style. Each style focuses on a different aspect of combat. For instance, the Red style focuses on gaining anger, while the Namekian style focuses on life and energy. If a player uses nothing but one color or style in his or her deck, the player would be able to declare a Tokui-waza at the start of the game, allowing various benefits, such as certain cards allowing additional powers, as stated in the card's text box.&#10;&#10;Later expansions allowed you to play Mastery cards that allowed abilities that always stayed in play. Sensei cards were also eventually introduced, allowing for sideboards to cater against one's opponent.&#10;&#10;There are three ways to win the game. First is to reduce your opponent's deck to zero cards. Second is to win via having the most powerful personality, via gaining anger. This win condition may sometimes be not available, depending on who one's main personality is. Third is to play or capture, all seven Dragon Balls. Again, this win condition may sometimes be unavailable, depending on how decks are constructed.&#10;&#10;The bulk of the Dragon Ball Z CCG focuses on combat. Players alternate as attacker and defender. Attacks are divided into physical and energy attacks. Physical attacks reduce the opponent's power levels, eventually dealing life damage. Energy attacks deal damage directly, but usually costs two power levels to perform. Players must strike a balance between offense and defense, as cards are discarded from one's deck upon taking damage, making it possible for a certain card to be discarded from play, even before being used.&#10;&#10;The game was criticized to be highly random and greatly dependent on having better cards than one's opponent, as opposed to simply being the better player. Nonetheless, the tournament scene was quite popular during the game's existence, and the secondary market remains strong even after the game has died out.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Soldiers: Decision in the Trenches, 1918  is a two-player tactical wargame of low-intermediate complexity simulating the first 30 to 60 minutes of a hypothetical (though typical) attack by an American infantry division somewhere along 1st US Army&rsquo;s area of operations on the Western Front in the late summer or early autumn of that year. The American player is on the offensive, attempting to use his division to break through the German defense line that covers almost the entire map at the start of play. The German player &ndash; in the historical role of a Kampftruppenkommandeur or &ldquo;K.T.K.&rdquo; &ndash; commands, in total, a reinforced infantry regiment that&rsquo;s fighting to prevent a breakthrough, or any significant penetration, of its position. The game is won by playing once, noting the depth of the American penetration (failing a &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; breakthrough victory), then switching sides, playing again, and comparing that game&rsquo;s depth of penetration with that of the first match. Draws are possible and solitaire-play is doable.&#10; Each game turn of Soldiers is equal to five to 10 minutes of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the tempo of action in each turn, and each hexagon represents 25 yards (22.8 meters) from side to opposite side. Each unit-counter represents a platoon of infantry or heavy machineguns. Tactical support units &ndash; such as light artillery (&ldquo;one pounders&rdquo;), mortars, engineers, etc. &ndash; are assumed to have been broken up and parceled out among the infantry squads, as was the usual practice historically.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;",

This must be done before 49 minutes pass, or all players lose automatically.&#10;&#10;Atmosfear uses a DVD that acts as a timer, constantly ticking away toward the end of the game. The Gatekeeper also frequently appears on screen and causes problems for any or all of the players. Just like its predecessor, Atmosfear makes for stressful play -- players rush to take their turn and pass on the dice as quickly as possible before the Gatekeeper appears and calls on them. &#10;Unlike the original, the adaption to DVD means encounters with the Gatekeeper are randomized rather than in a fixed order, so you cannot predict when he will turn up next. It also means that new events can come up several plays on, although as with the original, in the long run, players may still become familiar with the possible events, leading to reduced replayability.&#10;&#10;",

The outer and middle rings are each divided into twelve checkered spaces, while the inner circle is a single space. Each player places their four monsters on squares on the outer ring opposite each other, and places the card with the monsters' statistics beside them. Every round, the players roll a d20 to determine initiative, then take turns activating the monsters. Each monster can move and attack once per round according to its speed, statistics, and special attacks as listed on its card. Once all monsters have activated, a new round begins. Play continues until all monsters on one side are destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this new Jungle Speed version for kids, be the first to catch the totem when two identical tiles appear. The goal of the game is to collect the most tiles by game's end.  This version differs from standard Jungle Speed by mixing in elements from the classic children's game Memory which makes it perfect for younger children to enter the world of Jungle Speed.  The game consists of 36 animal tiles and the Jungle Speed totem.  The tiles are comprised of 8 each of a monkey, elephant, giraffe, and zebra along with 4 lions.  All the tiles are placed face-down in a grid just like &quot;Memory&quot; with the totem placed at the center of the grid.  Each player takes turns flipping over one tile in the grid making sure each player has seen it and then replacing it face-down in its original place.  As soon as a flipped tile matches one that has previously been flipped (not including the lions), the players race to grab the totem.  The player who is fastest to the totem now has to turn over the correct matching tile hopefully remembering where it is.  If they are successful they collect both tiles and put it in a pile in front of them.  If they do not flip over the correct tile, they are frozen and can not grab for the totem until they use their next turn to become unfrozen.  When a player flips over a lion tile , the tile is removed from the grid and placed on the side of the grid.  When the fourth lion tile is flipped, the game immediately ends and the player with the most tiles wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Each game turn represents three days of time. Playing pieces represent divisions and brigades of infantry and cavalry, formations containing from about 3,000 to 15,000 men. The game map represents the militarily significant terrain found across the Franco-German border region in 1870. There are 80 counters in the game, most of which represent combat units; others are provided as memory aids and informational markers.&#10;&#10;",

It uses a combination of conflicting visual and verbal cues to disrupt automated processes used by brain the for language and color identification. While the neuroscience is complicated, the game is simple and easy to learn. The inclusion of profanity adds to the challenge while dozens of optional NSFW and drinking rules escalate things to another level. In short, when the eyes, brain and mouth don&rsquo;t agree, things get tricky.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;All players start with the same number of cards and are not allowed to look at their hand. Players take turns flipping over their top card and placing it face up in the middle of the table. Depending on the card flipped over, the player that flipped the card must either read the word on the card, identify the color of the card, or shout out a swear word. If they say the correct response, the card stays on the table and the next player takes their turn. If they hesitate or get it incorrect, any other player can call out their mistake. The player that messed up must then pick up all the cards from the table. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

And somehow there was always some kind of melancholy and sorrow written on his face. Once during shared meal, the noble confessed what grieves him: he never tasted what real adventure is. He heard tales of heroes and journeys &ndash; he wanted it himself but did not know how to begin. So I helped him by taking him to the Adventure's Gate, notorious inn where you can find adventurers ready to brave the world.&#10;&#10;And this is how it begins...&#10;&#10;Tavern Tales is a card-game in which players build their decks on their own. Their deck consists of adventurers who crave fame and, well, adventure. Each of 15 characters in the game possesses their own unique ability, so the choice of characters that the players recruit has direct impact on their win chance. You need to choose your party members so their abilities complement each other. Although rules are easy, winning the game is not. Players have to demonstrate their strategic thinking, long-term planning, and ability to react to the other players' moves.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into nine rounds. In each round, each player performs their turn. During this turn, player must perform two out of three available actions&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play a card face-up and use its ability.&#10;    Play a card face-down and recruit a character or take on a quest.&#10;    Play a set of cards from the same character.&#10;&#10;&#10;Thanks to synergy between cards, players try to recruit as many characters as possible and complete as many quests as possible. At the end of the game, players earn prestige points for characters met during the game and for completed quests.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This popular Swedish game for three players is also known as Mj&ouml;lnarmatte or Mas and in Norwegian it is called Mattis.&#10;&#10;Players, cards and deal&#10;The game is best for three players, but it is also possible for two or four to play. A standard 52 card pack, without joker, is used. The cards rank in the usual order: A (highest) K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 (lowest).&#10;&#10;Deal and play are clockwise. Each player receives 3 cards. The rest of the cards are laid face down in a pile on the table (stock).&#10;&#10;Object of the game&#10;Skitgubbe has two phases. In the first phase players collect cards for the second phase. In the second phase the object is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible. The last player left with cards in hand is the loser and becomes the skitgubbe.&#10;&#10;Play in the first phase&#10;The first phase consists of tricks of 2 cards. The player to dealer's left leads first. Any card can be led and the player to the left of the leader plays any card to complete the trick. At this stage the suits have no significance and there is no requirement to follow suit. Each player draws a card from the stock immediately after playing, so that each player always has a hand of three cards so long as there are still cards in the stock. Whoever played the higher card wins the trick, places the two cards face down in front of himself, and leads to the next trick. If the player who led wins the trick, he leads again and the same two players are involved in the next trick.&#10;&#10;If the two cards played to a trick are equal it is called a stunsa (bounce); the cards are left on the table, the two players each draw a card from the stock and the same player leads again. This continues until one of the players wins the trick and takes all the cards played, including the cards from the tied tricks.&#10;&#10;In this first phase, the second player to a trick is under no obligation to try to beat the card led. If a low card is led the second player may wish to play lower and give the trick to the leader, for it is important to collect strong cards in the first phase of the game, so gain an advantage in the second phase.&#10;&#10;Throughout the first phase, when it is your turn to play and there is still more than one card in the stock, instead of playing from your hand you may turn up the top card of the stock. If you turn a card from the stock you must play it - you may not put it in your hand.&#10;&#10;The last card from the stock determines the trump suit for the second phase. The player who has to draw this card takes it but does not add it to his hand but keeps it face down until the first phase is over.&#10;&#10;When the stock is exhausted, the play continues as long as possible with the cards players have in their hands. If some players have cards left in hand at the end of the first phase they keep them for the second phase. If the final trick of the first phase is a bounce, the players take back the cards they played to it and keep them for the second phase.&#10;&#10;Play in the second phase&#10;The players have now divided the 52 cards between themselves, but the cards are probably not divided equally; some players have more cards than others. The player who drew the trump card leads. The object is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible.&#10;&#10;Now you must either beat the previous card played or pick it up. A card may be beaten by a higher card of the same suit, and a non-trump may be beaten by any trump. It is never lawful to duck. If you cannot or do not wish to beat the card in front of you, you must take it up into your hand, and it is then the next player's turn to lead to a new trick. If there is more than one card lying on the table and you cannot beat the last card played, it is only this last card which you must take up into your hand. It is then the next player's turn to beat the card which was underneath it.&#10;&#10;A trick is complete when either:&#10;&#10;the number of cards in it is equal to the number of players who were in the game when the trick began, or &#10;all its cards have been picked up. &#10;In the first case, the cards in the trick are set aside and the player who played last (and therefore highest) to the trick leads to the next. In the second case, the player to the left of the player who picked up the last card leads to a new trick. &#10;Suppose there are 3 players; player A has led and player B beaten A's card. If C now beats B's card, C puts aside the cards and leads to the next trick; but if C does not beat B's card but picks it up, it is now A's turn to beat the card showing on the table (which is in fact A's own lead). If A does this, and then B beats A's card, it is B who has completed the trick; B sets aside the three cards and leads to the next trick. Another possibility is: A leads, B beats A's card, C picks up B's card, and A picks up his own card. It is now B's lead.&#10;&#10;Note that as players run out of cards, the number of cards in each trick reduces. If there are three players, one of whom runs out of cards during a trick, that trick still requires three cards to be completed (or all its cards to be picked up), but the next trick will require only two cards.&#10;&#10;For example suppose there are 3 players: A, B, C. A leads his last card, B beats it, C picks B's card up, B beats A's card again, and now C beats B's card. The trick is now over, and C leads to the next trick. As there are now only two players, the new trick will have only two cards. Another example with three players: A leads; B beats with his last card, C picks this card up, and A picks up the card he led. It is now B's lead and the next trick will be complete with two cards.&#10;&#10;A player who gets rid of all his cards can draw a sigh of relief, for he is not the loser. The loser is the player who is left with the last card in his hand, and is called &quot;Skitgubbe&quot; (or &quot;Mas&quot; or &quot;Mattis&quot;). Skitgubbe means &quot;dirty old man&quot; (in the sense of unwashed, rather than obscence); Mas and Mattis mean fool.&quot;&#10;&#10;- Description and rules credited to John McLeod from his excellent website here:&#10;&#10;http://www.pagat.com/beating/mattis.html&#10;&#10;",

The game was &quot;old&quot; by the time it was played in Ancient Rome, since it had been played in Greece and other parts of the ancient world before it found its way to Rome. The game has many counterparts throughout the Middle East and Asia. Some historians indicate that the game may have had its origins in some religious rite, while others believe the game was always just a gambling game.&#10;&#10;Knucklebones are the dried ankle bones of sheep. They have 4 different sides - one flat, one concave, one convex, and one sinuous side. Values were assigned to each side. In ancient times, adults as well as children played Knucklebones. The Greeks and the Romans modified the equipment and play of this gambling game, eventually passing on to us six sided cubed dice rather than the four sided Astragali.&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;The game is played with two or more bones. One player tosses the bones in the air and either catches them on the back of the hand, or lets them fall to the ground. As in dice games, assigned values determine the outcome of each toss.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by Oss&#10;&#10;",

In the 16th century, alchemists made attempts to do that in their laboratories, aspiring to gain wealth and never-ending fame. Some, as Edward Kelley, thanks to royal sponsors, achieved all that, nevertheless they never succeeded in transmutation of metals&hellip; In this magical game that you are holding it&rsquo;s very simple. &#10;Build a laboratory and collect the necessary components. And transformation of metals? If you manage to adjust to the changing moods of the Spirit of Transmutation, then it&rsquo;s really not complicated at all. So, what is the game about? You have competition in your town &ndash; other alchemists who also know the right technology. Only the one of you who is the most efficient will win recognition and fame. It will surely last until the next game, or, who knows, perhaps eternally&hellip;&#10;&#10;Players will try to be the most effective alchemist.&#10;To achieve that they will need to build buildings, represented by cards. In these buildings, they will acquire resources, transform them into gold and finally sell them for victory points or cards. Selling gold isn't only way to win the game.&#10;&#10;Game is using Rondel mechanic to pick an action by players and hand management, where cards represent buildings, currency and resources.&#10;&#10;Alchemicus was designed as a family game with little negative interaction. Requests planning but also concentrating on other players movements and predicting them. Many beginners forget it, being focused on their own technology structure, so very often they fall behind. We think that this game style can be useful for teaching young players to think beyond their own needs. Anyway, the game is not for kids. The youngest of our testers who was able to win the play against his father was 12 years old (consider that his father is lawyer, so probably he is quite smart ;))) hahaha one of them. Father or son. we are not sure which one :D).&#10;Because the factor of negative interaction is not very strong the play goes ahead in a nice atmosphere which is fun for family play.&#10;Older players can play a bit differently, by using the position of The Transmutation Ghost to foil your opponents' plans. This strategy can be counteracted by defending yourself with buildings and goods in circulation which are resistant to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;",

In this quick, fun, and captivating game, everyone has a different solution, but only the player who best manipulates the board and completes their puzzle will win! Four Corners comes in 2 themed editions:  Kaleidoscope and Galaxy.&#10;&#10;Players each start a game of Four Corners game with secret goals.  Every turn, you&rsquo;ll add, twist, rotate, and flip tiles to reach your goal.  This is achieved on the unique, patented Four Corners game board, which allows tiles to rotate and move without affecting neighboring tiles.  You score a goal either by creating sequences of four identical images, or by completing a full image from the corners of four tiles.  Watch out, because other players will also be shifting and changing the board to shape it the way they need.  The first player to achieve three of their secret goals wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player plays one of four semi-fictional TV networks, and the goal is to end up with the most money when the game ends (which is either when only one network is left on the air, or when certain tiles run out).&#10;Players move pawns around a standard square-track board, with spaces that trigger various events -- drawing an event card, auctioning off a new TV show or star or academy award movie, or triggering a ratings war.&#10;During a ratings war, players lay out the tiles representing their prime-time line-up of shows and movies, along with bonuses for stars and reviews.  Shows with the lowest ratings in their time slot are cancelled, and when a network has no shows left, it goes off the air and the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

You have to use a magnet to learn if the totem is a good one or a trap. If the totem moves away from the magnet, it is a trap. If it pulls towards you it is one of the 8 good ones. Players check the totems individually and place it on the middle of the appropriate adventure square. This means the nature of this totem is known to one of the players. He must memorize all the totems he checked. In the second part (when all totems are known by one or more players), when a player starts an the adventure players have to tell the other players what status the totem has, if he is right he gets the totem. If he gets it wrong he loses a research point.&#10;&#10;When all 8 good totems are found the golden Rastapopoulos totem is placed for the final adventure. When players cross Rastapopoulos himself they have to fight him (by a throw of the dice).&#10;&#10;When a player loses all his points he has to start at the beginning of the board and receives 4 new points to re-enter the race until the golden totem is reached.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For 200 years, the Knights Templar were a powerful political and economic force, helping to shape Europe during the Middle Ages. Founded to protect pilgrims on their journeys to the Holy Land, the &quot;poor comrades-in-arms of Christ and the Temple of Solomon&quot; would eventually grow a network of strongholds (&quot;Commanderies&quot;) throughout the Christian world, where novice knights were trained, and trade goods could be managed and exchanged. By 1307, the &ldquo;poor comrades-in-arms&rdquo; were one of the richest organizations in Europe: one that would attract the covetous eyes of the French king.&#10;&#10;In The Mystery of the Templars, players become the masters of this secretive organization. They must assign their knights to the critical task of escorting pilgrims, but also to seek out and discover long-lost artifacts of Christian lore. Using their holdings in the Holy Land, they procure valuable trade goods, which must then be transported to the hungry markets of Europe, using the profits to expand the Order&rsquo;s holdings. But along the way brigands and pirates threaten the flow of goods and wealth, and must be challenged by valorous knights to safeguard the precious caravans and trade ships. To be successful, the players must balance the needs of trade, development, and battle.&#10;&#10;In time, the powerful enemies of the Templars will strike, beginning the Persecution which will eventually cause the destruction of the Order. In those last desperate days, the players must flee from their Commanderies with all the wealth and relics they can carry, seeking refuge in the farthest corners of the world. The player who can best manage the resources of the Order during the days of wealth, and who can rescue the most important relics from the Persecution, will be the victor in The Mystery of the Templars.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The publisher's description:&#10;Hero is a wild, no holds barred man-to-man (or beast) game on two levels. Players control their own Hero in their portion of the maze as well as monsters in their opponents portion.  Each Hero is composed of several categories: Intelligence, Physical Appearance, Class, Strength, Luck, Hits, and Weapons Proficiency.  Each of these must be determined by the player from a fixed number of points.  To make a Hero super-strong will mean that some other category must suffer (super-strong and a lackwit?).  Monsters include such loathesome creatures as trolls, ogres, zombies, goblins, lycanthropes, men, and the horribly alluring succubus.  Each has an offensive potential as well as a defensive capability based on the type of creature vs. the Hero's weapon and how mightily he wields it.  Your Hero must avoid traps, slaughter monsters, gather gold, and make it to the end of the labyrinth to win the hand of the stunning, voluptuous daughter of the most powerful wizard in the land.  If the Hero does not there are always other challenges, unless he has become a Dead Hero.&#10;&#10;Components: &#10;Thin album box &#10;3 panel folder (Yaquinto catalog), Space Gamer Magazine advertising&#10;flyer.&#10;&#10;Thick album box &#10;Yaquinto price sheet dated &quot;Feb 1 1982&quot;, rules booklet marked &quot;Second&#10;Printing, March 1981&quot;.&#10;&#10;Both editions&#10;12 page rules booklet, card with 3 perforated hero set-up sheets, &#10;2 plastic ziplock bags.&#10;&#10;Summary Counter Manifest: 52 3/8&quot; counters, 130 1/2&quot; counters &#10;(9 white, 1 blank, and 3 identical sets of 40 colored red, blue, or green.)&#10;&#10;",

Cards have positive or negative values. The cards with negative values also have a special power (e.g., move the captain from one ship tile to another). If the cards hit the value of the ships tile, it sinks; otherwise the ship tile sinks when five cards are on each side, and whoever has more points on their side wins this tile.&#10;&#10;Each ship tile, the captain, and the first mate are all worth 1 VP, and a game is won as soon as a player has scored three points.&#10;&#10;",
