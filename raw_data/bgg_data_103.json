    "Description": "In May of 1863 the Confederacy was winning battles but losing the war. In the west Grant was moving on Vicksburg. In the east, the Army of Northern Virginia was holding off the Army of the Potomac, but Lee realized that this could not last forever. Something had to change, he would strike north and take the war to the enemy. After weeks of maneuver, a chance collision between the two armies would seal the fate of the Confederacy. Now is your chance to change history. Can you do better than Lee and crush the Union army as it arrives piecemeal? Or as Meade will you hold the heights and dash the last great hope of Confederate victory? The decisions are yours&hellip; in Gettysburg 150!&#10;&#10;Gettysburg 150 is an expansion of the ideas contained in Hold the Line. Like Hold the Line, it uses command action points for units to move and attack. The CRT is simliar, although artillery is weaker at longer ranges due to the greater scale of the battle. However, the board is not modular and infantry units are stronger. Units are division level, with brigade level cavalry. Advanced features like column movement is covered simply with movement bonuses for not moving adjacent to enemy units. More importantly, the game has optional rules to increase realism, including early reinforcements, army demoralization due to heavy losses, and rules to encourage corps organization. The game has 4 scenarios covering days 1, 2, and 3, as well as the Confederate attack on Little Round Top on July 2. Scenarios are playable in 1 hour for the day battles, 20 to 30 minutes for the Little Round Top scenario. The complete 3 day battle is playable in 2.5 to 3 hours.&#10;&#10;A division level Gettysburg game in honor of the 150th anniversary of the battle.  This simple fast playing game comes with a mounted 25 x 22 map, two counter sheets, rules, and dice.  You can play the entire battle in 2 to 3 hours, with 4 shorter scenarios.&#10;&#10;Players will maneuver the counters representing the Union and Confederate armies across a hex cover representation of the battlefield at Gettysburg.  Each turn players get a number of action points that will allow them to maneuver, fire combat, and close combat enemy forces.  You will always receive some action points, but will never be sure exactly how many recreating the uncertainty of command and control. Victory is obtained by driving the enemy from the field by capturing terrain objectives or eliminating enemy units.&#10;&#10;The game uses the popular Hold the Line game system as its base.  Optional rules include a Chaos of War table, force march, and more.&#10;&#10;Includes a mounted game board, 2 counter sheets with large 7/8&quot; counter sheets, dice, and rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Race For Bastogne is a Grand Tactical Series (GTS) game that covers one sliver in the history of the Battle of the Bulge. On 16 December 1944, the Germans launched their great offensive through the Ardennes.&#10;&#10;The XLVII Panzer Corps attacked with the 2. Panzer Division and 26. Volksgrenadier Division, reinforced by the Panzer Lehr Division. Defending was part of the 110th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division. It should have been a blitzkrieg through the thin defenses but stubborn resistance, the terrain, and the well-managed commitment of American reinforcements caused the German attack to fail to take Bastogne just as the 101st Airborne Division arrived. Even as German forces by-passed Bastogne to extend the &ldquo;Bulge,&rdquo; the 101st was hard pressed to defend the critical crossroads town.&#10;&#10;Race For Bastogne simulates the German XLVII Corps attack across the Our River through the 110th Infantry Regiment, the delaying actions by Combat Command Reserve, 9th Armored Division, and Combat Command B, 10th Armored Division, followed by the defense of Bastogne by the 101st Airborne Division. The game covers the night of 15 December to the night of 25 December 1944. The German initially commands three &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; and the American two &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; on two maps laid end to end.&#10;&#10;Race For Bastogne includes one Campaign Game and six scenarios; five of these use a single map (or portions of a single map), and the sixth uses both maps.&#10;&#10;Race For Bastogne components:&#10;&#10;&bull; Grand Tactical Series (GTS) 2.0c Series Rules (40 pages, color)&#10;&bull; Race For Bastogne Exclusive Rules (60 pages, color)&#10;&bull; Rules Summary (8 pages, B&amp;W)&#10;&bull; Race For Bastogne TRC/TEC set (2 cards, color)&#10;&bull; Race For Bastogne Divisional Charts set (5 cards, color)&#10;&bull; Race For Bastogne Off-Map Display &amp; Turn Record Chart (2 cards, color)&#10;&bull; Two single-sided 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps&#10;&bull; One double-sided 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; map&#10;&bull; Eight countersheets (5/8&quot;)&#10;&bull; Four 10-sided dice&#10;&bull; One box and lid (*Note: this is our standard 3&rdquo; box and is not the same style of box used for The Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron, Where Eagles Dare, and The Greatest Day).&#10;&#10;Designer: Joe Chacon&#10;&#10;Developer: Nick Richardson&#10;&#10;Game Art: Nicolas Eskubi&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes they need to banter and fight for prices. And sometimes they have to swallow their tears and abandon all they have built. If you can overcome these hurdles, earn the trust of people and build up a fortune, then you will be a true master merchant.&#10;&#10;Master Merchant is a &quot;hand-building&quot; card game along the lines of the &quot;deck-building&quot; genre started by Dominion, except that players have no deck &ndash; only a hand of cards and a discard pile.&#10;&#10;Players start with a hand of two cards: &quot;Steal one gold from all players with four or more gold&quot; and &quot;Buy a card from the town&quot;. On each turn a player can play up to two cards from his hand, either face up to gain a card's effect or face down to gain one gold.&#10;&#10;The &quot;town&quot; consists of ten different types of cards, which cost 1-4 gold. All cards played and purchased go into a player's personal discard pile, which is open information to all players. If a player starts his turn with no cards, he picks up his entire discard pile. The first player to get eight gold or eight different cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game's setting is same as Mai-Star, which is from the same designer, artist and publisher.&#10;&#10;",

On a classical game board, terrain symbols on the map and specially designed rules help to represent weapons effects, which are one of the main sources of casualties during urban fightings.&#10;&#10;In the same way, the map system allows the management of distant fire, even from building to building, as well as close quarter battle from room to room. When explosives are used to breach walls, or when a shell hits its target, collateral effects of the explosion are taken into account. It was also critical to integrate one of the major players of today&rsquo;s conflicts, which is the civilian population. The presence of non-combatants often complicates the way forces can use their weapons, especially against irregular opponents.&#10;&#10;In addition, the presence of tactical leaders is a real asset for assault squads. And combat service support teams can deliver logistical support on the frontline, in order to enhance the operational status of any element.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&bull; Boxed game&#10;&bull; 5 maps: Four 72cm x 54cm and one 72cm x 13cm&#10;&bull; Two 24cm x 30cm game map (underground)&#10;&bull; 199 die-cut counters&#10;&bull; One 82 et one 74 stickers sheet&#10;&bull; 160 wooden blocks&#10;&bull; Rules booklet&#10;&bull; 3 Campaign rules booklet&#10;&bull; 16 scenario player aids&#10;&bull; 2 player aids in english&#10;&bull; 1 set of 144 playing cards&#10;&bull; 2 dice&#10;&#10;",

Since every Player controls Romans as well as Barbarians you will get all kinds of situations like Romans vs. Barbarians, Romans fighting among themselves, or Barbarians fighting other Barbarians.&#10;The Emperor for each Roman Faction changes every Game Turn as well as the Barbarian Peoples that the Players control.&#10;With its easy to learn rules - players who are familiar with &quot;Hispania&quot;, &quot;Britannia&quot; or &quot;History of the World&quot; will find some similarities and some new features - and the constantly changing Barbarians, &quot;The History of the Roman Empire&quot; can be great fun.&#10;&#10;The Players will have to decide how to use their Roman Legions as well as how to use the armies of their Barbarians and of course where to plan new Cities and Forts (for the Roman Factions).&#10;Since it is worth many more Victory Points to control all areas of one color, soon everyone will try to establish his own small empire (and of course to disturb the others), until the more powerful Barbarians like the Goths or the Huns arrive and threaten to take control of the map.&#10;&#10;Each turn the Roman Factions spend some of their Victory Points on new Legions and/or Forts or Fortresses. The Barbarians do not use their Victory Points for recruiting Units but rather &quot;mobilize&quot; up to a certain number of Armies (how many units depends on the Barbarian People).&#10;Every game will present you with new situations since the Players will work on and change their strategies and the 45 random cards will influence every game in a unique way.&#10;At the end of the seventh turn, the players total their victory points and determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Will the Roman Empire rise to Glory or will it be crushed by the overwhelming Barbarians?&#10;&#10;It's up to YOU&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Autumn has arrived, and the fall flowers color the forest. The robin announces the imminent cold and the hoopoe, almost ready for the great nocturnal migration, feeds itself with the last available food. The fox grows its winter coat and toads swarm the most humid areas of the grove, thriving with mushrooms and deciduous leaves.&#10;&#10;In Fall you create, together with your opponent, an autumn ecosystem. You both place leaves tiles in the same environment to grow the forest and host its flora, fauna, and funga. However, each player scores points for different objectives, and only at the end of the game the opponent's scoring conditions will be revealed, thanks to the Fox, Bird, and Flower scoring cards, which are different for each player in each game.&#10;&#10;During the game, try to understand your opponent's strategy, to counteract it and make it turn in your favor.&#10;&#10;Single tableau for both players, with variable scoring opportunities for each player.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a hand of cards that add to battle, reinforcements, and other elements that occurred or could have occurred during the game. The game is not card driven, but card enhanced. The game is chit driven. The Allied, and German armies are broken up into their larger commands, chits are placed in a cup and drawn during the game turn. When a chit is drawn, the command for that chit is activated for movement and combat.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined at the end of the game if the Germans can attain the goals on their strategy card, and for the Allies if they can prevent the Germans from reaching their goals.&#10;&#10;",

Boyd, &ldquo;Patterns of Conflict&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&#10;At 0400 Zulu Time, July 24 1985, Warsaw Pact forces cross the Inner German Border and assault NATO positions in West Germany. The main thrust, formed by 10 Soviet Category I Divisions, is in the BAOR sector and points directly to the Ruhr area.&#10;&#10;Taking its roots from SPI&rsquo;s Central Front and NATO: Division Commander, The Dogs of War is the second module of the C3 series, focused on Command, Control and Communication.&#10;&#10;All the elements of modern mechanized warfare are covered: Chemical and Nuclear Weapons, Attack Helicopters, Engineers, Electronic Warfare, Counter-battery Fire, Ribbon Bridges, Army Doctrines, Reconnaissance units, Close Air Support coordination and more.&#10;&#10;Several typical wargame mechanics have been reinterpreted, and both sides will fight three equally dangerous foes: the enemy, their own plan and time. Even a simple action can quickly turn into a disaster when facing an opponent using more efficiently the real key to victory: the OODA Loop theorized by John Boyd in the early &lsquo;80s and used today as the basis for several military doctrines.&#10;&#10;Military doctrine, tactics and peculiarities for each side are represented, allowing a skilled commander to use his own strength points and exploit the enemy&rsquo;s weak ones. Some examples are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    West German Auftragstaktik (Mission-Type Orders), giving Bundeswehr a flexibility hardly obtained by other armies.&#10;    British Engineers, allowing extensive use of prepared defense positions.&#10;    BAOR logistic deficiencies and ammunition shortage.&#10;    Soviet Sappers, first-line assault units used to crack the toughest nuts.&#10;    Soviet Assault From March doctrine.&#10;    Warsaw Pact vulnerable supply network.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Highlights&#10;    5 km per hex, 3 hours per game turn&#10;    Regiment / Battalion sized ground units&#10;    Detailed Order of Battle set in 1985&#10;    Close Air Support and Attack Helicopters&#10;    Command, Control &amp; Communication related problems&#10;    Electronic and Intelligence Warfare&#10;    Artillery interdiction and Counter-Battery fire&#10;    Chemical and Nuclear warfare&#10;    Specific events for Warsaw Pact and NATO&#10;    Random events to further increase battlefield chaos&#10;    Two Campaign Games:&#10;        &quot;The River Weser Deep and Wide&quot;, Warsaw Pact offensive in BAOR sector.&#10;        &quot;One Minute to Midnight&quot;, all-out chemical and nuclear warfare after several weeks of tension and build-up &#10;    &#10;    Four Smaller Scenarios:&#10;        &quot;Welcome to Braunschweig&quot;, West German 2 Panzer Brigade defense of the city against Soviet 35th Motorized Rifle Division.&#10;        &quot;They Came Before Dawn&quot;, Soviet 76th Guards Airborne assault to key crossings on Weser and Leine rivers.&#10;        &quot;Give Me the Night&quot;, British 1st Armoured Division fight to slow down Soviet 3rd Shock Army assault.&#10;        &quot;Queen's Gambit&quot;, British 3rd Armoured Division counter-attack at D+4.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Components&#10;    98&times;55 cm matte plasticized map, covering BAOR area of responsibility&#10;    1000+ 5/8&Prime; matte plasticized counters&#10;    44 Action and Event Cards&#10;    30 pages Rules Booklet&#10;    30 pages Scenarios &amp; Designer&rsquo;s Notes Booklet&#10;    10 pages Examples of Play Booklet&#10;    2x Tables booklets&#10;    4x Players' Aid Charts&#10;    2x 10-sided dice&#10;    10x zipbags&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Moving those cards can trigger the basic movement of other cards on the board.&#10;&#10;The cards move from a neutral area in the middle of the board toward your side or the opponent&rsquo;s side through three rows. Each row represents how close the character is to joining your Faction. The rows are called Recruits, Loyalists, and Allies. Each row represents how loyal the character is to your side. If they reach your Allies, those points are locked in.&#10;&#10;When the game begins, each player will choose a Faction and build a deck of Faction cards that caters to their own style. These Faction cards allow for even more powerful card movement. For instance, let&rsquo;s say you choose a Faction card that says, &ldquo;Choose any card from your opponent&rsquo;s Recruits or Loyalists and move to your Allies.&rdquo; Then imagine your opponent has a card with a 15-point value in their Loyalists row. You can snatch up that valuable card and lock it into the Allies row on your side of the board, giving you a large number of points and taking those same points away from the opponent. A single, well-timed Faction card can be a serious game changer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You will decide how to avoid falling into the jaws of a Great Wolf, and how to outwit the Blackbird, who was ordered by God to shepherd all the sheep in the world. You will see how Aley, the God&rsquo;s Spirit, splits the earth with a wave of a paw. You will exchange magical trinkets from Aridnyk, who at the beginning of times was the brother of God himself. And, of course, you will earn wisdom from the Holy God, who knows everything about everything. &#10;The game is based on the mythology and legend of the Hutsuls &ndash; a Ukrainian ethnical group from the Carpathian mountains, who through the centuries developed a unique culture, the amazing blend of Christian and pagan traditions, together with the tough highlander customs.    &#10;During their turn, the player places a tile from their hand and activates its &ldquo;when placed&rdquo; abilities: move their Shepherd, move one of the Spirits, draw a Card (Plot of Trinket), or gain Sheep. After moving their Shepherd, the player can activate the &ldquo;when moved on&rdquo; abilities of the tile, and the shepherd has ended their movement on. Any time during their turn, the player may play 1 trinket card, receiving a buff or any number of plot cards, but only if their conditions are met in full. When the player completes their actions, they draw a new tile, and the turn passes to the next player. &#10;The game lasts until all the tiles are placed, and after the last player completes their turn, all players count their sheep, and whoever has the largest flock is declared a winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "&quot;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War&quot; is a tactical combat wargame of the first battle of Bull Run.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a map of the area over which the battle was fought overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.&#10;&#10;Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.&#10;&#10;The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. &#10; The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine References:&#10;&#10;The GENERAL Index  Article List:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5&#10;        Series Replay - Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War, Rex A.

You take turns shooting 2-6 balls (depending on the die roll) at each other's targets.  You continue to take turns until you wipe out all of your enemy's targets.&#10; Connecting the two bases is a cardboard strip with trees and grey circles.  You can spend some of your shots to move a soldier towards your opponent on these circles.  You are allowed to place your shooting device closer to your opponent's base at this time...moving it up to be level with the advancing soldier.  However, advancing soldiers are quickly targeted.&#10;&#10;In play, the easy shots (soldiers and simple targets) get knocked out in the first few rounds.

Adjusting their location will let you rebalance the tower, but they may also end up in inconvenient spots that get in the way of you placing walls to build new floors.&#10;When Toto sees his friends making it to the floor above him, it gives him the bravery needed to climb up higher and higher himself.&#10;&#10;The game may start off seemingly easy, but you will soon find that it is unsurprising to see the tower fall apart once you start building from the 5th floor and beyond.&#10;Build up the tower, place the Feline Friends and get Toto to reach his goal to win the game!&#10;If you get Toto to the 10th floor, you clear the first stage and get to see more of Toto&rsquo;s story as he journeys to reunite with his mother.&#10;&#10;The challenge doesn&rsquo;t end there, however. If Toto wants to reach the stars, he will have to reach heights that seem almost impossible, but with your help he can surely do it!&#10;Cat and the Tower has cute cats, engaging gameplay, and a storyline that will tear at your heartstrings and leave you giving it your all to help Toto complete his adventure.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is VentoNuovo's continuation of the system created for Moscow '41, now looking at the campaign of Army Group North in Barbarossa. The final chapter of the Trilogy is Kiev '41.&#10;&#10;Players take either the German or Soviet Union forces and use colorful wooden blocks to simulate the forces they have involved.&#10;&#10;Leningrad '41 uses the same basic game engine of Moscow '41, with a few tweaks and changes to suit the differing conditions in the north. The game brings new wrinkles in as well because the Germans have &quot;allies&quot; as part of their forces-- the small but powerful Finnish Army which sought to recover territory lost in the &quot;Winter War&quot; but did not fully match the ambitions of Germany at destroying the U.S.S.R.&#10;&#10;Four weeks after the commencement of Barbarossa, Hitler visited the headquarters of Army Group North.  The F&uuml;hrer&rsquo;s words were dutifully noted in the army group&rsquo;s war diary, and culminated in the following observation: &ldquo;&hellip;the loss of Leningrad might result in a complete collapse.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;By the end of the third week in July the capture of Leningrad did indeed seem inevitable.  The Germans had already covered more than half the distance to the city.  And yet, as they advanced into the vastness of Russia, it appeared that everyone on the Axis side of things had a different plan; and as time went by, those plans had a habit of changing.&#10;&#10;Hitler did not want his tanks entering the city; but then, he did not want his infantry engaged in prolonged street fighting either.  So, after another think about things, the F&uuml;hrer decided the city should be simply cut off and starved, or relentlessly bombarded and starved&hellip; or the Finns would be welcome to breach Lake Lagoda and flood it.  Whatever the means, the F&uuml;hrer purposed that the &ldquo;Cradle of Bolshevism&rdquo; was to be wiped off the face of the earth, and its population left to dwindle away to nothing.&#10;&#10;The problem was, despite the rush of victories, or perhaps because of them, the Germans had precious little idea what to do next. Halder wrote that July: &ldquo;&hellip;there seem to certain differences in von Leeb&rsquo;s and Hoepner&rsquo;s views of what the next moves should be.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;They waited to be told what to do, or argued between themselves.  Manstein, commanding one of Army Group North&rsquo;s panzer corps, knew what to do, but he was not in charge of the operation.  Delays accrued, brought on by lack of supply and the first recovery of Soviet forces.  Already within one short drive of Leningrad, the Finns were meant to help, but the Finns had their own plans; and, for the time being, they did not involve doing more than reclaiming what they had lost in the Winter War.&#10;&#10;And what of Stalin?  Beyond the speeches, the threats and the executions, he sent Zhukov to the city in early September 1941, and there the man who would eventually oversee the fall of Berlin organized the workers&rsquo; militias and planned a defence that was meant to face the expected German onslaught - an onslaught, which as the weeks went by, never actually came. &#10; As the German player, in reaching for a victory that will have meaning, you are up against the clock, the terrain, and alongside Soviet resistance, the loss of units that some other bright idea from somewhere else will impose upon you.  The forces of Army Group North are not huge, so you must act to avoid your units being dispersed, and have victory in your grasp before another plan takes the panzers away from you.&#10;&#10;As the Soviet player you must know what to defend and what to abandon.  You cannot be strong everywhere.  Limited time is the best ally of those defending with limited forces.  Encourage the Germans to use their time up.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to deploy your ships to form combinations while performing their effects.&#10;&#10;Players perform their turns one after another by laying a ship on a sea space. They apply the effect of the sea space and the effect of the ship tile. This is the main action. They can also perform an optional action: buying a mercenary ship by paying its cost. The game ends when each player has played 16 turns.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players score victory points (VPs) for:&#10;&bull; the combinations made (three or more ship tiles laid side by side with identical numbers or forming a sequence of increasing or decreasing numbers),&#10;&bull; the ships laid in the opponent player's sea side,&#10;&bull; some mercenary ships, and&#10;&bull; the VP tokens collected during the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the entry for Rail Baron:&#10;&#10;BOXCARS is the predecessor of Rail Baron.&#10;&#10;In the late 1960s or early 1970s, previously unknown designers R.S. Erickson and T.F. Erickson, Jr. began&#10;boardgame development. In an era when both the railroad and board gaming industry was in flux, the Ericksons managed to combine elements from the two to create a game that has withstood the test of time. In fact, it provided solid footing for the whole &quot;train gaming&quot; genre.&#10;&#10;The Ericksons decided to publish the game on their own, and released it as &quot;BOXCARS&quot; in 1974. It was billed as &quot;The Informative NEW travel game of OLD-time railroading.&quot; For a first-time effort, the components of the resulting boardgame were surprisingly refined and professional.&#10;&#10;The single-piece board unfolded to reveal a map of the United States on which routes of 28 historic railroads were traced. The rules of BOXCARS vary from those of Rail Baron in several ways. For example, BOXCARS has no restriction in the re-use of routes: this allows players to circle along the same track as long as desired. BOXCARS also allows a player to trade, sell or auction a RR at any time during the game. Furthermore, BOXCARS lacks the Express and Superchief locomotive upgrades that Rail Baron contains.&#10;&#10;Before long, the Ericksons' game caught the attention of The Avalon Hill Game Company (AH). The original designers apparently sold the BOXCARS rights to AH and were obligated to quickly disperse the remaining copies of their game. It is estimated that there were only 1000 copies of BOXCARS ever printed.&#10;&#10;AH scaled down the game's physical size to match the &quot;bookshelf&quot; style of many of its other titles, modified the rules, and released it as Rail Baron in 1977.&#10;&#10;(Description adapted with permission from &quot;An Illustrated History of Rail Baron&quot;)&#10;&#10;",

Hill's men held out all day against a rising tide of Federal troops from both the 1st and 9th Corps and were saved only by the late arrival of D.R. Jones and Hood's divisions.&#10;&#10;Despite the fact that it was a rather sharp defeat for the rebels, Hill remained justifiably proud of the fight his men managed for 12 long hours atop South Mountain. They had given Lee the time he needed to concentrate his army in the face of a suddenly aggressive Federal force.&#10;&#10;South Mountain is the fourth game in the Civil War, Regimental Series. With one map and a manageable number of counters, it is the first game in the series to offer a full, intense, battle that is playable in an evening.

    "Description": "Relive WW2 in Europe from 1939 to 1945. Two to five players, with excellent solitaire suitability.&#10;&#10;Black Swan may be combined with Orange Swan and Black Swan: Dark Black or both!&#10;&#10;&quot;Black Swan&quot; is a block wargame with over 200 combat units. A game turn is three months (a season) and there are several three-season Scenarios and two Campaigns (1939 and 1941).&#10;&#10;When in 1939 Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland, few in Germany - and probably in the rest of Europe - believed that France and Great Britain would have declared war.&#10;&#10;In the previous months Hitler had broken the Treaty of Versailles, by which the harsh conditions imposed had humiliated and starved the German population for years and led to a political reunification of the original German Reich: restored the Rhineland, annexed Austria and invaded Czechoslovakia, with the tacit consent of the other nations, Great Britain and France above all.&#10;&#10;So his assumption that he could have done the same with Poland had a logical basis. Instead this time events went another way. &#10;Most European countries had been so devastated by WWI that few wanted another war. Ignoring the German preparations for a renewed war of revenge based on the new Blitzkrieg tactics, France developed an old fashioned concept of static border fortifications - the Maginot Line - and Chamberlain's Great Britain focused entirely on diplomacy in an attempt to deal in a gentlemen fashion with the rapacious and very ungentlemanly Nazi regime.&#10;&#10;Even after the fall of France, which surrendered in a few weeks after a blitz attack across the Ardennes - almost the same move adopted at the beginning of WWI - Great Britain still tried to reach an agreement with Hitler.&#10;&#10;This did not happen and Great Britain remained alone, with no American help, and was on the edge of the defeat, having to choose between an unfair peace or the threat of an invasion. It was only one man, the freshly appointed prime minister Winston Churchill - going against any logic and even against his own political peers and the Crown - that wanted to resist, and the outcome of the Battle of Britain later proved him right. &#10;However many months would have to pass before the Soviet Union first and the US later would join the Allied cause to restore peace in Europe, at the cost of millions of deaths....&#10;&#10;As the Axis Powers you have to swiftly win the war, either by a Mediterranean strategy to break the British Empire, or an all out effort to demolish the Red Army. If a Decisive Victory is unobtainable, you can still go for a Strategic or at least an Economic Victory.&#10;&#10;As the Allies, you must survive the initial onslaught and prepare for a long war of attrition before dealing a deathly blow to the Reich's body. &#10;I hope you will enjoy Black Swan, and that it will answer some of your questions as well.  I look forward to the conversations that will follow its release.&#10;&#10;Historical Intro&#10;To strive in this world is to abide in the planes of chaos.&#10;Nowhere is this more readily apparent than in war. The belief in a cause, the assurance of a plan, the security of ordered ranks and painstaking calculation, all these are thrown into the hazard of conflict. Nothing ever survives.  Everything is changed.  In the aftermath, the world must always be rebuilt out of expediency and pretence.&#10;&#10;Since antiquity, some have known this as &ldquo;The Black Swan.&rdquo;  It is the rare and unlooked-for event, something that is entirely unexpected and presages abrupt reversal.&#10;&#10;In martial terms, The Black Swan symbolizes the unravelling of apparent certainty, together with man&rsquo;s desire to contrive notions of opportunity, or excuses for defeat, whenever he dares play with the volatile flames of ambition. Napoleon&rsquo;s fortune succumbed to this very phenomenon the moment his army moved against Russia. By the time of Waterloo, the great improviser of battlefield success had truly become the shifty and evasive apologist for disaster.&#10;&#10;And then it was Hitler&rsquo;s turn.  Lying in a hospital bed come the end of The Great War, whose four year course was the embodiment of bold assertions gone awry, the infantry corporal simply could not accept the sudden and supposedly unforeseeable collapse of his beloved army.  What had gone wrong?  That army stood everywhere on enemy ground. Russia had succumbed and was occupied, and the French had been bled white.  It could only be betrayal - betrayal by communists and the craven factions in government.  These were his &ldquo;Men of 1918.&rdquo;  The German army had not been defeated.  The soldiers had simply been stabbed in the back.  And one a night in early 1933, as he stood on the podium in the packed Berlin Sportpalast, that is the story he told.  He would still be telling it twelve years later.&#10;&#10;But the swan is no respecter of any cause or purpose.  Whatever things were, and whatever they become, the constant truth is, as Yeats put it: Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.  Whatever is gained or lost is not merely about having one good plan or a single bad one; rather, it is about what ensues when all plans inevitably founder.  Even if you cannot predict what is unpredictable, you should at least prepare for it the best you can. Men make plans to give order to chaos.  Whoever does that best will emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;Play Black Swan with Orange Swan: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/334141/orange-swan&#10;Play Black Swan on Vassal: https://vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Black_Swan&#10;&#10;",

Why would you do that? Because initially the highest-valued letter in the game, e.g. C, is determined randomly, with the other cards being ranked lower in C in order: C is higher than D, which is higher than E, etc. with G higher than A. When you play the same chord &mdash; that is, letter &mdash; as another player, you make that chord the new highest-valued letter for subsequent tricks.&#10;&#10;What's more, if you play the same chord as the player who started the trick &mdash; that is, if you improvise &mdash; not only do you change the highest-ranking chord, that trick goes unresolved and you start a new trick with the winner of that trick taking all tricks played since multiple instances of improvisation can take place.&#10;&#10;You score a bonus for improvisation, but you don't want to take too many tricks in a round as that will cost you points in the long run. Score well, lead the band, then step aside for others to (possibly) take things too far. After multiple rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Take The &quot;A&quot; Chord included rules only for three and four players, while the 2021 edition contains larger components and rules for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#233;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130; &#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#187;&#162;&#232;&#170;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#230;&#168;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#143;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#141;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

An Axis attack was met by a furious Allied counter-attack which then developed into a grinding battle of attrition and maneuver that finally ended in massive Axis victory.&#10;&#10;Alternating random activation by formation provides player with uncertainty and high re-playability as no two games will be alike. Each turn player receive a varying number of activations to represent the supply levels, command confusion, fatigue and intelligence of their armies and this leads to an ebb and flow to the battle as each side is dominant at different times. After units move, strengths are educed to simulate fatigue and lack of defensive preparation making counter-attacking key to the game. Minefields, airpower, anti-tank abilities and the armor versus infantry conflict are all modeled in a simple and effective set of rules.&#10;&#10;There are two scenarios with a playing time of 3-7 hours.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 1 miles / 1.61 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Regiments&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 17 x 22&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (168 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 12-page Gazala rulebook&#10;One dual-side printed cover sheet/player aid card&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-7 hours&#10;&#10;Note: Players will need to provide one 10-sided die for game play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Warriors of Jogu is a two-player card game in which players take turns playing units into one of five locations. The five locations are numbered 2 to 6, and at the end of each round battle happens at only one or two of these locations. Each unit that is in a battle location contributes its strength multiplied by the value of the location, and the sum of the contributions from all of a player's units is their strategy rating for the round. However, each player only knows one of the two battle locations, while their opponent knows the other battle location!&#10;&#10;The player with the higher strategy rating wins the round and one victory point. The other player not only loses the round, but also loses an amount of morale indicated on the units they deployed to the board &mdash; so be careful about playing too many units as they will cost you morale if you lose the round!&#10;&#10;If a player runs out of morale, the game ends immediately and the other player wins. If at the end of seven rounds, no player has ran out of morale, the player with the most victory points wins. In case of a tie (made possible by some special abilities), the player who won the final victory point (in the final round) wins.&#10;&#10;",

The 101st has battled their way to the small Dutch village of Veghel.  All they need do now is await the arrival of XXX Corps on their way to Nijmegen and beyond to Arnhem. As fate would have it, the Germans planned otherwise. German armor and infantry conducted several determined attacks on the positions held by the 101st.&#10;&#10;Operation Market-Garden is usually best remembered for the stubborn defence of the Arnhem Bridge by the British 1st Airborne. The equally important role of the two American Airborne Divisions is often neglected. Screaming Eagles in Holland covers the crucial defence of the Veghel bridges by the 101st Airborne. At Veghel, the Germans launched their most concentrated and determined effort to sever the vital supply and reinforcement route of Hell&rsquo;s Highway to the embattled British 1st Airborne at Arnhem.&#10;&#10;Screaming Eagles is the 13th game in the Tactical Combat Series.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters&#10;Units: Platoons &amp; individual vehicles&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 28-page Tactical Combat Series ver 3.1 rulebook&#10;One 16-page Screaming Eagles in Holland rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed Tactical Combat Series ver 3.1 charts &amp; tables folders&#10;Two dual-side printed Op Planning Sheets&#10;One Morale &amp; Turn Record Chart&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 6-20 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "(from the company website)&#10;&#10;The Great Game recreates the 19th Century Anglo-Russian struggle for supremacy in Central Asia.  In the actual contest, Tsarist Russia resented British expeditions into the Steppe Khanates while Victorian Britain feared that Russian entreaties to Persia and Afghanistan would jeopardize India's security.  So the two imperial powers wove a complex tale of diplomatic intrigue, colonial conquest and proxy wars that spanned 50 years.&#10;&#10;In the game, players alternate moving officers (historical personalities) and troops across a point-to-point map of Central Asia in yearly turns.  Imperial powers strive to enlist vassal states such as Afghanistan and Bokhara into their camp through diplomacy or combat.  Vassals offer troops and tribute to their imperial patron.  But there's a twist, vassals closest to Russia prefer alliance with Britain while those closest to India prefer Russia, so an engaging game of move-counter move unfolds across the chessboard of Central Asia.  Random events such as the Crimean War, Sepoy Mutiny and American Civil War intrude to make each game different.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Carrousel is a game without turns. The board shows a carrousel with seven spaces in a circle. Placed on this (on five adjacent spaces) are five different-colored horses. The game also contains a deck of cards, each showing three horses in different colors.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player is dealt nine cards and lays them out in front of herself. The object is then to make the three horses at the front of the carrousel be in the same order as on one of one's cards. When this happens, you get a point for that card (put it upside-down in a private score pile) and get to draw a new one.&#10;&#10;There are a number of legal moves to make, like swapping the places of two horses, placing the last one first and so on. To score a card, you must perform a move to make the first three horses match one of your cards. If you make a move and they don't fit, you lose one point. If you're not fast enough, someone else will move something, messing up your plans.&#10;&#10;The game has been illustrated by St&#195;&#169;phane Poinsot.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Here's a strange merry go round!  Its wooden horses, joking and mocking, have come to life and nothing can stop them for turning in any direction!  If you want to ride, you'll have to catch them!&#10;&#10;To play Carrousel, you don't have to be a knight, jockey or a cossack.  A little speed and observation will do.  Find the right color combinations and move your horses quickly before your opponents do it for you!&#10;&#10;Carrousel is a game of speed and observation by Max Gerchambeaux who, when he's not cooking one of the best cassoulets in Paris in his restaurant, invents smart games for the whole family!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Lord of the Rings: the adventure deck game is a solitaire game, that takes from 5 to 15 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;In Lord of the Rings: the adventure deck game, the player is Frodo, whose goal is to reach Mt.Doom, drop the One Ring into the volcano's lava, and save Middle Earth.&#10;He has to hurry, as Sauron is gaining power, so the journey cannot last more than 25 days.&#10;In his journey, Frodo will encounter friends who help him (from Aragorn to Legolas) but he'll also encounter enemies (like Trolls and the Nazgul) that threaten Frodo and make his mission harder.&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&quot;Consider the card as a crossroad: therefore you are given choices on where to travel (up, left and/or right).&#10;The Directions show numbers (which range from 1 to 5) and show how many cards need to be drawn in order to proceed with the quest.&#10;&#10;B. Each card shows an aggression number (ranging from 0 to 3) which represents the attacks you have received while travelling.&#10;Sum the aggression numbers  of each card you draw to get an Attack value which represents the amount of wounds you have sustained this turn.&#10;At any time, if the total attack value is higher than Frodo's wounds, the player immediately loses the game.&#10;&#10;This means that the Attack value will be the sum of all aggression numbers of cards drawn this turn.&#10;&#10;Example: if the player chooses directions with a high destination number, which makes him move faster, he will finish the mission within the preset time of 25 days/turns, but will also increase the chances of getting damaged and killed.&#10;&#10;At any time, but before drawing cards from the quest deck, you can use the RING which will turn Frodo invisible and, therefore, immune to all the attacks received (consider all aggression numbers as 0). BUT doing so will also bring the Witch King closer to you. Any time you use the Ring, put a token on the the Witch King Track on the play mat.&#10;The first time you use the ring, put a token on the Ring symbol on the play mat: this is a reminder that the ring has been used at least once.&#10;&#10;While drawing or before drawing (depending on the item), the player will have the chance to use one item he is equipped with.&#10;The player can use only one item per turn.&#10;&#10;C.  Card Effects can be good or bad, depending on the card.&#10;A player resolves the card effects ONLY of the last drawn card of the turn. Unless otherwise stated, the ONLY thing the player should take into account while drawing the cards is the aggression number.&#10;&#10;Example: if the player chooses a direction with a destination number 3, he draws (one at a time) 3 cards, adding the Aggression Numbers of all 3 cards and resolving ONLY the effects of the 3rd card.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each turn, the player will have many choices to make, from deciding if he wants to rest (and recover his wounds), to which direction to go; from using potions or other items (like the Ring), to going looking for Aragorn to help him against the Witch King.&#10;&#10;Main game mechanic: push your luck.&#10;&#10;",

Movement is decided by dice (you chose which dice you use for each character you chooses to move).&#10;&#10;The game is won when either everyone is out of the mansion or when the last card (Clock Strikes Midnight) is drawn from the deck. You win by having the most moneybags (of the 20 available) of any of the players.&#10;&#10;You are always trying to &quot;knock off&quot; the other heirs because as they are gone, their moneybags move down the will to the next heir in line. The board is a 3D house with several traps, which you use to get rid of the other heirs.&#10;&#10;You can bluff by moving your opponents' characters towards the entrance or moving your own character onto the trap spaces, but without releasing it.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    13 Dead End Drive&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It is an empire of changing flags. The old crown fell, and many stepped forward to claim it. That was two centuries ago.&#10;&#10;Now the barons and the princes swear loyalty to whichever claimant-emperor garrisons the nearest army today. The clergy sell their sermons for the highest bidder, and spies whisper promises to mercenary generals.&#10;&#10;You are the one true ruler of the broken Empire of Lyssan, and it's up to you to put the pretenders (the other players) in their place before their endless squabbling tears your nation apart. You (and others) will attempt to take control by using castles, knights, nobles, priests, and spies:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Knights hold territory and fight masterfully.&#10;    Nobles hold territory, support priests, and fight poorly.&#10;    Castles hold territory, spawn new units, and protect knights and nobles.&#10;    Priests manipulate influence and support spies.&#10;    Spies assassinate priests and other spies, and have the devastating power to steal other players' court cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Lyssan is an intense board game of strategy, cooperation, and betrayal for two to four players. The winner is the player who claims the most trophies, and each trophy can only be claimed by a single player. One trophy card might call for the player to control the most mines, the next to have most spies deployed, and the next to have the most sophisticated court. An upcoming trophy is revealed each turn, requiring strength, cunning, and adaptability to win.&#10;&#10;Lyssan combines tightly designed euro-style rules with the interactivity and flavor of an epic wargame. Lyssan has slim rules comparable to many family friendly games. Yet the play is as rich and interactive as the crunchiest, most grognard-friendly wargames. And Lyssan plays fast. A typical game of Lyssan runs a full hour quicker than comparable games.&#10;&#10;Lyssan combines: &#10;A map to be conquered (like Risk)... &#10;...with a few different unit types that act a few different ways each (like Chess or Diplomacy) ... &#10;...with cards that let players pull off devastating surprise moves or permanently improve their abilities. To play one card, you discard others. (Like Race for the Galaxy) These cards can be very powerful, but they can also be stolen by spies. The whole landscape of the game can change in the blink of an eye as ownership of a card changes hands. Get one of your spies into a rival's castle, and you can take over his improvements or turn his own followers against him.&#10;&#10;All interrupting effects have been stripped out of the game, so each player can complete their turn quickly, without waiting for the others. The game has been designed from the start to allow timed play, like a tournament chess match. This is good for players who want extra-brisk play, or who just have one slowpoke at the table who needs to be reined in.&#10;&#10;",

Each Hero comes with their own set of four double-sided Action Cards placed on the table in front of the player.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you will use two of those cards, performing Actions like attacking monsters (but not other Heroes), searching through rooms, moving or preparing for the next rounds. After using an Action Card, you will flip it to the other side, featuring a different Action.&#10;&#10;Each Action can be boosted by using the Boon effects from any number of Fate Cards from your hand. Fate Cards are drawn from a common Fate Deck at different points of the game (usually when using the Prepare Action). But Fate Cards can also be used for their alternative Bane effect, which allows you to move monsters, make unexpected changes to the layout of the labyrinth, or snatch treasures from other players.&#10;&#10;Each turn will end with the active player drawing one Fate Card for its third and final effect: monster spawn and movement. This is also the time when most monsters will be able to attack the Heroes, dealing damage some of which can be easily soaked, while other have to be placed on their Action Cards, making them unavailable until the Hero is healed.&#10;&#10;",

Place one card from the deck letter side up and another color side up. When the timer starts, everybody plays at the same time. You can play a letter on the letter pile as long as you can name something that starts with that letter and that &quot;matches&quot; the current color showing; similarly, you can play a color on the color pile as long as you can name something of that color that starts with the letter atop the letter pile. For example, when playing a &quot;B&quot; card next to a yellow card, you could say &quot;Banana!&quot;, and when playing an orange card next to an &quot;L&quot;, you could say &quot;Lion!&quot; You can't repeat a word previously given, and you can't name the color of the color card.&#10;&#10;Whenever you want, you can say &quot;Roger!&quot;, and all players must flip the cards in their hand, so letters become colors and vice versa. Alternatively, you can say &quot;Over!&quot;, and players pass their cards to the left.&#10;&#10;When time runs out, you gain points equal to the number of stars on played letter cards, then subtract 1 point for each unplayed card.

The object of the game is to get your team through the qualifying for the (soccer) World Cup, and hopefully win.&#10;&#10;The game has a board which depicts a a bunch of soccer fields - just placeholders for the cards played in the &#10;tournament: from 16 fields for the first elimination round and the 8 fields for the round of 16, up to the one field used for the finals. There is also a deck of cards for each of the teams involved in the game with two sets of numbers printed on the card depicting the number of goals scored and the number of penalties given to that team. Finally there are counters depicting the 32 teams in the tournament.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with five random cards and the team counters are randomly distributed to each of the players (showing which team each player will 'manage'). Each team is rated either as 0, 1, or 2 - this is the 'bonus' number of goals that team will score in each match it plays.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn can play a card onto any soccer field. On the preliminary matches (fields), the cards are placed face-up (maximum of 3 cards), on any other field, the card is placed face-down. Once all the fields are full, the matches are resolved with the winner of the match going on to the next. Once the preliminary matches are resolved and the teams determined for the next round, those cards are flipped over and the results determined. This is done all the way to the finals.&#10;&#10;A player can determine where his team will end up playing each subsequent match and play cards face-down to try to get his team to win, but if your team is upset early - all those face-down cards that you played are now going to help some other team and not yours.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Bug, winner of the 2017 best combinatorial game award, is a 2 player combinatorial game where you build shapes on a hexagonal board, which then eat each other. The shapes that survive grow into different, larger shapes until one player runs out of space to grow (and thus wins).&#10;&#10;The game is played with white and black stones on any hexagonal tiling. The author strongly recommends playing at first on a &quot;hexhex3&quot; board, and playing on larger boards only after accruing some skill.&#10;&#10;The game originated in the author's thinking about a cognitive phenomenon called &quot;perceptual binding&quot;, and how it may be used to make combinatorial games more easily understandable to the human mind, given its peculiarities.&#10;&#10;Summary:&#10;&#10;A bug is an entire group of connected, same-color stones on the board. A single stone is also a bug.&#10;&#10;The size of a bug is the number of stones it contains.&#10;&#10;The board starts empty. Black begins the game by placing one black stone on any empty space. Then, starting with White, the players take turns. Each turn has 3 steps, taken in order: 1) Grow, 2) Eat, 3) Bonus Grow&#10;&#10;1) Grow: Place a stone on an empty space to either start a new bug or grow one of your preexisting bugs by one stone. You may not merge bugs, and you may not grow a bug to be larger than the largest bug on the board (regardless of color) prior to placement.&#10;&#10;2) Eat: All your bugs which are adjacent to one or more enemy bugs of the same shape (possibly rotated and reflected) must eat (capture) those enemy bugs.&#10;&#10;3) Bonus Grow: Increase the size of each of your bugs that ate, by exactly 1, by placing a stone of your color on any empty space adjacent to each such bug.&#10;&#10;If eating would unavoidably force a bug to grow by more than 1 through a merger with another bug of the same color, no eating occurs.&#10;&#10;If, after growing, a bug is adjacent to an identically-shaped enemy bug, it must eat the enemy bug (and grow again) if possible, and so on.&#10;&#10;The first player who CANNOT place a stone in the placement step WINS.&#10;&#10;",

Your rightmost column is also considered to belong to your right-hand neighbor, and likewise your area includes the rightmost column of your left-hand neighbor. Each player reveals any two cards in their area, then the round begins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either draw the top card of the deck and reveal it, or draw the top card of the discard pile. If you draw from the discard pile, swap that card with any card in your area, then discard the replaced card. If you draw from the deck, you can discard that card (turning any card in your area face up) or you can swap that card with any card in your area.&#10;&#10;If you draw from the deck, any other player can knock on the table to indicate that they want this card. You can ignore the knock, or you can give them the card; in the latter case, they then replace one card in their area with this new card, taking the old card in their hand. You then take any one card in their area and swap it for a card in your area, discarding the replaced card. The other player then places the card in their hand into the hole you created when you took one of their cards.&#10;&#10;Any time you have three identical cards in a row or column &mdash; even a row that includes a card in your left neighbor's rightmost column! &mdash; you discard those cards from play.&#10;&#10;Whenever one player has all their cards face up, each other player takes one more turn, then players sum the value of the cards in their area (which includes any cards remaining their neighbor's rightmost column). If the player who triggered the end of the round doesn't have the lowest sum, their sum is doubled. The player with the lowest total score after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

This action was one of the few in the Civil War where the South actually outnumbered the Federals. The battle was closely fought and the game recaptures the spirit of the struggle for victory. After the disasters at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the South's hope was to secure one decisive victory in the west.  Large portions of the Army of Northern Virginia were detached to bolster the hard-luck Army of Tennessee.  After being maneuvered out of Chattanooga without a fight, Braxton Bragg's army struck the Union forces under Rosecrans on the Chickamauga Creek.  The bloody battle of Chickamauga ensued...&#10;&#10;Its the fourth game in the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series of games by The Gamers&#10;&#10;This is a game of that hard-fought, evenly balanced battle.  In it, players can test their skill with the converging armies - to generate the South's last hope and turn the tide in the West.

    "Description": "The events of Zena 1814 take place during the eight months in which Genoa was an independent city, following the end of Napoleonic domination and lasting until the Restoration of the Congress of Vienna. As the city's great families did in reality, you must cooperate with your rivals to reap the rewards of shared commercial ventures and the prestige of successful military victories. But your ultimate goal is to surpass all the others in the race for prestige! Zena 1814 is a game in which cooperation and competition always go hand in hand &mdash; but in the end there can be only one winner!&#10;&#10;The focus point is that is possible to place influence cubes on cards, including the ones played by opponents. This causes a very strong interaction among players and plenty of choices.&#10;&#10;In each round, players can move their pawns through the game areas and play cards from their hand belonging to areas where they have at least a pawn. On each card are spaces that allow others to influence it; the player who played it must influence it, while the others can decide whether to do it or not to obtain the effect of the card. Each time a player chooses to influence a card played by another, this one gains a smaller one-time bonus. This participation aspect reflects what really happened among historically families in those years...&#10;&#10;",

Static maps have been replaced with randomized locations on a set layout. Nodes towards a mission goal still exist but are no longer printed on the mission sheet. Instead, a deck of &ldquo;node&rdquo; cards are drawn and placed on an 11 x 17 map sheet as mission progresses.   To further customize the experience, the &ldquo;node deck&rdquo; can be split into specific encounter types such as zero-G, hazardous terrain, science facility, and so on.&#10;&#10;Space Infantry: Resurgence also brings together every module, both by LnLP and by the game&rsquo;s developer, including New Worlds, Hordes mode, Steele Bones, and The Last Outpost with new components, systems, and artwork.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "from user review:&#10;Each player assumes the role of a intra-galactic merchant, traveling from planet to planet in a future where wars are unheard of and &quot;Traders&quot; are the heroes of the cosmos. The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by &quot;jump lines&quot;: you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an &quot;orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.&#10;&#10;As the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in &quot;Prestige.&quot; These &quot;contracts&quot; vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.&#10;&#10;",
