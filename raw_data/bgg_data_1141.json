Players count to five while looking at what their opponent has rolled and then secretly order their own dice in a line behind their hand. This determines which card each die will be allocated to. The first die in the line will be allocated to the firest card and so on. The first player to finish allocating dice will break ties during the round. &#10;After both players have finished ordering their dice, they are revealed and then placed on the card they were allocated to. Each card is then resolved in order (1 to 5), paying attention to the rules that are written on the card. When  one  player  has  a  higher  end  total  for  a  card  than  the  other player, they are said to DISCOVER the card and receive a number of Discovery Points equal to the number on the card.&#10;Players play six rounds in the way described above, totalling  their Discovery Points across all six rounds.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to connecting cities and completing tickets in the usual way of other Ticket to Ride games, your routes can reach border crossings and thus connect neighboring countries. If you manage to create such a connection on your turn, say, building a track so that you have a connected line from Ukraine to Germany, you draw the top point card from the stack for each of these two countries. Their point value is arranged in descending order, which means that the players who are the first to draw cards receive more points. If you later connect this network to the Czech Republic, then you'd draw the top card from each of the three countries' card stacks &mdash; assuming that a country's cards haven't all been claimed, of course.&#10;&#10;",

The cargo hold is specifically designed to hold an M577 APC with its turret stowed, but in some cases it could be utilized to carry large amounts of equipment, emergency supplies, or even entire companies of troops to the ground.

All of the above actions create powerful combos, making you more and more powerful.&#10; The game play is tricky: resources used in the Past expire in the Present and Future.

It includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A reproduction coin of antiquity.&#10;     One additional Imperial Roman army (31 cards). This means that both players can command a Roman army in a civil war battle.&#10;     Two sets of four mercenary cards:&#10;         Cretan Archers&#10;         Gallic Medium Infantry&#10;         Hoplite Spears&#10;         Numidian Light Cavalry&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Employing mercenaries offers you the chance to use troops that are not normally part of your army&rsquo;s composition. Different troop types have different uses on the battlefield, so mercenaries offer you tactical options not usually available to your army (or give you additional units of a troop type you want more of in your army).&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;d like to use a mercenary unit in your army, here&rsquo;s how to do so:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Before flipping a coin to decide the game&rsquo;s first player, choose one of your four mercenary cards to hire for your army. Add it to your army without showing your opponent the card you have chosen.&#10;     Remove one other unit card of your choice from your army; this card is not used in the game. Note that the removed card cannot be a Leader.&#10;     The mercenary card counts as a standard unit card in your army.&#10;     That&rsquo;s it!&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player may choose up to one mercenary unit to add to their army.&#10;&#10;The downside of using mercenaries is that everyone knows they are there &ndash; that&rsquo;s the price you pay for their added flexibility! The card backs say &lsquo;Mercenary&rsquo; on them, so your opponent will always know if you hold a mercenary card in your hand or if it is the next card in the draw deck. However, they will not know which mercenary unit you have chosen until you use it for the first time.&#10;&#10;",

You must place the cards you take face up on the table in front of you, clearly arranged by letters, so your opponent can always see what you have taken so far. The game ends when the row of cards is exhausted. Then the players do the scoring.&#10;&#10;The scoring combinations are either sets of three such as; three of the same letter &ldquo;b&rdquo; or &ldquo;e&rdquo;...etc or sequences of letters that spells either &ldquo;bug&rdquo; or &ldquo;bedbug&rdquo;. Each card can only be counted once in a set or sequence. Your score for the deal consists of two parts. First, for combinations, score as follows:&#10;&#10;sets:&#10;&#10;three &ldquo;b&rdquo; for 3 points&#10;three &ldquo;e&rdquo; for 6 points&#10;three &ldquo;d&rdquo; for 9 points&#10;three &ldquo;u&rdquo; for 6 points&#10;three &ldquo;g&rdquo; for 9 points&#10;&#10;letter sequences:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;bug&rdquo; for 12 points&#10;&ldquo;bedbug&rdquo; for 18 points&#10;&#10;Next, take your total score and multiply it by the total number of cards drawn by your opponent to have your final score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Bags of Coronium are represented by yellow or green discs.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a small coloured wooden token (their Miner). Players move through the orbits of different planets based on the roll of two dice. A player collects Coronium by landing on a planet and then throwing a particular number associated with that planet.&#10;&#10;When a Miner with five or more bags (discs) of Coronium lands on Mars, it becomes a Martian Raider. The small Miner token is exchanged for a large wooden token of the same colour. The Martian Raider can then capture Coronium from another player by landing directly on the player's Miner.&#10;&#10;To win the game, a player must arrive back on Earth, by exact count, with 15 or more bags of Coronium.&#10;&#10;",

Timing of the launch and other external events are determined by a rotating disc on the board that rotates when a double is thrown with the dice. Once all the required components and 25,0000 litres of fuel is collected a player launches a satellite. &#10;A successful launch is determined by throwing a number greater than 6 with the two dice. If the total of the dice is less than 6 then the launch fails and all is lost. An exception to this is if a player obtained life insurance for the scientist and fire insurance for the rocket whilst moving around the board.&#10;The player who successfully launches the most satellites in a set time is the winner.&#10;&#10;A Greek version of the game is titled 'Lunik', where 5 playing launch pads are included instead of the typical 4 in RISCO.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

Every round but the first is much the same. You roll a die and use it to solve the grid puzzle and mark off two numbers from the lists of numbers, one for the type of die you use for the roll and one for the type of die you choose to mark on the board. If all numbers of a die type are used, you could no longer choose to roll this type of die or write that die type to the grid.&#10;&#10;The die roll will be used both as the limit of movement and the number to cross off. You do not have to write the same die type on the grid as you roll, but the number used, must be within the range of the die type. Remember that there may not be two of the same die type written into any row or column.&#10;&#10;There are three bonus actions to use during the game (the star symbols on the gameboard). Be aware that using them all will end the game, regardless of whether or not there are squares left to fill in. Resolve any movements before ending the game, after the last bonus action is used.&#10;&#10;The first round will be different.&#10;&#10;First round&#10;Chose a number from any list of numbers, mark this off and place your first mark on the board in any square on the grid. Write either a number, symbol or letters to remember what die type you chose. At the sides of the grid, there is die type symbols for all columns and rows, to help guide you, you could mark these off as well. This marked square is your starting position. The following rounds movements must start from the position of the previous round. You may not end a movement in a previously marked square.&#10;&#10;Any following round&#10;Start the round by choosing one die of any type.&#10;&#10;Mark off a number of own choice from the list of numbers the same die type as the die type you use.&#10;&#10;Roll the die, and use this number shown to move, and to mark off a number from any list of numbers (associated with a die type), this is the die type you mark to the board. It has not to be the same as the die type you rolled.&#10;&#10;Rolling a one&#10;If you roll the number one with any die, you either chose to reroll or use one bonus action. Unused bonus actions are worth four points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The Bonus action&#10;If you use a bonus action after a roll of one. Cross out one of your three bonus markers and mark one square anywhere on the grid with a die type of your own choice. This will be your starting position next round. Remember to cross out one number of that die type as well.&#10;&#10;The bonus action could also be used as a reroll of any die roll during play.

Grab the gold and get out!&#10;Goblins and Gold is a game about several dwarves who stumble into a goblin gold mine. The greedy dwarves must grab as much gold as they can carry and make it out of the mine alive. Players compete to steal as much gold from the goblins (and other players) as they can. Goblins and Gold is a dice rolling game with a subtle strategy behind every move you make. Players take turns laying down mine cards to build the mine. This means that players have control over where they want to place gold and goblins. It also means that the board is different every time you play the game! Each player controls their own dwarf, but all the players control the goblin horde and the powerful ogre. Players can play defensively, keeping the goblins away from themselves, or aggressively, pushing the horde towards their opponents. There's only one ogre, but if it hits your dwarf with an attack, instant game over! Use action cards to gain an edge on your opponents. Knock goblins off the board, steal gold from other players, and freeze the ogre in place until your next turn. Plan ahead and make sure you're the dwarf to survive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The smaller the die, the weaker, but quicker. There are roughly two types of places to place, either material-gathering places, which number varies depending on number of players, and the University, which allows players to play upgrade cards from their hand. The four-sided worker allows the player to take the selected action 3 times, the 6-sided twice, and the 8-sided just once. However, the player can strain the worker in order to perform certain extra actions, and this will lower the endurance of the worker &ndash; a worker with just 1 endurance cannot be placed. Being pushed out by another player's larger worker will also lower a worker's endurance.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 3 &quot;years&quot;, each year being divided into the above first phase of gathering of materials and playing cards, and the second phase of completing the tasks of the year. Once a player starts completing tasks, they cannot go back to gather materials, but first to the mill gets more points.&#10;&#10;The special upgrade cards that players play when placing a worker on the University customizes the player's various abilities, giving their workers or the laboratory improved or new functions.&#10;&#10;Ater 3 years, the collected VP for completing tasks is tallied with bonus points for various things, and most VP wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each full game turn represents 10 days to one month of &lsquo;real time,&rsquo; depending on the time of year.&#10;&#10;The maps illustrate the militarily significant terrain found in and around this border area of western Germany in 1944-45 when portrayed at this scale. The national boundaries shown are the final internationally ones from just before the war began in 1939.&#10;&#10;A hexagonal (&ldquo;hex&rdquo;) grid is printed over the map to regulate the placement and movement of units across it, much like the squares in Chess and Checkers. A unit is considered to be in only one hex at any one time. Every hex on the map has a unique four-digit identification number printed within it. They&rsquo;re provided to help find exact locations more quickly and to allow for the recording of unit positions if a game has to be taken down before it can be completed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Also, it contains many trashers that help you build stable decks by throwing away cards you don't need. Moreover, it contains some flexible cards for combo decks, so you can enjoy combo decks more easily.&#10;&#10;People in ancient times built great civilizations, though they had much lesser technology than today. They constructed pyramids, wrote documents and lived in a high mountain hundreds or thousands of years ago. At a glance, such great civilizations were flashy. However, in fact, they based on constant supply of food. How did they manage it?&#10;&#10;The most important thing was stability. Astrologers predicted what would happen; shamans removed bad fortune when they were asked to; people wore accessories to gain more power; lapis lazuli was thought to prevent evil spirit. Ancient people made efforts to avoid disasters, such as famines, drought and floods.&#10;&#10;Now that many ancient remains have been discovered by archaeologists, you can use the wisdom of ancient people.

To advance a rocket, one adds the numbered square the rocket is on with the result from a roulette wheel spin. E.g If a rockets sits on square 6 and the roulette spin is a 2 they may advance to square 8. Problem is there is only 25 squares on the board so a player could remain on a spot if the number spun on the roulette wheel adds up to a number not found on the board. In addition, the numbered squares are either black or red, with red holding unpleasant surprises.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player to return their rockets to earth and to have accumulated the highest number of points.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Arcane Scribes&#10;&#10;The Arcane Scribes are the trusted aides of the mighty Magi. They are tasked with channeling the necessary mystical energies from the Elemental Oinks to awaken the runic manifest arriving from the various realms so as to inscribe powerful spells into scrolls ready to be cast by their prodigious masters at the snap of fingers during deadly battles of magic. Are you good enough to win the minion of the month award?&#10;&#10;TKG ARENA: The Arcane Scribes is a game set up for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;Components required for this game:&#10;&#10;FULL SPELL DECK:    1&#10;WORLD TILES:    48&#10;OINKS:    2 from each element for each player (Default)&#10;&#10;Winning Condition&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Arcane Scribes consist of a group of world tiles representing the sources of an array of available spells furnished by a FULL SPELL DECK, symbolizing the runic manifest. Players take on the role of an arcane scribe choosing and inscribing spells onto their master&rsquo;s scroll by activating the required number and type of Oinks. The value of the collection of spells scribed depends on the strategic choices made and can be measured in terms of victory points.&#10;&#10;Victory points are tabulated as follows:&#10;&#10;1. The victory points from each spell card scribed are equal to the FACE VALUE of the spell card. E.g. A Telegate spell is worth 8 victory points.&#10; 2. The victory points of each spell card of an element double if all other players have less spells of that element in terms of number of spells scribed.&#10;&#10;3. Reserved spells that are not scribed are worth 0 victory points.&#10;&#10;Ending Condition&#10;&#10;The game will end immediately when there are less spells cards than the number of players in play.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of the common shuffled FULL SPELL DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the FULL SPELL DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved.&#10;&#10;Players then draw 5 world tiles from a stack of shuffled world tiles faced up from topmost first. The world tiles are put adjacent to each other in a row side by side faced up. 5 spells cards are drawn from a re-shuffled FULL SPELL DECK and placed on each of these world tiles from left to right. The rest of the spell cards in the FULL SPELL DECK remain face down as a pile.&#10;&#10;Additional Notes&#10;&#10;Each player may only have a maximum of 5 Oinks (of any type) in their possession. Any above this limit must be immediately discarded back to the common supply. Players may choose what they want to discard whenever this limit is exceeded. Whenever the common supply is not able to fulfil any needs, the need will be unfulfilled.&#10;&#10;Game Flow&#10;&#10;During each turn, players can do one of these four actions:&#10;&#10;1. Take 2 Oinks of different elements from the common supply.&#10;&#10;2. Exchange 1 Oink for up to 3 Oinks from the common supply. The Oink must be of a different element from the 3 Oinks traded. The 3 Oinks must be of the same element type.&#10;&#10;3. Reserve a spell card and place it face down in the respective player&rsquo;s personal playing space till it is scribed at the normal cost. For 1 &ndash; 4 players, up to 2 spell cards can be reserved at one time.&#10;&#10;4. Scribe a spell card and pay for the cost depending on the FACE VALUE of the spell card. 1 Oink of any element is required for each unit of the FACE VALUE. E.g. for a FACE VALUE of 9, 9 Oinks must be expended and returned to the common supply. If the Oink used is of the same element type as the spell card to be scribed, it will count as 2 Oinks for this purpose. E.g. An ASHW spell of FACE VALUE 9 can be scribed with 4 ASHW Oinks and 1 Oink of any other element.&#10;&#10;When a player either reserve or scribe a spell card and the spell is moved from the world tile to the player&rsquo;s personal playing space, the elemental insignias on the world tile will be revealed and a follow up effect for the rest of the players occurs.&#10;&#10;1. If there is only 1 elemental insignia on the world tile, the rest of the players get an Oink of that element from the common supply.&#10;&#10;2. If there are 2 elemental insignias on the world tile and they are different, the rest of the players can choose to get 1 Oink of an element from either element but not both. If the 2 elemental insignias are the same, there will be no choice.&#10;&#10;3. If there are 3 elemental insignias on the world tile, the rest of the players can chose to exchange 1 Oink for up to 3 Oinks of elements matching the elemental insignias. The Oink that is traded must be of a different element type from any of the elemental insignia(s) on the world tile.&#10;&#10;4. If there are 4 elemental insignias on the world tile, it is an ARENA world tile and players can choose to take 1 Oink of any of the 4 elements present from the common supply.&#10;&#10;After this follow up effect, the world tile is discarded and a new world tile is drawn from the stack to replace its position and anther spell card is drawn from the FULL SPELL DECK to replace the spell card that has been just scribed or reserved. The ending condition is then checked to see if the game should end and victory points calculated according to the winning conditions to determine a winner.
