Use Tornadoes, Wipeout Balls, LolliSloth Ladies, X-Ray Vision, Slam Dunks, DJ Skills, Pickpocketing and Bank Robbery to edge ahead in summoning the sea monster from the depths. A party or warm up game that can be played quickly and taught even quicker.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player plays a card out of their hand of 7. The card effects are played out and then the player replenishes their hand back up to 7 cards from either the draw pile or the top card of the discards. Card effects include stealing cards from other players, wiping out other players hands, looking at other players hands, blocking another players effect card.&#10;&#10;The game moves around the players until one of them spells the word KRAKEN with the letter cards and shouts KRAKEN. Any player that has 5 letters of the word KRAKEN must shout AHOY or forfeit their hand and start with a fresh hand.&#10;&#10;",

Strategically strengthen your armies on the districts of the city under your control, attack the neighboring districts to expand your dominion. Try to reach your goal and defeat your opponents to remain the only ones left on the board and win!&#10;&#10;In this game we find ourselves playing the opponents of the superhero. The title includes up to a maximum of four players, who can however choose from the most iconic villains of Gotham City: Bane, Joker, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler and Harley Quinn.&#10;&#10;This is a first new element compared to the classic version of RisiKo! In fact, each villain will have a Criminal Plan to carry out, developed in different missions (such as taking control of specific territories or making certain results with the dice). Achieving a certain number of objectives will activate the character's special powers, giving the player various advantages during the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Clearly while the villains compete for the districts of Gotham City (following the traditional RisiKo! dice-rolling mechanic!) Our hero is not standing idle. When five 1's are rolled during a turn, Batman goes into action, clearing one or more territories on the board and wreaking havoc in the fight for control of the metropolis. Especially in the initial stages it will not be easy to watch, but it will always be a great emotion to swoop into our opponents. It will be less pleasant when it's our turn to face the Dark Knight, but that's part of the challenge too.&#10;&#10;In addition to conquering all of Gotham, you can take home the game by completing one of three objectives, common to all participants. However, every time a criminal empire is definitively defeated, the player who accomplished the feat can choose to eliminate one of the conditions.&#10;&#10;&#10;RisiKo! Il Gioco di strategia pi&ugrave; amato in una edizione speciale ambientata nel mondo DC! Nei panni di uno dei Supercriminali di Gotham City scenderete in citt&agrave; per conquistarla! Rinforzate strategicamente le vostre armate sui distretti della citt&agrave; sotto il vostro controllo, attaccate i distretti confinanti per ampliare il vostro dominio. Cercate di raggiungere il vostro obiettivo e sconfiggete i vostri avversari per restare gli unici rimasti sulla plancia e vincere!&#10;&#10;",

Therefore, it is not enough to expand their territories and open pubs. You will need to use your own gang's special skill wisely, create a working network for your (illicit) activities to thrive, get the most out of the characters and use the best moment to attack (or defend against) your opponents. Mechanics and themes were matured by the expertise of designer Marcos Macri and his long creative process. The result is an exciting, fun and balanced card game. You don't need to know or like the show to enjoy this game, but fans will delight in the elegance of the artwork and character reincarnation.&#10;&#10;In his turn, the player has three options: expand his region or open a new business, laying down cards in his table; or receive profits from the table itself. It's also possible to use the effect of different characters to optimize actions and improve gang development.&#10;&#10;After the endgame is triggered (the pubs cards or the territory cards have run out), the leader who scores more points wins and achieves supremacy over rival gangs.&#10;&#10;",

Since the game is heavily player vs player, it requires both Pioneers and Bandits in similar numbers. A single Round consists of the Pioneer turns (rotating player order) and then Bandit Gang's turn (any order). Either the Bandit Gang team or the Pioneer with the highest Reputation at the end of 25 Rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;For Pioneers, Reputation is mostly earned by doing a job (Panning or Mining for Gold, Herding Livestock, Trapping for Furs). For Bandits, Reputation is primarily gained by robbing the Pioneers. Additional cash and Reputation can be earned by robbing the Train, Saloon, and Bank or by performing a Jailbreak. Cash allows you to load up with Weapons, Items, and Pets. Power Cards that grant extra abilities, upgrades, and utility bonuses can be collected around the map at the Indian Village, Saloon, and Ghost Town.&#10;&#10;Pioneers move using Movement Cards and can also ride the Train that travels around the map every Round. Bandits move either by using Movement Cards or Ambush Cards. Ambush Cards allow a Bandit to secretly hide on a space on the board. Battling is primarily dice-based, but also includes Power Cards and character abilities.&#10;&#10;",

In an underground temple, you must use the Board of Opportunity by placing stones with powerful crystals that will determine what the future holds. However, summon too many crystals of one color and bring horrible luck upon your people.&#10;&#10;In Crystallia, each descendant duels for the good fortune of their people by drafting stones from a pyramid and strategically placing them on the Board of Opportunity, which they will create from 6 of 16 different pieces at the start of each game. Activate stones by creating lines of crystals of the same color, taking advantage of free crystals on the board and use powerful abilities that change the board-- and the turn order. Patience and self-control are needed as these stones can unlock special powers like the ability to rotate stones, move stones or even earn another turn.&#10;&#10;Stones can only be drafted from the pyramid if no other stone is on top of them, so picking the right stones can be challenging. If you create a line of four of the same crystal, you must take another turn. Do this at the right time and you could find yourself collecting the crystals that bring you closer to victory.&#10;&#10;With an advanced variant that has unforgiving consequences and rewards perfect timing, Crystallia will have you asking yourself: do you have what it takes to navigate the Board of Opportunity?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Your stage can only be 3x3 stacks and each stack can only have 3 cards, but once you place the third card on a stack, it cannot be altered for the rest of the game.  But building stacks, while encouraged, is also risky.  If you don't fill all 9 spaces of your stage, you'll lose points for each unfilled space.&#10;&#10;Most frogs score points at the end of the game but some frogs' abilities trigger immediately such as the pink frog that helps you recruit extra frogs or the green frog that allows you move frogs between stages.  These two frogs are powerful and help you ruin your opponent's plans.&#10;&#10;For more addictive replayability, dual frogs are thrown into the mix to give more variety and open up entertaining combos such as a yellow frog being worth up to 15 points or adding extra points to each blue frog.

    "Description": "This new edition takes us from the death of Alexander in 323 BC and the war of his successors &mdash; the Diadochi &mdash; which will last fifty years, to the last battles in Italy and Spain of the Second Punic War in 206 before BC, via the expedition of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus in Italy between 280 and 275 BC.&#10;&#10;Two great systems of weapons clash then, the Macedonian phalanx and the elephants against the legions of the Roman Republic, but the battle of Cynoscephalae will not take place until 197 BC and the phalanx is not yet obsolete.&#10;&#10;Champs de Bataille is a board game largely inspired by an English rule for miniatures called De Bellis Multitudinis published by the Wargames Research Group in the early 1990s, four booklets of army lists ranging from 3000 BC to 1500 AD accompany this rule.&#10;&#10;The general classification of troops allows not only armies to compete in historical battles, but also non-historical adversaries thanks to its budgeting system, providing practically endless what ifs.&#10;The adaptation for board game makes it possible to play many battles of antiquity on a small surface and without figurines with on average between 20 to 30 counters on each side.&#10;Overlays to be cut are also provided to vary the battlefield. No two games of Champs de Bataille will be the same.&#10;&#10;Through eight lists that will allow you to experiment with many army combinations and four historical scenarios(*), this module will give you the opportunity to replay many battles with a relatively simple system.&#10;&#10;(*)    Paraitacene (317), Gaza (312), Ausculum (279),  Ilipa (206).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (edited)&#10;&#10;",

However, its main focus is to get treasure ships back to Spain while avoiding pirates and other navies who also have a hunger for gold.&#10;&#10;The pirate faction is a disjointed conglomeration of characters like Blackbeard, Jack Rackham, Mary Read, Black Bart Roberts, and others, each trying to capture victory points by looting, pillaging, or capturing prize ships.  If they can pull together and establish a Pirate Republic and add a little whimsy, the black flags of the pirate faction may even have enough swagger to take on the navy factions in the game.&#10;&#10;The merchant faction produces exports and seeks to get them back to Europe.  They establish plantations, produce crops and get them to port, then ship them off for export.  Of course, with pirates lurking everywhere and navy captains stopping your ships for inspection, it'll take everything the faction has to produce enough VP for a win.&#10;&#10;So, pick your side and customize your deck (or play with the suggested decks) to give yourself the best chance to win.&#10;&#10;The game is packed with historically accurate people and ships of the Age of Sail and Age of Piracy.  They made history.  Can you rewrite it?&#10;&#10;&#10;    Note: 2 more factions have been added in preparation for our Kickstarter event in late summer of 2023.  The &quot;Yankees and Frogs&quot; expansion adds the American and French factions to the game for even more historical shenanigans and cooperation.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This adds a strategic gameplay element to a genre of games that is often very dice-driven.&#10;&#10;Example: Team A may be very good at offensive rebounds. When a shot is missed, they would have a better chance of grabbing a rebound than teams without as good ratings. By spending coaching points, those results can be modified.
