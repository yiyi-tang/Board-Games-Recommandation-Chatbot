If the cards don't transform your face in the same eye, you return them to their places in the circle, with everyone else remembering what they saw on your face. Perhaps they should tell a story about what the objects you saw in the museum and why they made you look that way.&#10;&#10;If you don't make a match, you lose one of your life tokens, and if someone runs out of tokens, you lose the game.

    "Description": "Inside the Cup is a simulation of the sport of golf using PGA Tour players and courses.&#10;&#10;The development of the game started as a spinoff of the old Avalon Hill Golf game and then blossomed into something all its own. The stats the PGA tour keeps are much more detailed than ever before allowing for players to really show their strengths and weaknesses on golfer cards. Golfers are rated for driving length and accuracy. The cards show the golfers&rsquo; ability to hit greens from all distances along with proximity to the hole. Scrambling shots from the sand or around the green are captured as well as putting ability for distance and keeping away from the 3 putt.&#10;&#10;Courses are depicted in colorful segments showing the good and the bad places on each hole. As shots are hit they end up in quadrants on the course that show the next club that will need to be used. Stay in the fairway and your next shot should be easier and hold better on the green. Hitting out of the rough or worse can make the shot to the green harder and might not hold up like you like. You don&rsquo;t want to be too far off the green as those areas could spell danger, while around the green shows safer chip shots or bunkers to hit out of. Some greens even have adjustments that make them easier to hole out or some are more likely to bring out a 3 putt.&#10;&#10;Gamers can just let the golfers&rsquo; golf or you can have some strategic decisions to make. Should I hit a little less club onto this narrow fairway? Go for it on this par 5? Should I go pin hunting or just play it safe to the middle of the green? Should I putt aggressively or just lag it up there and get off this green?&#10;&#10;There are even ways to quick play the game. You can go hole by hole or finish a round with one roll of the dice. ITCG is a fairly fast playing game that can allow a gamer to take his favorite golfers out on some of his favorite courses without leaving his own table.&#10;&#10;",

However, if they roll more of a number than the row supports, they cannot fill that row. When a player rolls the exact dice to finish their pyramid, they have to yell &quot;Inkarumi&quot;. If another players yells first, they roll is forfeit. Anyone who calls out &quot;Inkarumi&quot; in error has to delete some previously filled fields. The first player to completely fill their pyramid is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

You have to watch the minions all the time  because otherwise they would screw up everything. I got sick and tired of this. I wish I had loyal assistants able to chasten the minions, twist the asteroids' tails, and bring me coffee in bed... Well, perhaps, that's not necessary.&#10;&#10;But in our galaxy, everybody with a head on their shoulders fancies themselves a villain. Where to find quick-witted servants? Luckily, the League of Villains has come to aid just in time. They have assembled a portal to another dimension inhabited by best henchmen in the universe and vowed to open it once per season. I hope they are not lying. So all I can do now is wait! And rig the portal with explosives, of course, to prevent other villains from laying hands on what is rightfully mine!&#10;&#10;The Henchmen Expansion for Supervillain: This Galaxy Is Mine! gives you figures that are head and shoulders above ordinary minions. In the hands of a skilled villain, each henchman is able to reverse the course of the intergalactic battle!&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, you shuffle the &quot;Unstable Portal&quot; card in the domination deck along with &quot;Secret Facilities&quot;. Sooner or later, some player draws &quot;Unstable Portal&quot; , and when this happens, each villain takes a henchman card, which includes three abilities from which to choose. You can play any one of those abilities, then you place the henchman card in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;The two upper abilities of a henchman card are played strictly in accordance with the minion ops rules. Furthermore, using a henchman is considered playing minion ops. Therefore, during your turn, you may either play one of the two upper henchman's abilities or a regular minion ops (along with any number of swift minion ops). As for the lower ability on a henchman card, it is played as swift minion ops. It's much weaker than any of the two upper abilities, yet comes in handy sometimes!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As you already know, in a Galaxy far, far away, Superheroes have vanished. The local Villains were swift to use this opportunity and started a marvelous mayhem. They aren&rsquo;t that experienced yet but have already laid hands on the antimatter and erected Secret Facilities on their planets.&#10;&#10;Our duty is to enlighten them by setting the poor things on the right path of mutual destruction. Share your experience, teach disastrous tricks to them &mdash; and don&rsquo;t forget to retreat before it gets too hot. As we always do.&#10;&#10;Please submit three copies of your signed applications to the galactic cash register.

Deal one Run for Power! card to each player. Put the upper Legendary Villain card face-up. When a Villain draws New Legend card from the Domination deck, replace the Legendary Villain card with the next one.&#10;&#10;Each Legendary Villain has a Salutation, Influence, and Superpower.

Recently another Galaxy has approached ours; it looks like the local Villains were pumpkin-headed enough to waste each other. Only Minions remain. The poor things wither without supervision on their desolate planets...&#10;&#10;The scouts (those who managed to survive) report though that space self-defense forces are still active on some planets, while miniatures shaggy alien beasts were spotted on other planets, while somewhere else... these issues have to be dealt with. I have to send an Asteroid there.&#10;&#10;Or two Asteroids. Or, even better, three. Somebody has to scavenge the scarce values left on these mysterious planets. Otherwise other Villains are going to loot everything...&#10;&#10;Postscriptum. A special note for Asteroid firing pointers: &ldquo;Shoot gently! The Asteroid must neatly penetrate the force field around the planet leaving all the valuables intact for further scavenging. Understood?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;During the game, Lootable Planets expansion provides an alternative. You may launch an Asteroid either into another Villain or into Lootable Planets. Then, in the beginning of your next turn, the Asteroid hits the target and... you find out what has happened.&#10;&#10;Some cards of the Lootable Planets expansion are very useful. Hitting such a card is like hitting the jackpot! For example, May the Loss Be with You! card allows you to seize a random card from other Villain&rsquo;s hand immediately, Backdoor Asteroid &mdash; to deliver a sudden blow to other Villain&rsquo;s planet, while Star Shower &mdash; to launch two Asteroids at once.&#10;&#10;Other cards of the Lootable Planets expansion are not that efficient. Sometimes the Minions point the Asteroid not very precisely and it smashes a half of the planet. The remaining half brings smaller loot.&#10;&#10;Finally, there are two nasty cards &mdash; Ambush of Alien Hamsters and Assault on Black Hole. The Minions have launched the Asteroid... in a wrong direction. Assault on Black Hole simply &lsquo;eats&rsquo; your Asteroid, which is logical &mdash; what else would you expect from a Black Hole?! But the Hamsters are worst of all. These tiny evil beasts retarget your Asteroid into you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each of the games involve using imperial resources (known as White Granite, Mithril, Weirwood and Ilium) acquired from The Bourse to build magnificent wonders of the world known as Great Works.&#10;&#10;Bourse &amp; Build is for 1-3 players and takes 5-10 minutes to play.

Whoever contributes the most resources to a great work is entitled to name it; whoever names the most great works wins the game.&#10;&#10;Bribe the Bourseholders is for 2-4 players and takes 10-20 minutes to play.  The game is played over four seasonal summits during which players use imperial resources to try to bribe members of The Bourse who vary in their influence.  Whoever controls the most influence at the end of the game dominates The Bourse and wins.&#10;&#10;Great Work! is for 2 players and takes 10-15 minutes to play.  Players invest imperial resources to contribute to building four great works.  The player whose investments pay off the most wins the game.&#10;&#10;Cartel is for 2-4 players and takes 10-15 minutes to play. In the game, players are Merchant Princes seeking to dominate The Bourse by controlling Bourseholders to create a Cartel with a monopoly in one of the Imperial Resources.

This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages, for use with a variety of rule systems, to be used together. The rules are simple enough that players who have not previously encountered them &ndash; including wargaming novices of any age &ndash; can be taught the basics in  fteen minutes or so and then learn the rest &ldquo;on the job&rdquo;. &quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;A new English Civil War set, called &ldquo;To the Strongest! For King and Parliament.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Battles fought using the TtS! rules can be fought with model soldiers, on a dining room table and won or lost in less than two hours. The rules also support huge battles, with several thousand figures and up to five players a side.&#10;&#10;A grid enables players to completely dispense with measurement, and so permits the game to move along at a cracking pace. Miniatures can be in any scale from 2mm to 5mmm and based for any of the common wargaming rules systems. To the Strongest! games use a unique activation system driven by either playing cards or chits. This system introduces uncertainty to a battle; in some turns a unit can move four or five times, and in others not even once. The same deck is used to resolve shooting and melee. No dice, whatsoever, need be rolled!&#10;&#10;The rules include terrain placement and points values to support those players who wish to play competitively. Numerous army lists can be downloaded, for free, from the BigRedBatShop.&#10;&#10;TtS! Rules are written in plain English, with appropriate diagrams, sample lists and many examples of play. They are copiously illustrated with pictures of battles and beautifully painted miniatures. They have proved popular with veteran and novice wargamers alike!&#10;&#10;The rules enable two or more players to fight battles on a tabletop to a conclusion usually in two hours or less.&#10;&#10;The book includes 78 pages of rules including army lists, diagrams and numerous images of beautifully painted wargames figures and battles. It is printed on 130 GSM paper, with stiff card covers, and wire-O-bound so that it will lie flat on the table.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Every aspect of the game was designed with one overarching question in mind: does this help break the ice? It's primarily designed to help shy, reserved and introverted people socialize, laugh their socks off, and have a great time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Contents:&#10;&#10;4 Player figures &ndash; these are children, whose names you can imagine yourselves.&#10;1 Playing board, which represents a meadow with lots of colourful flowers, divided in 38 spaces.&#10;28 Animal tiles.&#10;1 six sided dice with the numbers 1, 2 and 3 (each number twice).&#10;&#10;Goal of the game and game idea:&#10;&#10;The children are playing at the flower meadow of the Mole. Other animals grow curious of their cheerful laughter and, as they begin to approach the flower meadow, are invited one after the other to join them. The meadow is small, though, and the children must consider which is the best way to distribute the space on it so that as many animals as possible can get a spot, or maybe even all 28!&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Distribute the player figures randomly on the playing board (2, 3 or 4 pieces, one per player).&#10;     Place the tile with the Mole on one of the corner spaces, and the rest of the tiles face up or face down beside the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: it is suggested to play with 20 animal tiles on the first, introductory game. The rest of the tiles are then put back in the box and are not used in that game.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The youngest kid begins. After rolling the dice, they move they player piece as many spaces on the meadow grid as the number rolled. They are allowed to move on any direction on the grid, but only forwards. That is, they can't turn or change direction midway.&#10;     If the player figure lands on a new space (not occupied), an animal tile is freely chosen and placed on the space the player just left when moving (on the first roll, the space from which the player started, and so on).&#10;     Going around the table, each player then does the same on their turn, bringing more and more animal tiles onto the board.&#10;     While moving, both other player pieces and occupied spaces can be jumped over, but they still count as spaces moved towards matching the total rolled on the dice.&#10;     As the game goes on, the available space for placing tiles becomes more and more scarce, and one can't land beside another player's figure!&#10;     If a player can't place a tile on their turn, they can move another player's figure instead of their own. To do so, though, they must ask the figure's owner for permission first.&#10;     The children are allowed to discuss and give advice to each other regarding where to best place the animal tiles. Nevertheless, the decision is always on the hands of the currently active player.&#10;&#10;&#10;Mainly through the rule that makes the players ask for permission to move another player's figure in case that they can't move their own, children are motivated to play fairly and respectfully, which ends up being of benefit to all players as a group.&#10;&#10;End of the Game:&#10;&#10;If the players manage to lay down all the animal tiles, they win. If they don't manage to do so, they lose.&#10;&#10;For subsequent games, add or subtract one tile from the 20 tiles used in the introductory game, depending on whether you won or lost the last game respectively. For example, if the introductory game played using 20 tiles is lost, try with 19 tiles next time; if that game is won, try with 20 tiles again &ndash; if the introductory game is won, try with 21 tiles next time and work your way up to using all 28 animal tiles at once.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the manual (translated)&#10;&#10;",

With his Uncontrolled Wrath Special Ability, he's able to roll 2 extra dice when he attacks Zone 1 (for a total of 3 dice, as each Hero is able to roll 1 die innately) - enabling him to clear many Krohns storming the walls as he bellows savagely. His Base Strength of 3 ensures that he's strong enough to deal with Elite enemies and M&ouml;lens without needing Bonus Strength. But all of his savagery comes at a price: Thorlak can't store Permanent Cards, and therefore can't equip Armor or Weapons.&#10;&#10;As a veteran of many battles, Eivor, the Noble boasts a Base Strength of 2, which enables him to deal with the Elite versions of Krohns and Gargohs from the very start of the game. Eivor's Persuasion starting Special Ability grants an extra Gold when he visits the Palace - and this extra Gold may be given to another Hero if he chooses to do so. With this ability, the entire group of Heroes may benefit, as the extra Gold that's shared can make the difference, enabling a Hero to use a vital Resource Card! Lastly, as a lord of the city, Eivor can more quickly level up due to lower Food costs requirements, which will make him an even more valuable asset in the siege!&#10;&#10;With his Cook Extraordinaire Special Ability, Donatto gains an extra Food everytime he visits the Barn in the Citadel, and this extra Food may be given to another Hero of his choice. Having the famous chef on the team will ease the pressure to get Food each Season for the entire team.&#10;&#10;",

With his Base Strength 2, he has enough damage to kill Elite Krohns, Elite Gargohs, and Orcs right from the beginning. But more importantly, his starting Special Ability Legendary Vigor allows him to ignore up to 2 hits per round, in true tank format! It makes Viggo ideal to soak up damage where it's needed the most: be it while protecting a vital building or battling Assault Units in a side of the wall that's swarmed with enemies!&#10;&#10;Growing up in a farm gave Dahlia, the Peasant not only a deal of hardships to overcome, but also a solid dedication to work and a strong will. 'Stoicism', her starting Special Ability, represents Dahlia's natural skill to overcome troubles and frees her up from the requirement of gathering food by the end of each season. That means that her actions can be better spent in other areas of the Citadel and it makes it easier for her to get new Special Abilities. Lastly, she also has a Blue Permanent Card slot, which allows her to use one piece of Weapon or Armor.&#10;&#10;Astrid, the Princess is unique in the fact that she doesn't have a starting special ability. Instead, Astrid's Special Ability slots have lower Food requirements, enabling her to acquire new Special Abilities quickly and easily. Due to her military knowledge, Astrid has 2 Permanent Card slots, meaning she can don combinations of Weapons and Armor that will give her an edge in combat.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Daggers is a two player micro game. The game is about the size of a deck of playing cards.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to accrue the most points by playing a numbered card on each of their turns. Their hand is finite and cards are drawn rarely. They must use the resources they are given in clever ways to win two out of three rounds of play. Special Arcana cards can drastically effect the game, each offering a unique power.&#10;&#10;Daggers feels like it belongs in a rich fantasy world. Both the look and play of the game make it seem like a living and immersive piece of a fantasy setting.&#10;&#10;The art and feel of Daggers draws on the iconic images of the tarot. Both in name and depiction the cards have an esoteric flavor that add an air of romanticized mystery to the game.&#10;&#10;If you've ever experienced the trope of the seedy fantasy tavern, be it in a movie, a book, or perhaps a role-playing game, then you know the scene is not complete without a few shady characters gambling in the greasy lantern light. The game they are playing is Daggers.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Under Cover is a light-hearted game of spy-collecting -- a set collection game, with a theme of intrigue. Manage your resources, in order to build your spy network. The more spies you have in the field, the higher your score. Put the most spies into active duty to win the game! Build your team of spies, informants, sleeper cells, whistle-blowers, and double-agents to infiltrate enemy targets. Steal agents from your opponents, call upon underworld contacts. Do what you must to ensure your forces are stronger than your enemy's.&#10;&#10;As a set collecting game, the obvious goal of Under Cover is to gather the largest sets of cards -- larger sets of cards laid down scores more points. But, each card also has a special ability, which allows you to do special actions, such as drawing more cards, stealing from opponents' sets, forcing your opponent to draw cards (to put them over the hand limit), or taking cards from the &quot;Veterans Pile&quot; (the set of cards that have already been spent for their special abilities). On your turn, you may draw cards, then you'll decide how you want to act. You can lay down cards to score points, discard cards to make room in your hand, or play special ability cards. All of the cards are special ability cards. Under Cover even requires special ability cards to pick up a set from the table, so you can add to it.&#10;&#10;Each game begins with a simple shuffling of the deck. That's all the setup required, so the 15-30 minute play time is entirely playing. The cleanup at the end of the game is just as simple: put the cards back in the box. The Solo mode of the game is just as simple as the multiple-player mode, but it becomes more of a puzzle game -- instead of trying to get more points than the other player(s), you have to score large enough sets in ALL the color groups. That is impossible without using the abilities on the cards in a tactical manner.&#10;&#10;Under Cover has strategic choices to make, but it's a quick game that sets up in moments, and can be put away in seconds. It can be taught in five minutes, but can be played over and over -- with a quick shuffle, you're back in the game. It works as a great filler, or a fun game to play with your kids.&#10;&#10;",

Historically Onna-Bugeisha have been associated with the Naginata and Kaiken as fighting weapons; one very long and one very short!

Living to 100 years old she is still honoured today and often held as an example of everything the Onna-Bugeisha symbolise.&#10;&#10;The Warlord studio has worked hard to bring you these stunning and intricately detailed models, perhaps some of the best we have made!&#10;&#10;The box set contains:&#10;&#10;7 exquisite metal Onna-Bugeisha models&#10;    cards to play Test Of Honour&#10;    Campaign rules booklet&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Go Eco is a card game for 2-6 players that celebrates diversity in nature.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to reach a predetermined number of points over multiple rounds by scoring a set of food chain cards from one ecosystem.&#10;&#10;Players start with a hand of 8 cards. On your turn you can either draw a card or declare victory of the round. If you draw a card then you can play or discard a card from your hand. There are two basic types of cards in the game: Ecosystem cards and Go cards. Ecosystem cards will be collected in order to declare victory. Go cards allow you to gain an advantage over other players or protect yourself. If you declare victory and meet the victory conditions, you tally your points and then begin a new round. Play continues until one player has reached the predetermined number of victory points, 50 for a shorter game or 100 for a longer one.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Dominion of the Stars is a solitaire game in which you take the role of a world empire expanding its sovereignty into space. This calls for sending starships from your home planet to explore deep space. Along the way you will make various discoveries while trying to colonize as many planets as possible. Colonization of a planet is achieved after its discovery, conquest, and development have taken place. In addition, you must retain control of your planets by protecting them from the game-controlled enemy race.&#10;&#10;Planet Discovery&#10;Dominion of the Stars takes place in a fictitious galaxy where many formidable findings await. Among your findings will be planets requiring commitment and investment if you hope to colonize them. Assessing a planet&rsquo;s profile requires the determination of the following key data:&#10;&#10;&bull; The value of the planet&rsquo;s natural resources.&#10;&#10;&bull; The presence of intelligent lifeforms.&#10;&#10;&bull; The difficulty of development/colonization.&#10;&#10;Quadrant Accessibility&#10;At the onset, the only major discovery is a WarpGate located within your home quadrant. A WarpGate provides instantaneous travel to other quadrants. As more WarpGates are discovered, more quadrants become accessible. The game provides a total of 7 quadrants that can be explored based on access.&#10;&#10;Starship Movement&#10;Normal space travel is performed using hex-to-hex movement. In addition to moving from hex to hex, a player may move from level to level (within a hex). Hex level is represented by counter placement; how a counter is orientated or whether it is inverted.&#10;&#10;Starship Types&#10;The player oversees the following types of starships on behalf of the empire:&#10;&#10;&bull; Exploration starships &ndash;used to discover habitable planets in deep space (among other discoveries).&#10;&#10;&bull; Military starships --used to secure fleets during exploration, and to conquer/defend planets.&#10;&#10;&bull; Development starships -- used on one-way missions, these starships are necessary for colonizing planets.&#10;&#10;Winning/Losing&#10;There are different degrees of win and loss as outlined by the Achievement Scale. Through the process of discovering and controlling planets, it is possible to win the game. If you are unable to discover and control the necessary number of planets by the end of 26 turns, the game is lost.&#10;&#10;Dominion of the Stars is available as a free Print &amp; Play game (uploaded to BGG) or as a Print-on-Demand (see official link). In the Print &amp; Play version, counters replace all the non-cardboard pieces (except for the rolling dice).&#10;&#10;",

The good spirits want to help the kid navigate the ever shifting rooms of the old house, where as the more sinister spirits are trying to sneakily lure them into the basement to never return...&#10;&#10;Spirits of Carter Mansion is an 18 card game, where players navigate through the different rooms of the mansion, and use their unique effects to inch closer or further from their goal. In order to enter a room, you must convince the other players that your room is the best choice, and convince that you are in fact a good spirit. Beware of the treachery of the evil spirits trying to convert other players to their sinister ways, or their deceptive words, as they try and steer the neighbours child towards the basement.&#10;&#10;Each turn players will play a card from their hand which represents a room for the child to travel into, each player then makes a case for why their room should be picked, and the chosen room is then navigated into. Evil Spirits will try and trick the group into journeying into the basement, whilst good spirits must try and maintain justice and level-headed thinking through the rooms.&#10;&#10;The game ends once either victory condition is met, the Good players must travel, and retrieve the Soccer Ball, and return to the entrance, whilst the Evil team must journey into the Basement (however if the basement is entered with the Soccer Ball, the ball is lost in another room, and good gets another chance to continue!). If either Victory condition is met, all the players of that alignment win!&#10;&#10;Spirits of Carter Mansion relies on clever bluffs, subtle team work, social deception and Luck for players to successfully navigate the perils of the haunted estate!&#10;&#10;",

Beware!&#10;&#10;The Time Portals allow the Professor to make use of his own amazing time travel technology &mdash; to manipulate time within the Castle itself! When he moves around the Castle, the Professor will open time portals in each room he stops in. And if he ever revisits one, he will jump back in time and repeat his turn, making him an even-more forbidable opponent!&#10;&#10;",

Each player drafts a pack of dinosaurs (dinos), wagers precious stones (tokens), and then watches as their dinos take on their opponents dinos in head to head duels.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of three cards which are arranged in a line face down. These cards are their pack of dinos. Players take turns successively replacing these cards from the deck or discard pile until one player is satisfied with their pack and knocks. The aim is to make a pack that can win the most head to head duels.&#10;&#10;When you think you have the best chance of winning the round you can use your turn to knock instead of drawing to replace one of your cards. This causes the play to end after each of the other players has taken one more turn.&#10;&#10;The game is played across five rounds and the player with the most stones at the end of those five rounds is the winner. If, at the start of a round, a player can not ante three coins the game is over and that player has lost. Alternately, before the game begins, players may agree upon a set time limit or number of rounds for the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players must carefully consider pushing forward for longer deliveries because once they are done, there is no going back to shorter deliveries.&#10;&#10;This expansion map was released for attendees of the  inaugural Age of Steam Con in March 2018 and then made available for purchase at and after HeavyCon in May 2018.&#10;&#10;",
