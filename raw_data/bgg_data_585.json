This allows it to stand, like a table, with one entrance on each side. Five round wooden pieces fit inside the Elchomat perfectly. The game includes six round wooden pieces: two with white numbers (2 and 3), two with black numbers (2 and 3), one with an arrow, and one with an elk.&#10;&#10;The roll-out board shows a map of Scandinavia with a race track superimposed on it. The track is made of spaces that are either white, red, or black. Players try to be the first to get to the end spot on the track, and movement is determined by the Elchomat.&#10;&#10;The Elchomat is filled with five of the six pieces. The sixth is placed outside one of the four entrances. On a players turn, they push the outside piece into the Elchomat, and of course one of the pieces comes out the other side. The piece that emerges determines the car's movement. The arrow means the car moves one space. The numbers depend on the colors. With red numbers, the car moves forward if the car is on a red space. Otherwise, the car moves backwards. The same works for black. The car moves forward with any number if it starts on a white space. If the elk emerges, the car is struck by an Elk and loses a turn.&#10;&#10;A fun game to play, and it is very difficult to remember how the pieces are positioned within the Elchomat.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "soft landing is an abstract strategy game about the global haves and have-nots, with two possible endings: Players either work towards technology that brings about a new era of peace and prosperity, for which only one player gets the credit (and victory points), or it is every nation for themselves, trying to have the most hoarded away when the final collapse comes.&#10;&#10;Basically, people are competing for score and each player is a &quot;nation&quot; (geopolitical entity like &quot;North America&quot;). It is designed for 3-6 players, but there is a 2-player variant, and the rules are such that someone who has played it can explain it quickly to new players.&#10;&#10;soft landing is a trade and resource management game, but the trick is, different players are going to be trying to end the game different ways, and everyone has a different starting score. The European Union has good production numbers, but only starts with 3VP. Africa, not so good on production, starts with 12VP, and there are regions that start with up to 17VP. Obviously, Africa wants the game to end sooner, while it is still ahead, and may try to force Catastrophes. The EU wants the game to last longer so it can develop New Era tech, and will be trying to abate Catastrophes.&#10;&#10;You need to provide for the needs of your people, and if you do not, you generate &quot;stress&quot;, which accumulates in a central location. The type of stress depends on your nation.&#10;&#10;For instance, on a production roll of &quot;5&quot;, Africa generates one Tech, one Industry and one Resources. If it does not acquire some Reserves or Lifestyle by the end of the turn, it will generate (from left to right, Political stress, Health stress and Population stress (fyi, the panda is Environmental stress). Each of these stresses has a little holding area on the score track where all the tokens accumulate until bad things happen...&#10;&#10;Each nation also can use its production to buy special abilities, which are generally what you use to mess with other players. For instance, Africa has good production numbers for &quot;Resources&quot; and might have a surplus, but need &quot;Industry&quot;. Another player might have Market Manipulation, and use it to drive the &quot;sell&quot; price for Resources down to zero, screwing over Africa. Or, a nation with a Military could take existing stress tokens and rearrange them. When enough stress builds up, bad things happen (minor or major Catastrophes), and whoever has the most of their tokens in that zone takes the blame (and loses VP). Your Military is not actually attacking another player, you're just taking existing global stress and shifting it around to get yourself out of a jam, blame someone else, or both. Your turn consists of production, using abilities, trade, stress and investment, each of which is a very simple action, so turns move pretty quick.&#10;&#10;soft landing has some superficial strategies and some more subtle ones. If you play looking only out for yourself, odds are that someone else will pass you by limited cooperation with another player.&#10;&#10;",

A stone is captured if it ends up &quot;in the tongs&quot; -- meaning between two foreign stones. On a players turn, they can move one space or jump in a straight line. The game is played in three phases that help react to the realty that the game requires more movement toward the end as there are fewer pieces to jump.&#10;&#10;The game is essentially an advanced version of Seega, the ancient Egyptian game, but makes it much better by using a hex board and adding the phases of play.

    "Description": "This game is based on the traditional concept where you flip a plastic chip by pushing its edge with another chip. However, the author has added an entire sports stadium with different disciplines, which are very well designed. For the high jump, for instance, you actually have to flip your chip over a bar that is raised each round. There are also more jumps and different running competitions. For each of these you can gather points which determine the overall winner.&#10;&#10;",

Enjoy!&quot;&#10;&#10;After this history lesson from the box, a little about the game itself is in order.&#10;&#10;Piracy is a two player abstract game with a pirate theme.&#10;&#10;The board is composed of two ships, one Spanish and one pirate, between the two is a rope net consisting of six by five spaces. The rope net also has 4 broken rope spaces which will drop a player's piece to the sea (out of game) if they land on it.&#10;&#10;Players have two options a turn, they may either launch as many as up to 5 game pieces from their ship's cannon doors towards the enemy. Or, move all their pieces on the net forward one space, either forward or diagonally up/down. Player pieces that land on the opponent's pieces remove the enemy pieces from the game.&#10;&#10;If a player's pieces reach the other ship, they will destroy the opponent's cannon door and any pieces behind it. The player's piece is also returned to the player's ship to again enter the net.&#10;&#10;The optimal game end is when one player removes all the other player's pieces from the board.&#10;&#10;An added complication is that pieces moving up or down off the net return on the opposite top or bottom, depending on movement.&#10;&#10;",

Figures can move one space or jump over others, with the goal to bring all of your pieces to the other side.&#10;&#10;The game works well because of two additions. First, each player has a Mandarin that starts on a temple space and must end on his opponent's temple. If the Mandarin is hit, it returns to its home temple. Second, the game includes seven blockade discs. These are placed at the beginning of the game, and the rules offer four variations on how to treat them.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This roll &amp; move game is another Monopoly clone with some notable differences.  The &quot;color groups&quot; represent different craft fairs held throughout the year and the &quot;properties&quot; are different days of each fair.  Instead of &quot;houses&quot;, player may buy booths to open on different days of the fairs.  Different players may have different booths on the same day space.&#10;&#10;Booths and mortgages are marked on the board with durable, vinyl, reusable stickers (like Colorforms toys) and the player pawns look like little old craft fair vendors (both male and female).&#10;&#10;From back of the box:&#10;&#10;TWELVE CRAFT FAIRS surround the game board.  CRAFT BOOTHS are in each fair.  Players (VENDORS) shake the dice and move around the board, trying to buy the fairs and booths that each one thinks will help him/her win the game.&#10;&#10;Colorful VINYL MARKERS are used to show the ownership of the fairs and booths.  Each player has a different color which matches his/her playing piece.&#10;&#10;PROFIT or LOSS CARDS contain over 100 DIFFERENT CRAFT ITEMS and designate whether the player &quot;COLLECTS&quot;, &quot;PAYS OUT&quot;, OR &quot;BREAKS EVEN&quot; on the business transactions in the booths.  These cards also bring about INTERACTION AMONG THE PLAYERS which adds to the fun of the game!&#10;&#10;",

This mighty tome comes in at 264 pages and takes into account the feedback we have received over the years since Afrika was initially released, as well as new research that the team has unearthed.&#10;&#10;The first major change is that not only is North Africa much larger than its predecessor, but it will also be in hard cover. This means that it will stand up to the rigors of gaming like never before as we give our Late War armies a break and head back to North Africa and Italy.&#10;&#10;The second major change is that a number of the companies have been split up into Africa, Tunisia or Italy lists. This means we have been able to more accurately represent the forces fighting in each of the theatres. The organisation diagrams for choosing your company have also been changed to the new style. This makes it much easier for new and experienced players to put a force together.&#10;&#10;The last major change is that we have added in some of the new units that you have come to see regularly in Late War such as heavy artillery, as well some new ones like British 3.7cm AA guns. &#10; As a result of the increased size (50+ pages larger than before) we have also been forced to increase the retail price of the book, making it the same price as the rulebook. Taking customer feedback into account regarding Fortress Europe we felt that it was important to include all the lists that you knew and loved (as well as a few more that will become favourites), rather than dropping anything out.&#10;&#10;North Africa will be in stores 29 August 2009!&#10;&#10;",

The islands were populated in the late 19th and early 20th century. Commercial sugar cane cultivation and fishing (mainly for consumption on the islands) are the main sources of income. In the early 20th century, a small freight train network was build on South Daitou Island (&#229;&#141;&#151;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#157;&#177;&#229;&#179;&#182;) to get the sugar cane to the harbor. This railroad network served until 1983.&#10;&#10;In the game &lsquo;Daitou&rsquo;, players build sugar cane farms and railroads. Life on the islands is expensive, however, and the margins of profit are small. Efficiency is key. Whoever made the biggest fortune after three years wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is currently a prototype.&#10;&#10;",
