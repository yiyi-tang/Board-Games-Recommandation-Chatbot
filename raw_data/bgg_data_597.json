The card is then put to the bottom of the pile and the player takes another.&#10;&#10;The card illustrations are not always absolutely identical with those in the circus grounds.

The planets were built on wooden platforms an connected to the base-plate via wooden pegs. The game was handcrafted, and hand-painted, all the cards, rules, and names were invented for the occasion.&#10;&#10;The army pieces were made from broomsticks (round pieces), and the others by sawing rectangular rods. Rocks were glued to the surface of the board and elevations were made from insulation foam. Electric illumination from toy railroads were added later, the pictures added here are from the candle - sun phase.&#10;&#10;If players were eliminated, they received the ability to control a non-player character, who would occupy a certain space (i.e. planetary system) that could not be reached by any player, and could continue harassing the best players.&#10;Army pieces were allowed to move so long as they successfully conquered a new territory, making the game travel fast, and allowing boxed-in plaers to quickly gain territory on their round. Refreshments (new armies) were doled out on two methods (agreed upon in advance). Once, with more and more armies each time, and one depending on what the player offered the non-player characters (in terms of cards).&#10;&#10;It never left this conceptual design phase, but allowed us several years of extreme gaming fun.&#10;&#10;",

The game is on the high strategic scale with corps and army units fighting a cross a map running from Aachen to Paris. Each turn is six months, with ten turns covering the entire war.&#10;&#10;The game system is a distant derivation of the &quot;area-impulse&quot; mechanic created in Storm over Arnhem. Units are activated by group in a single area, and may generally move or attack but not both before becoming &quot;spent&quot;. Spent units are more vulnerable to attack. Storm Over Europe uses a card-driven system for activation, with each side getting varying amounts of cards each turn. The cards generally allow special moves or combinations that break the standard rules of the game, or provide events that shape the strategic outlook.&#10;&#10;Players choose their hand each turn from a pool of sixteen Operations cards. Special Strategic cards are added to the pool once a turn from the third turn on; these allow special tactics like poison gas, or desperate offensives to turn the tide.&#10;&#10;The rules are only seven pages, and the game is simple and fast enough to play in a short evening.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    1 full map&#10;    198 counters&#10;    48 cards&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The entire game consists of a foam brick separated into two halves that fit together like two large puzzle pieces. &#10;SETUP: One person is designated as the &quot;Holder&quot; and the other player is the &quot;Chopper&quot;. The &quot;Holder&quot; holds the ends of the brick firmly, using two hands, so that its center is exposed. Face the &quot;Chopper&quot; and place the brick about chest high, holding it away from your body. This is the &quot;Ready&quot; position. As the &quot;Chopper&quot;, face the &quot;Holder&quot; and place your chopping hand lightly over the exposed brick to aim. Then lift your hand to touch your ear. IMPORTANT - If you are RIGHT handed, use your LEFT hand - and if you are LEFT handed, use your RIGHT hand for the chopping hand.&#10;TO PLAY: 1) The &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; to begin the contest. After announcing &quot;Ready&quot;, the &quot;Holder&quot; may fake, pull the brick aside, or do anything to try to fool his opponent, the &quot;Chopper&quot;, into committing himself. He must always return the brick to the &quot;Ready&quot; position to give the &quot;Chopper&quot; a chance to strike again. After each point is made the &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; before a new strike can be made. 2) The &quot;Chopper&quot; MUST KEEP HIS HAND AGAINST HIS EAR UNTIL he is READY TO CHOP. He can fake - but must always keep his hand touching the ear during the fake. Once he has started a chop, taking his hand from his ear, he must CONTINUE the chop and try to hit the brick.&#10;TO SCORE: The &quot;CHOPPER&quot; scores one point if he strikes the brick. The &quot;HOLDER&quot; scores one point if the &quot;Chopper&quot; misses the brick.&#10;After every 5 tries the players change places. The first one to score 11 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A traditional mancala game played in the Congo.&#10;&#10;From Mancala World: http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Imbelece&#10;&#10;Imbelece is a three-row mancala game of the Genya (also known as Wagenia). They are a small people with a population of just about 19,000 who live near the Stanley Falls not far from Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Genya were fishermen and hunters.&#10;&#10;Imbelece is only played by men as it symbolizes fertility and courtship. The Genya use the seeds of the Ngola tree (Pictantus makombo) to play the game. It seems to be related to Embeli and also to some Ethiopian mancala games such as Selus.&#10;&#10;Imbelece was first described by the British ethnograph P. Townshend in 1977. Later another description was published by the American L. Russ which was inaccurate (like so many of his accounts).&#10;&#10;There was an Imbelece tournament at the Regionale Schule, Niederzissen (Germany), on May 15, 2008, which was won by David Fischbach.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Imbelece is played on a mancala board, which consists of three rows. The outer rows have six holes. The central row has four ordinary holes and a large one in the middle, which is a store. The smaller holes are called moseka (&quot;girls&quot;). A player controls the six holes in the outer row closest to him and the holes to his right of the central row. The store is used by both players.&#10;&#10;At the beginning each girl contains three seeds called maana a moome (&quot;boys&quot;) or maana a leemba (&quot;male teenagers&quot;).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the boys of one of his holes counter-clockwise into the following girls. This is called koenda (&quot;visiting the girls&quot;). After a player has dropped the last boy into the right-most girl of his outer row, he continues sowing by visiting his girl in the central row adjacent to the store, then the girl to the right, before he switches to the opponent's outer row.&#10;&#10;If the last boy visits a girl, which contains boys, these boys including the visitor are distributed in another lap.&#10;&#10;If the last boy makes a population of four boys in a girl of his opponent, this girl is &quot;closed&quot; by putting a leaf on it. The Genya call it kosongo moseka (&quot;marrying a girl&quot;) or koija moseka (&quot;killing a girl&quot;; in other words: turning a girl into a woman). For moseka, you can also say moakali (&quot;newlywed woman&quot;). Then the four boys are distributed in another lap.&#10;&#10;Exception:&#10;&#10;In the first half-move no girl can be married.&#10;&#10;During sowing closed holes are skipped. If the wife was made from one of the player's girls, nothing happens. However, if she is on the opponent's side, a boy must be put into the store, before the sowing continues. This is known as ko-ongesa moakali moleli (&quot;providing food to the newlywed woman&quot; (while her husband is on a hunt)).&#10;&#10;A move or a lap may never start from a closed hole nor the store.&#10;&#10;The move ends, when the last boy falls into an empty girl or in a wife of the opponent's side (i.e. the store).&#10;&#10;The player who could move last wins.&#10;&#10;Draws and ties cannot occur.&#10;&#10;Strategy&#10;&#10;The girls in the lower right and upper left corners are known as ipaoko (&quot;respectable girls&quot;). A boy who marries such a girl in real life, will enhance his social prestige, a player who marries her in the game will have a big advantage.&#10;&#10;",

Players use a tournament format to choose their preferred quotations from several historical sages, and the winning quote makes it to the championship. Everyone wins! The tournament includes hundreds of great quotes and encourages discussion of &quot;real stuff&quot;--peace, love, honesty, trust, truth, dreams, hopes, forgiving and genuine friendship.  If you pitted the wisdom of Gandhi against the wisdom of Mother Teresa, who would win?  Pit the wisdom of Shakespeare, Buddha, Eleanor Roosevelt, William James, Helen Keller, Coach John Wooden, Maya Angelou, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jane Austen, Plato, Anais Nin and a host of other thinkers up and bare witness to something good.&#10; Agreed The Tournament of Enlightenment:&#10;&#10;Creates a safe context for sharing thoughts, beliefs, values and opinions.&#10;Fosters sharing, cooperation, working together and building a sense of community.&#10;Generates and achieves heartfelt dialogue.&#10;Helps people get to know each other on a personal positive level.&#10;Prompts deep conversations and the use of concepts and choices that are sadly missing from our black and white world.&#10;Provides a means to re-learn the skills necessary to find common ground, build agreement and connectedness.&#10;Provides a safe venue for a group of like minded or different minded people to achieve deeper discussions. &#10;Guides players to share two thousands years worth of wisdom, wonder, mysticism, and precepts from many different traditions.&#10;Provokes a stretching of the mind, encourages reflection and lighthearted banter.&#10;Stimulates non-competitive and non-argumentative exchanges.&#10;Teaches skills in listening, sharing, consensus, team-building, critical thinking and democracy.&#10;Compels exploring of important poetic/literary/spiritual/philosophical/religious concepts among family, friends, colleagues, romantic interests, and acquaintances.&#10; Step into a good for you, good for me consciousness.&#10;  &#10;Great for: people who love quotes, the alternative/hippy/green/peace &amp; love crowd, the health and sustainability crowd, educators, bookstore patrons, literary types, coffee shop customers, poets, song writers, friends, family, strangers, metaphysical book store customers, college students, clients, spiritual and ecumenical folks, conference/fair/festival goers, philosophers, academic settings, therapeutic and self help folks, religious studies groups, dating, couples retreats, therapists, counselors, groups, companies, corporate trainers, Sunday school classes, boards of directors.&#10; Select comments from the comment cards from the 2010 Mensa Mind Games Competition: Original idea, interesting concept, easy set up, smart green board and minimal packaging (it does not come in a big clumsy box, it comes in a neat container), promotes agreement, has a feel good quality to it, a way to get away from alienating first person shooter videos, actually it was cool: kind of like watching democracy and philosophies at work, non-competitive entertainment, based on a concept of no discernible winning player; rather everyone is a winner, leaves you knowing more than when you began playing, worth marketing but not to the competitive and strategic game player market.&#10;&#10;",

And sometimes, splendid combination of taken cards becomes big score. These rules make the game more thrilling and brilliant. Hand combos are a bit complex but the basic is easy. Soon, you can learn them from charts. Because these hand combos have handicap points, you can select to play even with such a weak hands. In this case, turning a card becomes more thrilling.&#10;&#10;After seen your hand, if you decided no chance to win, you can drop from the round like Poker. But you must pay dropping fee to the pot (winner of the round get the pot). This system may teach players self control.&#10;&#10;It is convenient game for playing with 3 to 7 players. Active players are always 3 (or 2). Thus voluntary or not, other players should drop (If you have to drop involuntary, you can get compensation).

The Big Six consists of six separate tasks, which help students focus research, solve problems and make decisions. The players must have received instruction in The Big Six before playing this game.&#10;&#10;The board game consists of a series of questions which players need to answer correctly in order to score points and cycle through the Big Six process twice. The game board is divided into six areas that represent each step. These areas are flanked by &quot;rooms&quot; which occupy the four corners of the board. The rooms describe locations in which Big Six activities typically take place: the Classroom, the Library Media Center, the Home, and the Group Study (where students might work collaboratively on projects).&#10;&#10;The game is a linear race game which continues until all the players have finished. The first player to finish is not necessarily the winner. Nuts and Bolts has been designed to reward understanding the Big Six more than the roll of the die. Those players who have answered questions most deftly accrue the greatest number of points. The winner is determined when the last player has completed the second round.&#10;&#10;",

The basic mechanism is to execute one or two out of three permitted moves. To understand these it is important to note how many corners the pattern of the rubber band has (i.e. triangular, rectangular, etc.). The number of corners can be increased by one, decreased by one or stay the same, with one corner being moved to a new position. The player using least moves to reach the positions on his/her cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
