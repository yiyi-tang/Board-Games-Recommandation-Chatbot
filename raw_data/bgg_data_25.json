    "Description": "It's the most anticipated moment of any heist: time to split the loot. Of course, everybody trusts the boss to divide everything evenly, right? But will the boss be even-handed and make sure that every &quot;made critter&quot; gets a piece? Maybe the boss will pay off only some of them and keep the rest of it...&#10;&#10;GoodCritters is a game for 4-8 criminal critters who are pulling off heists and fighting over the loot! Whoever is chosen as the boss can distribute the loot from the heist however they desire, but it's the crew that has the final say. If the crew doesn't like the split, they might just tell the boss to take a hike and put some other critter in charge! In the end, the critter that collects the most valuable stash of loot wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Monster Lands is a competitive dice-placement game that combines resource management, worker placement, and fun combat.&#10;&#10;You will take on the role of the leader of a small clan of brave warriors, competing to win the crown of the Lands of the Discord. You will visit buildings within the Citadel, the last bastion against the monsters that have overrun the kingdom, and also travel to the outside, the areas surrounding the Citadel, where you will battle monsters and reclaim the lands for the Queen.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the crown is handed to the clan with most victory points, which are gained by amassing glory, reputation, gold, and trophies from defeating monsters. The most important factor is glory; to gain it you must leave the safety of the Citadel and undertake missions, defeat or capture monsters, and conquer lands.&#10;&#10;Your mercenaries provide you with dice, which you will use to take actions using a &ldquo;worker-placement&rdquo; mechanic. In the Citadel, your dice allow you to improve your clan, acquiring hunting tools, shields, potions, venoms, mercenaries, and more. The timing of your dice placement and the type of dice you use affects both yourself and other players.&#10;&#10;In the Outside, your dice become battle tools. You roll them in missions and battles to try and defeat monsters or reconquer the land. If you plan well, you will have many ways to manipulate your dice results and increase your chance of success. You cannot simply hope for lucky rolls to snatch the crown, you will need to carefully manage your resources and do some proper planning to be successful.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to go for the crown?&#10;&#10;",

With buoys, you can steal the lead or determine which color must lead the next trick, force players to pass cards or lose points; you can even steal all other cards in a trick, ideally netting yourself huge fish for use next round.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, score 1 point for each card you caught.

Employing a new take on card driven game systems, each player will create a unique deck that represents their advice to their candidate. The players will struggle to influence voters in the critical swing states from this election, while targeting key constituencies that just might put them over the top. Players will try to define the key issue in the states. Will McCain dominate the national security debate, or can Obama play on people's fears over the economy? As the campaign manager of a national presidential campaign, you will either identify the road to the White House, or the road to irrelevance.&#10;&#10;User review: The object of the game (and it is a game, not a simulation) is to lead your candidate, John McCain or Barack Obama, to victory by getting 270 electoral votes. Twenty battleground states are up for grabs in this game of cardplay.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of forty five Campaign Strategy cards; only fifteen can be used in the game. (The rules suggest a selected fifteen cards for novices.) Each player also has a deck of ten battleground state tiles. Each player will select two of their states to put into play. (again, the rules make a suggestion for novices.)&#10;In turn, a player either plays a card from one's own hand and follows the instructions on it or draws a card if fewer than five are already held.&#10;&#10;To win a state, a player must get complete support from the state's voters in the issue which has more support of the people. Each state also has two key demographics. A shift in which demographic takes precidence also may affect the effect of a player's cards.&#10;&#10;Some cards require players to go &quot;negative.&quot; These cards require the opponent to roll a die and the result may give the opponent an unintended benefit.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player wins a state, the electoral votes are added to that candidate's tally. A state is brought into play by the winning manager and chance card is put into effect.&#10;&#10;The game is over when one manager scores 270 electoral votes. That player is the winner. A tie, resulting in winner, is possible.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In a distant land, many and many years ago, rose a big and wealthy city: its name, now forgotten by most, was Hermagor. Commerce was the source of its richness, because from all its territory countrymen, artisans and also adventurers brought to the city every kind of merchandise: weapons, ancient books, precious relics, and rare dragon eggs. In this city, you can buy and exchange everything. This made Hermagor famous and merchants came from afar to buy and sell all kinds of goods at the market. Some even undertook perilous adventures to acquire especially rare items. They criss-crossed this wealthy region, creating new paths and roads, adding markets to towns, but always with the aim to become the richest!&#10;&#10;Set in the imaginary land of Hermagor, each player takes on the role of a merchant striving to be the wealthiest trader. While playing, they aim to acquire goods in the marketplace and then sell those goods profitably in the towns and villages across land of Hermagor. Players first gain access to goods tiles in the marketplace by placing their agents in proximity to the tiles they want.  Then the players move one agent across the map of Hermagor, visiting and selling goods in the towns requesting goods that match the tiles the player acquired in the marketplace.&#10;&#10;Hermagor is played in five rounds with two phases in each round.  Each round begins with the marketplace phase. Players pay to place their four agents in the market trying to control the goods tiles they will use in the second phase of the round.  Control of a tile goes to the player who has the most agents next to the tile.  Ties are broken by the priority of the adjacent locations.  Agents adjacent to the sides of a tile take priority over agents adjacent to the corner of tiles.  An agent placed on a tile has the highest priority.  After all agents have been placed and tiles claimed by the players, the marketplace agents also generate income.  Agents in the same row or column generate income at the rate of 1 for 1 agent, 3 for 2 agents, 6 for 3 agents, and 10 for 4 agents.  The price for placing agents depends on the location.  Locations that apply control to more tiles cost more.&#10;&#10;Each round concludes with selling phase.  Players take turns moving one agent across the map of Hermagor, paying a price for each road segment they use so that they can sell goods in a town or village.  Importantly, each player may only sell in any town or village once during the game.  Players mark each town or village where they have sold goods with a house. Players receive a small monetary reward when other players sell in a town or village that the player has already sold in. Selling goods in all the towns or villages surrounding a region of the map defined by a set of roads potentially gives the player the right to a production facility in that region, supplying additional income immediately and at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Hermagor ends when the last player finishes his turn of the selling phase of the fifth round. End game bonus money is awarded for production facilities, most sales along the major road, and for the smallest of each players sales locations in each of the three Hermagor regions defined by its rivers.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

From cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms, each challenge is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card.&#10;&#10;As these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete the task before them.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to complete every chapter, and then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive; if any player is killed, the game ends immediately!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "STORY&#10;The future:&#10;Slowly but steadily, the Moon has been approaching the Earth. It has touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans. It has come to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants. That chaos grew greater when the Moon revealed itself to be a &quot;kami&quot; (a Japanese God of old) - the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves of their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...&#10;&#10;In the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.&#10;&#10;TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame, that demands specific strategic skills of its players. Its particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Values and abilities of the factions still don&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: it&rsquo;s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players&rsquo; weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life.&#10;&#10;FACTIONS&#10;THE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.&#10;&#10;THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species - claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes.&#10;&#10;THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.&#10;&#10;THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.&#10;&#10;THE KAMPFGRUPPE 03 are the heirs to the Order of Marduk - and same as their spiritual ancestors in medieval times, dragonslayers Siegfried and Georg, they strive for a world unburdened by TSUKUYUMI'S existence.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Each faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win. &#10; After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.&#10;&#10;According to the descending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their &quot;Homezones&quot;, pick three start-areas and place their units.&#10;Prior to the first round, they also choose a white action card - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.&#10;&#10;Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red action cards. Every phase is represented by six of those action cards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase. The highest bid is awarded with the A-card, the next one with the B-card, and so on.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of the following phases:&#10;White Phase: Players use the white action card they chose to emphasize their strategy.&#10;Blue Phase: Players can rise in the initiative order and/or draw an Impact Card.&#10;Green Phase: New units are generated and resources collected.&#10;Red Phase: Units are moved, adversarial areas and units may be attacked. Onis are placed, moved, and used for attacks.&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;The player who gains the most Victory Points wins the game. Victory Points are earned by conquering and occupying areas, and by fulfilling goals and/or the faction's respective mission.&#10;&#10;END&#10;The game ends after the number of rounds determined by the players beforehand - usually 3-4 rounds.&#10;&#10;MICROBADGES&#10; Tsukuyumi fan - logo&#10; Tsukuyumi fan - moon&#10; Tsukuyumi - Boarlords fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Cybersamurai fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Dark Seed fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Nomads fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Oni fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Kampfgruppe 03 fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Lords of the Lost Sea fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Fireborn fan&#10; Tsukuyumi - Children of the Lion fan&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In the days before the Void consumed much of the Old World, there were stalwart humans, elves, dwarves, and gnomes who banded together to invade the deep places of the earth. These heroes forged unbreakable alliances in search of knowledge, treasure, and glory. Rival adventuring parties would often descend into the same dungeon, and these companies fought one another as fiercely as they battled the monsters that lurked behind every dark corner. These were daring times, when nothing in the world was considered more sacred than the oath that bound those who shared the dangers of the pit together. This was the age of the Dungeon Alliance.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Alliance is a deck-building, dungeon-crawling miniatures adventure game that allows players to send 1-4 different teams of adventurers into perilous dungeons in search of experience and treasure. At the start of the game, each player drafts their own team of four heroes (from the 17 included in the game) and uses tactical movement and card play to overcome the dungeon's monsters and treasures. Each player starts with a unique twelve-card starting deck that includes the starting cards from all four of their heroes.&#10;&#10;Rival teams may compete with one another to slay monsters, or even battle one another for complete domination. As each team of heroes overcomes monsters and challenges, they earn experience point (XP) tokens that they can spend to purchase new cards for their alliance decks. Once spent, XP tokens are flipped face down and kept until the end of the game. When the sun greets those who emerge from the pit, the alliance that has accrued the most XP claims the mantle of victory.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Alliance includes rules for competitive, cooperative, and solo play.&#10;&#10;Microbadges:&#10;&#10;&#10;      Dungeon Alliance fan&#10;&#10;&#10;Special Articles:&#10;&#10;Dungeon Alliance Store&#10;&#10;Dungeon Alliance FAQ&#10;&#10;Dungeon Alliance: A Webcomic Adventure&#10;&#10;Your First Game of Dungeon Alliance: Advice for your First Steps into Darkness&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This 18xx game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various rail companies located on a map of central United States. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Players buy and sell stock in various share companies, whose actions are controlled by the majority stockholder. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best.  Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game.&#10;&#10;This game features private companies with special money-making capabilities and sizeable map which encourages most (if not all) share companies to become profitable.  A game is finished when the bank runs out of money, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Zapotec were a pre-Columbian civilization that flourished in the Valley of Oaxaca in Mesoamerica. Archaeological evidence reveal their culture going back at least 2,500 years. Remnants of the ancient city of Monte Alb&aacute;n in the form of buildings, ball courts, magnificent tombs, and finely worked gold jewelry testify of this once great civilization. Monte Alb&aacute;n was one of the first major cities in Mesoamerica and the center of the Zapotec state that dominated much of the territory that today belongs to the Mexican state of Oaxaca.&#10;&#10;In a game of Zapotec, you build temples, cornfields and villages in the three valleys surrounding the capital to generate resources needed for building pyramids, making sacrifices to the gods, and performing rituals.&#10;&#10;Each round, players simultaneously pick a card from their hand to determine their turn order and the resources they collect. Players then perform individual turns and spend resources to build new houses, gain access to special abilities, make sacrifices to the gods and build pyramids. The played action card determines three important aspects of each player's turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The resource printed at the top of the card determines the row or column to activate on the resource grid to collect income.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The icon in the middle of the card matches one of the nine properties of the building spaces on the map (one of three building types, one of three regions, or one of three terrain types). On their turn, players may build only on spaces that match that icon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The number at the bottom of the card dictates the turn order for the round when the card is played.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, players draft new cards from the central offer, with the final undrafted card becoming the scoring bonus card for the following round.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, players score points for pyramids, for their position on the sacrifice track, and for their ritual cards. The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Through your knowledge of astronomy and occultism, you discover the only way to help save the village. It is simple: the more Yokai you manage to capture, the less the menace caused by these demons. After a few months in the village, you are successful in your efforts; the Yokai menace is completely eradicated in that village!&#10;&#10;Then, word reaches you of the havoc being wrecked by the Yokai on your own village. In your absence, the village chieftain has consulted another Onmyoji to help save your village. This is an affront because this is your village and the people under attack are your people. It is your job to save the day! Do not let another Onmyoji save the day and go down in history as the greatest there ever was and the Savior of your village at the time of need.&#10;&#10;Compete against your rival Onmyoji and capture as many Yokai as you can!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay OverviewIn Yokai Septet, your goal is to capture high scoring Boss Yokai by strategically playing cards from your hand. Each turn, players play a card from their hand following the rules of the &quot;trick taking games.&quot;&#10;&#10;After everyone has played a card, the player who played the strongest card matching the lead suit takes all the cards played this turn. A new turn continues until one of the round's end condition is met. At the end of the round, the winner of that round is determined.&#10;&#10;In a 4-player game, the game is played as a team battle of two players versus two players, whereas in a 3-player game, all players play individually competing. The winner of the round is the team that captured four or more Boss Yokai in a 4-player game, and three or more Boss Yokai in a 3-player game.&#10;&#10;The winner of the round scores points based on the Boss Yokai they captured. New rounds are played until the game's end condition is met, which can be either 2 points for a basic game, or 7 points for an advanced game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Components&#10;    49 cards (7 suits, 7 cards each)&#10;    18 scoring tokens&#10;    4 player aids&#10;    1 lead player card&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yields the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.&#10;&#10;The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money &ndash; acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige &ndash; while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they've placed their workers next to on the action board.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they've completed their work, and their money on hand. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The original art by comics legend Marco Checchetto is brought to life in amazing game pieces depicting the iconic Marvel characters in glorious (and often gory) detail.&#10;&#10;In Marvel Zombies: X-Men Resistance, players control the last surviving Super Heroes (Hero Mode). The X-Men and their mutant nemeses unite against the zombie threat.&#10;&#10;Each Super Hero has unique skills that get unlocked the more zombies you eliminate.&#10;&#10;Players can use actions to acquired various Traits. These single-use cards boost their skills in various ways.&#10;&#10;Hiding in buildings or being hunted by zombies, Bystanders are often your primary objectives. Rescuing them gives you a permanent ability unique to each one.&#10;&#10;Your actions can increase your heroic Power, which in turn can be spent for bonus dice or to trigger special Skill and Trait effects.&#10;&#10;The more experiences and powerful you get, the larger the hordes of infected that will spawn to hunt you down every round. They could be lurking inside any room.&#10;&#10;The apocalypse gets in full swing when a Zombie Hero rises to hunt you, Death has not weakened their unique powers.&#10;&#10;Modular tiles faithfully recreate the X-Mansion in amazing detail. Over the course of 10 Missions you'll make your stand on the ground floor, the upstairs student dorms, and the underground X-Men facilities.&#10;&#10;The box also contains the cards needed to use its Heroes and Bystanders in Zombie Mode, as well as unique Zombie Mode missions. The Marvel Zombies core box is needed to play in Zombie Mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to earn more money than any other manager (if you are a manager) or more money than any other investor (if you are a investor) by the end of the fifth round.&#10;&#10;Each round managers and investors negotiate with each other in a noisy, two-minute free-for-all to set a purchase price for shares in the managers' companies. Investors then collect income from the shares they purchased but not until a roll of the dice brings (sometimes drastic) changes to the economy, with major consequences for the balance sheet of each player. Managers collect what they are owed from investors, pay fees for each of their companies, and buy new companies at auction.&#10;&#10;After five rounds of play (5 months), the manager and the investor who have accumulated the most money are each declared victors, the undisputed masters of commerce.&#10;&#10;Panic on Wall Street! is the new edition of Masters of Commerce.

On the brink of a revolutionary innovation, CyberSolutions Inc. is poised to become the next global powerhouse, threatening the profits of well-established conglomerates Haas-Bioroid and Jinteki &ndash; but unfortunately for CyberSolutions, security at their New Angeles branch has just been compromised.&#10;&#10;Set in the dystopian future of Android, Infiltration is a tense card game of futuristic larceny in which two to six players take the roles of thieves, competing to steal valuable secrets from a highly secured corporate facility.&#10;&#10;The most vital information lies deep within the complex, but each step inward takes you farther from escape. Worse yet, corporate mercenaries are closing in! How long will you push your luck as you avoid security patrols, surpass rival thieves, and try to download the most data before the building is locked down?&#10;&#10;Game description above from the publisher&#10;&#10;The layout of the complex is different every game, choosing 6 of the possible 18 first floor cards, 6 of the 18 second floor cards, and 1 of the 3 secret room cards. These rooms are revealed to the players over the course of the game, usually by one of the players entering the room. The rooms contain traps, NPCs, valuable data and items, and even secret exits.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players secretly choose actions they will take, then in turn reveal and resolve their actions. Advancing into the complex or retreating towards the exit, downloading valuable data, interfacing with the current room, or using an item are the actions available to players. After the players have had their turn, any active NPCs have a turn, then the proximity dial is increased. Once the dial reaches 99, or all players have left the complex, the game ends. The players who have escaped the complex add up the value of the data they have extracted; the highest value wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each card comes with an extra (getting to be first player in the next round, for example). Then he decides whether to travel to the next city. Does he want to wait until the next round in hopes of better cards, or will he make his journey now? If so, he must have and play the required travel cards. The two transportation types are trains and ships. For example, 2 ship cards are required to travel from Suez to Bombay, so 2 ship cards must be played; train cards won't help in this instance. Time is spent each step of the way in the form of days, and (while meeting certain other requirements) the winner is the player who spends the fewest number of days getting around the world. The number of days depends on the travel cards used, plus help from special cards, hindrance from the meandering detective, and so on.&#10;&#10;",

Wizards can expand their magical knowledge by unlocking ancient secrets and may learn up to 80 different spells.&#10;&#10;While individual games of Frostgrave are quick and can easily be played in an hour or two, it is by connecting them into an ongoing campaign that players will find the most enjoyment. The scenarios given in the book are merely the beginning of the limitless adventures that can be found amidst the ruins of the Frozen City.&#10;&#10;Osprey Games and North Star miniatures will produce a full range of official Frostgrave miniatures. This includes wizards and apprentices from all ten schools of magic, and all the soldiers that can be hired for their warbands. The wizards, apprentices and specialist henchmen such as the apothecary and thief are metal sculpts while a multi-part plastic box set offers huge variety in building the more common soldier types.&#10;&#10;",

But who really has what it takes to gain control over both relics and therefore claim the throne of Asgard?&#10;&#10;Thunder &amp; Lightning, a reimplementation of Hera and Zeus, features the same gameplay as the earlier design, but with larger decks of cards with a different distribution of powers.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with nine cards in hand, then places three cards face down in their first row, with these rows butting against one another and each player having space for four rows in their playing area. If a player loses a card in a row, then any cards in the same column behind this card slide forward to fill the empty slot. On a turn, a player has as many action points as the number of columns they have in the playing area. They can use these action points to draw cards, play cards to the battlefield, play a mythological card for its power, or challenge an opponent's card.&#10;&#10;To challenge, the player chooses a card in their first row that abuts an opponent's card, then reveals both of them. Most cards have a strength value (0-7), and the card with the lower strength value is discarded, with the opponent's other cards in the same column then sliding forward.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot use all of their actions or has no actions (due to having no cards on the battlefield) or loses control of Odin's Crown/Ring, then they lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

They build canoes and train warriors to create a force to defend their empire, while forging lines of communication with their developing discoveries. Resources are scarce; using them wisely is a key to victory. Investing in exploration widens your empire. Building warriors strengthens your empire. Investing resources into cultural innovations can yield unexpected dividends, like tattooing, hula dancing, surfing, or even the giant moai statues of Easter Island fame.&#10;&#10;Conquest of Paradise is a well-tested, fast-playing design geared to appeal to players who enjoy games like New World, Civilization, and Conquistador. You can learn the game in 10-15 minutes and finish a complete game in 60-90 minutes.&#10;&#10;Conquest of Paradise is a game of exploration and empire building, but also (as you'd expect from a GMT game) CONFLICT.

    "Description": "Il Vecchio is set in the 15th century, when Cosimo de Medici &ndash; also called &quot;Il Vecchio&quot; (&quot;the Elder) &ndash; and his family ruled over Tuscany and its capital Florence. The players represent the heads of Florentine families trying to rise their families to power. To achieve this, they send out their family members to locations in Tuscany to perform various tasks, specifically to recruit followers (knights, assassins, abbots) and collect money as both are needed to take control of provinces in neighboring regions; controlled provinces provide power and a bonus action. Another task is to gain the favor of the squirearchy as these favors are indispensable when it comes to getting an official position in Florence, e.g., a seat on the town council to enhance actions in Tuscany, or a noble rank to gain power at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To complete these tasks, however, a proper middleman must be present at a location, and as these middlemen travel a lot, they are rarely met. That's why it is so important to have one's family members in the right place at the right time &ndash; to save on time and money while achieving one's goals.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has four family members in Tuscany. Players take turns performing exactly one action. Before his action, a player may pay money to move one of his own family members to another location. The available actions are to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a location-specific action in Tuscany. This requires both a middleman and one of your own standing (active) family members at that location. After the action, this family member is laid down (inactive).&#10;    Travel to another region and take over a province, which costs both followers and money.&#10;    Travel to Florence where you'll spend scrolls (and possibly money) to claim a city council or nobility tile.&#10;    Introduce a new family member to the board.&#10;    Raise all lying family members on the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when the &quot;Power of the Medici&quot; has faded, as indicated by a diminishing pile of crest tiles. Certain actions require you to remove such a tile, and the game ends when they're all gone. Players then sum their power points &ndash; earned for gained tiles and majorities in the regions and Florence &ndash; for a final scoring, and the player with the most power wins.&#10;&#10;",

As a consequence, it is seeking to increase the share of domestic resources, of which the most feasible are biomass and wind energy, as well as employing end-use energy efficiency measures to increase its energy security. In addition, the government aims to use the intended growth of the domestic energy sector to foster its other objectives of increasing economic growth and creating employment. (Extract from World Bank Documents, CASE STUDY 11: URUGUAY &ndash; WIND ENERGY PROGRAMME )&#10;&#10;&quot;Toward noon, however, the sun's rays were extremely scorching, and when evening came, a bar of clouds streaked the southwest horizon - a sure sign of a change in the weather. The Patagonian pointed it out to the geographer, who replied:&#10;&#10;'Yes, I know;' and turning to his companions, added, 'see, a change of weather is coming! We are going to have a taste of PAMPERO.' And he went on to explain that this PAMPERO is an extremely dry wind which blows from the southwest.    [...]    The PAMPERO generally brings a tempest which lasts three days, and may be always foretold by the depression of the mercury, 'he said. 'But when the barometer rises, on the contrary, which is the case now, all we need expect is a few violent blasts. So you can make your mind easy, my good friend; by sunrise the sky will be quite clear again.' ( Jules Verne, 1868: In Search of the Castaways.

Every player has a starting set of eight cards to be played on their own tableau, which contains two rows of spaces to activate actions on the different sectors of the board. Each turn, you have the option to play a card to the leftmost empty space of either row or to retrieve all cards from your tableau. After three actions, a special phase takes place &mdash; consolidation, during which you retrieve the rightmost card from any row, generate batteries from stored energy, collect income, and advance the game timer. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Genetically engineered dragons pull trains across dangerous and unexplored territory. Connect cities, fight off forest creatures, and explore the underground to build a railroad empire.&#10;&#10;Based on the Empire Builder system, this fantasy game puts classic building strategy and money management tools in a new venue. Players use erasable crayons on a special board and operate a rail empire. Perfect for an evening of fun and adventure with family and friends.&#10;&#10;In Iron Dragon, probably the most elaborate of the crayon rail games from Mayfair Games, players are set within a fantasy world attempting to create an extensive and profitable rail network.  Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to the standard mechanisms of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks. Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual).&#10;&#10;",

You are a politician who tries to gather enough money and influence to become the next president. Of course, you depend on the work of others to get the needed influence. You start with a set of 10 cards (7 of them are &quot;fatherly friends,&quot; which give you 1 money each and 3 of them yield 1 influence each (VPs)). Each round you draw 5 cards from your deck and use one card for the turn order to place your workers. The workers go to the different offices in the government building to buy new cards for you, get influence or to carry out other actions. Each round there is one more space in which you can choose to place your workers. On the game board is a row of cards which you can choose to buy and each round the empty places in this row are filled from a deck of cards divided into 4 different &quot;Ages.&quot; The last cards of the deck are Doctoral degrees which you can buy with your money; these give you 1 VP for each unit of money spent. The game ends when all of the Doctoral degrees are bought or when one player has 95 VPs or more.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In Florenza, the players are the heads of the most powerful families in Florenza during the Renaissance period. The goal of the game is to become the most famous patron of the arts by hiring the most famous artists of the period and financing their works.&#10;&#10;Each player can commission artworks in his own district, the Cathedral, or in the civic buildings of the city. Each artwork requires money and resources to complete. To earn the money and resources the artists need, the players send their workers to labor in various workshops, possibly even in their opponents&rsquo; districts. Additional workers can be earned by offering charity to the church. During the game, players will earn prestige points, primarily by completing artworks. Prestige points can be spent during the game, but at the end of the game they will be the player&rsquo;s primary source of victory points.&#10;&#10;All of the characters in the game are real historical figures that lived and worked in Italy during the Renaissance. Most of them worked in Florence. All of the buildings in the game were real Renaissance workshops. The artworks the players can complete include the masterpieces of some of the most famous artists in the world.&#10;&#10;Note from the designers directly from the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;We apologize if we included some characters in the game who never worked in Florence during the Renaissance, but we wanted to include all of the most important artists (in our opinion) from that golden age of Italian art and culture. Michelangelo, for example, left an important mark on the history of the city&mdash;and the Renaissance period&mdash;even if he was only in Florence for a short time. We also added some portraits of military leaders (created by Ivan Zoni) to the rulebook. They are not involved in the game, but they were influential members of public life during this era.&#10;The names of the buildings, parts of the Cathedral, and the workshops are in the literal form they had in Italy during the 1400-1600 period. Some of them are unchanged in the modern Italian language, some have changed a little, and others have completely disappeared or remain only in some dialects. We chose to maintain those words, without translating them into a language that the real artists didn&rsquo;t know. We hope you agree with our choice, and we hope you have a good time playing Florenza!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

To create more advanced resources, they have to work with other players.&#10;&#10;The game also features an auction mechanism in which players vote periodically to determine which new building proposals come out and where they are placed on the board.

The action spaces are laid out on the game board in a linear track, with players advancing down this track to take actions. The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces. What players are doing on the track differs from what they do in Tokaido.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "It's 1956, and waves of protest in Poland are once again showing cracks of the Eastern European communist bloc. Emboldened by these signs, students and intellectuals in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, organize a protest of previously unseen magnitudes. As the communist leadership sweeps in to kill the movement in its tracks a violent response is provoked, thus sparking the Revolution of the 23rd of October.&#10;&#10;One player takes charge of the Soviet forces trying to shape the headlines to his liking and uses the militia and snipers of the State Protection Authority to stop the revolutionaries at all cost. The other player(s) (from 1-3 opponents) co-operatively play as the ringleaders of the revolutionary forces collecting resources (represented as icons on their cards) and recruiting other fighters to ensure the revolution's events end up in favor of their side, while fighting off tanks and soldiers in this exciting, historically inspired card driven game.&#10;&#10;Days of Ire: Budapest 1956 is played over seven days &mdash; the last week of October 1956. The Soviet commander plays headline cards at the beginning of every turn, gathering Command Points and triggering effects that sometimes help, sometimes hinder the revolutionary effort. This card-play, reminiscent of well-known card-driven wargames (CDG) such as Twilight Struggle or Labyrinth: War on Terror, is what drives the tempo and the strategic thrust of the game. The other player(s) form the revolutionary side. They collect cards and fighters for two reasons: to resolve events for boosts to their side, and to fight off militia, snipers, and Soviet tanks in a drastic fight for survival. They have to manage their positions while spreading across Budapest, carefully dividing their actions as a team and always keeping an eye on their morale lest they run out of cards. This team-playing aspect &mdash; reminiscent of highly successful cooperative games such as Pandemic &mdash; guarantees ease of access to players who would otherwise be more intimidated by a traditional CDG.&#10;&#10;If any of the revolutionary ringleaders suffer too many wounds, or if they fail to resolve enough events by the end of the game, history changes and the revolution falls. But if they keep the streets of Budapest free from oppression, the revolution lives on, to fight another day.&#10;&#10;Historical Note: In real life, the revolution succeeded, and Hungary was free for less than a week. On the 4th of November, the Soviet forces quickly recaptured the country, but that is a subject for a different game...&#10;&#10;",

Via performing attempted moves, each player tries to deduce the movement of their own pieces.  As you determine how to move your pieces, your goal is to capture the neutral piece, initially located in the center of the board, and deliver it to your opponent's side of the board.&#10;&#10;From the new Stronghold Games version, Confusion: Espionage and Deception in the Cold War:&#10;&#10;The Cold War.  A dangerous time for the world.  A dangerous time to be a spy... but that is exactly what being a spy is all about.  As the shadowy clouds of intrigue and subterfuge settle across the globe you have been called upon by your country to obtain the Top Secret information that will ensure your country's safety and supremacy.  But not all is as it seems; your spies are difficult to control on a global scale, and even worse, there's a Double Agent in your midst who threatens the entire mission!&#10;&#10;At the start of a game of Confusion, players aren't aware of the talents and skills their own spies possess!  Your opponent can see what your spies can do, but you cannot.  Your job as a wise leader is to first deduce exactly how each of your spies move, then employ your knowledge by using each spy for maximum effect.  But be on alert, because your opponent has placed a double-agent in your team of spies! The first player to take the Top Secret Briefcase from the middle of the board and deliver it to his opponent's capital is the winner.&#10;&#10;Can you achieve your goals at the expense of your opponent, or will the entire operation collapse in a sea of Confusion?&#10;&#10;Confusion is game #1 in the Stronghold Games &quot;Castle Line&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Imperial Miners is a light engine-building card game for 1 to 5 players from designer Tim Armstrong (Arcana Rising,  Orbis), in which players excavate mines using a clever card activation system. This stand-alone game is set in the popular Imperial Settlers universe and offers beautiful illustrations, easy-to-grasp rules, and satisfying gameplay full of chain reactions and engine-building synergies.&#10;&#10;In Imperial Miners, players create their own mines by playing cards into their personal tableau. They start from the surface and develop downward. Each time a card is added to their mine, it activates itself and all the cards above it, rewarding a player with satisfying chain reactions and combos. The cards belong to six different factions and offer various strategies. Players mix different factions in their mines to achieve the best results.&#10;&#10;While developing their mines, players also advance on progress boards. During set-up, three out of the six available progress boards are randomly chosen for the game. These boards each offer a different strategic focus. Throughout the game, players advance to gain additional bonuses that help them develop their tableaus, activate the synergies between cards, gain victory points, and achieve even more satisfying combos. The combination of progress boards influences strategies and makes the game different each time you play.&#10;&#10;Imperial Miners offers impressive replayability thanks to its wide range of different cards and modular progress boards. Players also take turns simultaneously so gameplay is quick and lasts no longer than 45 minutes. The straightforward rules, beautiful artwork, and rewarding engine-building mechanisms make a perfect game for both casual and experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically.  The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness.  Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.&#10;&#10;",

The dwarves have managed to trap the dragon in a shady valley at the foot of the mountain where it lives &ndash; apparently dragons can't resist the smell of freshly slaughtered sheep &ndash; but despite being in chains, the dragon is still young and ferocious, providing the dwarves with the difficult task of killing it without being killed themselves.&#10;&#10;Each player has a unique deck of cards, and each card has symbols on it to indicate possible actions. The dragon can move around the game board, bite, shoot fire, fly (in a limited way), and defend itself from attacks; the dwarves can attack with their axes, shoot crossbows, move individually or in groups, protect themselves with shields, and cast nets.&#10;&#10;Each player can have up to six cards in hand, and managing these cards and maneuvering their characters on the game board are the keys to victory. Has the opponent run out of defense cards? Can the dragon nip the strongest dwarf and take him out without opening himself up to attacks from the others? The dwarves can attack the dragon's wings to keep it from flying, chop its legs so it can't move, and cut its throat to prevent it from breathing fire.&#10;&#10;If the dwarves kill the dragon before it breaks from the trap &ndash; that is before dwarves run out of cards &ndash; they win. If the dragon survives or defeats the dwarves, he will manage to free his trapped leg and fly away, triumphing over his opponents.&#10;&#10;",

Once inside the dungeon they will encounter nasty foes, discover treasures, unlock plot cards, and ultimately face a dungeon boss.&#10;&#10;Along the way you will learn new skills and upgrade your character with new items. You will have to manage your health and energy levels, while trying to avoid hazards like getting poisoned or lost in the labyrinth.&#10;&#10;The core mechanics in Iron Helm are based on the core mechanics of our other solo-play game Desolate, but with many new advanced layers. Each adventure should feel unique with multiple characters, items, foes, and loot to encounter and the player will have to make tough choices with each new dungeon card drawn.&#10;&#10;In order to win, you must unlock the dungeon boss, by resolving a certain number of plot cards, and then vanquish the boss. You will then score points based on a multitude of accomplishments to determine how well your retirement will be.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

As in most zombie games, you represent a unique character with your own character traits, except in Run, Fight, or Die! you will also have your own individual board with zombies you alone will encounter.  Zombies move closer to you every round. You run from location to location, searching for weapons and survivors in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Survivors may bring new skills to help you in your desperate fight for survival, or in some cases, new challenges to overcome. In either case,  every survivor provides you victory points.  The game ends either when one player finds five survivors and declares the last round, or when a player reaches the town line (and the total Followers in play meets a minimum), or if a player gets bitten and turns. Be careful, some followers may turn against you, while others can slow you down. When it comes right down to it, the choice is simple: Run, Fight, or Die!&#10;&#10;Scoring is based on the total points of survivors and remaining health of the players&rsquo; characters.&#10;&#10;Run, Fight, or Die! is a frantic first person experience for 1 to 4 players (will play up to 6 with the 5/6 player expansion).  The game is loaded with goodies, including 4 Action Boards, 5 Character Boards, a Loot Deck, a Location Deck,  an Event Deck, a Follower Deck, Mutant Deck, 7 Custom Dice,  tokens and beautifully crafted miniatures.&#10;&#10;",

From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Long ago, the once-gentle leviathans lost their minds and tore the world apart. After generations of hiding and struggle, humanity discovered that the frenzied leviathans can be restored. Climbers willing to take the risk must explore the wilds and work together to remove a series of binding crystals to heal the leviathans roaming the world.&#10;&#10;In Leviathan Wilds, 1-4 players will confront these colossal beings, with each creature being depicted across the spread of a spiral-bound storybook that makes up the game's board. The book also forms the basis of a connected campaign mode built around the game's story, with each of twenty included scenarios estimated to last around 45 minutes. Tougher difficulty levels are also available for added replayability.&#10;&#10;Each character's deck of multi-use cards is unique, allowing them to climb, jump, and glide around the board in different ways. The number of cards left in the slim deck represents their grip on the leviathan's body; if the deck runs out, the player loses their grip and begins to fall down the board until they're able to reach a rest space, which resets their deck. Moving onto rest spaces also provides a way to regain one's grip without falling. Other spaces reduce a character's health or grip or they increase blight, a status that reduces their overall hit points.&#10;&#10;The leviathan has its own deck of cards, which triggers various effects at the beginning of a player's turn, from targeted attacks that reduce health to effects that move players between spaces or loosen their grip. As the game progresses, the leviathan gradually gains &quot;rage&quot;, which intensifies the effect of its event cards.&#10;&#10;Players' characters can move around a square grid overlaid on the creature's body by spending action points &mdash; the number being determined by a card played at the start of their turn &mdash; and their remaining hand of ability cards to reach the crystals and reduce them to zero. Victory is achieved by reducing all crystals, which vary in strength, to zero.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "On November 11, 1918 an armistice halted the killing field that was The War to End All Wars. To make peace, Woodrow Wilson (United States), David Lloyd George (United Kingdom), and Vittorio Orlando (Italy) were hosted by President George Cl&eacute;menceau (France) in Paris, and sat down to write what would become the Versailles Treaty. The treaty was signed on June 28, 1919, after six months of acrimonious debate and bargaining between the great powers.&#10;&#10;Versailles 1919, created by designers Mark Herman and Geoff Engelstein, allows you to experience this piece of history as one of the four leaders with a national agenda that must be satisfied. As one of the Big Four, you sit in a conference room gaining influence on the issues present in the room. In the waiting room sit other issues and personages who are waiting their turn to make their case to meet regional aspirations such as self-determination. Will you support Ho Chi Minh's attempt to free Vietnam from French colonialism? Help Prince Feisal establish a new nation in Mesopotamia or Chaim Weitzmann create a Zionist state? Work with T. E. Lawrence to reduce unrest in the Middle East or with Ataturk in Anatolia?&#10;&#10;As France, you are concerned with containing future German aggression while aligning with the British on reparations to pay for the destruction of the war. The British, however, would like to see Germany restored as a trading partner while preserving their empire against the global aspiration for self-determination. Italy wants territorial concessions from the former Austro-Hungarian empire. Lurking in the background is the threat of Bolshevism. Towering above it all is President Woodrow Wilson with his fourteen points that set global expectations soaring, ultimately ending in disappointment when the U.S. does not join the League of Nations.&#10;&#10;Versailles 1919 introduces a new card-bidding mechanism in which you use your influence to settle issues aligned with your agenda while keeping domestic constituents in support of your actions. You need to balance the need to demobilize your military forces while simultaneously keeping regional unrest under control. All of these decisions are set against the backdrop of regional crises and uprisings. The player who writes more of the treaty prevails in this contest of wills and national agendas. Can you save the world from the rise of nationalism? Can you make a better world while satisfying your domestic electorate? Play Versailles 1919 and relive making the flawed peace that was the Treaty of Versailles.&#10;&#10;",

The human population is scattered all over the continent, living in dark and humid caves. You represent the clan chief of a dynasty, and your one goal is to become the ruler of a vast empire.&#10;However, realizing this goal will be an arduous journey.  Your subordinates will have to faithfully strengthen you, and your armies will have to be more advanced and stronger than those of your enemies.  You will have to conquer areas and develop colonies to receive resources and luxury goods. You will have to skillfully maneuver on a political level and use scientific progresses to its maximum value. If you are successful, you will become the supreme ruler of the known world.&#10;Objective of the Game:&#10;Your objective is to get the most Influence Points (IP) by the end of the game. To reach this goal, you have to develop your empire with the help of your leaders. Take turns placing them in the different boxes of your tribal action board, where they can help you in different and unique ways:&#10;The &quot;Expansion&quot; chamber allows you to spread your vassals, found cities, collect luxury goods or resources, and decide conflicts. &#10;The &quot;Trade&rdquo; chamber allows you to increase your wealth by trade. &#10;The &quot;Taxes&quot; chamber allows you to levy taxes in your cities. &#10;The &quot;Diplomacy&quot; chamber allows you to negotiate with your neighbors, raise your influence with them, and either change the play order or acquire additional leaders.&#10;The &quot;Improvement&quot; chamber allows you to discover new improvements that enable you to construct more cities, improve your strength, gain more influence, raise the moral of your population, enhance the effectiveness of your farmers, execute navigation, or improve your trade.&#10;The &quot;Bread &amp; Circuses&quot; chamber allows you, in combination with luxury goods, to increase the morale of your people. &#10;Finally a &quot;Revolution&quot; allows you to ascend into the next higher epoch if you meet the requirements.&#10;The additional rooms &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Intelligence&quot; allow direct actions against your opponents and will be available as an addon soon.&#10;You gain influence by taking different actions during play, and by Influence Cards which are distributed secretly at start of the game. These cards will be evaluated at the end of the game and will add additional influence if you have fulfilled their conditions. Furthermore, there are some aspects which will give you additional Influence Points after finishing the game. Again, the player with most IPs will win the game.&#10;There are several end of game conditions. Amassing wealth, holding many provinces, reaching the ancient times, developing the most advances, conquering an opponents main territories, gaining a certain amount of IP, and meeting your influence marker with your triumphant march.&#10;The game is for up to 4 players, with ten different unique tribes you can choose from.  It takes about 30 minutes per player in the normal game, and 60 minutes in the long game (higher game end conditions).&#10;&#10;",

Each queen card has a point value on it, and whenever all the required queens have been awakened or one player hits the point threshold, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Far to the north, in a remote winter land, rivers are frozen most of the year. When the villages along the riverside eventually are accessible, a small river cruise company offers exotic tours like polar bear safaris, reindeer trips, ice fishing, and more. Lucky tourists may even get a chance to see the northern lights.&#10;&#10;You work as a tour guide trying to attract tourists to your guide boats for spectacular excursions.&#10;&#10;Riverside is a different kind of roll-and-write game: The game comes with a modular game board, which composes the route for the game. On a river cruise boat, everyone follows the same route, but you can take your tourists on different tours. You may plan ahead, but beware, the dice may force you to change your plans.&#10;&#10;You start each round by rolling dice into a common pool. Simultaneously, each player chooses one die of one specific color (without physically taking it) and fill seats on the matching guiding boat on their own player sheet. Whenever they have completed a row of seats, they have sold a group ticket of the corresponding color (excursion). The longer the row, the more points they get. Additionally, this ticket is valid for the remainder of the game: Every time they go on an excursion in a village of this color, they take this group with them to earn even more points. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each dice color represents tourists with a preference for one specific type of excursion. The transparent green die is &quot;wild&quot; and represents the northern lights, something everyone wants to see.&#10;&#10;Riverside offers tough decision-making within a short playing time: Some rows are short with low points and bonuses, while other rows are long with higher points and bonuses. Which one do you start to fill? Within each guide boat, you need to score higher and higher, so taking too many tourists on your first excursions could be fateful. Players are rewarded if they manage to please all five kinds of tourists, so maybe you need to score a new color instead of scoring really high in another color? Higher dice represent tourists who are freezing and cost fire symbols to get. Note that the &quot;wild&quot; green die always costs fire symbols to get! You have a limited number of fire symbols to use, so when will be the right time to use them?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Theme: Chickens are learning to dance (&quot;cha cha&quot;) by completing circuits around the yard.&#10;&#10;Goal: To &quot;cha cha&quot; your chicken past every single other player's chicken, stealing each one's &quot;tail feathers&quot; as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.&#10;&#10;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch&#10;&#10;The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.&#10;The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.&#10;&#10;",

The death was dismissed by the police as natural and you are commissioned by an unknown person to investigate the case more closely. But who is the unknown client? And is it really a natural death?&#10;&#10;One thing is clear: this calls for true pros. To find the murderer, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.&#10;&#10;As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone with which you can receive text messages. It is also helpful (but not absolutely necessary) if you have a laptop or tablet at hand. Mobile phones are also allowed!&#10;&#10;You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day.&#10;You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another. The game is suitable for people aged 14 and over. It is too complex for a group of younger children. In a family, however, younger children can also make a contribution and assist with the detective work.&#10;&#10;Languages&#10;This game is available in: &#10;German: Der Fall Klein-Borstelheim&#10;British: The Case of Little Gomersal&#10;American: The New Haven Case &#10;Spanish: El crimen de Quintana de la Matanza&#10;Netherlands: De Case Klein-Apelroos&#10;French: L'affaire Bourg-le-Petit&#10;Italian: Il caso di Villasetia &#10;Canadian: The Maplebrook Case &#10;Australian: The Barridale Case &#10;Portuguese: O caso de Pedralva Pequena &#10;Swedish: Fallet Karleborg&#10;Polish: Sprawa ze Szczecin Ma&#197;&#130;ych&#10;Mexican: El caso de San Pedro el Chico&#10;Brazilian: O caso de Pedra Pequena (coming soon)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Haven Town is facing total annihilation at the hands (and teeth) of a horde of monsters from beyond the Shadowrift.&#10;&#10;You, the heroes, must band together to drive them back. To do this, you will need powerful spells, skills, attacks and loot. When the game begins, you are a basic hero; you can explore and fight. Luckily for you, Shadowrift is a deck-building game! You can buy new cards to add to your deck, cards that will define you as an adventurer and complement the strengths of your fellow heroes. Unlike other deck-builders, there is constant interaction with your fellow players as you figure out who will gain which benefit from the limited supply of townsfolk, offer their coin to help construct walls, and seek healing from anyone who's learned such magic.&#10;&#10;Shadowrift also features monsters that don't merely sit waiting to be slain; if you leave them alone, they will rip Haven Town asunder. They'll kill people, break walls, and kick your heroes in the face. Combat with them is intuitive (though frequently painful). For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake. Since the monsters won't stop coming until the last Shadowrift is sealed or the town has been built into a mighty fortress, you'll need every boost you can take.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Shadowrift features many improved mechanisms, including a revised system for how monsters choose who to attack (based on types of villagers, instead of specific people) and a new system for monster powers (making them much more dangerous). It also has a revised card layout and a great deal of new and improved artwork.&#10;&#10;",
