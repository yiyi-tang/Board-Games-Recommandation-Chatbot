    "Description": "Battle for the South China Sea is a two-player board-wargame that investigates a potential Chinese drive to take control of Southeast and Eastern Asia through force in the near future. Each player must contend with the delicate political balance in the region with an uncertain and unstable political landscape. Once the conflict begins the Chinese player must balance focusing their forces against the scope of their ambitions, including potential control of the first and second &ldquo;island chains&rdquo;. The US player must manage a disparate, political unstable alliance where each country is concerned with their own security. Combat takes place on land and at sea, with the various airpower, missile, air denial, and sea denial systems of the regional powers influencing the outcome.&#10;&#10;Planned for publication with Modern War #57.&#10;However Modern War stopped being published in 2021 and last issue was #55&#10;&#10;(description from the publisher and user's comments)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Fully referred to as the &quot;500 Cribbage Thomas System&quot;, this game sets out to develop and modernize the classic game of Cribbage with several refinements.&#10;&#10;Players peg points on an updated version of the original Cribbage board, with separate tracks for points scored in the Play, Hand, and Crib. Additionally, the straight-flush is recognized as an independent scoring combination, and the play of the cards until &quot;Go&quot; is extended to a limit of 34 instead of 31. Equal deals are played (5 each) and at the end players total their scores: points from the Play are worth 6, from the Hand 4, and from the Crib 3. If the loser failed to reach a grand total of 500, their deficit is added to the winner's final score (relevant in series play).&#10;&#10;The most significant change is the board. The &quot;500&quot; Cribbage board includes, for each player: two tracks to 30 labeled &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Crib&quot;, one double-track to 60 labeled &quot;Hand&quot;, a bank of additional pegs and 30/60/120 holes to mark if any of those tracks are exceeded, and a 5-hole track for each player to mark the number of deals. The game thus cannot be played on a classic Cribbage board, but classic Cribbage can be played on the &quot;500&quot; board by using the eight tracks for up to four players.&#10;&#10;Included within the rules are variants for solitaire play, four players in partnerships, and a spinoff betting game called &quot;Cribbage Poker&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Before each roll, all players can put some (or all or none) of their funds into the bank as a bet. Based on the roll, the pawn is moved (with possible re-rolls) and the color where the pawn lands determines what happens to everyone's bets. This can have varying results, including &quot;lose all money in the bank&quot;, &quot;win 10x your bet&quot; or even &quot;lose all money NOT currently in the bank&quot;.&#10;&#10;This may sound like a game of pure chance but there is some strategy involved because of the re-rolls, the distribution of colors on the board (e.g. at any given moment, there is higher probability of pawn ending its turn on color X and not on any other color) and the changing order in which the players place their bets.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to own 1,000,000 of &quot;Game Crowns&quot; (fake money).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The substitution pack adds a whole new dimension to Rugby: The Game. RTG plays great as the base game, but adding subs creates an exciting new dynamic to really get the adrenaline pumping.&#10;&#10;Firstly we have the Star players. Two full teams of them! These guys are on another level, with better stats and a few player-specific abilities that give them the edge. The overall gameplay is still pretty balanced, but played right, you know when these guys are on the field!&#10;&#10;The players can only come on when you use one of your substitution cards (generally 5 in a game). These cards have rules which dictate when they can be used, and are determined by points-difference, total points scored, game stage (such as &quot;play at half time&quot;), and such. Also, the player is randomly selected (with the subs card dictating &quot;Forward&quot; or &quot;Back&quot; deck only), so you don't know who you will get. Oh, the anticipation is already killing me!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

You travel across the board which contains a diverse number of regions and locations that have unique opportunities and dangers as you set out to complete your quests and become the Master Gem Hunter!&#10;&#10;Quests are unique jeweled items that contain specific numbers and types of faceted gems and pearls and have a monetary value once all the components are collected and turned in at the jeweler&rsquo;s.  There are 50 unique quest cards that can consist of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, topaz, opals, and various pearls.&#10;&#10;Rough gems and pearls are obtained on unique locations on the board. Rough gems need to be cut into faceted gems to count toward completing your quest. There are some other opportunities to acquire gems and pearls in the game which gives players the opportunity to take a chance on finding an alternate means towards their goal.&#10;&#10;Gem Town is the central hub of the island nation of Pacifica, which contains various locations visited throughout the game.  The island also has a mountain region, jungle region, and desert region; which are interconnected and accessible via rope bridges.  Each movement space visited requires the player to draw a fate card which can be beneficial to the player or a dire challenge.  There are 100 unique fates and 240 fate cards in total.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game the players decide whether to play a game based on completing the most quest cards in a specific time frame (first to achieve a specific total value in completed quest cards) or a speed round, which is the first player to complete one quest card.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Gem Hunt uses a turn-based, card drawing, and die rolling game system. Every turn has a movement phase and an action phase. The movement phase can consist of crossing a rope bridge, taking a ferry, taking the underground railway, taking a ride on a zip line, or moving on the board on one of the regional movement spaces. The action phase can consist of mining for gems, digging for oysters, cutting rough gems into faceted gems, performing transactions in the appropriate location, turning in completed quest cards, playing one of the mini games, or drawing a fate card after landing on a regional movement space. There are certain situations where additional movement or actions can be taken on your turn but those are detailed within the instructions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Instead of marching peacefully to the forest the koalas are now starting to gather in the city and riot!&#10;&#10;Bad Koalas is fully-cooperative, which means players win or lose as a team. Only one player takes a turn at a time, but they may solicit feedback from other players.&#10;&#10;&bull; The deck contains of 4 different colors (types) of koalas.&#10;&bull; The play area is communal for all players. It consists of four columns, one for each koala type. The horizontal row of 4 zones at the bottom of each column is collectively called the City; each koala that enters play from the deck is placed into the city zone that corresponds to that koala&rsquo;s color.&#10;&bull; Koalas are unhappy in the city; when too many of them end a turn in the same city zone, they riot, which leads to problems for the players.&#10;&bull; The center row above the City is called the Country. Koalas in the country are relatively happy and therefore don&rsquo;t riot like the koalas in the city.&#10;&bull; The row of zones at the top of each column is called the forest; players want to advance koalas to the forest to score them (flip them over) and gain upgraded action powers that the happy koalas in the forest grant you.&#10;&bull; Above the play area are the 4 action cards that each player can choose from on their turn. Each action is dedicated to moving koalas up toward the forest zones. (The koala token must be moved to a different action card each turn; you can&rsquo;t select the same action that was chosen the previous turn.)&#10;&bull; On their turn, the active player moves the koala token to the action card of their choice, resolves that action, and then places into the city zones the (2+) new koalas that automatically come out of the deck... and resolves any riots that ensue as a result. Then the next player in clockwise turn order takes their turn. The game ends immediately when players win or lose together.&#10;&#10;All players win immediately if at any time all koalas have been cleared from the city and country zones.&#10;&#10;All players lose if either of the following conditions are met:&#10;&bull; if there are 15 or more koalas in the city zones&#10;&bull; if the koala deck is empty when a card is required to be drawn&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Different passing options include a backhand, forehand, swing, and dump pass. Both offensive and defensive players can also utilize speed boost and dive cards that can make all the difference from a defended pass to a completed touchdown.&#10;&#10;This board game presents an option to play real-time ultimate, where strategy, and a bit of luck will be needed to put you over the top.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Run Fight or Die: Reloaded is a revamped and refreshed edition of the Richard Launius game Run Fight or Die.&#10;&#10;In the game, you play a hero trying to survive wave after wave of zombies coming straight for you! You play as a unique character with your own character traits including a minor, major and super combo. You'll need them to fight off the zombies move closer to you every round. You run from location to location, searching for weapons and survivors in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Survivors may bring new skills to help you in your desperate fight for survival, or in some cases, new challenges to overcome. You'll also need them along if you want to win as every survivor provides you victory points.&#10;&#10;This streamlined version removes several decks from the original game, including the Fleeing deck and Event deck. Players rolls six dice instead of five and there are now different combos to mitigate against tough zombie-filled rolls. Additionally, players can now use followers to soak damage coming in from zombies.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player dies, the Town Line comes out of the locations deck, or when the Mutant Zombie has been put down once and for all.  Whoever has the most leadership points among surviving players wins.&#10;&#10;Run, Fight, or Die: Reloaded is a frantic first person experience for 1 to 4 players (will play up to 6 with the 5/6 player expansion).&#10;&#10;Note: This is an exclusive edition that contains the following promos/exclusives, in addition to the content normally available in the Retail edition.

It contains all of the stretch goals from the Kickstarter campaign: the Aftermath expansion, the Void Seeders expansion, and the Medic.&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;&quot;Every spaceship has a voice; a melody of machinery and subsystems its crew learns intimately during long travels. The problem is, ever since the last mission our ship sounds WRONG. There&rsquo;s something foul in the way it&rsquo;s speaking to us. Barely audible murmurs. Strange whispers no machine could make. The dark corridors and vast halls almost seem to SING.&#10;&#10;Some of us have tried to locate sources of this interferences, but they always seemed two steps ahead. Stalked by their never-ending presence, we soon started cracking. Our engineer has cut some words on his flesh. When we asked why, he replied:&lsquo;Incandescent secrets need to be written in blood&rsquo;. Then, our navigator took a spacewalk without her suit. When we pulled her in, her entire face frozen and cracked, she grinned in a way I will never forget.&#10;&#10;Now, it got even worse. Noises turned into voices, sharing tales of slaughter and terror. They do not run from us anymore. They encircle us and herd us through the ship to some dark purpose. I need to UNDERSTAND them before it&rsquo;s too late. I put my hand on the pistol grip, looking at the backs of my last two crewmembers. I see dark mysteries swirling under their skulls. It would only take two bullet holes to release them...&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Overlook:&#10;&#10;Voidseeders are a race that can interact with the minds of crew members. They will have few nests instead of one, but only one strong fighting presence at given moment. Once killed, new one will be awakened from the most developed nest.&#10;&#10;This race will focus on whispering and controlling minds - people who will be near them will start to hear voices commanding them to do different destructive things.&#10;&#10;Nests:&#10;&#10;On the board, there is normally 1 Nest as a room token, but there are additionally 2-3 smaller nests. Those are places where new Voidseeders will born. At the moment of discovering main Nest, you should put a Stalker miniature in it (this is the model that is on the ship from the beginning. He is very dangerous, especially when faced by people with a high Insanity level).&#10;&#10;Other Nests will start showing up on the board together with discovering certain Exploration tokens. Those nests will be especially dangerous. They will not move, but if a crew member will happen to end the turn at the tile with a nest, he will get a serious wound.&#10;&#10;Voidlurkers&#10;&#10;They will spawn in nests, and their objective will be to spread insanity and try to move players to Nests.&#10;&#10;Whispersers&#10;&#10;They will work very similar to Voidlurkers, but with the difference that they will have the main goal of defending the main nest.&#10;&#10;Stalker&#10;&#10;He is a main guardian. He takes advantage from fear / insanity of the crew members and will focus on them.&#10;&#10;Despoiler&#10;&#10;Equivalent of the Queen. Actually, it is hard to say if she is real or if it is a mass hallucination. One way or the other, she will only emerge when all Insanity tokens are on players (number of tokens will be specific for different numbers of players). She is extremely strong.&#10;&#10;Contamination card&#10;&#10;Here it will change a little bit - players will normally get a contamination card every time they will get an insanity token. They will be easier to discard (you don't need to check if it was infected or not). Effect of the card will only take place at the very end of the game, and it will be the same as in the normal version - if it will turn out it was indeed &quot;infected,&quot; it will mean that your character, even if escaped, went mad and lost the game either way.&#10;&#10;Whispers mechanic&#10;&#10;This mechanism will change the noise mechanic. Whenever you move (or an event card will tell you to), you will need to roll for whispers. If you would get a corridor with an whisper token already in it (you hear something more) - you need to draw a Card from the Insanity deck. Those cards will apply to you or not based on the numbers of insanity tokens your character has. Effects might be very different - from one-time action to permanent disabilities.&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;&#10;In combat, Voidlurkers will only try to add insanity tokens to you and then run away to the closes nest. Whisperers will be harder to kill, as well as present some portion of actual physical danger, but their main weapon will still be giving you insanity tokens.&#10;&#10;Things will change with Stalker and Despoiler - those two will be huge opponents who will give you real wounds, so you will not want to be near them.&#10;&#10;Event phase&#10;&#10;In the event phase, one additional step that will be added is checking your insanity tokens and numbers of Voidlurkers and Whisperers in all rooms next to yours. If the number of them is higher than the number of insanity tokens, you add one insanity token and draw one contamination card.&#10;&#10;But whenever you will be in a room with other people, this effect will be less harmful. (they can help you calm down)&#10;&#10;Overall feel&#10;&#10;Overall feel we will be going for will be way different from what you will have in the base Core Box. We have a lot of cool ideas how to get Insanity cards in a way, that it will be an additional layer of you not trusting your friends  - not only because of their objective but perhaps because of the Insanity cards.&#10;&#10;Additionally, interaction with Voidseeders will be way different, you will need to think very carefully where to move or place your hero to not go insane.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When assembling continuous sections of 3 or more tube cards of the same color (complete set), remove them and keep them aside !!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, count the points shown on the tubes you have accumulated and ... whoever scores the most points wins!

(which will cause the first player to start the game);&#10; If you have tube cards in your hand that cannot be attacked anywhere (the tightening screws do not attach to any of the cards in the Game Area) you can decide to play it and start a new line or conduct;&#10;&bull; Can play Special or Cassette cards (if he has them);&#10;&bull; Cannot discard cards during his turn (except in special cases explained later);&#10;&bull; He can only pass hands if he has 3 or fewer cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;Finally, remember one last rule:&#10;All the special type cards or tools used or the tube cards removed will be discarded and placed face up next to the Fishing Deck, thus composing the discard pile.&#10;&#10;End of the game&#10;The game ends when there are no more cards to draw in the Draw Deck. After the last player of the turn has drawn the last card from the deck, the final game turn will proceed: after this, the game will end.&#10;&#10;The tube cards left in the hand of each player will be counted as a penalty and the points shown above them will be subtracted from the player's final score ... so remember to use them (be careful though, continuing existing lines or starting new ones can provide advantages to the players after you!)&#10;&#10;Count points and win&#10;Each player at the end of the game counts the points shown above the accumulated tube cards.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved depending on the game mode chosen:&#10;1. &quot;Kill them all&quot; (about 30 minutes): the player who scores the most points in a single round wins;&#10;2. &quot;Long road to ruin&quot; (about 60 minutes): The first player who reaches 5000 points in one or more game rounds wins. If the player scores the necessary points during a round of play, he will still have to complete the game, hoping not to be exceeded in the point count and therefore not to stick to the ... tube!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Made by Mr. Sasaki as a hobby for events, we took &quot;Startups&quot; and gave it the look and feel of &quot;Rights&quot;.

Since it's a government asset intended for use at sea, it's made of fantastically high-quality materials which help to make up for how utterly inane the actual trivia proves to be (example: According to the 1972 mandate, what is the minimum length of sounding cord that should be trailed behind any vessel approaching a port from the leeward side with the intention to transfer cargo after dusk?&quot;). The game box also includes a copy of the hefty &quot;Collision Regulations: International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 - with Canadian modifications, 1983&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players start out taking only yellow coastal routes, but as their knowledge progresses their ships (oddly represented as multicoloured faux bullets made of iron termed &quot;projies&quot;) can move out into the ocean, ultimately needing to reach certain key ports and complete specific routes, all while avoiding hazards and inclement weather. The winner is officially termed the &quot;Commander of the High Seas&quot;, and more importantly the Canadian naval personnel have passed another two hours at sea. The popularization of video games ultimately rendered traditional classics like &quot;High Seas&quot; less necessary.&#10;&#10;It was reported that the initial printing was of only 100 copies of the game in October 1987 for initial deployment and testing, and it's unclear whether there were later versions produced as the rules stated &quot;Copyright 1988&quot;; it is referred to in naval literature as both &quot;High Seas: A Collision/s Regulation Game&quot; and &quot;High Seas: A Performance Maintenance Game&quot;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

They must come up with a convincing explanation as to how or why they know the correct answer...even if they don&rsquo;t.&#10;&#10;After everyone pleads their case, the Judge grabs the two black cards and gives the Brilliant card to the person they think got the question right and the BS card to the person they think got it wrong.&#10;&#10;The player that receives the Brilliant card automatically earns 2 points and the player who receives the BS card earns 0 points.&#10;&#10;The Judge announces the correct answer (highlighted in bold) before asking the other players to reveal their cards.

Each player that gets the question right earns 1 point.&#10;&#10;The Judge receives 1 point for each correct Brilliant prediction and 1 point for each correct BS prediction. But beware. For each wrong prediction, the Judge loses 1 point.&#10;&#10;Play continues until each person has had the chance to be the Judge the same number of times.

Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.&#10;&#10;WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Race X Card - This card is a booby trap you can play on your rivals. But be warned, you could get caught in your own trap! When you play this card, you immediately flip the top card from the draw pile onto the discard pile (this card needs to be a number card, so, if necessary keep flipping over cards until a number card is on top.&#10;&#10;Going in the current direction, each player in turn must play a card from their hand that is ONE number higher than the card on top of the discard pile. You would play a 0 after a 9.&#10;&#10;Continue to go around until a player can not do this and they will draw 3 cards.&#10;&#10;",

The offensive player chooses an option play, while the defensive player selects a pass defense. The chart on the card indicates that the play results in a 10-yard gain. The football is moved forward to the 50 yard line and both players get ready to pick their next play.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The phrase &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so gay!&rdquo; has been used mostly in a negative context for decades. Some people use it as a way to attack or vilify us, and others use it in fun, not realizing the damage it can do. As with the reclaiming of negative words and phrases such as &ldquo;queer,&rdquo; this game seeks to turn &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so gay!&rdquo; into a positive opportunity to educate LGBTQs and our allies, and even those people who would attack us. Words can be a tool of our enemies, or can empower us in our work. And this game hopes to break down stereotypes while having some fun with our LGBTQ history. There are the well-known celebrities and media sensations, but also obscure authors, scientists, athletes and pioneers. The scope of the game goes back thousands of years and across multiple continents, all with more than 2,400 questions that will tease you, taunt you, and treat you to some amazing facts. This game would be the most enjoyable for adults and for children ages 12 and up. It is best played in teams, but even two players can have fun testing their knowledge. There are all ranges of questions, so even those who think they &ldquo;know it all&rdquo; about the LGBTQ community will undoubtedly sometimes find themselves stumped. This game was created and produced by Tracy Baim, co-founder and publisher of Windy City Times, an LGBTQ newspaper founded in 1985. She has been volunteering and working in the LGBTQ community since 1984.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Space Plague is a modern strategy game of planetary conquest for 1-4 players.  The four major galactic powers -The Slimes, The Reptilians, The Rams, and The Flat-Earthers - all want one thing, galactic dominance.  Their commanders ready themselves, the armies follow orders, and everything that can shake, shakes.  The race to conquer new planets is the most important game in the galaxy and those that win it will gain for themselves and their species a brand new spherical land mass to rule and to populate.&#10;&#10;In Space Plague, players will employ hand management and hand building strategies to efficiently guide their plague soldiers through various ecological environments while collecting energy (the game&rsquo;s currency), adapting to planetary events, and overcoming the opponents&rsquo; obstacles that await them on their unwavering march toward the planet&rsquo;s core.  Survival of the fittest is the name of the game as the faction with the greatest number of soldiers to reach the core will be crowned the victor and given the deed to the planet.&#10;&#10;The keys to victory are careful planning and adaptability. Everyone will begin the game with the same starting hand of action cards.  These will be used each round to spawn, move, shield, or evolve your aliens. Additionally, certain factors will give variability to each game.   Each planet you conquer has its own defense mechanisms which will force you to employ unique strategies and play styles.  Planetary events are randomized and could spell riches or doom for your advancing soldiers.  Additionally, the in-game marketplace offers dozens of evolutions that will improve the capabilities of your hand or grant you unique ongoing or temporary powers ensuring a different game every time.  These elements not only force interesting decisions but also give the game extensive replayability.&#10;&#10;Fellow commander, are you ready to join the plague?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Space Plague es un moderno juego de estrategia de conquista planetaria de 1-4 jugadores.

Sus comandantes se preparan, los ej&eacute;rcitos siguen &oacute;rdenes y todo lo que puede temblar, tiembla. La carrera para conquistar nuevos planetas es el juego m&aacute;s importante de la galaxia y aquellos que lo ganen obtendr&aacute;n para ellos y su especie una nueva masa de tierra esf&eacute;rica para gobernar y poblar.&#10;&#10;En Space Plague, los jugadores emplear&aacute;n estrategias de manejo y construcci&oacute;n de manos para guiar de manera eficiente a sus creaturas de la plaga a trav&eacute;s de varios entornos ambientales mientras recolectan energ&iacute;a (la moneda del juego), se adaptan a los eventos planetarios y superan los obst&aacute;culos de los oponentes que los esperan en su marcha hacia el n&uacute;cleo del planeta.

This system can be a game of discovery of wargames, but also a system that will satisfy the most seasoned players.&#10;&#10;This game seeks to have the best compromise between historicity (orders of battle, aspect of the units) and playability.&#10;&#10;Players play out the battles of the proposed scenarios, which are descirbed on A4 or A3 maps. Their style is simple and clean. The duration of a game is 1 to 2 hours.&#10;&#10;The units (leaders or combat units) have a movement and combat capability (possibly including firepower) and represent 500 to 1000 or 2000 men depending on the type of unit and the scenario. For some scenarios, these figures are theoretical given the sources (difficult to represent the million men of Darius or Xerxes or others).&#10;&#10;The system is based on the initiative won by players as a result of a die roll and the impact of leaders and/or other modifiers in the scenario.&#10;&#10;In ARS BELLUM, the system is based on the skills of the units, which balance reality and gameplay. These are abilities assigned to units, basic or special, that represent a property or advantage during combat.&#10;&#10;The basic module of the game gives the essential rules and discovery scenarios; the extensions are groupings of scenarios around one or more armies, a historical character, a military campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Revivez les grandes batailles de l'Antiquit&eacute; et &agrave; la t&ecirc;te de votre arm&eacute;e, imposez votre puissance &agrave; votre adversaire !&#10;&#10;ARS BELLUM est un jeu de complexit&eacute; moyenne, permettant de simuler toutes les batailles de l&rsquo;Antiquit&eacute;. Les m&eacute;canismes sont concentr&eacute;s sur 5 pages de r&egrave;gles, pour un livret comportant 16 pages avec les illustrations et les sc&eacute;narios. L&rsquo;ensemble est ais&eacute;ment assimilable. Ce syst&egrave;me peut &ecirc;tre un jeu de d&eacute;couverte des wargames, mais aussi un syst&egrave;me qui satisfera les joueurs les plus aguerris.&#10;&#10;Ce jeu cherche &agrave; avoir le meilleur compromis entre historicit&eacute; (ordres de bataille, aspect des unit&eacute;s) et jouabilit&eacute;.&#10;&#10;Les joueurs livrent les batailles des sc&eacute;narios propos&eacute;s sur des cartes A4 ou A3 maximum. Leur style est simple, propre. La dur&eacute;e d&rsquo;une partie est d&rsquo;1 &agrave; 2h.&#10;&#10;Les unit&eacute;s (chefs ou de combat) ont une capacit&eacute; de mouvement  et de combat (regroupant &eacute;ventuellement celle de tir) et repr&eacute;sentent 500 &agrave; 1000 ou 2000 hommes suivant le type d&rsquo;unit&eacute;s et le sc&eacute;nario. Pour certains sc&eacute;narios, ces chiffres sont th&eacute;oriques compte tenu des sources (difficiles de repr&eacute;senter le million d&rsquo;hommes de Darius ou Xerx&egrave;s ou autres).&#10;&#10;Le syst&egrave;me est bas&eacute; sur l&rsquo;initiative conquise par les joueurs suite &agrave; un jet de d&eacute; et &agrave; l&rsquo;impact des chefs et/ou autre modificateur dans le sc&eacute;nario.&#10;&#10;Dans ARS BELLUM, le syst&egrave;me s&rsquo;appuie sur les comp&eacute;tences des unit&eacute;s qui am&egrave;nent respect de la r&eacute;alit&eacute; et particularit&eacute; ludique. Ce sont des capacit&eacute;s attribu&eacute;es aux unit&eacute;s, de base ou particuli&egrave;res et qui repr&eacute;sentent une propri&eacute;t&eacute; ou un avantage durant le combat.&#10;&#10;Le module de base du jeu donne l&rsquo;essentiel des r&egrave;gles et les sc&eacute;narios de d&eacute;couverte ; les extensions sont des regroupements de sc&eacute;narios autour d&rsquo;une ou plusieurs arm&eacute;es, d&rsquo;un personnage historique, d&rsquo;une campagne militaire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Qua is a three-dimensional (3D) abstract strategy game for three players. It is an extension of the two-dimensional, two player game called Gale, marketed as Bridg-It. Qua is played on a 3D game board grid composed of NxNxN cells in the shape of a cube, where N is typically odd and equal to the number of cells along each edge of the game board.&#10;&#10;The objective of Qua is to be the first player to complete a connected chain (path) of cells containing their game play pieces between their two opposite faces of the game board cube.&#10;&#10;The 3D game board does not start out empty. Some of the cells in the game board are permanently filled-in with one of three game play pieces, called qua. See Figure 1 from the Images gallery above: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/5539928/qua. The three qua game play pieces--one for each player--are distinguished from each other by shape and color.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;Players choose their qua at the beginning of the game and decide who will go first, second and third in sequential turn order. Each turn, players place one of their qua in an empty cell in the game board cube.&#10;&#10;Players may only place qua in an empty cell if it is adjacent to two cells that already contain their qua, or one such cell and one of their two game board cube faces.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot make a move, they skip their turn.&#10;&#10;If the current player is in a Kingmaker situation where one of the other players will win on their next turn and the one who wins will be determined by the current player's move, then the Qua Kingmaker game play rule states that the current player blocks the immediate next player's win first. However, if no one identifies the Kingmaker situation, and the current player makes a different move, then that move is valid.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player connects their two faces of the Qua Cube game board.&#10;&#10;Game Play Variants&#10;Qua Misere&#10;The first player that connects their two faces of the game board loses. This can be a two-player game.&#10;&#10;Dice Qua&#10;Players roll a 6-sided die to determine which game play piece to play on their turn (two sides of the die for each game play piece). This can also be played as a two-person game. A player may win as a result of an opponent&rsquo;s move.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quin is an abstract tabletop strategy game, taking place in a sci-fi quantum realm.  Players control a variety of quark particles, 17 on each side, made of 9 types, each with distinct speed, powers and capture abilities.  The goal of Quin is to reach First Sight, Center, with your Light, or to capture your opponent's Light.&#10;&#10;Your pieces are always faced away from your rival, making deception and memory two of the most important skills in play. Use a piece's special abilities - like Memory that swaps places with another piece, Time that can move an opposing piece backward, Peripherals that can circle the sides of the board, or Shadows that reach far and capture everything - and you risk revealing your strategy.  In Quin, your choices, and how well you know your rival, are what determine your fate.&#10;&#10;The magnetic Quin board is based on a traditional grid, if you can imagine that grid warped into a circle by a black hole.  As such it is made of 5 Sight Lines, crossing the board at the center, 8 gold Rings, a Horizon Line, and the Iris.  The Iris is just 2 spaces around the center, where most pieces have to pass if they want to get to the other side, and it is a neutral zone, where powers don't work.  In the middle of it all is First Sight, Center, and the goal of the game.&#10;&#10;It's only 5 moves to center, from the start, but you'll never take the same route twice.  Awaken your Memory, look out for the thief of Time, and beware the Shadows - they're far faster than Light.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Welcome to the Alternate American Revolution!&#10;&#10;Road Patriots is a skirmish-style wargame set in an alternate version of 1776 Colonial America. &#10;In this version of the colonies, the revolution is about to be in full swing. Colonists are preparing to fight the British and claim America as their own country.&#10;&#10;However, there is one subtle difference. Both sides of the war have cars--cars that run on steam engines. These cars were used extensively in battles. They often had mounted cannons and muskets. Riders were militia and continentals wielding sabers.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the world of vehicular combat during the American Revolution.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A MATTER OF HONOR The Battle of Le Bourget - Oct 30, 1870&#10; Long before it became the site of Charles Lindbergh's landing after his first air crossing of the Atlantic Ocean and later of a renowned international Airshow, the town of Le Bourget, in the outskirts of Paris, was the scene of a bloody battle between the French Army and the Prussian forces besieging Paris in October 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War.&#10; A Matter of Honor is an action-packed two-player tactical board game using a simple but effective area impulse activation system. The game captures the dramatic intensity of the Battle of Le Bourget and its desperate house to house fighting. &#10;Added chromes include random event cards featuring historical events players may use to influence the outcome of the battle. &#10;Units are companies of elite Prussian Guards, facing determined French Regulars and National Guardsmen in a fight to the finish and for a matter of honor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
