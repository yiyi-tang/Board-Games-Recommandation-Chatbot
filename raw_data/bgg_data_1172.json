By vanquishing an opposing creature, you gain might points equal to the creature's power level.

Each tribe consists of six different creatures with unique abilities and distinct power levels.

    "Description": "'Nice Darts -CardGame of Darts- is a competitive card game themed on darts.&#10;&#10;In the base game (Count-up), players use their hand cards to win three tricks, representing their three throws from the ockey.&#10;&#10;One by one, each player plays a card from their hand, and each card has its rank. After all players play a card, the player who plays the card that has highest rank among them takes their played card back in front of themselves as a score card, and other played cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;Once a player takes three score cards in front of themselves, that player finishes their play for this round, and waits for all players have finished.&#10;&#10;When all players finished their play, they count up victory point according to their own score cards, and the player who has highest point wins!&#10;&#10;There are three different mode for this game.&#10;1.

Cricket for darts has variants but this card game supports 'All number Cricket'.&#10;Team play is available for four players.&#10;&#10;3. Zero-one (&#227;&#130;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#179;) (requires an expansion pack)&#10;Count down from a number that ends '01', such as 301, 501, or 701.

Holding your steering wheel you rely on the resources of your racecar or use your tactical cards and pilot abilities driving on the edge while your goal is certain: victory.&#10;&#10;Grab your steering wheel as if you were jumping into your cockpit. Set up your own assembled racing car, choose a pilot whose abilities fits best your strategy, qualify with your tactical cards, or save them for the racestart and the race itself. Shift into 1st gear, avoid wheelspin and race for victory pushing the limits while using your pilot awereness and abilities along with tactical cards and your resources!&#10;&#10;The Grand Prix takes place on one track of the two-sided gameboard. By literally shifting gears you gain movement points to spend during your turn. However, using the resources of your racecar - such as engine, fuel, tires etc. - you can gain extra speed. Along straights there's an opportunity to use slipstream or try to take over the car in front with a bold move from a certain distance. There are strict rules for cornering (based on gears and car setup), but using your resources wisely you can violate them and get further. Resources can be gained back during a pit stop.&#10;&#10;Rulesystem is created so, that players get to know more and more functions of the elements as they approach advanced level.&#10;&#10;'AI' drivers lets you fill up the grid when playing with a small amount of players or solo.&#10;&#10;&sbquo;Team orders&rsquo; game mod lets you control two cars between wich you have to share your initial income evenly or favorizing one of them for victory.&#10;&#10;You can also compete against an AI driver on your friends&rsquo; side in &sbquo;Co-operative&rsquo; game mod during a four-round championship relying on each others&rsquo; developments while racing for 1st.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Squadron Commander' is designed specifically to play with the 10mm Crew miniatures from Capitan Games, and the Gunboats &amp; Ships made by Laser Dream Works for Capitan Games.&#10;&#10;The main elements of the game are the gunboats and ships, along with their crews.&#10;&#10;Gunboat, our original Napoleonic small naval action rule set, has grown and, with this second edition, has become Squadron Commander in an updated form. The game has been re-scaled for a better playability and is supported by a whole range of miniature crews and ships that are available in 10mm scale.&#10;&#10;With this re-scaling, players will be able to play on a smaller game table with smaller gunboats or on, a larger table, with cutters, brigs of war, sloops, corvettes, frigates, Xebecs, and much more.  Also in this 2nd edition we have introduced two new kits from the great &ldquo;Hearts of Oak&rdquo; Ships of the Line a 4th rate (50 &amp; 64 gun) and a 3rd rate (74 &amp; 80 gun).&#10;&#10;We are investigating the introduction of 2nd and 1st rate vessels later, together with a merchant or &ldquo;Indiaman&rdquo; vessel. As a result of these moves, we have made a small adjustment to the rules.&#10;&#10;With these changes, the rules have been expanded and cover all ship types and there is a full set of ship characteristics and crew charts ready to play straight from the book. By including the great &ldquo;Ships of the Line&rdquo; and  Frigates, players will be able to recreate the famous frigate actions of the Napoleonic wars, with Privateers or take the role of a captain of the Royal Navy, like Lord Cochrane on HMS Imperieuse, the French Privateer, Surcouf, with Le Confiance, Stephen Decatur who fought against the Barbary pirates or Spanish Captain Barcelo and his gunboats attacking Gibraltar&hellip; all this using a single rule set&hellip; action on the high seas, coastal landings, shore actions, cutting-out operations&hellip; plenty of enjoyment and history in one book&hellip;&#10;&#10;As a tactical game, Gunboat &ndash; Squadron Commander is designed to be played with a few ships per side, but ships which provide a strong visual experience as well as quick exciting game play, Squadron Commander is a new concept in naval games, emphasising the individual action of ships and crews rather than those of fleets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The huge influence of Napoleonic combat systems, tactics and weaponry (the flintlock musket was the standard weapon for all Armies until the later 1840&rsquo;s), meant that they remained the standard throughout the world until the full development of the rifled musket. This weapon, which used percussion caps rather than a spark from a flint, together with rifled artillery changed tactics and formations, and ended the Napoleonic Era.&#10;&#10;Divisional Commander (DC) is a set of Napoleonic rules to cover the whole Napoleonic era, including the British-American War of 1812, the &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; Wars of Liberation in South America, and the last War of the Napoleonic Era - the 1st Carlist War.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed to play battles of this period of medium size, involving a division, or a small corps. DC is designed to allow players to represent historical battles or to play balanced games based on a point system that allows them to play fictional scenarios and to run campaigns or championships.&#10;&#10;To represent the intense movements and counter movements of the formations in Napoleonic battles,  DC (as other Capitan Games rules) uses a system that allows more flexibility in the game rather than an &ldquo;I go, you go&rdquo; system.&#10;&#10;With the order system and the obligation to choose between different options for units, DC represents the fog of war and the uncertain control a commander has over his troops and his subordinate generals.&#10;&#10;Included: Rules, Cover &amp; Back Cover in High Resolution, Tokens &amp; QRS, Napoleonic Army Lists, 1st Carlist War  Rules &amp; Carlist Army Lists&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Company Commander is set in the XVIII &amp; the first half of the XIX century.  During this period there were many great battles with large armies and thousands of men but there were also many smaller actions where the use of a musket, ability in fencing, riding skills, personal courage and charisma were decisive.&#10;&#10;Company Commander rules are designed for games between small units of men such as reconnaissance patrols, convoy escorts, intelligence missions, border attacks, and other missions which were given to small groups of selected troops. The actions of small groups of soldiers and the direct commands of their officers are the most important aspects of play.  The system simulates the frantic rhythm of an encounter.  The &ldquo;human factors&rdquo; of individual initiative, speed and leadership are worth more than the grand tactics of larger battles.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed to use with 15/18mm figures. Figures can be based individually or in groups. But other scales as 28mm could be used.&#10;&#10;For command figures, standard bearers, musicians and officers, one figure equals one man. In all other cases one figure represents three soldiers. 8-12 figures represent a section and three sections represent a company.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents about 3 minutes of time.&#10;&#10;Ground scale is 1:100.&#10;&#10;During 6 years the game has been developed with the suggestions of many players, clubs and hours of gaming.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For two thousand years; from 3000 BC to 1000 BC, warriors fought battles with weapons of bronze. This gleaming red-gold metal is an alloy of copper and tin. The warrior nobles rode into battle in chariots and were clad in bronze armour. Their followers gripped bronze thrusting spears, battle-axes and slashing swords. Battle was a dazzling sight as weapons and armour glinted in the sun amid the clash of bronze against bronze and the clatter of charging chariots. This was the heroic age of legend! When the sand and rubble is cleared away from the mighty ruins of the temples, tombs and strongholds of this time; the tales of these battles are revealed inscribed in stone and on the imperishable tablets of baked clay.&#10;&#10;Around the ancient carvings of the warriors, which inspire the model soldiers depicted in this book, are the reports of their deeds on the battlefield. From what they tell us we can recreate battles for our model armies. In this book you will find many battle scenarios and skirmishes all based on real events. We begin with the Sumerians, rival city states. Then we see the rise and fall of the first great empire of the Akkadians. Ancient Egyptians fight to unite their nation and repel Hyksos invaders. The mighty Hammurabi takes on rivals to create the kingdom of Babylon. The chariot Empires of the Hittites and Mitanni clash and try and hold their own against the New Kingdom Pharaohs and the Mycenaeans. Egyptian and Canaanite chariots battle on the plain of Megiddo. Heroes fight duels upon the plain of Troy. Then Sea Peoples and Habiru tribes challenge the chariot lords as we approach the dramatic end of Bronze Age.&#10;&#10;Age of Bronze contains 32 scenarios - in addition to the traditional Hail Caesar massed battles we introduce skirmish rules for smaller scale conflicts between warbands so often seen during this period.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from Publisher&#10;&#10;",

Regrettably, for those tasked with running the experiment, Schr&ouml;dinger himself has snuck into the group and wishes nothing more than to sabotage the experiment as he believes the Benefactor has missed the entire point.&#10;&#10;Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat is a quick social deduction party game for 6-12 players. Game-play typically lasts 10-15 minutes. Player roles include a host, Lab Techs, Schr&ouml;dinger himself, a Financial Benefactor and several Think Tank Physicists.&#10;&#10;Roles are split into two teams, blue and red. On the blue team are the Financial Benefactor, the Honest Lab Tech and the Think Tank Physicists. Their goal is to determine weather the cat is dead or alive successfully. On the red team are Schr&ouml;dinger and his Lab Tech. Their goal is to ruin the experiment.&#10;&#10;The experiment is prepared by placing the two sided cat meeple into the experiment box (mint tin). One side shows the cat as dead, the other alive.

    "Description": "This is the latest set of wargaming rules from Hordes of Models and Buckets of Dice. The rules facilitate phalanx, warband, company to regimental level games from 3000BC to 1901AD with a focus on command and control. Larger games can be played depending of the scale and size of the table available. The design philosophy of the rule set provides a simple approach that can be used to play wargame battles, irrespective of the figure scale (6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 25mm and even 1/32 scale). These rules have been designed to provide the player with challenges based around the manoeuvre and the management of their army in an easy format while still maintaining a feel for the specific period being played. The rules use a number of bases, depending on the size of formations. These are then grouped into distinct command groups. A formation has between two, four or six bases to represent the different formation sizes. The bases are placed side by side to represent a line, skirmish line or a column/block deployment. A base can have any number of figures on it according to the players preference or current basing arrangement. To represent scouting or skirmish formations, the formation bases are spaced out in a line, with each base having a gap equal to one base width. I personally, use blank bases to show clear formation definition. Artillery formations are based slightly different. They are always on a single square base of two base widths wide to two base widths deep, always counting as a standard size formation. When playing with scales of 6mm &ndash; 28mm, a base size of 60mm x 60mm is used, although the equally popular 40mm wide bases could be used instead. For a scale greater than this, bases of 100mm x 100mm are used. This is the base size I use for my 54mm games. The rules use a measurement of one base width equal to one range/movement distance measurement. The rules have been designed to provide capability options for each base. These bases are then grouped into formations. Each formation cannot complete all of the traditional actions/phases (shooting, moving, charging and reforming etc.) during a turn, with a specific formation. Each formation has two action points per turn. The players then decide which combination of actions to complete. The players complete all actions on a specific formation alternatively. This makes the style of play more of a conversion, keeping players engaged through the whole game. The framework used in the game looks at the different formations capabilities compared to that of compatible enemy formations in period. Or put more simply: &ldquo;Was the specific formation any better or worse on the battlefield compared to their opponents, for the period?&rdquo;. This enables the player to apply their own knowledge of the historic period to represent the way they believe a specific type of formation would have performed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Gunpowder Period: Quick play wargames rules for 1560AD - 1885AD&#10;&#10;The design philosophy of the Gunpowder rules provides a simple approach that can be used to play wargame battles at brigade or higher command levels, irrespective of the figure scale (6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 25mm and even 1/32 scale) with your own current models and common basing formats currently in use. There are many very good rule sets aimed at a specific period in the hobby which provide a detailed simulation of warfare in that period. These rules have been designed to provide the player with challenges based around the manoeuvre and the management of their units in a quick play format while still maintaining a feel for the period. An army within the game is typically 20 units as side broken down into distinct command groups. A unit is a single base. The rules use 100mm equal to one range/movement unit and a unit has a footprint of 120mm wide by 30mm &ndash; 80mm depth depending the formation and unit type. The rules have been designed to provide capability options at the unit level, while still presenting the dilemma to the player that they cannot complete all the traditional phases (shooting, moving, charging and reforming) during a turn with that specific unit. These rules instead of using a traditional system of very distinct detailed weapon factors and micro-managed movement rates, they provide a game framework that looks at the different unit&rsquo;s capabilities compared to that of the unit&rsquo;s opponents for the period. This enables the player to apply their own knowledge of the historic period to represent the way a specific unit should perform with in the game. The rules also do not use the IGUGO turn approach, but instead each action, (reform, charge, move and shoot) can be done in any sequence and up to twice in a turn. This keeps both players engaged throughout a turn sequence. A unit has a limit of two actions in any turn. The players take it in turns to complete these actions by unit. Also, the rules do not focus on detailed weapon factors and actions within a specific game turn time frame, but use the approach: &ldquo;Was the specific unit any better or worse on the battlefield for the period?&rdquo; For example, all units could have used volley fire, but was this specific unit any better/worse at than anyone else? The rules manage this through a unit being given a selection of capabilities. The rules make a difference between the plug and socket bayonets. This is handled by the unit completing a distinct action to counting them fitted. This means when a plug bayonet is fitted, the unit cannot shoot. This formation is called &ldquo;Foot cavalry defence&rdquo;. This also covers the use the of foot squares as an anti-cavalry defence. The rules have to make a comprise and when a unit is claiming &ldquo;foot cavalry defence&rdquo; they also count as a deep formation even when a unit is in line with bayonets fitted. All units break at the same point, regardless of if the unit is veteran, regular or militia. What is managed within the rule set is how quickly or slowly a unit reaches that point of failure. Generals are used for command and control only. Units must be organised into command groups. An army for the game is organised into a number of these command groups with an overall army commander. Generals can only command units within their group and the army commander can command any units across all command groups. Typically, a command group is a brigade, division or corps depending on the scale you have adopted for the army. Games can be played over a two-hour time limit with a scoring system based around the number of units that one side has managed to kill. The rules reward aggressive play; thus, hopefully avoiding a static game. For a specific historical battle use the objectives of the actual battle to decide the winner. These rules cover the period from the end of the dominance of the Swiss Keil to the end of The Mahdist Wars in the Sudan.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to get rid of your cards before your friends &mdash; and do as much damage as you can while you go.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 96 cards, numbered 0-5. You can play one card higher or lower than the card on top of a play pile, including your on your own pile, and those numbers wrap, so you can play a 5 on a 0 and vice versa. The &quot;0&quot; card is special, though, in that it counts as damage (negative points), counted at the end of the round, so it's best to try to play them on other people's piles while defensively keeping your pile as far from 0 as you can.&#10;&#10;The app is there to tell you when to play, give you random challenges, and generally make your life a panic-inducing nightmare (in a fun way!). The app will randomly (but evenly) assign turn order and occasionally force all players to compete in quick, frantic mini-games on the device &mdash; often when they least expect it.&#10;&#10;The first person to get rid of all their cards and tap the button in the middle of their screen gets the most Space Points, with fewer points being given to each player as they finish. Once all players are done, they are asked to count their damage (cards marked &quot;0&quot;), and then the app will calculate their scores for the round.&#10;&#10;Rounds typically last about 3-6 minutes, and the player with the most Space Points at the end of 10 rounds wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "After centuries of machinations, Hades finally defeated the other gods. He is about to drag mankind into the underworld to reign supreme. Only the wise old Daedalus, inventor of genius, still stands against him, helped by a handful of heroes. But these will not cooperate: only one will be the savior of humanity.&#10;&#10;Hades Trap is played on a modular board made up of 9 tiles, which allows you to renew your games. Each player plays as a hero who will be able to perform a variable number of actions in turn. You will be able to move around or interact with the square on which you are standing, in order to fight skeletons, activate mechanisms or even knock out your opponents! But beware, if you step on a breadcrumb trail, the Minotaur will be alerted and will run in the direction of its patrol! Maybe this is your chance to pull it towards your enemies?&#10;&#10;Collect three of the available medallions and exit the labyrinth to be declared the winner. The medallions can be retrieved in many ways, so you'll need to be resourceful and brave to complete this important quest.&#10;&#10;",

The tiles are all 2x3 but their contents vary wildly, and placement rules just require that every block be supported. The ultimate shape of your castle is up to you!&#10;&#10;There are four main ways to earn points: you can have the highest or second highest roof in each of three colors, you can build a bridge that spans two tiles, you can place a castle resident at their preferred height, and you can add a new shape of windows to your castle. These goals interact in interesting ways - for example, to get roof points you want a very high castle, but most residents prefer relatively low levels of the castle.&#10;&#10;Normally you place one tile each round, but if you place a colored toy block next to another colored toy block you get to place one extra tile on your turn. This can be used to take tiles from the shared stock in quick succession or to make a surprise play.&#10;&#10;Once someone has played their 15th tile, play continues until everyone has had the same number of turns before entering final scoring. The game is flexible and can be played as a casual game with children and families, but the scoring and high degree of freedom leave plenty of room for serious play.

(Soundtracks are available on the publisher&#039;s website.)&#10;&#10;Your goal is to co-operate to achieve a high score. On the beat, you play one of your four cards in hand to the end of the line, then draw a new card. If you miss playing on the beat, you'll play one fewer card total and probably miss out on points. Each card has five lines on it, so when placed together, they look like a music score. Sometimes a line is blank, sometimes it has 1-2 colored symbols on it, sometimes it has an X over the colored symbol, and sometimes the symbol has a scoring halo around it.&#10;&#10;Once the music ends, you advance from the first card onward with a pawn, stopping whenever you hit a scoring halo. You then count backwards to see how many symbols of that color (shape) there are before you hit an X, with the symbol inside the halo also counting. Sometimes a halo has an &quot;x2&quot; mark to indicate that you double the score for that halo. Some cards consist of nothing more than a &quot;cancel&quot; symbol, which tells you to ignore Xs on either side of that card. Combine your cards to score lots of points, with anything higher than 100 being excellent!&#10;&#10;",

To prevent this, the Deathwatcher sends his curse to hunt the players, killing them on contact. If a player should die, he transforms into a minion of the Deathwatcher. This player can still win by scoring points when he kills other players. Players use standees to move on the gameboard and a charactersheet to keep track of their scores and possessions.&#10;&#10;The dungeon is represented by a non-modular map which has several routes of varying length with unexplored rooms that are only revealed when a player enters them and are either a dead end or not. This ensures the need for flexible planning by players. It is up to each player to plot a route through the crypt and modify their plan according to revealed rooms and the actions of other players.&#10;In their turn players must first choose how they move. Either slowly and sneaky to attract less attention and find more treasure or fast and reckless to cover more ground. &#10;Then they roll the dungeon die to see what happens to him or her that round. This will be highly influenced by the choice of movement.&#10;Lastly they must deal with obstacles like traps or combat which occurs when a player draws a monster card or when a player that became a servant of the Deathwatcher catches a still living player.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Deduce his location to surprise him there, or for extra points catch him and the Dark Lady together, unmasking them both at the same time.&#10;&#10;The Rendezvous challenges you to discover which of seven landscape features acted as a meeting place for Shakespeare and his Dark Lady. Querying a location gives you a number from 1 to 3, being the number of steps away from the current location that the Rendezvous symbol can be found. Deduce which map symbol represents the Rendezvous, then confront and unmask the Dark Lady in a location with that symbol at it.&#10;&#10;The Rival Poet adds a second pawn that stalks the streets and interacts with the player via simple movement rules. Choose from two different poets to make the game easier or harder. The Elusive Poet tries to stay one step ahead of you, but if you catch him he will reveal a clue about the Dark Lady. In contrast, The Aggressive Poet hounds and chases you, potentially spoiling your plans to intercept the Dark Lady.&#10;&#10;Waypoints and Traces gives you two tools to mark and track the Dark Lady's location at a particular point in the stealth deck. And The Darker Ladies replace the clue cards in the base game, giving each Dark Lady a new set of characteristics and presenting a slightly harder deduction challenge.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players must collect more total ring points than their opponent to be the winner at the game's end.&#10;&#10;Board: 5x5 or 5x7 grid board.&#10;Pieces: Each player has own color 5 ring collecting agent pieces.&#10;Rings: 1 luxury gold, 4 gold and 10 silver rings(5x5 grid board) or 20 silver rings(5x7 grid board)&#10;Player: 2&#10;Playing time: 10 to 20 minutes&#10;&#10;- Playing&#10;Decide the first player and take turns alternately. Players must move  any one of their own pieces on the board or replace one of their re-use pieces previously captured by their opponent. Re-placing piece must be placed on the space where a ring exists and becomes a ring holder agent as described below.  Players can't pass their turns when they have a legal move.&#10;&#10;- Basic moves&#10;Any agent pieces can move one space to any eight directions, vertically horizontally and diagonally like chess king except for a space where own piece exists.&#10;&#10;- Game end&#10;There are two game ending conditions. The first is after all rings on the board are picked up, both players get one last turn. The second is when both players pass consecutively.&#10;&#10;- Winner&#10;The player who obtains more ring points at the end of game, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

So if the middle is &quot;tomato&quot; you could play &quot;bread&quot; to make pizza, and then the next person could play &quot;curry&quot; to make nan and curry. You go on this way until someone runs out of cards. An important rule is that you can't just invent some kind of food on the spot, you have to use an existing well-known dish.&#10;&#10;The other games use the same principle of making food out of ingredients. In &quot;Cooking Poker&quot; the hands are based on combinations of food, so for example a &quot;straight&quot; is where you use all your five cards to make a course meal and can explain the order the courses are served in. In &quot;Indian Food Cooking Poker&quot; you play with your hand visible only to the other players, and &quot;Tanuki Soba&quot; is like Old Maid.&#10;&#10;What food will you come up with?&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The area control aspect is fairly traditional with two major twists: areas will merge as you play, and there are unique rules for hand management.&#10;&#10;Every player starts the game with the same hand of nine cards, one for each district in Tome, but the cards are shuffled and can't be reordered after picking them up. Each round you pick two of the first three cards in your hand and use one to determine where you place cubes and the other to determine how many cubes you place. Cards that let you place two cubes correspond to more central and thus valuable districts, so you have to choose between good placement or more cubes.&#10;&#10;After a district is filled with cubes accounting takes place, and typically after each accounting a &quot;friendship token&quot; will be placed between two districts, connecting them. After that filling individual districts still triggers accounting, but during accounting cubes in directly connected friendly districts are counted the same as cubes in the district itself. In the extreme case you could even take first place in a district you have no cubes in if you've packed a friendly neighbor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "There&rsquo;s Something Magical About This Place!&#10;&#10;Maybe it&rsquo;s the take-your-breath-away beauty of nature combined with the high altitude and more than 300 sunny days a year. It&rsquo;s not surprising that &ldquo;America the Beautiful&rdquo; was inspired by a trip to the summit of Pikes Peak.&#10;&#10;Colorado-Opoly allows players to collect favorite Colorado properties and increase the rent by adding Cabins and trading them in for Lodges. We&rsquo;re talking everything from Buffalo Burgers to the majestic Rocky Mountains! It&rsquo;s all fun and games until someone has to BOW TO THE PLOW and is snowed in for three turns.&#10;&#10;Grab your token and advance to Go Colorado! You may soon be hitting the slopes&hellip;or out of the game from eating too many Rocky Mountain Oysters. Whatever happens&hellip; IT&rsquo;S GONNA BE&hellip; MILE HIGH FUN!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This music based quiz game is laugh-out-loud funny and easy to pick up and play in no time. Ideally suited to three or more players, the game can be played by anyone with a love for music! The game comes with 100 catchphrase cards, each with a different well-known artist, song, or musical phrase that the player must guess by deciphering the pictogram clues.&#10;&#10;Each clue is a representation of a famous name or phrase, so all the guesser needs to do is say what they see for the answer to seem obvious. Pictogram or Rebus style games have been hugely popular for generations, using images, symbols, or clever wordplay to denote meaning that is often clearest when read aloud. With a retro style box designed like a classic cassette, Say What You See: Music Edition makes can be neatly stored away when not in use.

The first player to reach eight or more items on display will trigger the end game condition, as long as items or action cards are still available.
