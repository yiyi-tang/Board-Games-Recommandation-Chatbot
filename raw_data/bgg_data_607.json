    "Description": "Napoleon&rsquo;s Legacy is a set of rules allowing players to game warfare during the period 1795 to 1865, taking in the Napoleonic Wars to the American Civil War.&#10;&#10;The rules arose from the collective fascination for the variety of conflicts during this period of history shared by the writing and testing team. We also felt that there was a need for a faster playing set of rules for the period that kept charts and calculations to a bare minimum. Legacy is a flowing game, with the element of surprise and frustration built in to simulate the Fog-of-War using commands issued by dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The core rules apply to all the conflicts during the period. You will find that the battle tactics used by the warring nations throughout the period covered by these rules were taught to all officers under the huge shadow cast by Napoleon. With the army lists provided towards the back of the book there are additional rules for the conflicts in which these armies took part.&#10;&#10;Napoleonic doctrine would be present at every battle to 1865 and the end of the American Civil War: Johnny Reb and Billy Yank were part of Napoleon&rsquo;s Legacy&hellip;.

    "Description": "Introduction&#10;&#10;In Conceptualize This! you're approached by two manufacturers of final products. They both want to launch a new product into the market, for which they need the same intermediate product. Step by step you conceptualize this intermediate product by collecting the right cards and placing them on the board. Be careful though, because every player is approached by different manufacturers and will do everything to get control over the intermediate product, which appears on the board.&#10;&#10;Explanation&#10;&#10;Conceptualize This! is a card game in which every player gets a unique target. During the game you try to collect cards which &quot;connect&quot; to each other in a dominos like way. The set of cards you collect results in a concept of the intermediate product, build up out of different components that need each other to function. The board supports the concept of tile (card) placement in such a way that the connections between the cards are made visible. The game is won by the player who completes his / her concept of the intermediate product on the board.&#10;&#10;Background&#10;&#10;The development on this board game started as an element of a Bachelor thesis. For the research in this thesis the board game was meant to educate people on how to model UML activity diagrams (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of actions are modelled) in a fast and easy way. During the creation of the board game the accent moved to a system diagram (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of components are modelled) which gave more freedom in the creation of cards. Because the concepts used in both modelling languages are the same, people should still be able to create an activity diagram after playing the game.&#10;&#10;At first the game seemed to have a very high luck rate, but closer to completion the game turned out to be tactical as well. Due to this development a few extra rules were included which made the game even more tactical and increased the replay value.&#10;&#10;The research on the Bachelor thesis for which this board game is created is still in progress. The board game itself however is completed and only needs to be stylised. If a publisher can be found the game will be published in the future. Currently both Dutch and English versions can be previewed by publishers.&#10;&#10;",

When playing cards of the same suit (which is required if possible) the middle card wins, when two suits are played, the odd one wins and if multiple suits are played, the one with the odd color takes the trick.&#10;&#10;Yet points are scored based on tricks won, where you get 1 point for each trick you win, yet 2 for each trick won by the player on your right. Also, the goal is to be the one in the middle when one player reaches 100 points. Thus at the end if the scores are 100, 82, 67; the player with 82 would be declared the winner (in case of a tie, the untied player wins).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Operation Orient was a relatively obscure plan conceived by Adolph Hitler and Hiroshi Oshima, Japanese ambassador to Nazi Germany, that set forth a unified strategy for the two great Axis powers.  It called for the seizure of ports at Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Diego Suarez, Madagascar to disrupt Allied operations across the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean.  There were plans to invade Siberia in concert with the climax of the Wehrmacht's Operation Typhoon.  In it's most ambitious form, it proposed a land invasion of India by the Imperial Japanese Army, with great assistance from Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.  Meanwhile, German forces would seize Egypt and the Caucusus but not stop until panzers could parade in front of the Taj Mahal!  In the end, Yamamoto and the Imperial Japanese Navy won the internal power struggle - the American Pacific fleet and Allied colonies in Asia became the target of the Rising Sun, and Operation Orient became just a footnote in history books.  But what if Yamamoto didn't have his way?  One can only imagine the frightful threat of a truly coordinated Axis effort.  Now you have the chance to rewrite history!&#10;&#10;Days of Infamy is a grand strategic simulation, currently in pre-production, that recreates the Pacific Theater of Operations during the Second World War.  It can be played as a standalone game or serve as an expansion to Sturm Europa! to create a truly global conflict.  The combined campaign game is a five-player game, that will introduce a unique arrangement of sides, each with independent victory objectives and only ONE winner, to realistically depict the international and interservice rivalries that threatened to shatter the fragile alliances of all the major combatants of World War II.&#10;&#10;PTO Only&#10;Player 1 - Japan (Imperial Japanese Navy, Imperial Japanese Army)&#10;Player 2 - Allies (United States Navy, Commonwealth Nations)&#10;&#10;ETO + PTO (Requires Sturm Europa!)&#10;Player 1 - Land Axis (Germany, Imperial Japanese Army)&#10;Player 2 - Naval Axis (Italy, Imperial Japanese Navy)&#10;Player 3 - ETO Western Allies (United States Army, Great Britain)&#10;Player 4 - PTO Western Allies (United States Navy, Commonwealth Nations)&#10;Player 5 - Soviets&#10;&#10;Can be combined with Sturm Europa!&#10;&#10;",

Each set has a random set of tiles, made from left-overs of the acrylic version of Kaliko.  These tiles are hexagonal, each one having 3 paths that cross the tile from one edge to another.  To play the game, each player uses 6 tiles and tries to be the first to form a specific hexahex shape with matching paths.  There are 82 different hexahex shapes, formed from all possible arrangements of 6 connected hexagons.  The rule sheet includes puzzles for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;There is also a version named Pocket Loops 3 that uses 16 all-different three-color tiles.  To play this game, each player starts with 7 tiles, the remaining 2 form the starting pattern.  Players take turns placing tiles, such that each tile touches at least 2 other tiles and the path colors match.  Each segment of the paths extended by the newly played piece scores 1 point.&#10;&#10;",

In the dark depths of the forests and swamps of this realm, horrible beasts and dragons lurked, often terrorizing the helpless farmers and village dwellers of the kingdom. In order to make an end to the terror and rid the country from the bestial scourge, the king summoned the bravest and most fearless heroes from all four corners of the country. He sent them on a noble quest to free the country of all dragons and foul beasts, to make the kingdom a safe place to live in.&#10;Unfathomable peril, but also treasure, gold and glory await the fearless Dragonslayers!&#10; The goal of the game is to slay all monsters without being killed. You can either play solo or two players. If you play two players, the player who slew the most monsters in the end wins. If you play solo, you can set a high score in your first game which you can try to beat in further games by trying to beat the game in as few turns as possible while amassing a maximum of gold!&#10;&#10;",

This period of trade between the two countries was known as Nichi-Min or Kango trade. Ming China agreed to this trade on condition that Yoshimitsu brought the Japanese pirates called Wako under control. Hence, the Shogunate's trading ships all carried a Kango-fu identifying seal in order to distinguish them from the pirates.&#10;&#10;The players are traders in Sakai, a port in Osaka Prefecture.  They are trying to earn money from importing goods to Japan from China. So the Kango-fu is very important to the success of their business.&#10;&#10;",

Players will set up the board by taking turns placing a large opaque piece that has been randomly filled with a medium and small colored piece onto the chess board. The players having placed the hidden information stashes on the board will then each turn place a card facedown on the table to represent how many spaces they would like to move. All players reveal this number simultaneously and may move any direction at that point but they MUST move that many spaces. If they cannot move that many spaces (due to board edges or exhausted veins or other players) they may not move at all. Players move to 'veins' and search for colored diamonds. Diamonds of their own color will be worth extra points at the end of the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Diamond is an Icehouse game designed by Sam Zitin.&#10;&#10;To play, players will need 6 Icehouse stashes (2 of which must be opaque), a chessboard, three cards designating 1, 2, or 3, and an opaque bag or hat from which to blindly draw pieces.&#10;&#10;Diamond Mine placed 4th in the Spring 2009 Icehouse Games Design Competition.&#10;&#10;Diamond Mine was redeveloped into Iceminers.&#10;&#10;",

This singleton acts much like the king in Chess as controlling your opponent's singleton is the condition for victory in Albiorix.&#10;&#10;You are able to move a piece if the topmost pyramid is in your color OR if the piece contains a pyramid identical to your current singleton. Direction and range of movement is dependent on the sizes of the two pyramids that make up the piece, with higher value pieces loosely corresponding to larger freedom of movement. Capturing does not occur in a traditional sense, but instead the two pieces involved (captor and prisoner) remain on the board and are re-structured according to the acting player's whim [provided the two newly formed pieces consist of no more than two pyramids and the topmost pyramids are not larger than the bottom pyramids].&#10;&#10;When both singleton pieces are your color, you win.&#10;&#10;Albiorix was designed by Don Sheldon and placed 3rd in the Icehouse Games Design Competition, Summer 2008.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Let's go for a Tiki Tour! This is a fun board game designed and produced in Auckland, New Zealand. It is like Snakes and Ladders but faster and better.  Along the way you will meet some of New Zealand's wildlife. Throw the dice and see what you land on - Pukekos can take you forward or backwards, Katipo spiders make you miss a go, kiwis put you up with the game leader and volcanoes take you right back to the start. The player who circumnavigates both islands of NZ and makes it up to the Remarkables first, wins.&#10;&#10;A novel, New Zealand made board game that will help to teach New Zealand geography and native animals in an entertaining way.  Suitable for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;- To take a &quot;tiki tour&quot; is New Zealand slang for taking a trip somewhere, but in a meandering way.-&#10;&#10;",

If you roll a 1, you can move a piece forward on the track like normal or move it over an adjacent wall so long as it moves toward the end of your track. If you land a piece on a lone opponent's piece, that piece is pinned until you move all of your pieces off of it.&#10;&#10;If all of your pieces form a single connected group, with part of that group on the final space on your end of the track, you win.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to get five pieces into the inner ring around the honey is the winner - but the five pieces have to be alone or on top of their respective stacks.&#10;&#10;",
