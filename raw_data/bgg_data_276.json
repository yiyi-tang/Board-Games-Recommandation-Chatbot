It is a card game played with approximately 100 cards. Both sides of each card depict a character and its name, while its weight, IQ and fighting ability are printed on only one side of the card. For each game, players decide before playing which of the three statistics they're comparing.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player places a number of character cards on the table in front of them with the characteristics hidden. One card is placed in the center of the table with its characteristics revealed. Players then take turns placing a card from their tableau in a row on the table; a player can place a card between any two other cards. After placing the card, the player reveals the characteristics on it. If the card was placed correctly &ndash; that is, with the particular characteristic in numerical order compared to all other cards on the table &ndash; the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck and adds it to their tableau.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all their cards by placing them correctly wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Generally, the game of Nim is a two-player game of perfect information in which there are some number of rows or &quot;heaps&quot; of objects, and a legal move consists of removing any number of objects from a single heap. (For a non-trivial game, we should start with at least three heaps.) In &quot;standard play&quot;, the player who cannot make a move on his turn (because no objects remain) is the loser. A very general and far-reaching theory of such games is developed in Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays.&#10;&#10;In the commercial version pictured, the players take turns removing 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs together in a row. It would appear from the picture that &quot;rows&quot; can run in any direction, which means that the &quot;heaps&quot; intersect. This is not what most people know as Nim. Also, according to the original description, in this version the loser is the player who has to remove the last peg. This is so-called &quot;misere play&quot;, rather than the standard winning condition. Many combinatorial games allow mis&egrave;re play as a variation.&#10;&#10;Nim is solved, which means that from any initial configuration, one can readily determine whether the next player or the previous player has a winning strategy, and identify a good next move in the former case. For Nim, this can be determined surprisingly readily no matter the size of the heaps, but you're not going to get the secret from me.&#10;&#10;As most who would be interested in Nim know the solution, there isn't much of a game here. But Nim plays a central role in the theory of combinatorial games, as any two-player finite impartial game is in some sense Nim in disguise: any position in such a game corresponds to a unique Nim-heap, and one can play the disguised game perfectly by making the moves that correspond to winning moves in Nim. Sprouts is one example. This however does not mean that Sprouts itself is solved, as the &quot;disguise&quot; is only partially revealed.&#10;&#10;",

The first one to pillage all of the villages and take the daughters of their thanes to his home port as warranty of recognition of jarls authority will be declared the winner. To do this, the jarls will have to brave the stormy northern seas, battling each other along the way, and watch out for the sea monster that lurks beneath the waves! The most cunning and vehement of them all &ndash; that is, the one who the Gods favor &ndash; will throw a great feast and become the Konung of the North.&#10;&#10;Vikings: Warriors of the North is a card-based game. Players draw cards from a common deck. Wind cards are used for moving a drakkar around the board that depicts the cold north sea. Players can move the drakkar to a village (to sack it), to an enemy drakkar (to attack it), or to their own ports, where they can throw a feast for the Gods.&#10;&#10;A player can also use cards to drastically change the gameplay: He can increase his chances in an attack, re-roll the dice, sail further with his drakkar, or steal cards from an enemy's hand. All of those cards represent story events that have tangible effects within the game. Some cards represent heroes who can become part of a drakkar's crew. As long as a hero stays on the ship, he grants his owner a permanent effect. Each drakkar has three open slots for heroes. Daughters of the thanes are also considered heroes, so they also occupy drakkar slots. With only three slots, players have to think hard about their crew composition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can play any number of cards from his hand and take one action: attack, sack a village, throw a feast, etc. Attacks are resolved by a roll of a six-sided (d6) die, although many cards influence the combat result, so each battle is exciting.&#10;&#10;When a player take three daughters of the thanes (each of a different, opposing player color) and brings them to his own port, the game is over and that player wins. The gameplay is fast, furious and fun, full of twists and comebacks; it really lets you feel like a Viking chieftain!&#10;&#10;",

Properties are now only bought in the bank and not on landing on the square.&#10;&#10;2) Stocks&#10;Stocks can be bought in one of the 7 sets of properties and gives you money by dividend paid from the bank and dividend paid from the owner of properties.&#10;&#10;3) Car&#10;In Finans you have the opportunity to buy (and later sell if you are short on cash) a car which gives you two dices to roll instead of just one. Having a car makes jumps over the expensive properties more easy. You still only use one die inside the Bank.&#10;&#10;4) Bonds&#10;Bonds can be bought in the Bank by all players if a player land on one of the two bond squares. Each bond has a number from 2 to 12 and pays out if the number is rolled using two dices.&#10;&#10;The 1998-variant from Brio is a revised version of &quot;Finans&quot; by Anders Jeppson and Per Leveaux originally designed by &quot;Martin Marte&quot;. &quot;Finans&quot; means &quot;Finance&quot; but is different from Parker Brothers version from 1933.&#10;&#10;So far I have only seen this game sold in Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Finland &amp; Norway).&#10;&#10;",

(Your salary for passing Go is bumped up, and you can potentially make more money from the Chance/Millionaire Lifestyle cards.)&#10;3) Property spaces start with Fortune cards on them. (These allow you to build houses for free, force you to auction a property, or even allow you to steal properties from other players.)&#10;4) No paper money.  All the money is on little tiles.&#10;4) No banker necessary because the money tiles are placed in the middle of the board.&#10;5) No taxes, no railroads, no utilities.  The board only has 8 spaces per side instead of the usual 10.&#10;&#10;Otherwise most of this game is stuff you will recognize from the original.  Many gamers will be pleased to hear that this game puts a stronger focus on auctioning unpurchased properties, instead of the classic house rule of leaving it unowned.  Also the $1-million victory reduces the odds of player elimination and multi-hour games.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to get all your plane pieces into the base of your color in the center of the map.&#10;&#10;Each player has 4 planes in their starting base. Each turn you roll the die and move one plane of your color on the board.  To get your planes out of your base and onto the board you must roll a 6.  You get an extra turn whenever you roll a 6. If your plane happens to end up on top of another person's plane, that person's plane must go back to their base until he or she rolls a 6 again to get it out onto the board.&#10;&#10;On the board there are colored spaces that coincide with each player. If you land on your own color, you can immediately jump to the next block of your color.  There are also certain colored squares that offer shortcuts across the board.  You may only use the shortcuts that coincide with your color.  If you land on a colored square and subsequently jump to a shortcut square, you may also take the shortcut (essentially jumping twice in one turn).  If you ever land on your own piece, you may &quot;stack&quot; the pieces and move them as one piece until they reach the center or are landed on by an opponent and sent back as individuals.&#10;&#10;The first player to get all of their planes to the center of the board wins, and the rest play until there is only 1 loser. To land in the center of the board, you must roll the exact amount of spaces.&#10;&#10;It is very similar to Pachisi and especially Aggravation. There is no indication of a specific designer or publisher as the game is a classic from China, so it is now probably a public domain game. As is the case for Go, there are different packages for it with different colored/designed pieces&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "This is a game invented by the character Ross in episode 12 of the fourth season of the TV program  Friends. It is the same game as played by the characters on the show and as such does not require any knowledge of the TV series itself.&#10;&#10;The players split into two teams - intended to be girls and boys, but this only matters for the bonus questions. Each team takes it in turns to answer yes/no questions about the opposite team in one of four categories:  &quot;Fears and Pet Peeves&quot;, &quot;Ancient History&quot;, &quot;Literature&quot; and &quot;It's all Relative&quot;. This is done by submitting Yes/No cards face down for simultaneous reveal with the correct answer(s) from the other team. Some questions are about one member of the opposite team - in which case all members of the answering team submit a guess - and some questions are of the style &quot;Which of us...?&quot;, in which case the answering team collaborates for a yes/no answer for each member of the opposite team. The goal is to answer the most questions correctly about the other team and have the highest points total at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There is also a bonus round - and here the gender divide does matter, because the game is designed so that the boys are asking the girls questions that are supposedly hard for the girls to answer but that the boys themselves should easily know the answer to, and vice versa (no answers are provided for the bonus questions). The bonus round is timed and each team answers as many questions correctly as they can within the time limit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Dark Queen (otherwise known as the Evil Queen), the Queen of Hearts, and the Snow Queen &ndash; three of the most powerful queens of all realms join forces with the common goal of wiping out the population completely in order to start anew and create a utopia with no poverty, crime, or sickness, all designed with their vision and unquestionable control.&#10;&#10;To prevent history from repeating itself, they agree to select a champion to lead the new civilization and firmly guide the people based on knowledge from the past world. This champion must have a strong will, strength, magic, intelligence, persuasive abilities and is proven to be a survivor. Thus the Queens banished all Heroes and Villains into a fierce competition to see who will survive the Fairytale Games. There will be only one.&#10;&#10;Fairytale Games: The Battle Royale is a 1-10 player dice-based board game that uses cards as the board (for land exploration). Movement is with a 6-sided die. When you begin the game, you and other players start at the same location and begin revealing locations/terrain as you roll your die. Some locations offer opportunities to start quests to gain survival items or allow you to explore more lands and gain better abilities. All the while Events are happening that might help or hinder you greatly. There are 30+ character cards that you can play as or fight against in this game. Other cards include Action Cards, Event Cards, Location Cards, Quest Cards and Item Cards. A normal game duration is about 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to kill off at least ten fairytale characters in the game in addition to your opponent before they can do the same to you. If playing a one-player game, you must kill twenty characters. The other way you can win is if you complete certain Quest challenges as a team to escape the realm or to take the entire place down with you by finding the slim opportunities through certain card scenarios to defeat the three Queens.&#10;&#10;Although Action Cards allow you to strategically attack, defend, hinder, or help another player, your character cards themselves have their own special abilities that can be used during certain situations through dice rolling or if they are activated by Quests, Events or other Action Cards.&#10;&#10;",

(&quot;Simply Ingenious: Whoever Risks Too Much Loses!&quot;) is a tile game related to the Ingenious board game in that players are once again collecting as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also needing to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well.&#10;&#10;To start the game, mix all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) face down, then turn three face up and place them in a shared pool in the center of the table. On a turn, a player flips a tile face up. If the tile doesn't match one of those in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can either end his turn and collect the face-up tiles before him and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn.&#10;&#10;If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. (With four players, the goal is five tiles.) Any tiles of a color you collect over seven are shuffled back into the supply.&#10;&#10;If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool. If the pool ever has fewer than three face-up tiles, reveal tiles and add them to the pool until three tiles are available.&#10;&#10;Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert! was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.&#10;&#10;",

There are 6 types of commodity spread across the 5 continents and players must control these to satisfy two different winning conditions. So to win, you might need to control two tractors and two factories for one condition, and one commodity in each continent for your second condition. Alternately, the first player to earn 1 million wins.&#10;&#10;There are decks of cards; Country (which shows a commodity in a country and a price, e.g. Factories are in Britain and cost 70,000), Yes (good stuff), No (bad stuff), Auftrag (winning conditions). You start with some cash money, a few countries and two Auftrag. For the countries you own, you put the plastic commodity onto your colored disc onto the country. So the player owning Britain puts a factory on one of their discs onto Britain. This way, ownership can be seen and can change.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by two dice. The player rolls them, chooses one for itself and the other for the player on the left to use. The dice are marked Buy, Sell, Country, Yes, No, Cash. Buy means you can buy a commodity/country from another player - regardless of whether they want to sell it - at the price on the card. There is also a red die you can roll to gamble on the price, making it higher or lower. Sell means you may sell a Country back to the bank. Country means you draw a Country card and place the commodity on your disc on it. Yes/No means you draw from the appropriate deck and apply the result, e.g. all players get a dividend, or pay a tax, etc. Cash means you move a marker on the board and whoever has that commodity or continent gets a bonus.&#10;&#10;Since the game is completely driven by two dice, it is pure chance if a good thing or bad thing happens to a player. Due to the nature of the dice, the cards, and the rules, it is quite possible for the game to end in the first round. ...or it can go on forever.  [See Fluxx.]&#10;&#10;",

You attain this aim by collecting &quot;Peace Treaties&quot; from alien nations spread throughout six different galaxies.&#10;&#10;In the Lieutenant Rules (No Reading Required!), you race about the board collecting treaties.  Transporter spaces act as tunnels across the board.  The player with the most treaties collected wins.&#10;&#10;In the Captain Rules, each player gets one or two (depending on the number of players) photon torpedo cards, used to blast asteroid belts which block access to some planets.  Treaties come in two colours, the rarer ones being more valuable.  Random event cards complicate matters slightly.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "From the back of the box&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is a somewhat less complicated version of The Great Chain of Being, a medieval, theological, parlor game, first uncovered in a small church in Urbino during the renovation of an ancient, holy, but clearly inadequate, sewage system.  Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, &quot;that's a crock&quot;.&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.&#10;&#10;This is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.  It's a wild game.&#10;&#10;Game includes a 22 x 24 gameboard, 2 dice, 240 promotional prerequisite pieces, 20 power play pieces, 64 player tokens, a pack of money, 80 lifestyle cards, 20 memo cards, 20 consumer goods cards, 8 bucks, 1 power file, and two rulebooks (one to explain what it says in the simple game rules)&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Classic three dimensional haunted house race game from the seventies. Players move their pawns around the board trying to be the first to escape the house. Along the way players draw cards that either: a) turn you into a mouse (can't move), b) turn you back into a child if you are a mouse, or c) have you drop the &quot;whammy&quot; ball down the chimney. The whammy ball comes out in one of the four quadrants of the game board and makes something move (witch's broom, secret door, etc.). If a player's pawn (or mouse) is hit by the ball or moving object it is sent backwards to a &quot;safe&quot; spot. Ages 6 - 12.&#10;&#10;Which Witch came out in two editions: a large box version in 1970 with an unfolded board, and a narrow box edition in 1971 with a folding board.&#10;&#10;Finnish version known as Kummituslinna did not use cards for events but came with wheel you spin around. Kummituslinna had high quality plastic tower and staircase instead of cardboard.&#10;&#10;Italian version of the game was published by MB and it was called &quot;Brivido!&quot;. It came with a plastic central tower and a phosphorescent skull instead of the ball. Also, the plastic &quot;scared guy&quot; markers glow in the dark and the cards are replaced with a spinner (the Greek version also came with the glowing skull and the spinner).&#10;&#10;Hungarian version of the game is known as &quot;Szellemkast&eacute;ly&quot; and also came with a plastic central tower, a wheel instead of cards and a skull which glows in the dark.&#10;&#10;The UK version of the game, called Ghost Castle, also featured the black plastic central tower, glow-in-the-dark skull, and spinner.&#10;&#10;",

The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call &quot;crashes.&quot;)&#10;&#10;Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "BASIC DESCRIPTION:&#10;The UNO Dice Game attempts to translate the original UNO card game into a two player dice game.  It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;The game includes 11 dice.  Each die is unique and has some combination of faces in the four UNO colors (yellow, green, blue and red).  The die faces include: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, draw one, draw two, and wild (in black).  Note that there are no die faces that represent the Skip or Reverse cards from the original UNO card game (presumably because this is just a 2 player game).&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;The game mechanic is simple and mimics the original UNO card game.  To begin, 5 dice are randomly given to each of the two players.  These dice take the place of a players hand of cards in the original UNO card game.  The 11th die is left in the middle of the play area to form the start of the dice line (think UNO discard stack from the original card game).  The starting player rolls their dice and has to match either the color or value of the most recently placed die in the dice line.  That player's matching die is placed in the dice line and will have to be matched by the next player.  Play continues as players take turns rolling their hand of dice and adding one matching die from their hand to the dice line each turn until they only have one die left in their hand.  The player must then say &quot;UNO!&quot; or be penalized.  The penalty for not remembering to say &quot;UNO!&quot; is similar to the draw one and draw two die faces:  the affected player must take the appropriate number of dice from the end of the dice line.  The first player with no dice left wins.  The winning player's score is based on the faces of the dice left in front of their opponent.  Alternate rules are provided to ignore scoring and simply play the best out of 3 games.&#10;&#10;PACKAGING:&#10;This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label.  The top of the can pops off (twist to open).  The one sheet of rules and 11 dice fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin.  The tin also has a coin slot in the top that holds the a plastic hook to allow it to be hung for selling/display purposes.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Inspired by the success of Chez Geek, Steve Jackson presents another John Kovalic inspiration. This game is about buying the latest geeky gadgets and gamer items. Each player takes on the personality of one of the stars of Kovalic's comic &quot;Dork Tower&quot; in an attempt to purchase and possess the items that satisfy their obsessions. Of course, tastes are prone to change (one week it's LARPs, the next it's Computer Games), so players are constantly trying to purchase/trade/auction items so as to reach a certain number of points (items in your obsession count double towards victory). A light-hearted game with loads of gamer/otaku/LARP humor makes this a nice filler game that anyone can play.&#10;&#10;NOTE: Some form of currency/money is needed to play this game.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "FROM the SESSION REPORT:&#10;&#10;Each player is competing to pull off the most lucrative scams. You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.&#10;&#10;Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.&#10;&#10;You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.&#10;&#10;Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.&#10;&#10;To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.&#10;&#10;",

B1 Games has created an incredibly innovative game that mirrors the hit franchise and will truly resonate with fans.&quot;&#10;&#10;Featuring the same premise and characters as the video game - including Master Chief, A.I. and Covenant - the 'Halo Interactive Strategy Game' offers a modular board that can be re-configured to create a virtually limitless game play experience.

Instead of laying a tile, the player may elect to use a spade card that allows the player to flip certain already-laid tiles changing the pattern of the underlying grass and sand.&#10;&#10;Players claim ownership of features by placing welly boots on them during their turns. There are limited welly boots and several features to lay on, so the choice on where and whether to claim features is the key part of the game.&#10;&#10;Completing a feature allows the player to score points and to claim back their welly boots for further use. Using a spade card allows the player to capture welly boots on the tile that is flipped as well as potentially completing features.  Players have the option of a short 30 minute game to reach pre-agreed points totals or a longer game in which all tiles are played. the player with the highest points total wins.&#10;&#10;The set comprises a scoreboard, 96 tiles, 8 spade cards, 4 counters and 4 different coloured sets of 7 welly boots, and a tile bag.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These pads usually have flies, as shown above.&#10;&#10;When you land on a pad, you automatically gain the number of flies indicated. It is now in your possession. The flies are then removed from the lilypad and cannot be gained by another player.&#10;&#10;You can also land on a pad another player is already on. When this occurs, you may attempt to dunk them.&#10;&#10;Dunking&#10;When you land on the same pad as an existing player, you can choose whether to try to dunk them. If you want to, roll the frog dice. If it's an even number, you can move that far, and they lose a life. If it's odd, you may not move. However, if it's a 1, you lose a life.&#10;If you die holding flies, they FLY back to the location they come from and can once again be claimed by another player. &#10;Notes:&#10;You must roll for the pad first when attempting a dunk on yellow/red. You may leapfrog even if you lose a life, provided you have not been eliminated.&#10;When there are 2 or more people on a pad, you dunk them all!&#10;&#10;Lives&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 lives.

Rules cover all aspects of the sport: facing, movement, contact, transferring the ball, passing and running.  The standard 'Combat Results Table' in most wargames becomes the 'Contact Results Table', where players are neutralized for a number of play segments or immobilized for the turn.  On passing plays, a 'Pass Completion Table' is consulted.&#10;&#10;Extensive examples of play are included for both running and passing.

Gain allies and items, unlock new abilities, interact with locations and characters and gain experience during multiple adventures. As everybody's Neverland is different, every game will be a new adventure, with new possibilities and challenges to face.

Adventures are narrated through story cards, happenings, and side quests of your choice. You can interact with other characters and locations on the island.
