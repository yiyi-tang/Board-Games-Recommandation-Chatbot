    "Description": "An early aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy, HMS Eagle was originally a super-dreadnought of the Chilean Navy (named Almirante Cochrane), laid down in 1913, but was purchased by the Royal Navy for conversion to a carrier in 1918. This work was not finished until 1924.&#10;&#10;Initially deployed in the Indian Ocean against the threat of German commerce raiders, Eagle also saw service in Mediterranean and the China station. At the outset of war, the Fleet Air Arm was severely lacking fighters, so her complement of aircraft was limited to solely Fairey Swordfish Torpedo bombers until late 1940.&#10;&#10;Upon the Italian entry into the war on the side of the Axis, HMS Eagle was the only Royal Navy carrier available to the British in the Mediterranean, but performed sterling service in ferrying fighters to the island of Malta. It was whilst performing this latter duty that she was sunk in August 1942, when torpedoed by the German Submarine U-73.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The Type 1936 was a large and very powerful design mounting 5.9-inch guns, based on the general layout of the Type 1934. The intended twin turrets were not available in time, so planned armament was reduced to single mounts in some positions. As with the preceding class, an enlarged version, designated Type 1936A, was developed from the original. &#10;The Type 1936A was more seaworthy, with much more reliable machinery. These vessels were known to the Allies as the Narvik-class.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Admiral Franz von Hipper was commander of the German battlecruiser squadron of the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and subsequently became commander-in-chief of the German high seas fleet. It was for him that Admiral Hipper was named, the lead ship of her class.&#10;&#10;Admiral Hipper saw significant action over the course of the war, with a heavy emphasis on the Battle of the Atlantic. She also led the assault on Trondberg during Germany&rsquo;s invasion of Norway, sinking the British destroyer HMS Glowworm in the process. In December of 1940, she successfully broke out to the Atlantic in an effort to disrupt Allied Merchant convoys, but failed to achieve much success. Her next sortie in February 1941 saw much more success when she sank several merchant vessels, before being transferred back to Norway to raid convoys to the Soviet Union. ON New Year&rsquo;s Eve 1942, at the Battle of the Barents Sea, after sinking a destroyer and a minesweeper she was forced to withdraw due to the efforts of HMS Sheffield and HMS Jamaica. Following the failure to destroy any merchant vessels in this battle, Hitler ordered the majority of surface warships scrapped. Admiral Hipper returned to Germany and was never restored to operational status after being bombed by the Royal Air Force in May 1945.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the 1930s she served as a training vessel for cadets, but the outbreak of World War Two saw her conducting operations in the North Sea, though she didn&rsquo;t encounter any British warships at this time.&#10;&#10;She was present at the attack of Bergen during the German invasion of Norway and was the only member of the K&ouml;nigsberg-class to survive the operation (codenamed Weser&uuml;bung). Later, in 1942, she was experimentally modified to carry a Flettner FI 282 helicopter, and returned to Norway, though she failed to see action. Remaining there until 1945, she eventually returned to Germany only to be sunk in March by American bombers over Wilhelmshaven. However, she remained on an even keel, and with her gun turrets above the waterline, was able to provide fire support to the defenders of the city until war&rsquo;s end in May 1945.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

She was the second of the Admiral Hipper-class of heavy cruisers, completed shortly after the outbreak of World War II. She was assigned to the task force supporting the invasion of Norway in April 1940, serving as the flagship of Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz, leading the flotilla of ships to capture Oslo, she was struck by numerous coastal defences including outdated 28cm coastal guns at close range, and two torpedoes fired from land-based batteries.&#10;&#10;These hits resulted in a major fire breaking out aboard the vessel which spread first to the ship&rsquo;s magazines, and then to her fuel bunkers, resulting in further major explosions that could not be contained. Her wreck still sits at the bottom of Oslofjord and was recently designated as a war memorial to protect it from looters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The two ships destroyed the British cruiser Hood and damaged HMS Prince of Wales in the Battle of Denmark Strait. Shortly after, Prinz Eugen put into France to enact repairs following engine difficulties.&#10;&#10;Briefly deploying to Norway, she was put out of action for repairs in Germany after being struck by a torpedo from a submarine. In the latter stages of the war, she served as artillery support for the retreating German army from the Baltic Sea. &#10;In May 1945 she was surrendered to the US Navy as a war prize, and was subjected to the nuclear tests of Operation Crossroads. Despite surviving the atomic blasts, she capsized after being towed to Kwajelein Atoll in December 1946.

As a result, she was absent from the attack on Darwin of 19 February 1942. Her next major action was at the Battle of the Java Sea, the largest surface engagement since the Battle of Jutland in World War One. 5 cruisers and 10 destroyers of the Allies met a Japanese force of 4 cruisers and 13 destroyers on 27 February 1942. The ABDA naval force lost 2 cruisers and 3 destroyers.&#10;&#10;It was the at the Battle of Sundra Strait that Houston would meet her eventual fate, in which she and HMAS Perth were sunk by torpedoes from a destroyer squadron. The route had been thought free of enemy vessels, but this proved false with the two ships surrounded by multiple Japanese Warships. The story of her demise was not known fully until the liberation of the 368 survivors of Houston, from Japanese prison camps at the close of war.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

While Snakes and Hawks is a team game, there is only one individual winner. You can play 12 unique versions. This is a very thrilling and different card game.&#10;Unlike a normal deck of cards, Snakes and Hawks is played with a 60-card deck. Snakes and Hawks can be played with teams, but unlike other popular trick taking games, your partner doesn&rsquo;t always have to sit across from you. Your partner can also change every time the cards are dealt. Choosing the right partner could make the difference between winning and losing, The game ends when a player reaches positive 200 or negative 100.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Quick Play Pro Hockey was designed by Michael Owens to quickly and accurately replay N.H.L. seasons, playoffs and any kind of tournaments the gamer wishes.  Each game takes a few minutes to play, which allows for many games to be played in a short period of time.&#10;&#10;Game play is activated by two standard dice (of different colors or sizes) read separately.  For instance if the red die is 4 and the white die is 2, it is to be read as &quot;42&quot;, or if the red die is 2 and the white die is 1 to be read as &quot;21&quot;.  This gives thirty-six different possibilities from 11 to 66.  If you are familiar with APBA games, it is read in the same fashion.&#10;&#10;The basic steps are:&#10;&#10;     Select Visiting and Home teams&#10;     Determine &quot;Base Score&quot; (including normalization) for each team&#10;     Determine Scoring Chance range and Home/Visitor Chance ranges and enter them on your scoresheet&#10;     Determine Close Game Factor difference and select the applicable CGF range&#10;     Record CGF details on scoresheet&#10;     Start game&#10;&#10;&#10;When playing the game, you roll two dice. The first dice will be used for time management based on a timing chart. The combination of the two dice will then be used to determine if a scoring chance takes place. If a scoring chance takes place, then another roll of the dice will determine which team has the scoring chance. Once a team is determined, a third roll will be matched against a scoring table to determine the outcome of the scoring chance.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three periods and the team with the higher score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

In Clue: North Pole Edition, instead of solving a murder mystery, players attempt to solve the mystery of the missing presents.&#10;&#10;Players move from building to building at the North Pole to solve the mystery of: who did it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, item, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the Sleigh Room in the middle of the board. Players must move to a location and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific item. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, item, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the hidden in the Sleigh Room.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "In this card game, based on the beloved priest-detective character created by G. K. Chesterton, 2-6 players take the role of the Investigators and try to create a case against a suspect. The game will be issued in a base game, comprised of all the cards (nearly 200), as well as a deluxe edition with a board showing locations for investigation. The deluxe game can be played with the base rule set, or a separate rule set for a different mode of play.&#10;&#10;In either version of the game, first a crime scene is established using the Crime, Suspect, and Evidence decks. Then, players will use the Investigation Resources deck to try to acquire their own Evidence cards in order to try to match them to the requisites of the Crime and Suspects' dossier. Evidence is acquired in rounds of a &quot;bidding&quot;-type action against the other players.&#10;&#10;Apart from competing to acquire evidence, however, players can also interfere with one another's investigations by deploying Special cards, or by utilizing a special action allowed to their Investigator type. There may also be a traitor in the game, playing as Father Brown's nemesis Flambeau, whose goal is to masquerade as a detective and stop anyone from solving the crime.&#10;&#10;There are also risks in some investigations: a player's Investigator might be killed in the line of duty, forcing that player to draw a new Investigator role and start out again back-footed in his or her investigation!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Steady Bayonets 1756 is a set of rules for playing tabletop wargames representing battles in the middle part of the 18th Century, using 15-30mm size model soldiers. The rules cover the period roughly 1740-1790 in Europe.&#10;&#10;In these rules, battles are won with lines of well-drilled, bayonet-armed infantry delivering coordinated volleys of musket fire. Cavalry in general cannot take on steady infantry frontally and artillery is not yet powerful enough to be a battle-winning arm.&#10;&#10;A typical game has about a dozen units per side. A game like this should take under four hours for a pair of opponents familiar with the rules to complete.&#10;&#10;The rules work best with units of 24 infantry models, 12 cavalry models and batteries of 2-4 gun models but this is not a strict requirement.&#10;&#10;Game setup usually involves two opposing forces facing one another across a table laid out with terrain models representing hills, woods, streams, etc.&#10;&#10;The usual table size is 4-6 feet deep by 6-8 feet across.&#10;&#10;Figure and Ground Scales:&#10;&bull; One infantry model = 20 actual men.&#10;&bull; One cavalry model = 20 actual men.&#10;&bull; One cannon model = two actual guns.&#10;&bull; One gunner model = 5 actual crewmen.&#10;&bull; One inch = 20 actual paces (50 feet).&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence&#10;&#10;     Rally &amp; Command&#10;     Move&#10;     Shoot&#10;     Close combat &amp; Recovery&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This landmass, called Pangaea is where our story begins.&#10;&#10;At the same time, in the far far distance of our Galaxy an earth disaster is heading our way. The famous asteroid that hit the earth over 65 million years ago. When this asteroid hits the earth, the game will end and we will see if the ancestors to mankind where able to survive allowing us humans to rule the planet as we do today.&#10;&#10;During the game play, Pangaea will change, continents will rise and fall, opportunities to survive will come and go, are you lucky enough? Are you strategic enough?&#10;&#10;Dinosaurs will make your changes to survive more difficult and volcano eruptions can happen any time, covering everything in lava.&#10;&#10;Earthquakes and Tsunamis are mother nature&rsquo;s forces that will challenge you. Are you able to outsmart your fellow players? It&acute;s survival of mankind but it better be your offspring to rule the world, or perhaps nobody shall survive!?&#10;&#10;This game is a typical hex-tile and worker placement. Tiles will also be stacked/unstacked on the board during the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 4 cards at hand, visible to all. &#10;From the 4 cards you select 2 (or 3 for experience gamers) to represent in order: &#10;&#10;     a number of tiles displacement of the event-locator, &#10;     an action that will take place at that new location and &#10;     (optional, based on chosen game play) the range, i.e. number of tiles, that is affected by that action. &#10;&#10;&#10;Played cards are discarded and new cards are added to the players hand for a next round.&#10;&#10;The event-locator, positioned on the board, points out where the action as given by the card will take place. Possible actions are land-rise, land-fall, climate change, earthquake/tsunami or dinosaur placement. Depending on the game-type, more than 1 tile can be affected.&#10;&#10;Each players meeple walks around the continents to harvest points or to place shelters (up to 3) but they are continuously in danger due to the effects of the actions that can happen to the continent (or tile) the players meeple and shelters are on. As player, you can chose to work with your fellow players or work against them, finding an alliance or break it again.&#10;&#10;Not all land-types can support players meeples or dinosaurs, but you can buy evolution cards that can give you a bit of help, but it will cost you points.&#10;&#10;Not all land-types are suitable for shelter building either or you shall choose between scoring points and harvest or not to harvest and move to a better spot to be able, in your next turn, to finally build your shelter. Can you build and keep your shelters on the board and earn the most points along the way? Shelters that you can keep on the board start earning points for you as well.&#10;&#10;Only if at least 1 of your shelters survives the end game when the famous asteroid impacts the earth, then and only then will you have a change to win the game. During the game-play the asteroid is triggered and will move closer to earth from the starting place you have chosen. This determines (more or less) the game length. The speed in which it approaches is different each game, making it hard to predict how much time or turns is still left in the game. But when the asteroid reaches the earth, the end game begins.&#10;&#10;Simply stated, ensure your ancestors survive the impact and earn the most points during the game, that will make you the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
