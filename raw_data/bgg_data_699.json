    "Description": "Hurry Hard! The Curling Card Game is a fun, fast paced card game suitable for curling fans of all ages.  Grab your teammates and take on your fiercest rivals to decide once and for all who really rules the ice.  Or go head-to-head against a fellow curler to determine who will be King of the Rings.&#10;&#10;Playable by two, four, six or even eight players, Hurry Hard! recreates all the action on the ice in a fun, easy to learn card game.  Players take turns throwing guards, draws, or takeouts.  Your teammates can then improve the impact of your throw, including through the play of the powerful Hurry Hard! sweeping card to help get your rock a little closer to the button. Watch out though!  Your opponents can also affect your throw.  The timely play of a Miss the Broom card can ruin an end, unless you have a Plan B card in reserve.  After the player with The Hammer throws the last rock, the score for the end is calculated the same as in real curling, based on whose rocks are closest to the button.  Then a new end begins.&#10;&#10;For non-curlers, the rules explain not just how to play the card game, but also the basic terminology to help you understand the game of curling itself.&#10;&#10;For curlers, the game has been well balanced to reward real curling strategy.  Deciding when to throw a guard or when to come into the rings can make the difference between scoring a big end or giving up a steal.  Just as with real curling, though, no matter how good your strategy, you still need to make your throws.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A box of three party games known as the Easy Chair Series of games.&#10;In game 1 you have to try to follow a word square of 4 by 4 letters and so arranged they form the names of rivers. This type of game is similar in mechanic to Boggle.&#10;Game 2 is Rhyming Pairs. You are given ten examples of question. The first information given is a word os short phrase. This is followed by a blank, then another blank and then a phrase again. You have to think of a word that goes into the first blank, thus forming two words 'with a close relationship'. Then you need to complete the second blank and make another word that links to the last phrase in your question. The trick is, the two blank words must rhyme. An example; A pool is the first word so the correct word to go with that is Lagoon. The last phrase is Very Light Ball and the correct answer is Balloon. Lagoon/Balloon is correct and rhymes.&#10;Game 3 is a quick trivia game. You are given a grid of five by six boxes. Down the left hand side is a subject for each row, Countries, Professions, Flowers, Prominent People, Motor Cars and Boy's Names. You are given a letter and you must fill in as many boxes as you can with answers that begin with that letter.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike most Mancala games, [1] there are between two and six sowing directions to choose (depending on the cup), and [2] the direction deflects when a board edge is reached. Sowing is extended (&quot;re-sowed&quot;) if the last stone drops into a pit containing only the active player's stones.&#10;&#10;Stones are captured when the last piece sowed lands in a pit containing an opponent's stone.&#10;&#10;The game is won when a player captures nine stones or claims the majority in each corner pit.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "User Summary&#10;&#10;StockCar Jr. is an auto-racing game. The object is to be the first player to complete 15 laps.&#10;&#10;Players qualify for racing order with a dice roll. Car movement is controlled by rolling the dice as players seek to vie for positioning in &quot;The Groove,&quot; an area of the track which allows for the fastest possible movement. But this is more than just a roll-and-move game...&#10;&#10;Players can choose a car setup that's either Tight or Loose. A Tight setup is more conservative and safe, while a Loose set up gives more reward at the cost of greater risk. Players can also switch between high and low gear. Special rules cover cornering, getting &quot;out of groove&quot; and &quot;out of shape,&quot; and accidents/collisions.&#10;&#10;Another interesting feature of the game is the ability to collect Power Points. Cars can gain these when they are caught in traffic or have no legal moves. They can be used later to help with tricky maneuvers.&#10;&#10;All cars pit after their 4th and 9th laps. Each car gets a Pit Card which indicates how long the pit stop is how many spaces of movement it gains while exiting.&#10;&#10;The game comes in rather large &quot;pizza box&quot; style container with a checkerboard patterned cover.&#10;&#10;Components include:&#10;- A large gameboard with a track three spaces wide for the cars to travel on, &#10;- 2 sets of instructions,&#10;- 6 sets of control tables which represent high and low gear for the Loose and Tight car setups, &#10;- 6 sets of gauges to track Power Point usage, &#10;- A color-coordinated pair of dice and wooden playing pieces for each of the six race teams (aka players), &amp; &#10;- A set of 20 Pit Cards&#10;&#10;",

Playing with 3-6 players just takes a few minor adjustments to the rules or cards and the versions for 4-6 are played with partnerships.&#10;&#10;The point system goes as follow:&#10;Aces - 11 points&#10;Fives - 10 points&#10;Kings - 4 points&#10;Queens - 3 points&#10;Jacks - 2 points&#10;&#10;Playing with a traditional spanish deck of cards is recommended but not mandatory, and the point system follows the same structure, with the &quot;cavaleiro&quot; (knight) card replacing the queen.&#10;&#10;The game is usually played with a hand of three cards (Bisca de tr&ecirc;s - literally three's Bisca), but there are two variants:&#10;&#10;Bisca dos Nove (Nine's Bisca) for a hand size of nine cards;&#10;Bisca dos Sete (Seven's Bisca) for a hand size of seven cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "For its age, some quite clever ideas. Here are the important rules;&#10;&#10;The game is intended for two players, one taking the 'planes' and the other the 'shells', both represented by discs.&#10;The aim of the game is to get as many planes as possible through to the Objective. Each player moves in turn commencing with a Plane.&#10;The Moves;&#10;The discs move according to the number obtained by spinning the arrow. The exact number of places must be moved each time and only one disc for each move. Planes must be moved forward (never backward).&#10;The red-circle shells move horizontal (sic) left or right only. The black-circle shell may move horizontal (left or right) or vertically (backwards or forwards) but not outside the green half of the board.&#10;Shells can move only if the number of spaces to be moved brings the shell to a circle of the same colour as a plane in play.&#10;Rules;&#10;The planes' player moves any plane he chooses. He may try to reach his objective with one at a time or more if he so desires, but he must not forego a move if it is possible to move a plane the required space.&#10;Shells may pass over planes but not over another shell.&#10;Planes may pass over another plane or shell.&#10;Losses;&#10;A plane is hit (and thus out of the game) if it comes to a circle occupied by a shell or if a shell hits the plane. That is, if a shell is able to move to a circle occupied by a plane. A hit is also registered if a plane comes to one of the red circles in the yellow half of the board, provided the red line is connected with a circle of the same colour as the plane and this circle has a shell on it or a shell hits it before the plane moves on.&#10;Now place the discs on the circles as marked taking care to put the black-circle shell on its appropriate circle.&#10;If the arrow should stop dead on a dividing line, spin it again.&#10;&#10;These rules make a little more sense when you look at the images. Note that it is never properly explained who wins. Does the planes' player win if he gets just one plane to the objective? Or more? I guess you need to make some 'house rules' before playing.&#10;&#10;",

Whether the group knows each other or not, they're getting to know.&#10;&#10;In each round only one person knows who is Lu: All other try with the given questions to find out who of themselves is Lu.&#10;&#10;If you have a guess, you can put on a bet on a person. The earlier you bet you can choose amongst the best betting cards. Who bets later, has more information but probably also less points.&#10;&#10;After each round of questions the mystery is solved by the player who knows. Each players pawn now moves forward (or backward when guessing wrong) on the board.&#10;&#10;Content&#10;&#10;121 question cards&#10;     64 player cards&#10;     8 betting cards&#10;     3 reveal cards&#10;     1 game board&#10;     8 characters&#10;     1 set of instructions&#10;&#10;",

Object of the game is to 'kick' the ball, by means of the 'boot' then smartly tap the coloured ring on the 'boot' with the forefinger of the right hand. The ball will then rise and drop on to the playing field. A little practice will make you quite expert at this. A completely different game but the idea of catapulting the ball on to the board is reminiscent of games like Flying Hats. After a pre-agreed time, the winner is the one who has scored the most goals.&#10;&#10;Playing instructions are inside top of box&#10;&#10;The box image illustrates the game rather well&#10;&#10;",

Again, if you think is easy, you are wrong. Your rivals will make everything to stop you.&#10;&#10;In the second Zone all the players follow a faster course trying to collect more Monuments. But here is the key. Among all of them there are some that have higher value and these Monuments will give you the victory!  During your speed trip, you will find many blocks since there are cards which send your pawn either back at the beginning of the Zone or at the end. You don't want that because when the race overs, you will have the less Monuments.&#10;&#10;In the last Zone things get nasty. There only few important cards, that if you manage to collect them, then you secure your victory. At the end of that Zone, all of you count the points that your Monument Cards provide to you and add them together. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

The board is illustrated with a stone pool, a barrel and a wheelbarrow.  Each player starts the game with 3 pennies (1 cent) and 1 nickel (5 cents). The rest of the 'money' is placed in the stone pool. Rolling the die tells the player to either place the specified amount of 'money' in the stone pool or take the specified amount from the stone pool.  Then the player must exchange their coins for a coin of larger value if they are able.  To do this the player places their coins on the wheelbarrow and takes the coin of equivalent value from the stone pool and places it on the barrel. When all the players agree that the two amounts of money are equal, the player takes the coin from the barrel.  The 'money' in the wheelbarrow goes into the stone pool.  Play continues until one player has enough change to get a quarter.&#10;&#10;",

In the late 70's Phil had added a game of random event cards to Cartel to add variety to the game.  In Dallas, those cards are added, the board is also slightly changed in the new theme, which is based on the Dallas TV show.&#10;&#10;Players take turns bidding on and buying companies on the board.  Larger networks of adjacent companies create higher payouts.  Players can also risk taking on debt to pay higher prices, hoping the resulting network pays for the liability of the debt.  A deck of random event cards adds a random element, &quot;Dallas Press Events,&quot; to each turn (making the game different from the original Cartel).&#10;&#10;The winner is the player that acquires the highest net worth, adding together current cash plus the value of their network of companies, less the cost of repaying their debt.&#10;&#10;While the game has a theme based on the popular TV shows, only the companies, e.g., Ewing Oil, appear in the game.  A very few of the characters are mentioned in flavor text that appears in the rulebook.  None of the stars of the show are pictured and the graphic design does not pick up on the TV shows look and feel either.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Space age card game designed by Truman Rothfus of Des Moines, Iowa, designed when space exploration was a 'brave new world'.&#10;Played with 72 illustrated cards, with players contracting to build and launch rockets into orbit.&#10;Collect cards to build your rocket's features and then try to launch it by playing alternative cards. Other cards allow you to raise funds, sabotage another player's cards and so on. The rocket cards are in three stages. When you have your chosen three cards, they can be laid end-to-end and you get a nice example of your rocket from the tail up to the cone.&#10;Box proclaims &quot;Exciting! Takes You from Base to Space!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "'An exciting game for boys and girls' says the box. The subject matter is probably related to the appeal of the comic book character Casper the Friendly Ghost without being an actual Casper linked game. Dates from the early 1960's.&#10;A spinner regulates players' movement and also indicates which part of the house is being haunted. The board represents four floors of an old house, from the cellar to the attic.&#10;Wooden pawns and a built-in spinner (next to the play-area of the board).&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A game completely devoid of skill. Players roll a ball down a curling slide (as in a Helter-Skelter ride in a funfair). The ball scores points depending on which hole it settles into, rather like in a Bagatelle-type game).&#10;&#10;The box depicts an aged gnome standing on a ladder and about to start a ball rolling whilst two children look on. Not sure why a gnome should be associated with the game!&#10;&#10;",

Play consists of collecting the various components to make a face. Described as a parlour game,  the game is in the grand tradition of British games like Mis-Fits and American games like Mixies.&#10;The box was originally filled with chocolates.&#10;The illustrator, Carey Orr, was employed by the Chicago Tribune as the creator of the Kernel Cootie comic strip.&#10;&#10;",
