    "Description": "TWRS is a strategy game for 2 players, which can be played in about twenty minutes. The game board consists of a grid of 11x11 lines. Playing takes place on the lines of intersection (like Go).&#10;&#10;Each player possesses three towers (hence TWRS). Each turn you must move one of them. You can move a tower horizontally or vertically, as far as you wish. You can't jump over other playing pieces however.&#10;&#10;After this, you can &quot;activate&quot; the tower you moved to place marking stones on the game board. You try to use these to lessen the freedom of movement of your opponent's towers. But they also lessen the freedom of movement of your own towers!&#10;&#10;Chains of marking stones can wall off parts of the game board. Play ends when every walled off area is occupied only by towers of one player.&#10;&#10;The player that possesses the largest part of the game board wins.&#10;&#10;TWRS is published in a limited edition of 265 pieces. This collector's edition comprises blown glass pieces and a stainless steel box and game board.&#10;&#10;",

From the ironclads of the late 1800s to the super-dreadnoughts of World War II, players can take command of the ships that altered the course of history.&#10;&#10;Great pains have been taken to accommodate a wide range of preferences: hexes or no hexes; any miniatures scale; simultaneous or sequential play. The choices are up to you!&#10;&#10;In addition to the basic rules for surface actions between 1890 and 1940, Grand Fleets includes advanced rules for things like time of day, smokescreens, crew quality, and destroyer flotillas. Best of all, you'll never have to wait for &quot;official&quot; publication of your favorite ships: comprehensive, step-by-step guidelines are provided to generate data cards for any vessel that put to sea during the battleship era.&#10;&#10;So, raise the battle ensign, sound general quarters, and damn the torpedoes! your destiny awaits!&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "A roll and move game based on the Swedish king Gustav Vasa&acute;s flight from the Danish army in the early 16th century. According to the legend Gustav spoke to the assembled men of Mora, Dalecarlia, trying to convince them to start a rebellion against king Christian of Denmark. The men did not want to fight for those reasons though so on ski he tried to flee to Norway. But he was caught up by two Swedes telling him that the men in Mora had changed their minds and they now wanted Gustav to lead the rebellion. In 1523 Gustav Vasa was crowned king of Sweden.&#10;&#10;",

Everyone plays one action, then after all these are resolved, everyone may play a reaction to what just happened.&#10;Then the demons possessing the host are revealed, and exorcists may play research cards to try an exorcism. If the die rolls modified by the research results beat the demons' resistance, the exorcism is successful. Based on this result the players may finally play cards aiding their victory conditions - and not every character necessarily wants the demons exorcised.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "The idea of this game is to teach children about the inequality of the world and the idea of development work in third world countries. The game takes place in a fantasy world of insects that is secretly ruled by the evil Tyrant and his sidekick Niljake (Slimy). In the beginning, the insect realms have different amounts of resources; some are poor while some have plenty. The poorest player, being the most desperate and thus also bravest, starts. The game is a mix of co-operative and individual play, as typically the players can only advance on the board by sharing their income. Likewise, the draconian measures of the Tyrant usually affect all the players and not just the intended victim. The idea is to expose the Tyrant and fill everyone's resources, and the winner is the player who accomplishes the second goal after the first one has already been accomplished.&#10;&#10;The three types of resource are: Food &amp; Water, Money &amp; Wealth, Education &amp; Rights.&#10;&#10;The insect realms are:&#10;&#10;1. Dunghill of the Beetles&#10;2. Spiders' Webbery&#10;3. Butterfly Valley&#10;4. Beeland&#10;5. Castle Ladybug &#10;6. Mosquito Swamp&#10;&#10;The game has been designed and published by the humanitarian organization UFF Finland with Tactic's help.

    "Description": "In Blood of Kings, players compete to build the most glorious dynasty in medieval Europe. You start as the ruler of a single kingdom, but over the course of the game kingdoms can change hands, and you may find yourself wearing several crowns - or no crown at all. Your ultimate goal is to gain Glory by enriching the kingdoms you have had the opportunity to rule; when you develop a kingdom&rsquo;s institutions or increase the size of its domain by conquering new lands, you gain Glory. Accumulate enough Glory and you get to claim an Achievement, which grants all your kingdoms a special bonus or capability. When all Achievements have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most Glory wins.&#10;&#10;Blood of Kings is a unique blend of warfare, civilization building, and political maneuvering. Each turn you choose the course of action for each of your kingdoms. Will you attempt to expand militarily, or focus on developing institutions to make your kingdoms stronger, more productive, and more culturally advanced? At some point you will have to divert attention and resources away from these projects to root out enemies at court, for your rule is never truly secure - other players are your constant rivals, quietly positioning themselves to claim rights to your throne or thrust your kingdoms into violent rebellion. If you aren&rsquo;t careful, you can find your crown stripped away and given to another, forcing you into exile to brood and plot your eventual return to power.&#10;&#10;Blood of Kings is card-driven, but not in the traditional manner. Each kingdom has its own hand of Kingdom cards, each of which denotes a type of action (development, raising troops, taxation, etc.), and each turn its ruler chooses one card to play from those still in hand. It is through these actions that players gain Glory and win the game. However, each player also has a hand of Dynasty cards, which he can use each turn to hinder other kingdoms, improve his political hold on his own kingdoms, or prepare to take political control of rival kingdoms. Therefore, each player must work not only to expand and improve his kingdoms, but to defend his kingdoms against political rivals while positioning himself to take over as many kingdoms as possible.&#10;&#10;The game is of the free D.I.Y. variety - you will have to print your own components. Playing time is scalable. Since the game ends when all available Achievements have been claimed, you can set up a short game by using only a few Achievements, or create a truly epic game by making all of the Achievements available.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Pacific 1942 Point Luck, the second extension of Pacific 1942 Admiral game, came to gamers as a small present free of charge.&#10;&#10;This extension brings to game new dimension - chance.&#10;&#10;Name Point Luck is connected to meeting point of US ships in the Battle of Midway.&#10;&#10;The true is that we have decided to keep Pacific 1942 as simple as possible, which, absurdly, brings the game much closer to reality than too complex and tricky rules often do. But everyone knows that chance plays quite important role in real combats. Up till now every fusillade destroyed one battle unit (one prism), an attacking bomber squadron destroyed one battle unit of the attacked ship (one prism) and so on. Now combat rules has changed by Point Luck Card.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;A) How many dices are rolled?&#10;&#10;Attacker rolls as many dices as many Battle units he use for attack. For example a fully equipped (3 prisms) battleship can use up to 3 dices. But if it have moved in the turn, you need to reduce number of dices according to number of moves.&#10;&#10;If more bomber squadron attack a ship, you can use as many dices as you have squadrons (cylinders).&#10;&#10;You never roll more than three dices. The fourth, fifth etc. attack is always succesfull.&#10;&#10;You can, of course, use only one dice and roll it more times up to number set above.&#10;&#10;You can stop your attack at any moment and use your actions to move out.&#10;&#10;B)Where put deffender his Battle units&#10;&#10;B1) Rows&#10;According to number of Battle units uses deffender the first, second or third row of Point Luck Card.&#10;&#10;The first row has a symbol of one Battle unit, second row has a symbol (prism) of two and third row of three (or more) battle units. So if you have (as a deffendor) one attacked Battle unit, you use first row and so on.&#10;&#10;B2)Columns&#10;B2a) First row&#10;&#10;To which column has a deffender to put his BU? It&acute;s only his decision.&#10;&#10;Expamle: In case of one BU form columns 1-4 and 3-6 two groups. If deffendor puts his BU to number 2, his BU will be destroyed if attacker will roll 1,2,3 or 4. From previous text implies that more BU attacker has, more attamptions has to roll.&#10;&#10;B2b) Second row&#10;In the second row are fields splitted to half, so columns 1-3 and 4-6 forms units. Because deffendor has two BU, he can choose whether to split them or put both BU to one section. In first case he will for sure loose at least one BU. (And of course attacker can roll the dice according to number of his attacking BU.)&#10;&#10;B2c) Third row&#10;When has a deffendor three or more BU, he can place them in the third row. Here fields 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 forms units.&#10;When is the Point Luck Card used?&#10;&#10;C) Point Luck Card is used all the time when:&#10;&#10;&#10;     battleship fires&#10;     bombers attack&#10;     fighters attack bombers (even in case when it is turn of player whose bombers try to flight through place where enemy&acute;s fighters are.&#10;     whne fighter shoots on un-armed fighter &#10;&#10;&#10;D) And when NOT to use the Point Luck Card?&#10;&#10;Point Luck Card is not used in case of:&#10;&#10;&#10;     battalions combat&#10;     armed fighters combat &#10;&#10;&#10;",

The other player then starts pulling out pins. If he or she pulls out a pin with the string around it, the mouse moves; if he or she removes the last pin, the mouse moves into the house. Then the roles are reversed. Whoever needs less pins to let the mouse move home is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

A player may &quot;cash out&quot; with a word at any time, but since the point values of the letters increase - sometime dramatically - when more &quot;Payoff Letters&quot; appear, to gamble on &quot;just one more card&quot; is a tempting option.  But there are risks:  the inability of a player to make a word will result in a zero score!&#10;&#10;Confidence is a game for two to four players, although variant rules are included which allow more people to play.&#10;&#10;",
