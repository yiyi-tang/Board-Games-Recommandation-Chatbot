Meanwhile, Van Helsing will be investigating the monsters and hunting them when he can.&#10;&#10;Each monster card has two sides. The front includes their ability to persuade other monsters and a special power. The backside shows their Christmas lesson and how nervous they are to teach it. The Dr. Jekyll card is slightly different - he doesn't teach a Christmas Lesson. Rather, he turns into a Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde can still be used, but he's far more clumsy and less efficient than Dr. Jekyll.&#10;&#10;The monsters will roll dice to try and convince each other to teach Franky his Christmas lessons. Each monster has distinct success values, making each roll in the game unique. Some monsters may instead use a special power to distract Van Helsing from his investigation or give other monsters a benefit. How the monsters use their actions is entirely up to you!&#10;&#10;Each turn has 7 phases.&#10;1. Roll Random Event - This will usually move Van Helsing further along in his investigation or give the monsters better luck in their attempts to teach Franky.&#10;2. Select a monster to teach Franky a Christmas Lesson&#10;3. The other monsters take actions to persuade the teaching monster to do its job.&#10;4. Check to see if Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde.&#10;5. Reset the cards and get ready for the next turn.&#10;&#10;You win the game by teaching Franky all 6 lessons of Christmas and escaping from Van Helsing.&#10;&#10;",

If a player succeeds at a majority of the tasks, that player retains the quest and gains its reward. Fail too many tasks and suffer the consequences.&#10;&#10;Once a player has retained enough quests to fulfill the charter's end game condition, the game ends. Each player counts the number of glory points on each quest they have retained they have won for their charter and the person with the most wins the game!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "When your home is the forest, preparing for winter isn't all fun and games. At least not until this year, when Fox proposed to his woodland friends a grand contest: Who will weather winter best? In this charming, light-hearted game of Fierce Friendship and Frosty Fortitude, take on the role of Squirrel, Bear, Deer, Rabbit, Beaver, or Fox. Optimize your actions each turn and explore, build shelters, forage for food to stash away, and hunker down before bad weather strikes. As winter approaches, you'll even direct the falling snow, transforming the map to a wintry landscape. All the while, you'll be strengthening your bonds of friendship to earn powerful bonuses.&#10;&#10;Gameplay details: Players gain points by foraging for and stashing away food, playing friendship cards, and hunkering down before weather events. Using an action-point allowance system, players move their pawns around the board, forage, build shelters, and manage their hand of Friendship Cards, which provide mini-objectives to pursue. At the end of each turn, players roll Snow Dice to determine how many snow tiles to place onto the board around your animal. Placing a snow tile renders that space impassable, so players must be strategic with their placements. Gameplay includes a press-your-luck mechanic involving predicting when certain seasonal events will strike. Game is turn-based, but animals may play certain abilities on each others' turns, keeping everyone engaged no matter whose turn it is. Placing the last snow tile triggers the final round, after which all scoring occurs and the player with the most points is declared the winner of winter!&#10;&#10;Replayability: The game has high replayability due to asymmetric animal characters, a modular/evolving board, and multiple proven strategic paths to victory. Further, because Hunker is a highly approachable game with a good mix of easy-to-learn rules and strategic depth, it is an excellent gateway game.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to succeed in reaching the set number of Victory Points (12 in a standard &ldquo;Cruiser Clash&rdquo; game) wins the game. Alternatively, if a player is required to draw or discard a card from their deck, but no longer has any cards in their deck, they immediately lose the game, and their opponent wins via a &ldquo;morale&rdquo; victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In the first game, you lay out 18 cards on the table so that their black-and-white images and their names (in English and Morse code) are visible on them. After downloading the game app to your phone, one player is chosen as the parent, who then chooses a card and taps out the Morse code repeatedly on the phone app. Whichever child, a term that encompasses everyone else, touches the right card first claims that card and becomes the parent for the next round. If a child touches the wrong card, they're out for the round.&#10;&#10;When only five cards remain on the table, the game ends, then players flip over the cards to reveal their colors, and the app then assigns a point value (1-3) to each of the three colors. Players then tally their scores, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In the other game, you lay out the 18 cards color-side up. Two Morse code player aides are placed on the table as well. The current parent secretly chooses one of the cards, then taps out the Morse code of a word related to that card; for a card depicting the sun, the parent might tap out the Morse code for &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;summer&quot;, &quot;heat&quot;, or another word that seems appropriate. Once again, whoever touches the right card first claims it and becomes the new parent.&#10;&#10;",

    "Description": "Introduction:&#10;Quest for Esmeralda is a strategy-based, Simultaneous Action Selection battle game with medieval theme. Players each take a role as an adventurer on a quest to retrieve the treasure called Esmeralda. It&rsquo;s every man for himself, and players must defeat everyone else before reaching Esmeralda. However, Esmeralda is heavily guarded by the Dragon... How will you defeat all opponents, slain the Dragon and retrieve Esmeralda?&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player is dealt a hand from a small deck of 12 cards. The deck is designed to be exhaustive, and players can deduce what other players have, based on what's been played.&#10;Players battle each other in multiple Battles, each consisting of Turns. &#10;At the beginning of every Turn, each player secretly chooses an action and their target. All cards are revealed at once, and the actions are resolved accordingly. If you accumulate enough damage, you are out for that Battle and cannot join until the next Battle. Don't worry, Battles typically only last 3 Turns.&#10;After every turn, surviving players get to move their pawn down the world map towards Esmeralda. Each point on the map, however, has a location card which may be beneficial or detrimental to the players. The last point on the world map is Esmeralda, defended by the Dragon. When fighting the Dragon, his health never heals. This means that sneaky players can swoop in and deal the last hit to win the game!&#10;&#10;Frequently Asked Questions:&#10;&#10;Is this a player elimination game?&#10;Yes, however the elimination is temporary. Players always come back to life after every Battle. It's no fun when players get eliminated and they have to sit around for the rest of the game!&#10;&#10;Will it be hard for losing players to win the game?&#10;Nope! The game is designed for quick battles with balancing mechanisms everywhere.&#10;&#10;What will I need to play the PnP version?&#10;You will need 4 pairs of matching pawns, and 1 unique pawn.&#10;&#10;",

Players, however, can repair their own systems mid-test by playing OK cards, based on Mission Control Officers and Engineers. The first player to have all 4 of his or her systems survive testing, completes a rocket, earns a Mission Patch and ends the round.&#10;&#10;Players can collect Mission Patches along the way for various in-game achievements (including completing a Rocket) and the player with the most patches at the end of 3 rounds wins the game! Mission Patches are used as a scoring mechanism as well as granting special rules to the players that hold them, creating a dynamic system that adds an ever-shifting asymmetrical gameplay landscape, keeping players on their toes and deepening the strategy further.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players must attempt to gather one food ration, one water ration, one weapon, and the one available vehicle to leave the group, or they must discover which, if any, of the members of their group, have been bitten before time runs out and the bitten player becomes a member of the walking undead and eats your brains.&#10;&#10;The original version was text only on cards in a tuck box. The second edition features all new artwork, modified rules including a few new cards, clay tokens for the items, and full illustrations on all the cards, the box, and the tokens.&#10;&#10;-description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Applying their agility, logic and savvy, children will move towards victory. During the game you will have to measure yourself with longevity, speed and fluffiness of your animals. The winner of the game will be only one who turns out to be more dexterous and quick-witted.&#10;&#10;On one side of the card - the name and picture with the beast, on the other - the figures for the four properties:&#10;&#10;The size,&#10;Longevity,&#10;Travel speeds,&#10;Fuzzy.&#10;To each property are added points, proportional to the values.&#10;&#10;Each player in his turn receives 4 cards, but does not look at the reverse side with the data. He needs to arrange these animals in order of increasing points for a single property. When the cards are arranged in a row, the player turns them over. If the sequence is correct, he gets one card for himself in the bank, if not - he puts all the cards back into the deck. Each player has three such moves, then everyone counts the earned points.&#10;&#10;",

The game shifts the focus from collecting many cards to collecting the right cards at the right time for deck optimization.  Every time you shuffle your deck you will bring your deck size down to the your current limit keep your deck dedicated to the actions you care about. Players need to choose the cards they take from the Tunnel carefully if they want to load the final gem into a cart and score a point.&#10;&#10;Micro Miners is played like many deck builders and can be played  by taking turns gaining cards and using them to score points.  However in Micro Miners each player starts their turn with 3 Effort which allows them to take actions.  They can spend a number of effort indicated to acquire an available card from the tunnel or use it to play a Cart in front of them.  It can also be used to load gems into any suitable cart in play controlled by any player, but any player can block the gem from being loaded if they have a gem that matches the targeted cart.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand limit size of just 2 cards and will draw a new hand at the the end of each turn.  If they ever need to draw cards but their draw pile does not have enough they will shuffle their discard pile to form a new draw deck.  Each time they do this they will count the number of cards in their deck, not including any carts in play or gems loaded into them, and will choose which cards to discard down to their deck limit.  All discarded cards will be Tossed face down into the Shaft.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 3 points will win this micro deckbuilder.&#10;&#10;Plays in 20-30 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

In almost all of these battles, the Macedonian Player has no room for error - the routing of a single Formation is often enough to lose the game. The opposing side has more leeway and more sticks, but generally comes up short in the quality department. Careful, nuanced play from both sides is require to stay competitive and to win the day.
